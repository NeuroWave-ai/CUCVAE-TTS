HAVEN PRINTING COMPANY PUBLISHERS NEW HAVEN CONNECTICUT If the word Death had never been known to human thought or language and some such term as Passing to the New Life had been adopted crepe would have been a drug on the market painful funeral discourses unheard of and long somber funeral processions unknown Thousands of human lives are blasted by negative goodness A little country boy whose mother everlastingly nagged him about being good but whose father was ever telling him about the beautiful things in the city ended his prayer with this O God make me such a good boy that when I die I can go to New York One Hundredth Thousand Observe your opportunities to be kind A little boy was sitting in his father s lap in the street car when a charming young lady entered and as the little fellow observed there was no seat he quickly jumped off his father s lap and said to the young lady please take my seat It is not wealth or position that gives health and happiness A mighty Emperor was stricken with a malady his court physicians gave him up to die He called in his magicians and they told him if he would wear the shirt of a happy man he would recover He ordered his kingdom searched for a happy man They found him up in the silent mountains but alas he had no shirt No Satan did not bring the temptation to Eve instead of Adam because woman was a weaker and man a superior being He brought the temptation to Eve because a woman isn t afraid of the Devil If he had brought it to Adam he would have been running yet Some people are so stupid in passive goodness that their whole life wouldn t fill three feet of a moving picture reel Dedication This book is gratefully dedicated to the kindly memory of two eminent physicians long since gone from this earth plane who professionally observed my fourth physical eclipse by rheumatic fever and who hopefully assured me as I fluttered weakly from the shadow that I could never pass thru it again When I received their bills I was sure I could not The Author If you are A Self Made Man don t say too much about it someone may suspect you loafed on the job and tell the Union Prayer should always prepare you for action

not take yourself so serious put the red blood of mirth into your daily thinking KEEP YOUR WILL SUPREME Your will is divine energy therefore it is a Supreme Power Christ said Be it unto thee even as thou WILLED It is inertia that suffers Fate Fear and Doubt are children of the imagination The power of the will dissolves them into mist Will power into your Being Will power into your work Will

infinite clearness infinite strength infinite ideals infinite aspirations for infinite realities Your Will tells you that if there is anything to day that seems to you too good to be true believe it

of the Roman Empire The goddess Diana said of Hercules When I saw him whether he sat or stood I knew he was a god so majestic is his will Like the magnetic mountain in the Arabian Nights your Will can draw the nails from your enemies ships so they shall fall to pieces before they reach your shores Will is a dynamic cosmic energy from whence eternal things proceed and immortal organisms are constructed Will is the glory of the Divine universe and you are a part of that Will In your Will sleep the oracles of prophecy You were made master over this world In your Will is enthroned

to him that believeth Come down out of the gallery of supine hero worshippers get into the arena and be the hero Quit the drivel of matinee idol longing and get onto the stage of life and get the bouquets for yourself The world is waiting to ring up the curtain for your star part in life YOU CAN WORK MIRACLES A miracle is a wonder a marvel a supernatural occurrence a result obtained by suspension of natural processes You can do that any day The miracle is that so few do it You know Ibsen s play The Doll House How the wife forged a note raised the money to send her husband to regain his health How he did regain it returned to great prominence and wealth as a banker Then the blackmailer threatened to reveal the crime How the husband rushed to his wife in anger that she should have done such a thing that it meant ruin to him in his high position How the wife replied Why I expected the miracle That you would save me as I saved you That you would say that you did it If he only had what a marvelous what a wonderful what a supernatural thing it would have been Christ made whole and useful a withered hand People say O that I could do so wonderful a thing Well why don t you See the withered hands around you A young woman with a beautiful voice but no means to cultivate it You have a thousand or so in the bank You can save that voice to a world that needs song A young man with a fine mind helpless to go thru college you have means to give that mind to a world in power and usefulness The natural thing is for you not to do it the supernatural the miracle is that you are divine enough to do it A man a woman is forsaken friendless cruelly judged by the world their goodness blasted their spirit crushed their hearts bleeding their lives made useless withered The natural thing is to avoid such stand aloof be quite scornfully indifferent The miracle would happen if you went to them lifted them up restored them to society I have said avoid useless people I mean selfish lazy purposeless aimless people Sir Humphrey Davy worked a miracle when he took the boy Farrady out of a stable loft and gave him a chance to cultivate his genius The Sistine Chapel is Angelo s miracle When the band on the deck of the Titanic under the pale light of the morning stars played Nearer My God To Thee to give hope and strength to men and women struggling to be saved each player as the voice of his melody was forever hushed behind the shining emerald gates in the crystal tomb of the sea went down crowned with the glory of a selfless miracle The natural thing would have been for them to have frantically fought to save themselves What superb opportunities to work miracles have passed you What magnificent possibilities are still right before you The cripple is always at your Gate Beautiful Are you divine enough wonderful enough marvelous enough supernatural enough to say Such as I HAVE GIVE I unto thee Do it quickly Do it and you shall know daily the joy of hearing the Father say This is My Son in whom I am well pleased If there is any one person on this earth to whom I take off my hat and wait until they safely pass it is a school teacher The most obscure teacher back in the country hills unknown unthought of unpraised but with loving patience unfolding the secrets of knowledge to little frowzy headed boys and girls can look into her mirror at evening and behold the face of an angel Flowers cast their wealth upon the vacant air and rich fathers oft cast their wealth upon the vacant heir Some people are so sensitive that if you call them Honey they will break out with the hives the next morning Do not divorce your husband because he has cold feet perhaps he got them since you were married Christ stopped every funeral that came his way and sent the mourners home singing Funeral sermons were too sad for Him to preach Every sick room He entered became a health resort He made grave yards unpopular Many a lonely bachelor looking back over the stretch of years recalls the charming moonlight nights when the cool summer air was perfumed with old fashioned flowers and he looked into the loving eyes of his sweetheart recalls how the crimson glow of youth flushed her velvet cheeks as he took her warm hand in his recalls sadly that if he had only given that hand a square deal played it in the game of life he would have had a full house now Would you

Verdi wrote Falstaff at eighty Sir Walter Scott was six hundred thousand dollars in debt when he was fifty five but thru his own efforts he paid all and made himself a lasting name Book knowledge is not all A wealthy fond father fearing his son would be contaminated by college life had him educated at home When he was twenty one he took him to ride thru the streets of the city They passed a female seminary just as the doors opened and a crowd of young women came out The dear boy grabbed his father s arm and cried What are those His father replied They are only goslins Later in the day the fond father said My son you have obeyed me have faithfully completed your education now I am ready to spend fifty thousand dollars to give you the highest ambition of your life The boy looked up in glad wonder and said O dad give me a goslin Lesson Second SUPREME CONTROL OF AGE YOUTH IS ETERNAL Nature never grows old The flowers that bloomed in Eden are blooming to day Just as lovely just as

notion of neatness A woman in Vermont crippled her usefulness for life by mopping a hole thru her kitchen floor and falling into the cellar Lesson Third A SUPREME DAILY LIFE METHOD A CENTRAL PLAN Do your mental work in the morning your manual work in the afternoon Do not dictate letters in the afternoon from ten to twelve in the morning is best The brain is usually at low ebb at three o clock in the afternoon Do not have your desk so that you have to look side wise at persons approaching you It blunts your personality By no means have people enter behind you it is the most negative psychic influence possible Let your position in your office be such that when anyone approaches your eyes will fall upon them as near a straight level as possible Plan your workroom for efficiency No matter how small how large or if it be but a bench Put your character stamp on the plan of the work you do Go to that work as a King goes to his throne Centralize your work Plan it Work your plan HAVE A SYSTEM OF ORDER Set your mind in order first If you are living as I have taught in the lessons that have gone before then your mind will assume a supreme command of order almost at once Classify what you do Keep matters separate Do the big things first As you classify drop the non essentials Weed out the useless Never spend a minute of your morning hours winding up a string or folding a piece of wrapping paper Do that when your brain tide has ebbed out in the afternoon or not at all Don t hunt for a pin or sharpen a pencil or manicure your nails after you reach your work of the day Classify your movements eliminate the useless Energize your movements Move with enthusiasm Put elastic cheer into your step Wear rubber heels of quiet manners Simplify your work Keep it straight after a little it will keep you straight Don t fall over your work nor step on it or sit on it Simplify by stopping the waste of words waste of material waste of time Jollify your work Put fun into each day s round of toil Be original in plans and ideas CULTIVATE YOUR EFFICIENCY To all the above add mental energy Develop insight grow new business brain cells Do not overload your stomach with food nor your body with clothing Study directness Master application At Niagara Falls I saw two giant dynamos generating twenty five thousand horse power their efficiency was kept in perfect balance by a little automatic nickle gate Your efficiency is kept in balance by little invisible and automatic thought neurons A clear brain is the test of efficiency Plans orders system application give efficiency Efficiency is positive thinking Freedom thinking above fear thinking Get out and keep out of negative thinking Just as soon as you drop negative thinking your mind will begin to rise to a new brilliance of expression One big element in efficiency is silence It is the strongest thing to be silent Noise is emptiness weakness inefficiency Silence is the law of greatness noise the breaking of the law DEVELOP YOUR POWER TO REST That person is wise who knows how to rest It is a powerful thing to rest successfully Over fed persons or animals do not rest they are stupefied Rest is filling your capacities with energy Sleep knits up the ravelled sleeve of care or it should Rest is relaxing the nerves and muscles Rest is reconstructing broken down cellular tissues Rest is restringing the harp of the senses retuning the rhythmic harmonies of the spirit Rest lets down the tension When you sit down let what you sit on hold you When you lie down do not try to hold yourself on the bed Rest is the opposite of labor Rest is recreation Rest with sleep is a divine restorative When you cannot rest or sleep you are expending energy without production Try this little code for rest and sleep My mind is empty my soul is at rest Repeat it with your eyes closed and your body relaxed Say it just as you would imagine the swing of the pendulum of an old fashion hall clock I never knew it to fail of inducing sleep Never rest or sleep with light falling on your eyes Shut out the world and noise GROW THE FRUITS OF THE SPIRIT Love Joy Peace Gentleness Goodness Faith Meekness Temperance against such there is no law Do not sit down and wish for them nor wait for someone to bring them to you even God will not bring them to you Grow them Cultivate them Produce them No power on this earth can defeat you make you fail or over throw you if you fill your Spirit with them As you work use them Take them with you to the store the factory the shop the mill to your bench Take them with you to the office the counting room the court room and to your throne room Take them with you to the battle field to the halls of justice to the senate chamber to the presidential chair Take them with you thru the streets along the highways and over the unbeaten paths of your life Take them with you down the rivers and out into the storm driven sea Chain them to the wheel of your ship sail on thru the starless night alone Trust them for they are the initiative of the Supreme in you TRAIN YOUR VOICE Take your snarling growling snapping whining voice away into the jungle and leave it to the wild beasts Take your sobbing sniveling trembling dolorous sanctimonious voice down into some dismal swamp and bury it Train your voice as you would tune a harp Your voice is an index of character Keep it on the level Let it speak as one having authority Charm it with modulation Make it ripple with music Allow no thrust of anger to ruffle it Intensify it with determination Strengthen it with courage Give it dominion and power When other voices are hot and spuming around you keep your voice cool Never allow your voice to become dull dubious uncertain shrinking or hollow Voice tones that are round rhythmic full measured Have a serene and reposeful voice Look at what you speak Reflect your soul in your voice Let the manner of your voice be calm smooth collected but energized with positive forces Have a cheerful voice a voice that makes one think of sunshine and smiles HOW TO LOVE RELATIVES To love your relatives be away from home all you can To have them love you keep about three hundred miles between you and them Thousands of homes and lives are wrecked by two families of the same family trying to live under the same roof Noah would have foundered with the Ark ten days after the flood started if he had taken more than two out of any one family with him Cain would never have killed Abel if Adam hadn t made the fool blunder of trying to keep his two sons everlastingly with him Of course there was some excuse in the fact that in those days New York and Paris were not brilliantly attractive cities If there is any one thing outside a church row that tickles the devil into a frenzy of laughter it is when a young married couple go home to live with the family There is about as much real life joy and harmony in it as there would be in a jungle picnic of monkeys and parrots There is just one place where large families can dwell together peaceably the grave yard It is contrary to natural law that families of grown ups should live together When a cub bear is old enough big enough to hunt for food and comes back after he once goes out his mother gives him a mauling that makes him feel he would rather starve than come back again Does she love him Of course she loves him to the limit of her instinct loves him to the point of pride that she wants him to be a brave daring self reliant master of the forest When the whelps of a lion get to be more than playful kittens the mother leads them into the jungle slips away leaving them to hunt The young lions may return to the old home but their father and mother have moved away to a distant den To evolve their natures to become supreme denizens of the forest they must rely upon their own prowess Take the eagle when the mother eagle by instinct knows the wings of her babies have become strong enough to support their bodies she pushes them out of the eyrie They fly or will be dashed to death on the rocks They always fly But you say human beings are not bears lions or eagles Well humans could well afford to attend the Nature College of the wild animals of the woods to learn the ethics of health happiness and the development of the individual Treat your relatives royally then let them alone Keep out of their affairs try to keep them out of your affairs Be kind generous sympathetic But keep out of the danger zone Insist upon living by yourself living your own life thinking your own thoughts playing your part in life s drama Parents wish they could hold their children the way to hold them is to let go of them If you love them you will let go Love is unselfish God sent His only Son on the loneliest journey ever taken and He came back crowned with glory God can live with lots of people you and I can t Abraham amounted to something God said to him Get thee out And he went out not knowing whither He staid until he became the head of a people as numberless and brilliant as the stars of the heaven But Isaac hung around home lived on his father s greatness and the only real thing he did that was worth while was to re dig some wells his father had dug before him The first time he saw his sweetheart Rebecca whom another man had to go and get for him he lifted up his voice and cried like a boob He had become soft on the mutton and grape juice of his father Tender little doves flit around the home cote but the eagle sweeps from sun to sun Anyhow in these modern days children are very largely bringing up their parents To kill a quarrel shut your mouth There is a world of sense in the saying Sell your hammer and buy a horn There is one place we can bear a boil and smile on the other fellow s neck Many people possess more than a thousand acres of possibilities and have about half an acre under cultivation The best way to exterminate mosquitoes would be to start a plan to cultivate them as a money making commodity Stop nagging twitting insinuating suspecting those whose love you wish to hold You assassinate love when you ridicule it Temper is the yeast of personality No man or woman ever rises in the world without it A razor knife ax or writer actor minister without it isn t worth a damn in any market Never lose your temper lose all things but keep your temper When I see people who are great stickers as to form or attitude in prayer they remind me of my old neighbor Saxby who fell into Bill Smith s well He said The prayingest prayer I ever said was in that well standing on my head Do you know the meanest thing about the worst boy on your street I will tell you It is the fact that you do not like him and he knows it God never made a mean boy Parents have made some towns have made some and cities have made a host Lesson Fourth THE SUPREME LAW OF SUCCESS SELLING POWER Study out plans Approach your customer or the public with a definite plan Here is one of simple power

Be original Think original thoughts put them into form Invent and produce Create ideas Feel complete in yourself Do not stand in wonder at what others have done right at your feet lies a secret that

power of service IMPERSONATE YOUR DESIRES Impersonate greatness and you will become great Impersonate loveliness and you will become lovely Why do actors become matinee idols They could readily marry a hundred times a month It is quite impossible for an actor to remain unmarried What is the secret Can a person get it Certainly here it is Actors impersonate heroes villains model husbands daring lovers in a real way They think plan and train themselves to impersonate the character they make it so real that people think it must be a part of their nature You can do it young man bachelor widower If you are only half a man half a lover impersonate a whole one If you are so bashful that it makes you blush to walk with your best girl in the garden where the flowers are in bed impersonate a dashing dare devil scamp of fascination and your sweetheart will faint from adorable bliss and fall into your arms If you are a coward impersonate a hero until you are one Do not stand on one foot or bite your fingernails or tear the rim off your hat trying to tell a beautiful healthy twentieth century young woman you love her You ll be all to the mustard Do something brave Go hire a kid that is a good swimmer to fall into the lake as you and your sweetheart are walking past then throw back your shoulders and tear off your coat and leap in the kid will get you to shore but you ll be a hero in

there are thousands and thousands of more women than there are men but you will win Men follow actresses around the world because they impersonate love passion beauty virtue and nobleness The men really think actresses must possess what they portray You see it is all a matter of thinking It does not matter how many times a man has lost on the races if he is a good sport he will bet on the next horse that looks good to him Women need to impersonate looking good better best Not on occasions only but all the time Men like women who are good pals So ladies impersonate sympathy kindness patience good fellowship enthusiasm in the things that interest men If you belong to the Citrus family impersonate the Peach If you belong to the Nettle family impersonate the Violet You may be so homely that your face pains you but think of the impersonations of beauty you can buy at the drug store Impersonate silence A young lady in Philadelphia lost her voice and she had nineteen proposals that year Impersonate form You may be as angular as the streets in Boston yet almost any department store will shape you up You may be so fat that you haven t seen your feet in years still you can impersonate so much good nature that men will be attracted to you as flowers to the sun Have confidence in everything you do even when you eat sausages at a quick lunch next door to the dog catcher Hell is not paved with good intentions Hell is paved with sanctimonious pretensions When you get up where does your lap go When you love where does your hate go After you have walked the floor all night trying to get the baby to sleep you can at least be thankful that you do not live in Greenland where the nights are six months long Avoid hot words in anger you might tell the truth A Chicago father thrashed his son for being out late at night Then added When I was your age my father would not let me be out after dark The boy answered Then you must have had a devil of a father The old man came back hotly I had a damn sight better father than you have Fretting is like a rocking chair you can do a great deal of agitating in it without getting anywhere Do not kick at the squirrel that runs up to you in the park it may be only mistaken identity he thought he saw a nut Children radiate truth they intuitively feel and express it Elsie had been bad and her mother sent her upstairs to talk it over with God After an hour she came down stairs singing her mother asked her what God had said to her O she replied God said Great Scott Elsie don t feel badly there are a lot of worse people in this house than you are Lesson Fifth SUPREME BODY BUILDING METHOD HEALTH HARMONY POWER SERVICE That is what a supreme body gives Do not always be taking care of your health take care of your body and you will

body glows and the muscles are well exercised Faithfully persist in these exercises and breathings Marrying a goose does not assure one of a bed of swans down Never ask a man who gave him his black eye nobody gave it to him he probably had to fight hard for it When discussing the modern dress keep in mind that a bare statement is not necessarily the naked truth There is a difference between notoriety and merit A thousand dollars worth of roses will barely fill a room with perfume but with a dollar s worth of fried onions you can scent up a whole town The American people lose three million years every twelve months by being sick The doctor s fees amount to a billion and two hundred and twenty million Wonder what the Master of Life meant when he said I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly Lesson Sixth SUPREME INTERNAL VIBRATIONS GOOD DIGESTION RULES THE WORLD Digestion is a matter of vibration Indigestion is on the increase because people are more and more sedentary in their habits Walking is life s finest exercise but people walk less now than ever The human body s great vibrator is the diaphragm Arouse it and you will arouse action in your digestive tract your liver and kidneys Continue vibration from one minute to as long as you please If these vibrations are continued a few minutes each day no cancer or tumor would ever develop and the thousand different stomach ills would disappear The DIAPHRAGM is a great muscle area stretched out for the stomach intestines and vital organs to exercise on and to give them freedom VIBRATIONS FOR INTESTINES Begin slowly take a deep breath then vibrate your abdomen in and out by using the inner muscles of the diaphragm Vibrate slowly then more rapidly Force the vibrations downward upon the intestines You may feel a little pain at first which shows the weakness of the intestinal muscles that passes away The DIAPHRAGM is the great digestive engine of the body work it all you can VIBRATIONS FOR STOMACH and SOLAR PLEXUS Raise the vibrations upward just as before you forced them downward Repeat the series with full breath several times Also give the vibrations with a little twist of the body so as to get the circular movement over the stomach VIBRATE THE SOLAR PLEXUS with short sharp vibrations far up into the chest this will cover the muscles of the lungs and of the heart This is a very essential work as it gives new strength to those muscles of the heart and lungs to ward off acute attacks of any kind VIBRATION FOR TORPID LIVER Direct the vibrations to the

courage seek to attain it YOU WILL COMMAND YOUR BODY KEEP MOVING TOWARD YOUR IDEAL Health is a result of Harmony By the force of the WILL acting in obedience to the mind is the body made perfect You are no fool if you know how to sin charmingly The most fertile source of family trouble on earth is an inheritance Do not spend your life leading asses to fountains of wisdom for you cannot make them think The life path of many people is like York Street in New Haven it begins with a hospital is populated with doctors and ends at the cemetery All Nature is Triune Earth Water Atmosphere Her agents are Heat Light Electricity Ether Magnetism Aura Her kingdoms are Mineral Vegetable Animal Her animal life is Aquatic Terrestrial Aerial Her formations are Angular Circular Spiral Man her highest creation is Physical Mental Spiritual If you cannot realize your ideal idealize your real Sleep is one of Nature s sanctuaries an alarm clock has no more right to disturb it than a fog horn has to blow off in a prayer meeting Be glad when you meet A Crank he may give you a suggestion that will make you A Self Starter Very few men are smart enough to fill five reels with genuine dare devil acts of villainy and get away with it by coming out an angel at the end of the film Heart failure is largely acute indigestion from selfishness Sunstroke is quite likely brought on by anger and anxiety het up by relatives Apoplexy is hate breaking up housekeeping Paresis is free love embellished with champagne Appendicitis is a six cylinder appetite hitched to a half horse power ambition Nervous prostration is a self love Movie trying to cover the earth in a single reel Pneumonia is vanity over heated in seal skin Lesson Seventh SUPREME MENTAL HEALING THE SUPREME MIND The previous lessons give you the key to Supreme Mental Healing Your mind is limitless Begin where you may conditions do not count No matter how weak how isolated how deep in the mire of trouble you can rise you can be free you can be renewed You may have a whole library of all sorts of books and treatises on healing You may have a library of biology and pathology but you can never read yourself well What you need is what I have sought to give you POSITIVE WORKING PLANS It takes some WORK to build a hut more to build a comfortable home still more to build a palace of luxury How much MIND AND WILL WORK are you willing to devote to build your body into a Temple of the living God MENTAL CONFUSION Make an easy PLAN for each day Relax your mind tension let down your body tension eat less drink water walk in the open air Change your thought to new plans new work LET GO OF THE PAST Have nothing to do with the future Sweep aside the odds and ends that litter your mind Let go by denying them any place in your

another in trouble to get out and you will get out yourself MAKE NEW PLANS WORRY AND FEAR Ask yourself this question How many things I have worried about and feared ever happened to me You will see how few and only those you attracted Worry is lost energy It is like a rocking chair keeps going but never gets anywhere It is like a mill owner starting all the machinery of his mill then going away leaving it running to injury and destruction It is a miserable habit It makes you and others near you unhappy It destroys your usefulness injures your health kills joy QUIT THE HABIT How By forming new PLANS of thought work expression activity and living only one day at a time Stop resisting struggling let go of selfish purpose and start loving Make a change Start new Grow something make

Stop buying tobacco or drink and buy flowers music or a farm ROUSE YOUR WILL SEVERELY CALL YOURSELF TO ACCOUNT WHEN YOU SLIP Stop talking about how you suffer or how hard it is talk about the victory When you are tempted SIT IN SILENCE TEN MINUTES AND SAY I AM SUPREME You will win over any habit that you may have Change your position Change your work Change your associations Drinking and smoking are the major habits that enslave men The moment you become disgusted with a habit it loses power over you When you get moral courage enough to hate it it will flee from you You may conquer in five days or it may be five weeks Just set aside a vacation of that time and fight a battle for Supreme manhood Have confidence in yourself Arouse your will to splendid self mastery Have a motive for being rid of your habit Have enthusiasm Be determined not to travel thru life loaded with a kit of bad smelling smoking tools Smoking does not stimulate nor aid digestion it does not clear the brain nor sooth the nerves It is quite the opposite The same is true of the liquor habit A habit is a deficiency it is a vicious enemy that mars and defeats Supreme Personality We become like the things we think Retire from business every night start in business anew every morning It isn t the mountain ahead that wears you out it is the grain of sand in your shoe All life is divine limitless in sensation supreme in expressions Get life get well get strong get wisdom get expression get in love And men seeing your good works will glorify your Father which is in heaven Lesson Eighth SUPREME POWER OF MAGNETISM OUR MAGNETIC MONOCHROME You can prepare your own Magnetic Monochrome by careful study of the colors which most influence you These will vary with the physical temperament of different people The primary healing colors are Crimson Scarlet Dark Blue Dark Green Lively Yellow Violet and Purple The primary inspirational colors are Light Blue Pale Green Rose Pink Lavender Lively Red From these you can form your Monochrome of almost endless results It is wise and best to select and use just those colors which will give the greatest intensity of vibration Once you have found your responsive and sympathetic colors those grouped together form your Magnetic Monochrome Magnetism is the highest form of physicalized power in the universe It knows no resistance it passes thru all substances and pervades all space It is the most vital power in the universe Our modern life presents a magnetic paradox it affords the greatest development of magnetism and is the greatest destroyer of it It is generated by the brain flows to the right thru the body in form of a figure eight From the brain to the solar plexus across to the left side then down to the procreative organs and thru to the right side and up to the solar plexus again and thru to the left side and up to the brain The solar plexus is the body s great life centre PERSONAL MAGNETISM Keep steadily cultivating Magnetism or your supply of Human Electricity The solar plexus is the great sympathetic centre of the nervous system Keep it aroused and active and you will increase your magnetic forces Sensation emotion and intensity of expression rise from the solar plexus Magnetism is generated by brain forces focalized by thoughts the nerves are the medium of transfusion colors increase the vibrations The moist palm of the hand forms an electrode when applied to any affected part The brain by thought starts the magnetic currents of healing force thru the arm into the part treated Let your eyes rest on the color of the Monochrome used the current will then be complete By practise you can greatly intensify the healing thoughts and so increase the flow of magnetism While giving yourself the treatment or to others breathe deeply and regularly Have the body relaxed while treating better lying down Have your eyes on the color also if treating another have them look at the same color MENTAL DISORDERS In all mental disorders like Hysteria Grief Distress Fear Melancholy select that color from your Monochrome that most soothes your particular temperament It may be light green or yellow or pink or one of the blues You will soon be able to quickly tell which gives the greater relief Use only one color at a time You will find that after a little you can summon to your mind the color you desire without even using the actual color in the Monochrome IN CASE OF INJURIES In case of injuries swellings inflammation local pain apply both hands where possible Have the palm of the hands always moist To start the process of thinking that will arouse the magnetic currents think of the affected part as WELL Think of the pain as LEAVING Now in treating the heart for palpitation think of it as quiet as strong praise the heart for its wonderful endurance and power thru the past years think of the strong abounding heart of an ox or moose and think that strength into your heart that your heart is like it in power You will see a decided improvement Use the colors of the Monochrome in such cases as will give you the best vibration the color that best responds to you Try the Red Violet Blue Most heart troubles are not heart troubles at all but troubles of digestion Give attention to diet and keep your intestinal tract clear TREATING THE EYES AND EARS In all troubles of the eyes and ears apply the hands over the eyes letting the palms rest firmly but not pressingly upon the eye with the fingers up over the forehead of course having the eyes closed Also treat with one palm over the eye and the other at the base of the brain Use the colors of the Monochrome that give the highest intensity of magnetic response The Purple Violet Blues and Green In treating the ears do the same Place the palm on each side of the neck Also treat the throat with both palms and with single treatment of one palm IT IS NOT NECESSARY THAT BOTH HANDS BE USED AT ONCE but it increases the force to do so TREATING THE SOLAR PLEXUS Treat the solar plexus daily by resting both hands lightly but firmly over the pit of the stomach Use the colors crimson dark blue violet and purple Untwist your solar plexus by cheerful thinking get new life force into its withered and neglected condition Invalidism is only a withered solar plexus Cultivate laughter to arouse it work at laughter until you sweat profusely do the same by walking and other exercises Stimulate life in your solar plexus and you will return to youth As I have said the solar plexus is the great magnetic centre keep it actively healthy bathe it with sunshine In treating the kidneys place the palm of the hands over them flatly and use the colors as above TREAT THE STOMACH AND LIVER WITH THE SAME COLORS Also treat the LUNGS The length of time for a treatment can vary from two minutes to any length Oft times the soothing effect will induce sleep As placing the palms over the temples for nervous headache The more you develop the magnetism the more readily will the effect be accomplished Provoke an evil and you produce it The place to feel for the poor is in your pocket A kiss is something like gossip it goes from mouth to mouth Chewing gum is like worrying a useless waste of energy Keeping close tabs on the calendar and clock induces the creepy feeling of old age Have nothing to do with useless people you cannot get wool by shearing a hydraulic ram The Mothers of America will in a near by day reset the cornerstones of this Republic Never stop a man running with a hat box in his hand it may be his wife s hat that he is trying to get home before the style changes Dress youthfully keep out of shadows love the sunlight fresh air the world and the people in the world LIVE FOR OTHERS Let the howlers howl Let the growlers growl Let the scowlers scowl And the gee gaws go it You keep in the light Be brave in your fight You ll win alright And I know it Anon Lesson Ninth THE SUPREME LAW OF TELEPATHY LIFE IS SPIRIT

picture of the person you wish to reach Get clearly as possible the actual presence in your mind Then begin to send the wave thoughts by repeating impressively to yourself or aloud the message of your

impressed that he delayed a day his western trip and so missed the train that went down at Ashtabula A husband who was some miles distant transacting business received the thought waves from his wife that she was in danger He hastened with all speed and found his home in flames A young lady felt the impress of thought waves from a young man to whom she was engaged and decided not to join a boating party On the return trip the pleasure launch took fire and six of the party perished A whole volume could be filled with most interesting cases of positive results of Telepathy or thought waves But
