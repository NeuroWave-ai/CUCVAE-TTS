XXIII BACK AGAIN XXIV missus GREEN S MISTAKE THE TALE OF missus LADYBUG I THE POLKA DOT LADY LITTLE missus Ladybug was a worker Nobody could deny that To be sure she had to stop now and then to talk to her neighbors because missus Ladybug dearly loved a bit of gossip At the same time there wasn t anyone in Pleasant Valley that helped Farmer Green more than she did She tried her hardest to keep the trees in the orchard free from insects Some of her less worthy neighbors were known sometimes to say with a sniff If missus Ladybug didn t enjoy her work she wouldn t care about helping Farmer Green If she hadn t such a big appetite she d stop to chat even more than she does now That might seem an odd remark unless one happened to know how missus Ladybug freed the orchard of the tiny pests that attacked it The truth of the matter was this missus Ladybug ate the little insects that fed upon the fruit trees Her constant toil meant that she devoured huge numbers of Farmer Green s enemies Goodness knows what Farmer Green would have done had missus Ladybug and all her family lost their taste for that kind of fare The orchard might have been a sorry sight Perhaps it was only to be expected that missus Ladybug should have little patience with folk that seemed lazy She thought that Freddie Firefly wasted too much of his time dancing in the meadow at night She considered Buster Bumblebee the Queen s son to be a useless idler dressed in his black velvet and gold Having heard that Daddy Longlegs was a harvestman she urged him to go to work for Farmer Green at harvest time And as for the beautiful Betsy Butterfly missus Ladybug found all manner of fault with her Nothing made missus Ladybug angrier than to see Betsy Butterfly flitting from flower to flower in the sunshine followed by her admirers What can they see in that gaudy creature missus Ladybug often asked her friends It will appear from this that missus Ladybug was not always as pleasant as she might have been Moreover she was something of a busybody and too fond of prying into the affairs of others And if she didn t happen to approve of her neighbors or their ways missus Ladybug never hesitated to speak her mind When she first appeared on Farmer Green s place wearing her bright red gown with its black spots everyone supposed that missus Ladybug was dressed in her working clothes And indeed she was Nor did she ever don any other I ve no time to fritter away she declared when somebody asked her what she was going to wear to Betsy Butterfly s party If I go to the party I ll just drop in for a few minutes as I am in my polka dot Her neighbors thought that very strange They even whispered to one another that they didn t believe missus Ladybug had anything else to wear Nor had she Nor did she want any And it wasn t long before everybody understood missus Ladybug s ways She was so earnest that they couldn t help liking her no matter if her remarks were a bit tart now and then II BUSTER S RESOLVE NOT only was Betsy Butterfly a beautiful creature She was pleasant to everybody And almost all her neighbors were just as pleasant to her missus Ladybug was one of the few that were sometimes disagreeable to Betsy For missus Ladybug did not approve of her She thought that Betsy Butterfly was frivolous And she frowned whenever she saw Betsy in her beautiful costume She never wears working clothes missus Ladybug often complained when talking to her friends Now if Betsy Butterfly would only wear something plain and serviceable as I do once in a while people might have a different opinion of her She ought to try this hard finished red and black polka dot of mine It s a wonderful piece of goods One day missus Ladybug was gossiping in that fashion with Mehitable Moth a soberly clad person who was always a bit jealous of the gorgeous Betsy And Mehitable Moth nodded her head to everything that little missus Ladybug said What do you think of Betsy Butterfly s wings Miss Moth inquired They re all for show missus Ladybug declared They re so flimsy and delicate that Betsy Butterfly never dares venture out in bad weather Of what use would I be to Farmer Green if I had wings like hers If I stayed under cover whenever the sun didn t shine the orchard would soon be overrun with insects Now it happened that Buster Bumblebee was sipping nectar from a head of clover near by Of course he wasn t listening to what missus Ladybug and Miss Moth were saying But he couldn t help hearing their remarks And being a great admirer of Betsy Butterfly he wasn t at all pleased He even buzzed near the two gossipers and said to them Can t you find something else to talk about Such rudeness missus Ladybug gasped What shocking manners cried Miss Mehitable Moth They hoped that Buster Bumblebee heard what they said Anyhow he flew off in his blundering clumsy way without speaking to them again Who is this missus Ladybug to pick flaws in the beautiful Betsy Butterfly he asked himself savagely Who is she to find fault with Betsy s lovely wings If missus Ladybug herself had wings I shouldn t think her chatter so strange But a person with no wings has no business expressing his views of somebody else s Buster Bumblebee was so out of patience with missus Ladybug that he lost his taste for clover heads for the rest of the afternoon And that was a most unusual thing with him However he could think of nothing but missus Ladybug and her unkind speeches And at last meeting Betsy Butterfly herself along towards sunset he stopped to tell how well she was looking and how charming her colors were Betsy Butterfly was not vain She laughed gayly and said You re very kind to say those agreeable things I can t help it he replied heartily Everybody s not like you Betsy Butterfly told him Then you ve been hearing about missus Ladybug he cried Somebody has been tattling It doesn t matter Betsy Butterfly assured him Perhaps it s good for me to know that everyone doesn t admire me Buster Bumblebee didn t agree with her I ll have to speak to missus Ladybug he declared Oh don t Betsy Butterfly begged him for she was as gentle as she was beautiful and never wanted people to quarrel on her account But Buster Bumblebee had made up his mind and nothing could change it III HIDDEN WINGS 
7925-114279-0000	train-other-500	THE next day Buster Bumblebee set out for the orchard to find missus Ladybug He wanted to warn her to stop talking about Betsy Butterfly But Buster hadn t realized
7925-114279-0001	train-other-500	that it was not an easy matter to say anything to missus Ladybug missus Ladybug always liked to do most of the talking herself She preferred to let others listen
7925-114279-0002	train-other-500	He found her hard at work destroying insects on an old apple tree And when she caught sight of him missus Ladybug paused in her labors
7925-114279-0003	train-other-500	Well young man she exclaimed looking at Buster severely Are you idling this lovely day away You don t seem to be making any honey
none	none	 Buster wished that he had spoken first He certainly had had no intention of discussing such matters as honey making I don t need to make honey he told missus Ladybug 
7925-114279-0004	train-other-500	The workers in our hive provide honey enough
none	none	 Maybe you didn t know that I m of royal blood 
7925-114279-0005	train-other-500	I m the Queen s son I don t have to work he declared somewhat hotly Rubbish cried missus Ladybug regarding him with a frown
7925-114279-0006	train-other-500	Go get yourself some working clothes Take off your black velvet and gold And save that suit for best You don t understand Buster tried to explain Being a Queen s son
7925-114279-0007	train-other-500	I m expected to wear my court costume every day Nonsense missus Ladybug retorted The sooner you get such silly notions out of your head the better off you ll be
7925-114279-0008	train-other-500	Everybody ought to work Too much play is bad for folks Buster Bumblebee could feel himself flushing The neighbors were not expected to address a Queen s son in that fashion
7925-114279-0009	train-other-500	That s exactly the way you talk about Betsy Butterfly he exploded Huh missus Ladybug sniffed You are a worthless pair Betsy Butterfly s wings
7925-114279-0010	train-other-500	At this point Buster managed to interrupt her Don t talk about wings please he cried Who are you to talk about wings when you haven t any yourself
7925-114279-0011	train-other-500	missus Ladybug started and she gave him a queer look What s that she inquired What s that Say that again
none	none	 You haven t any wings Ho she laughed You re mistaken I have wings 
7925-114279-0012	train-other-500	Then you ve left them at home he insisted missus Ladybug smiled a very knowing sort of smile When he saw it Buster Bumblebee couldn t help feeling uncomfortable Somehow he knew that he had blundered
none	none	 But just where he had erred 
7925-114279-0013	train-other-500	he was unable to decide Watch sharp young sir missus Ladybug bade him
none	none	 Watch sharp and perhaps you ll be able to learn something 
7925-114279-0014	train-other-500	Then Buster Bumblebee received the surprise of his life
none	none	 As he watched little missus Ladybug opened 
7925-114279-0015	train-other-500	her shell like black dotted red back and spread a pair of delicate brown wings See these she said to Buster Bumblebee who gasped at her blankly I ve really two pairs
7925-114279-0016	train-other-500	of wings because my polka dot wing covers are actually wings too only folks don t usually call them by that name Having spread her wings missus Ladybug decided
none	none	 to take a short flight And with Buster gazing dully after her she flitted off I ll have to tell my mother the Queen about this he muttered IV RUSTY WREN HELPS RUSTY WREN S wife was getting very impatient She was at home with her fast growing family of youngsters at home in the cherry tree near Farmer Green s chamber window Dear me missus Wren exclaimed I don t see what s keeping Rusty It s at least a quarter of an hour since he brought any food to these children missus Wren soon grew tired of waiting I ll go and find him she said under her breath And telling her nestlings that she would be back in a few minutes she hurried off towards the orchard I thought so missus Wren muttered soon afterward as she caught sight of her husband He was talking with Jolly Robin in the old apple tree where the Robin family lived I thought so Have you forgotten your duty as a parent missus Wren asked her husband in a tart voice dropping down on a branch right behind him Rusty Wren jumped I ve been here only a second or two he faltered mister Robin and I had a little business together So I see said missus Wren So I see And now if your business is finished allow me to remind you that you have six hungry sons and daughters at home Then missus Wren twitched herself off her perch and flew back to the cherry tree and her family I declare Rusty Wren remarked to his friend Jolly Robin I must have stayed here talking with you longer than I thought Those children have enormous appetites I ll have to work more spryly than ever to get them fed before sunset I know how that is said Jolly Robin with a chuckle Somehow he seemed much more cheerful than his companion I was actually glad when our last nestlings were big enough to leave home and hustle for themselves But of course he added I still keep an eye on them Rusty Wren had already begun to hunt for tidbits Almost immediately he found an ant which he snatched up and carried away Back and forth he flew making dozens of trips between his house and the orchard Grubs and caterpillars grasshoppers and spiders he seized them wherever he could spy them and took them home to his famishing children Though he worked his hardest missus Wren hadn t a smile for him And when she said anything in his hearing it was some such remark as this You poor hungry dears It s a pity you can t have all you need to eat I only hope your scanty meals won t stunt your growth Naturally such speeches didn t make her husband feel any more at his ease I ll have to bring home something special to please her he thought I wish I could find some dainty that would put her in better humor So he looked all around to see what he could discover that was different from the food he had been gathering And it wasn t long before he gave a chirp of delight Here s a pretty beetle he cried I know it will make missus Wren smile when I show it to her Thereupon Rusty Wren pounced upon missus Ladybug and bore her away struggling in his bill V A HARD SHELL RUSTY WREN hurried home carrying missus Ladybug despite her frantic efforts to escape She wriggled all her six legs at the same time She ll be pleased with this one Rusty murmured as he watched missus Ladybug s struggles missus Wren will certainly thank me when I give her this morsel And she did How lovely missus Wren exclaimed when Rusty gave her his captive And he was so glad that he hastened away to try to find another just like that one But he hadn t gone far before he said Ugh I hope I haven t made a mistake I don t like the taste of that beetle And he dropped down upon the ground and carefully wiped his bill upon the grass He couldn t help feeling somewhat worried I don t believe the children will notice anything wrong he muttered So far they ve never refused anything that was offered them But if missus Wren tried to eat that beetle herself I fear there ll be trouble And there was Rusty knew it a few minutes later when little mister Chippy s son Chippy junior came flitting up and peeped in his childish voice Please sir missus Wren wants you at once There was nothing to do except to go home And Rusty went He found missus Wren much upset Are you trying to poison us she demanded No indeed my love Rusty Wren replied meekly Well you made a terrible mistake then she declared Meanwhile Rusty Wren was looking all around Yet he couldn t see the pretty beetle meaning missus Ladybug anywhere Somebody must have swallowed it anyhow he thought You must be more careful his wife told him severely That was a horrid tasting beetle that you brought home It s lucky I discovered that it was a queer one The children poor dears are so hungry that any one of them would have bolted it had I offered it to him Then you ate it yourself Rusty Wren faltered Oh no I didn t said his wife I dropped it upon the ground And no doubt I d have thrown it away anyhow no matter how it tasted Why he asked her I thought it was a pretty beetle It was pretty enough I dare say missus Wren replied But it had a very hard shell It wouldn t have been safe to feed it to the children Nor should I have cared to eat it myself I thought it was a pretty beetle Rusty said again It was such a gay color bright red you know It seemed to me it would please the children and you too missus Wren still seemed to be somewhat out of patience When you gather food for the youngsters never mind about the color of it she exclaimed If you want to bring them playthings that s another matter But don t fetch home any more pretty red beetles for them to eat Very well my love said Rusty Wren And then he slipped away to hunt for food because the children were still clamoring for more missus Wren talked a good deal afterward about her terrible experience Yet she never stopped to think about the pretty beetle about little missus Ladybug For missus Ladybug had had a dreadful fright Luckily she wasn t hurt But it was a long time before she was her usual busy able self again And later when she told her friends about her adventure she said that she couldn t understand how Rusty came to make such a mistake I supposed missus Ladybug declared that every bird in Pleasant Valley knew I wasn t good to eat VI THE TRAVELER FARMER GREEN S garden was growing fast The sweet corn waved and rustled whenever a breeze swept it The beets and carrots sent their pert tops a little higher each day The cabbages began to puff their heads out as if they felt of some importance in the world And the potato vines were actually pretty with their white blossoms amid the green leaves Farmer Green was very proud of his potatoes He said in missus Ladybug s hearing that they were the best he had ever raised I must fly over to the garden and have a look at those potatoes missus Ladybug thought It s always a pleasure to see flourishing crops Before she found time to spare for her visit to the garden a traveler entered the orchard one day At least he had every appearance of having come from other parts For he carried a traveling bag an old fashioned carpetbag and he seemed to have lost his way As soon as missus Ladybug saw him she couldn t help thinking what a handsome person he was He wore a yellow coat And instead of being spotted with black as her gown was it was striped Good morning said the stranger Good morning said missus Ladybug Can I be of any service to you The stranger took off his cap He was a most polite chap Perhaps you can help me he replied I m looking for Farmer Green s vegetable garden Do you know where it is Indeed I do missus Ladybug cried It s at the end of this orchard just beyond the fence And the potato patch I suppose I ll have no trouble finding that the stranger went on Follow your nose said missus Ladybug You re headed right for it now The stranger thanked her And he was about to move on But of course missus Ladybug wanted to talk more than that before he got away The potatoes are fine this season she remarked The stranger looked greatly pleased That s good news he told her Have you seen them yourself Not yet missus Ladybug answered But I heard Farmer Green say they were fine And he ought to know if anybody does He certainly ought the stranger agreed Then thanking missus Ladybug once more he hurried toward the garden One moment she called There were several questions that she wanted to ask the newcomer She was wildly curious to know who he was and where he came from and what business had brought him to Pleasant Valley But he couldn t have heard her Anyhow he was out of sight in no time leaving missus Ladybug almost bursting with the questions that had sprung to her lips He might have waited a second she muttered But if he has traveled a long way no doubt he s eager to get to his journey s end Luckily missus Ladybug had kept her eyes open when talking with the gentleman in the striped yellow coat And as he turned to leave her she looked closely at his carpetbag On one side of it she read in big letters P BUG COLORADO VII A HANDSOME STRANGER LITTLE missus Ladybug was too excited to work Ever since meeting the stranger in the orchard she had been able to think of nothing but him Perhaps if she hadn t happened to notice his carpetbag with the words P Bug Colorado upon its side she might not have been so stirred up Anyhow missus Ladybug kept wondering what business had brought the stranger to Pleasant Valley She wished she could find out what he was going to do in the potato patch She wanted to ask him why he chose to have black stripes on his yellow coat instead of spots How long had he been traveling When did he expect to leave the farm There was no end to the questions that missus Ladybug burned to put to him Meanwhile she told the news to everybody she saw For missus Ladybug dearly loved to spread choice morsels of gossip It pleased her mightily to tell her neighbors something they didn t know People listened to her story with great interest They were eager to learn all about the stranger whom missus Ladybug declared to be very handsome missus Ladybug made her news last as long as possible in the telling She made her neighbors wait a bit for every fact so they would enjoy it to the full And whenever she stopped anyone and told him about the newcomer missus Ladybug kept the best part until the last She always ended her remarks by saying with a most important air His name is mister P Bug And he comes from Colorado That never failed to impress her listeners which was exactly what missus Ladybug wanted Since nobody asked her how she knew the traveler s name and where he came from missus Ladybug did not trouble herself to explain that she had read both name and place upon his old fashioned carpetbag There was one thing that puzzled her slightly when she paused to think about it How did it happen that the elegant stranger carried a most unfashionable bag missus Ladybug soon settled that question to her own satisfaction He s like me she decided mister P Bug is a hard worker and he doesn t care for show He s a plain person No doubt he put on that yellow coat to travel in because it s his best But he ll wear overalls perhaps if he starts to work in the potato patch as I suspect he will At last however missus Ladybug met with a rude shock She was telling her news to Peppery Polly Bumblebee one of the workers in the hive ruled by Buster Bumblebee s mother the well known Queen And to missus Ladybug s amazement when she related the name of the stranger and the place he came from Peppery Polly laughed in her face mister P Bug is not from Colorado said Peppery Polly Bumblebee He has never been off this farm Well missus Ladybug was staggered She gasped She clung to a leaf to keep from failing I don t believe that she cried as soon as she could speak I ll find mister Bug himself and learn the truth from him VIII SEEKING THE TRUTH missus LADYBUG was determined to know the truth about mister P Bug the newcomer And as soon as she had fully recovered from the rude blow that Peppery Polly Bumblebee dealt her she set out for Farmer Green s garden and the potato patch For some time missus Ladybug flew back and forth above the potato vines It was not an easy matter to find so small a person as mister Bug in so big a field But she discovered him at last And she was somewhat surprised to see him still in his elegant yellow coat with the black stripes For missus Ladybug had expected him to be hard at work in overalls To be sure mister P Bug did appear to be busy about something or other He was so busy that he scarcely so much as glanced at missus Ladybug when she spoke to him mumbling Good morning in answer to her greeting but not taking the trouble to doff his cap He s at work anyhow thought missus Ladybug He s helping Farmer Green Then she alighted on the potato vine where mister Bug was clinging Don t you remember me she asked He shook his head His mouth seemed to be full of something missus Ladybug wasn t sure what Don t you recall speaking to me one time she persisted After swallowing he answered I can t say I do I m the person that told you how to get to this potato patch missus Ladybug explained When you met me in the orchard on your way from Colorado you stopped and asked me to direct you to Farmer Green s potato patch For a moment or two mister Bug seemed puzzled especially when missus Ladybug mentioned Colorado But by the time missus Ladybug had finished speaking he nodded So I did he exclaimed I had forgotten all about that Though now that you speak of it I do remember meeting a very talkative dame dressed in a polka dot Possibly I spoke to you about my settling in the potato patch for the summer No said missus Ladybug But I thought I d find you here You seemed in a great hurry to reach this place So I was said mister P Bug And I m glad I came This is the finest potato patch in the whole valley so I have been told You must have seen a good many others on your journey from Colorado missus Ladybug ventured It s a long way from there to here I suppose I suppose it is mister P Bug murmured He seemed to be a bit impatient as if he were in haste to return to his work and didn t care to talk any longer I suppose you were weeks on the road missus Ladybug went on Are you going back to Colorado after you ve finished helping Farmer Green with the potato crop Colorado he blurted I don t know where that place is I ve never been there in all my life IX THAT CARPETBAG mister P BUG S statement amazed missus Ladybug He said he had never been in Colorado More than that he declared he didn t even know where the place was Now Peppery Polly Bumblebee had told missus Ladybug that mister P Bug was no stranger in Pleasant Valley But missus Ladybug had not believed what she said Even hearing mister Bug s own words missus Ladybug couldn t help doubting them Can it be true she asked him can it be true that you ve never been off this farm mister Bug quite plainly wished that she would go away and stop bothering him It can be it is true he replied carelessly At last missus Ladybug had to believe what she heard Then you re a fraud she cried You re a cheat For I read on your carpetbag when we met in the orchard P Bug Colorado Oh said mister Bug with a smile Oh So that s where you got your odd notion I wondered how you happened to make such a mistake A perfectly natural mistake I m sure missus Ladybug exclaimed indignantly Well I dare say it is he admitted But you see that s not my carpetbag At least I didn t get it new It belonged to my great great great grandfather Indeed I m not sure he wasn t even still greater than I ve said He lived in Colorado once so I ve been told But I was born and raised on this farm If all this is true said missus Ladybug what were you doing with that carpetbag And why did you ask me the way to this potato patch I m in a hurry to get to work mister Bug remarked I ll answer just this once When we met in the orchard I had been away on a little vacation And Farmer Green s potato patch so I learned had been moved since last year Dear me missus Ladybug wailed People will laugh at me for having made such a serious mistake But mister P Bug didn t say anything about that Good by he grunted And he crawled under a leaf out of sight For once in her life missus Ladybug wasn t eager to talk to her neighbors On the contrary she seemed to avoid them But Peppery Polly Bumblebee called on her and asked her if she had seen the handsome stranger mister P Bug Yes said missus Ladybug I ve talked with him And it s true that he has always lived here There was a slight mistake about his carpetbag It belonged to one of his ancestors And since it bears his ancestor s name and address naturally I thought they both belonged to this mister Bug Peppery Polly laughed If you don t believe what I tell you you can ask him yourself missus Ladybug snapped He s at work over in the potato patch helping Farmer Green Peppery Polly laughed again more unpleasantly than ever Helping Farmer Green she exclaimed He s eating the leaves off the vines as fast as he can I know that gentleman He s mister Potato Bug And he s one of the greatest pests on the farm X A BIT OF NEWS CHIRPY CRICKET was looking for missus Ladybug He had news for her Now it wasn t often that anybody could tell missus Ladybug anything Usually she was the one that told other people bits of gossip So Chirpy Cricket was specially eager to find her and make known to her what he had learned It was about missus Ladybug s cousin At least there was a person living in the vegetable garden who claimed to be a cousin of missus Ladybug s Chirpy found missus Ladybug in the orchard But strange to say she didn t seem at all interested in his news I dare say I have a cousin in the garden she told him Ours is a big family I have more cousins than I could ever count They re as plentiful as the leaves on the trees I can t stop my work to go and see this one If I called on all my cousins I d never have time to help Farmer Green Chirpy Cricket looked disappointed He had expected missus Ladybug to show great interest in what he told her She certainly always thought that others ought to pay strict attention when she related the happenings about the farm And she always wanted them to act surprised and pleased too Aren t you going to the garden Chirpy Cricket demanded Don t you intend to be polite to your cousin Humph said missus Ladybug She can t be any busier than I am Why doesn t she come to the orchard to call on me She can t do that he explained Your cousin says that it wouldn t be etiquette She says you ve lived on the farm longer than she has Rubbish missus Ladybug scolded I m a plain working person There s too much to do during the summer for me to bother with such nonsense Chirpy Cricket found her rather discouraging Still he hadn t given up hope of making missus Ladybug change her mind I fear you re making a mistake he remarked You ought to see this cousin She s different from any of your family that I ve ever met before How is she different missus Ladybug demanded pausing in her pursuit of insects on the leaves of the apple tree At last she began to show some signs of interest I don t know Chirpy Cricket replied I can t say Maybe it s her clothes that make her look strange missus Ladybug then started to ask him questions which was the best of proof that her curiosity had been aroused What sort of gown was my cousin wearing she inquired Was it a red polka dot like mine I don t remember he answered What colors did she have on I didn t notice said Chirpy Cricket missus Ladybug gave him a look of disgust Well if that isn t just like a man she spluttered Men never can tell how a body s dressed If I want to learn anything more about this cousin of mine I suppose I ll have to go and see her with my own eyes And that afternoon she went to the vegetable garden XI THE NEW COUSIN FOR missus Ladybug finding her unknown cousin in Farmer Green s vegetable garden was not an easy task Since Chirpy Cricket hadn t been able to tell missus Ladybug what colors her cousin wore missus Ladybug didn t know what to expect I wish I knew whether she was dressed in red black blue yellow or some other color missus Ladybug complained to herself But I don t know that I don t even know if she carries an umbrella There was nothing missus Ladybug could do except to ask everyone she met So she inquired right and left if anybody happened to be acquainted with her cousin And at last Betsy Butterfly came to missus Ladybug s help Look among the squash vines Betsy Butterfly advised her I noticed somebody there that looks a bit like you Maybe it s your cousin That was very kind of Betsy Butterfly missus Ladybug was no friend of hers Indeed missus Ladybug had often found fault with Betsy for being too pleasure loving But Betsy Butterfly was not one of the kind that nurses grudges She was only too glad to do missus Ladybug a favor missus Ladybug thanked her albeit somewhat grumpily Then flying to the place where Farmer Green had planted his squashes she found a person at whom she stared hard for a few moments Do you want to speak to me this strange lady inquired She was a gay appearing creature dressed in yellow with black patches on it I can t tell whether I care to talk to you or not said missus Ladybug It all depends If you re my cousin I do If you aren t I don t The strange lady laughed lightly I wonder she replied I wonder if you are missus Ladybug I am said missus Ladybug Then I m your cousin cried the other At last I ve met you And she rushed towards missus Ladybug with every intention of embracing her missus Ladybug backed hastily away Not so fast she exclaimed If you really are my cousin well and good But how do I know that you aren t an impostor A what the strange lady faltered She was quite naturally somewhat taken aback by missus Ladybug s coolness How do I know that you re not a cheat missus Ladybug asked her Have you any references Any what stammered the would be cousin Any letters about yourself missus Lady explained For all I know you may be dissembling I may be whatting quavered the lady in yellow Dear me missus Ladybug muttered to herself Must I address this person in words of one syllable Then to her companion she said bluntly Tell me why you think you and I are related That s easy cried the yellow one I belong to the Ladybug family Now you might think that would have satisfied missus Ladybug But she wasn t convinced yet My family she declared my family are all famous workers If you re one of us where are your working clothes Where s your red and black polka dot The cousin tittered She seemed to be a silly sort of creature I haven t any red and black polka dot she replied These are my working clothes that I m wearing now missus Ladybug shook her head It was plain that she didn t approve of those clothes nor of their wearer XII A QUEER WAY TO HELP missus LADYBUG wished that she hadn t come to the vegetable garden to see the person who called herself missus Ladybug s cousin She wasn t at all the sort of relation that missus Ladybug cared to have Although the stranger in yellow was most agreeable somehow missus Ladybug disliked her exceedingly And strange to say missus Ladybug couldn t have told exactly what it was in her cousin that displeased her It wasn t alone the yellow gown that the new cousin wore Nor her simpering smile Nor her trifling manner It was something else something that made missus Ladybug feel that she was not to be trusted I must hurry back to the orchard missus Ladybug announced There s work waiting for me there I really ought not to have left it to come to see you Don t take your work so seriously her cousin advised her You ought to take more time for amusement I hope you ll come to see me often missus Ladybug s opinion of the stranger sank even lower If some of us weren t earnest about our work the rest of the world would have a sorry time she declared I may as well tell you that I shall not be able to call on you again I shall be too busy And there s no use of my urging you to come to see me because of course you have your work to do too Oh naturally said missus Ladybug s cousin with an odd smile Still I could leave it once in a while to make a cousinly call It won t be necessary missus Ladybug told her If I need you I ll send for you And she said to herself grimly under her breath She ll never hear from me If I can help you at any time don t fail to let me know the cousin told missus Ladybug Doubtless I could be of some service though I d always rather work on vines squash and pumpkin preferred missus Ladybug thanked her I shouldn t want her helping me she thought I ll warrant she s so careless that she would do more harm than good And missus Ladybug looked at the vine on which they were standing I see you re helping Farmer Green with his squash vines at present she remarked aloud Yes said her cousin I have this one almost finished Good said missus Ladybug And she took a closer look at the vine It seemed far from healthy In fact she noticed that the leaves were tattered and torn What are these great holes in the squash leaves she inquired Her cousin fidgeted and made no reply Glancing at her missus Ladybug thought she was growing a bit red in the face Then all at once missus Ladybug guessed the dreadful truth You ve been eating these leaves she cried Her cousin tossed her head A person has to eat something she retorted missus Ladybug threw up her hands I knew you weren t trustworthy she muttered I knew you weren t the sort of relation I d want anything to do with Then missus Ladybug left her Later when Chirpy Cricket met her he asked her if she had seen her cousin who was spending the summer among the squash vines And he was astonished when missus Ladybug glared at him and exclaimed Never mention her to me again XIII JENNIE JUNEBUG JENNIE JUNEBUG was a frolicsome fat person And she was a great joker The joke that she loved most was this she loved to bump into people that were flying through the air to bump into them and knock them spinning upon the ground Being much heavier than many of her neighbors Jennie Junebug suffered little from such collisions And she never could understand why anybody should find fault with her favorite sport If a body objected to her rough play Jennie Junebug only laughed heartily I don t mind when I take a tumble she would retort So why should you And if the sufferer complained that it wasn t the tumble that hurt so much as the shock of her hard bulky self Jennie would shake with merriment and crash into him again Really it was useless to try to reason with her The safest way was to avoid her if possible especially after dark For then was the time that she preferred for her rowdy tricks missus Ladybug couldn t abide her Not only did she dislike Jennie Junebug s jokes She disapproved of her treatment of Farmer Green For Jennie Junebug did everything she could to ruin the trees on the farm She ate their leaves And that was one thing that missus Ladybug couldn t forgive in anybody It s a shame missus Ladybug often said it s a shame the way Jennie Junebug riddles the foliage Here I work my hardest to save the leaves by ridding them of tiny insects that feed upon them insects that suck the juices from the leaves and make them wither And there s Jennie Junebug trying her best to destroy the leaves that I save It s enough to make an honest person weep Perhaps Jennie Junebug wasn t so bad at heart as missus Ladybug thought her Maybe she was merely a gay careless creature who never stopped to consider that she was injuring Farmer Green when she hurt his trees At least that was what some of missus Ladybug s other neighbors sometimes remarked But missus Ladybug never could believe that Jennie had a single good trait unless it was good nature For she was always ready with a laugh no matter what anybody said to her It was seldom that missus Ladybug hesitated to speak her mind right out to a person if she happened to disapprove of him But she had always kept out of Jennie Junebug s way Jennie was many times bigger than little missus Ladybug missus Ladybug trembled to think what might happen to her if Jennie should ever hurl her fat body against missus Ladybug with a dull sickening thud If that ever happens missus Ladybug thought I fear I ll never be able to do another day s work for Farmer Green It might be the end of me Now in spite of her fears missus Ladybug had even more than her share of courage And as time went on and she saw the awful havoc that Jennie Junebug played with the trees missus Ladybug reached the point where she couldn t any longer stand by silently and let Jennie Junebug riddle the leaves Something will have to be done missus Ladybug declared to her friends I can t compel Jennie Junebug to stop She s too big for me to handle I m going to have a talk with her said missus Ladybug XIV BUMPS SOME busybody went straight to Jennie Junebug and told her what missus Ladybug had said missus Ladybug is going to have a talk with you this meddling person told the fat and frolicsome Jennie She wants you to stop eating leaves She says you are doing your best or your worst to hurt the trees that she is trying to save She claims that you are no friend of Farmer Green s She Jennie Junebug broke in upon her companion with a loud laugh I d like to have missus Ladybug try to speak to me she chuckled If she does I ll have fun with her I ll knock her over I ll send her spinning Jennie s friend seemed somewhat alarmed at that Now be careful she begged the fat lady Don t forget that missus Ladybug is a little creature You ll injure her if you re too rough with her Ho ho laughed Jennie Junebug and also Ha ha She had to stop and hold her sides while she rocked back and forth This is a great joke Jennie cried Imagine missus Ladybug trying to talk with me Why she ll be lucky if she can get her breath after I ve flown into her once Dear me said the tale bearer I wish I hadn t mentioned this matter to you Of course everybody knows that missus Ladybug talks too much And I thought maybe you d enjoy meeting her and making her keep still But I had no idea you would do her any harm Bless you cried Jennie Junebug I wouldn t harm a hair of her head And she roared with laughter for she had made a joke You see missus Ladybug had no hair She was quite bald Well missus Ladybug found Jennie Junebug that very evening She knew that Jennie wasn t often seen except after sunset For Jennie loved to see the lights twinkling through the gloom And she delighted in surprising people in the dark by flying bang into them and knocking them down So missus Ladybug didn t leave her work and set out to seek this dangerous fat lady until twilight came Good evening said missus Ladybug as soon as she spied Miss Junebug Have you a few minutes to spare If you have I d like to talk with you Jennie Junebug grinned broadly I can give you a few seconds of my valuable time she replied I was just going over to the meadow for Freddie Firefly will be there soon He dances in the meadow every night And I like to see his flickering light and watch him bounce when I hit him So you ll have to talk fast for I m in a hurry said Jennie Junebug Good thought missus Ladybug She s going to listen to me after all And then she fixed Miss Junebug with her eye and spoke to her severely Don t you think you ought she began And then Jennie Junebug bumped into her sending missus Ladybug sprawling Don t I think I ought to frolic with you Jennie cried Certainly I do missus Ladybug managed to rise off the ground Won t you please she started to say Won t I please knock you down Of course I will Jennie Junebug exclaimed And thereupon she struck missus Ladybug again Poor missus Ladybug was much shaken In her fall she had dropped her umbrella and her handkerchief too But she didn t stop to pick them up She scrambled to her feet and rose into the air again angrier than she had ever been before in all her life I ll thank you she spluttered You ll thank me if I ll do that again eh said Jennie Junebug interrupting her rudely Very well Here goes This time she gave missus Ladybug a terrific blow She dropped upon the grass where she clung to a blade and swayed up and down for a few moments dizzy and trembling And she was gasping so hard in order to get her breath that she couldn t speak Watching her Jennie Junebug shrieked with laughter Then seeing Freddie Firefly s light flashing in the meadow Miss Junebug hurried away XV ENOUGH SUCH impudence missus Ladybug gasped as soon as she could speak That terrible Jennie Junebug didn t care whether I ever got my breath or not After bowling missus Ladybug over three times Miss Junebug had flown away leaving poor little missus Ladybug clinging to a blade of grass and wondering if she would be able to move again missus Ladybug had attempted to take Jennie Junebug to task She had intended to berate Jennie for devouring the leaves of Farmer Green s trees and to order her to stop such damage at once But Jennie Junebug hadn t allowed her to say much In her playful way she had knocked the breath out of missus Ladybug I must try some other plan thought missus Ladybug And I ll have to have help So she sent Miss Moth over to the meadow to find Freddie Firefly and ask him if he wouldn t come to the orchard because missus Ladybug wanted to talk with him He came He came at once for he saw Jennie Junebug looking for him And he was only too glad to escape her attentions He found her too rough to suit him missus Ladybug quickly explained her difficulty What shall I do she asked him I don t know he answered I can t do a thing with Jennie Junebug She knocks me down whenever I meet her She annoys me It s not so much myself I m thinking of said missus Ladybug It s Farmer Green s fruit trees that I m disturbed about Jennie Junebug eats the leaves I must put an end to that I have it Freddie Firefly exclaimed suddenly I ll ask her why she doesn t bump into Solomon Owl missus Ladybug didn t seem to care for his suggestion What good would that do she inquired Ah he said Solomon Owl wouldn t let her browbeat him He d soon cure her of her rude pranks Then please speak to her and to Solomon Owl at once that is if you dare to said missus Ladybug I m not afraid of him Freddie Firefly boasted He won t touch me He s a scared of my light And then Freddie Firefly flitted away He found Solomon Owl easily enough He had heard Solomon s Wha wha whoo ah booming from the edge of the woods And he soon persuaded Solomon to fly down into the meadow Solomon Owl sailed above the waving grass while Freddie Firefly spoke to Jennie Junebug She liked his scheme She thought it would be a great joke to bump into solemn Solomon Owl And for once she forgot to fling herself against Freddie Firefly Only a little while later she struck Solomon Owl with an awful thud To her huge surprise she fell headlong while he merely paused in his low flight Who struck me he bawled Jennie Junebug said Freddie Firefly Where is she now Solomon hooted If I find her I ll fix her Jennie Junebug heard everything he said She was lying hidden in the grass near by And she wouldn t have come out for anything I ll keep an eye out for her Solomon Owl announced I come to the meadow often a mousing Jennie Junebug kept still as a mouse herself until Solomon had gone back to the woods Then she stole forth from her hiding place showing a battered face to her friends Good by everybody she called I m going to move I m going way down to the end of the valley to live I m off already she added as she spread her wings Nobody ever saw Jennie Junebug on Farmer Green s place again And missus Ladybug was more than satisfied XVI PLAYING DEAD FARMER GREEN S apple trees looked green and flourishing Thanks to missus Ladybug and some of her relations there was scarcely an insect left on the leaves And since there was no more work to be done in the orchard just then and nothing for her to eat missus Ladybug settled among the raspberry bushes near the duck pond She said that they needed her attention One day she paused in her labors feeling that she had earned a few minutes rest And she dropped out of the bushes and strayed close to the water s edge A light breeze ruffled the surface of the duck pond into tiny waves What a terrible rough sea there is to day missus Ladybug murmured as she gazed upon the troubled water Perhaps if I cling to a tall grass stalk I can get a better view of it She soon found a stalk that grew high above all the rest Crawling to the very top of it missus Ladybug was able to look far out over the face of the pond Goodness she said to herself I m glad I m not out there in a ship A few moments later she happened to glance down near the shore And there to her horror she beheld a frog He was not a big frog On the contrary he was the tiniest frog that missus Ladybug had ever seen He was sitting on a lily pad singing with a small shrill voice which sounded exactly as if you were tapping two marbles together Now missus Ladybug had all her life stood in great fear of frogs She didn t dare move as she gazed at this one with eyes that popped almost out of her head He was a brownish person with a yellow throat which he puffed out like a bag as he sang And his skin was so rough that missus Ladybug shuddered as she looked at it Her own was very very smooth All at once the frog looked up and spied missus Ladybug staring at him She would have shrieked had she been able to Then missus Ladybug did the thing that she always did whenever she had a great fright She played dead She pulled her feet under her body out of sight and stuck motionless to the grass stalk Nothing happened And she was about to take another sly look at the frog when something moved the stalk of grass It was only the wind But missus Ladybug didn t know that She was sure that the frog had touched it Then missus Ladybug played her next trick She let go of the stalk and dropped to the ground where she lay upon her side as if she would never move again Once more she kept quite still And since nobody disturbed her after a time she opened her eyes She found herself looking straight into those of the tiny frog who still sat upon his lily pad in the duck pond missus Ladybug shut her eyes instantly She only hoped that the frog hadn t noticed her action XVII A BRAVE GENTLEMAN missus LADYBUG didn t know that the frog she saw was a very timid fellow His name was mister Cricket Frog He liked to sit on a lily pad and sing And his singing sounded a good deal like the music that Chirpy Cricket made In fact that was the reason for his odd name mister Cricket Frog had a trick not unlike the one that missus Ladybug herself played upon him Whenever a fish or any other enemy came near him if he hadn t time to hide in the mud at the bottom of the pond mister Cricket Frog played dead He would float in the water as if lifeless until his enemy had gone off about his business He was so timid this mister Cricket Frog that when he saw a stranger he would sometimes play dead And that was exactly what happened when he caught sight of missus Ladybug as she clung to the grass stalk near the edge of the duck pond and stared at him Of course missus Ladybug didn t know all this When she shut her eyes and pulled her feet under her body she wasn t aware that mister Cricket Frog was just as alarmed as she was Having closed her eyes she couldn t see him jump into the water and float She couldn t see him climb out upon the lily pad again and gaze at her Now the moment missus Ladybug looked at the frog the second time he took fright anew Once more he sprang from his seat Once more he floated like a chip upon the surface of the pond Once more he crawled back to his seat after he had made up his mind that the danger had passed So they played dead for a long time both missus Ladybug and mister Cricket Frog And if he hadn t at last made up his mind that she was afraid of him they might still be trying to fool each other Pardon me madam mister Cricket Frog called to missus Ladybug I see you re a bit timid I assure you I shall not harm you At that missus Ladybug opened her eyes and looked at him Slowly she thrust her feet out from under her body And then she tried her wings They were as good as ever Her fall had not injured them You gave me a terrible fright missus Ladybug told him mister Cricket Frog was very bold now Why were you afraid of me he asked her Do I look fierce he inquired with a hopeful smile as if he hoped that he did but scarcely dared think so I m afraid of all frogs missus Ladybug explained Now there s Ferdinand Frog A rascal mister Cricket Frog cried But madam I m not in the least like him I wouldn t hurt you In fact I d protect you His words pleased missus Ladybug She said that thereafter she should always feel safe with him in the neighborhood mister Cricket Frog bowed gallantly with his hand on his heart And missus Ladybug went away without guessing that he had himself played dead because he had been in terror of her What a brave gentleman he is missus Ladybug murmured XVIII A MYSTERY THERE was one thing that missus Ladybug dreaded more than any other That was fire The slightest whiff of smoke sent her into a flutter of alarm The sight of a blaze made her almost frantic Perhaps missus Ladybug s neighbors more than she were to be blamed for her fear Some of them had an unkind way of frightening her When they found her a bit too prying with her countless questions about this that and the other matter that did not concern her they said to her Aren t you worried missus Ladybug What if your house were on fire Wouldn t your children burn Such questions never failed to send missus Ladybug hurrying away After a while people began to wonder where missus Ladybug went when she dashed away like that Nobody seemed to know where she lived They supposed that she must fly to her home wherever it was To everybody s surprise missus Ladybug appeared to want to keep the site of her house a secret from all her friends When they asked her point blank where her house was she always pretended not to hear the question and left them Or she would begin to ask questions of her own choosing without answering theirs Humph said some people missus Ladybug likes to pry into our affairs She wants to know all about our business And when she learns anything about anybody else she can t rest until she has told it to the whole neighborhood The more missus Ladybug s friends thought about her house the harder they tried to discover its whereabouts Sometimes they even mentioned fire to her and then tried to follow her when she hurried off But she always managed to give them the slip before she had gone far Now and then somebody or other thought he had found missus Ladybug s house But in the end somebody else was sure to prove that he was mistaken Once Freddie Firefly announced with great pride that at last he knew where missus Ladybug was rearing her family Her house he explained is in a hole in the ground in the meadow And that night he led Miss Mehitable Moth to the spot lighting the way with his flickering gleams She soon pointed out his mistake He had led her to the doorway of the Bumblebee family who were all sound asleep inside their crowded house After that Freddie Firefly had to listen to a good many titters from his friends The idea they would say missus Ladybug must have a much bigger house than the Bumblebee family s She couldn t squeeze her children into such small quarters as theirs Why she has more children than she can count XIX THE DINNER BELL THERE was great excitement in Farmer Green s orchard The neighbors came a flying and a running and a crawling from all directions And little missus Ladybug was the cause of the hurly burly She had appeared with a strange flaring object hanging by a cord from her waist if she could be said to have a waist The queer dangling thing had a handle at its upper end And when missus Ladybug moved a jingling jangling sound might have been heard In no time at all a crowd had gathered around her And some of the more curious and ill bred pointed at whatever it was that puzzled them What s that they asked missus Ladybug Strange to say she seemed pleased with the stir that she had made It s a dinner bell she explained They gazed at it in wonder until at last somebody spoke up and demanded What s it for To give the alarm with she replied What alarm chimed a chorus of voices high and low missus Ladybug smiled an odd sort of smile as she answered The fire alarm of course Everybody s always talking fire to me It makes me frightfully uneasy There s so little one can do alone in case of fire But now she added now when anyone says Fire I m going to ring this bell with all my might Well people didn t know what to say then Later however they gathered about in groups and talked a good deal about missus Ladybug and her dinner bell Miss Moth said that she feared missus Ladybug would disturb her rest if she rang the bell in the daytime when Miss Moth was accustomed to sleep Buster Bumblebee hoped missus Ladybug wouldn t ring it at night because he had a short enough night s sleep as it was with the family trumpeter waking everybody in the house about dawn And Freddie Firefly exclaimed that it would be very annoying to him if missus Ladybug gave the alarm of fire whenever she saw his flickering gleams on pleasant evenings in the meadow If others were troubled missus Ladybug herself was much pleased by her dinner bell She liked to hear it tinkle as she worked She said it was a cheerful sound and so long as she wore it she never needed to worry about being lost It was as good as a cowbell for letting the world know one s whereabouts There was only one thing that annoyed her Since she hung the bell from her waist nobody had mentioned fire to her Nobody had said a word about her children s burning It seemed as if none of her neighbors wanted her to sound a fire alarm And if there was anything that would have given her joy it would have been to seize the handle of her bell and ring it madly There were even some people that complained of the tinkle it made among the apple trees Peppery Polly Bumblebee laughed at them You ve brought this trouble upon yourselves she told them How can you expect missus Ladybug to keep the tongue of the bell still She can t even keep her own tongue from wagging No doubt Peppery Polly knew what she was talking about She had a very sharp tongue herself XX FIRE FIRE THE whole countryside was dry It hadn t rained for weeks The grass was turning brown The water in the river was low And Broad Brook was no more than a narrow trickle Every morning the sun rose streaming hot to beat down upon Pleasant Valley all day long until it sank a round red ball behind Blue Mountain each night At last one afternoon Farmer Green and the hired man started for the woods on a run They had seen a wisp of smoke curling up from the tree tops And they knew that the woods were on fire There was a high wind that day And if they hadn t worked lively there s no telling how far the fire would have spread As it was glowing bits came sailing down from the hill and settled in the valley But luckily they did no damage At least no other fire had started anywhere when the men came home from the woods and said that all was safe again Some of the small folk that lived in the fields knew what was going on But missus Ladybug never guessed that there had been a fire She was so busy working among the apple trees that she hadn t noticed any unusual stir And no one took the trouble to tell her about it Everyone had put thoughts of fire out of his mind when along toward evening a loud clanging rang out upon the air What s that people asked one another And all at once somebody shouted It s missus Ladybug s dinner bell Far and wide through orchard garden and meadow the neighbors took up the cry Fire Fire missus Ladybug s ringing the alarm Her house is on fire Back and forth they hurried trying to find missus Ladybug At last they told one another at last we re going to find out where her house is And they did At least they soon discovered missus Ladybug standing beside a blazing dwelling near the pasture fence With all her hands and she had several she was ringing her bell furiously We ll help you her friends all cried Don t worry missus Ladybug We ll have the fire out soon Be calm But there was nothing they could do The fire raged so fiercely that they couldn t get near enough to it to fight it And before long it had burned itself out There was nothing left of the house but ashes What a pity said missus Ladybug s neighbors It was a fine big house And then some one cried What about the children Where are they Nobody knew If missus Ladybug did she was too overcome to speak People looked very solemn They hoped her children hadn t burned And then then mister Meadow Mouse came running up all out of breath Sakes alive he screamed My house is ruined I wouldn t have had this happen for anything But it doesn t matter for I can easily build another missus Ladybug s neighbors crowded about her all asking the same question Wasn t this your house No she admitted No it wasn t And then she made an astonishing confession I ve never owned a house she said I ve never had one in all my life I can t have a house I couldn t get one that was big enough I have so many children that I don t know what to do said little missus Ladybug XXI PLANS FOR WINTER IT was almost fall The nights and some of the days were chilly Those that had spent the whole summer out of doors began to think about where they should pass the winter Yet everybody was amazed by the news that missus Ladybug spread broadcast She said that she expected soon to go into winter quarters Humph cried Daddy Longlegs wife when she heard what missus Ladybug was saying She never had any quarters so far as anyone knows missus Ladybug hasn t been able to tear herself away from the orchard long enough to live anywhere except in the apple trees It was plain that Daddy Longlegs wife didn t believe what missus Ladybug was telling her neighbors And there were many more folk that agreed with her Little missus Ladybug smiled a knowing smile when she heard what her friends thought They ll see They ll see she said I m going to spend the winter in the biggest and finest house on this farm That was all she would tell She wouldn t breathe another word about her plans And naturally every one became very curious There wasn t a soul that wasn t agog to know what missus Ladybug intended to do The neighbors asked her begged her teased her some even threatened her But she declined to answer She said that if she told where she expected to pass the cold months everybody would want to go to the same place and maybe there wouldn t be any room left for her Perhaps some of her friends had intended to follow her into her winter quarters Anyhow many of them looked guilty when she made that remark And a few of them looked angry and declared that missus Ladybug was selfish If the house is as big as she claims it is it ought to hold a few extra guests without being crowded they grumbled Guests said missus Ladybug guests should always wait for an invitation Have you had one Buster Bumblebee asked her missus Ladybug did not answer his question Most people thought Buster Bumblebee a stupid fellow Many people paid little heed to him Yet strange to say he often hit the nail on the head so to speak And this time he made missus Ladybug somewhat uncomfortable She had had no invitation to spend the winter in the fine big house But she didn t care to have her neighbors know that There s just one thing to do Buster Bumblebee decided I ll ask the Carpenter Bee if he s building a house for her So he went to the big poplar by the brook where the Carpenter Bee lived And that mild person himself sawdust covered as usual answered Buster s knock at his door Are you building a house for missus Ladybug Buster Bumblebee inquired No said the Carpenter We couldn t agree She wanted me to work twelve hours a day And I wanted to work twenty four I told her I must have some time to rest But she couldn t see things as I did Buster Bumblebee was puzzled I don t understand he said The Carpenter kindly made matters clear to him I rest only when I m working he explained XXII missus LADYBUG LEAVES THE Carpenter Bee who lived in the big poplar by the brook wasn t building a house for missus Ladybug That skillful woodworker hadn t been able to agree with her so he told Buster Bumblebee Furthermore he knew nothing of missus Ladybug s present plans as to where she was going to spend the winter Nor did anybody else It was all a great mystery And missus Ladybug seemed to enjoy it far more than her neighbors did She was the only person that could have solved it for them And she wouldn t At the same time she took delight in talking about her winter quarters as she called the place where she intended to live during cold weather It will be cozy and warm there she often remarked to her callers of whom she had huge numbers For there was scarcely a person in the orchard or the garden that didn t burn with curiosity to know more about the fine big house into which missus Ladybug expected to move My winter quarters will be wind proof missus Ladybug told them And that speech set them all to guessing again Almost everybody said then that she was going to live underground I shall not feel a drop of rain not even during the January thaw missus Ladybug went on And then everybody had to begin guessing all over again for rain drops were sure to trickle into an underground house during a warm spell You re going to live in a pumpkin cried Buster Bumblebee And all the neighbors even missus Ladybug laughed when they heard that Buster knew of an old tune called The Bumblebee in the Pumpkin and he cried with some heat that he could think of no reason why there shouldn t be A Ladybug in a Pumpkin I told you my house was big the biggest one on the farm missus Ladybug reminded him Ah Chirpy Cricket exclaimed Now I know You re going to live in the haystack A haystack is cozy and warm it s wind proof it sheds water and there s nothing bigger anywhere It really seemed as if Chirpy Cricket had solved the great mystery He s guessed the riddle people said You might as well admit now missus Ladybug that you re going to spend the winter in Farmer Green s haystack But missus Ladybug dashed their hopes You re wrong she told her friends And if to night s as nippy as last night was perhaps you ll find out to morrow where I m going For I don t care to freeze my toes here in the orchard That night it was colder than ever And the next day missus Ladybug went all around the orchard and the garden bidding people good by Still she wouldn t tell where she was going And if Daddy Longlegs hadn t happened to stroll around the cherry tree outside Farmer Green s chamber window that afternoon nobody would have known where missus Ladybug went But Daddy Longlegs saw her And he hastened to spread the news missus Ladybug has gone to spend the winter in the farmhouse XXIII BACK AGAIN SOMEHOW missus Ladybug s friends missed her The orchard seemed quite a different place after she vanished inside the farmhouse to stay there all winter long In spite of her sharp tongue and her prying ways people discovered now that she was gone that they had liked missus Ladybug more than they knew While she was with them in the orchard they had often wished she wouldn t ask so many questions But now the days seemed very long without missus Ladybug to inquire how and why and when and where And then then a rumor flashed from lip to lip all the way across the garden and the orchard and the meadow missus Ladybug is back again She didn t stay in the farmhouse a week And sure enough the rumor proved to be true missus Ladybug looking rather foolish appeared in her old haunts among the apple trees She acted as if something had occurred to upset her And though she seemed glad to be greeted by all her old companions she didn t want them to ask her a single question as to why she hadn t spent the whole winter instead of only a few days of early fall in Farmer Green s house If she thought her neighbors weren t going to question her she was sadly mistaken Only a little while before they had asked her a thousand and one questions about where she was going to live during the winter And now they were all just as curious to know why she had returned But this time they asked her a thousand and two questions You couldn t say that her answers weren t satisfying because she didn t make any answers at all Of course things couldn t go on like that forever People had to know what had changed missus Ladybug s plans And in order to persuade the stubborn lady to explain matters a few of her friends hinted that they expected they would have to go to Farmer Green himself and learn the truth You may ask him if you wish missus Ladybug told them But it won t do you any good He can t tell you what happened because he doesn t know himself Maybe the farmhouse was cold Chirpy Cricket suggested missus Ladybug made no comment on that remark Perhaps the roof leaked said Daddy Longlegs Still no sign from missus Ladybug She found that the farmhouse wasn t wind proof said Daddy Longlegs wife And missus Ladybug didn t deny it nor did she say that that was so Then Buster Bumblebee made one of his blundering speeches It was a short winter anyhow he said missus Ladybug s neighbors couldn t help tittering And somehow their amusement stung her into telling the truth about the whole affair right then and there missus Green and I didn t get on well together she confessed XXIV missus GREEN S MISTAKE missus LADYBUG spoke at last Her listeners crowded close about her jostling one another in their eagerness to hear every word she said For missus Ladybug was recounting her adventures at the farmhouse I flew in through an open window missus Ladybug began And she heaved a deep sigh as if the telling of the tale was costing her much pain I said nothing to anybody she explained because I didn t wish to trouble the family I knew I could find my way about the house after a little And it wasn t long before I had discovered the stairway I didn t walk on the stairs for fear there might be mud on my feet said missus Ladybug I didn t walk but flew up to the second floor and went into the first chamber I saw There was a fine big closet off that room The door leading into it was ajar so I had no trouble slipping inside it And there high up on a broad shelf I picked out the very spot where I could have spent the winter with every comfort in the world At this point missus Ladybug was overcome by her feelings for a few moments But the company waited politely until she could go on with her story She soon continued All went well said missus Ladybug all went well until one day this morning to be exact missus Green opened the closet door and began to brush and sweep and wipe and dust I heard her say that she was doing her fall cleaning And of course that pleased me for I was glad to learn that she was a neat housekeeper And then here missus Ladybug s voice broke slightly and then the first thing I knew she spied me and cried Ah ha A Carpet Bug The next instant she whisked me off the shelf with a brush Of course I played dead the moment she touched me And I fell into the dustpan and never so much as wriggled a toe Soon afterward missus Green set the dustpan beside the window which she had already opened That was my chance I seized it I flew out of the window And here I am missus Ladybug s listeners shook their heads in sympathy You had a narrow escape they told her It s a wonder you got away Yes said missus Ladybug And I m glad now that that window was open But for a moment I didn t much care what became of me To think that anybody should mistake me for a Carpet Bug missus Green ought to know that the Carpet Bug family are covered with black white and red scales Ugh missus Ladybug shuddered She was smooth and shiny herself So it wasn t strange that she should have felt insulted Anyhow she added missus Green is the loser Toward spring I would have kept her house plants free from insects But now of course she ll have to do that herself Well said the neighbors or words to this effect we re glad to see you again And now tell us where do you expect to spend the winter I ll let you decide that missus Ladybug replied THE END TUCK ME IN TALES Trademark Registered By ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY AUTHOR OF THE SLEEPY TIME TALES and SLUMBER TOWN TALES Colored
