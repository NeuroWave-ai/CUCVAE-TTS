none	none	seventeen ninety one was not only a musical genius but was also one of the pre eminent geniuses of the Western world He defined in his music a system of musical thought and an entire state of mind that were unlike any previously experienced A true child prodigy he began composing at age five and rapidly developed his unmistakable style by eighteen he was composing works capable of altering the mind states of entire civilizations Indeed he and his predecessor Bach accomplished the Olympian feat of adding to the human concepts of civility and civilization So these two were not just musical geniuses but geniuses of the humanities Mozart s music IS civilization It encompasses all that is humane about an idealized civilization And it probably was Mozart s main purpose to create and propagate a concept of a great civilization through his music He wanted to show his fellow Europeans with their garbage polluted citystreets their violent mono maniacal leaders and their stifling non humane bureaucracies new ideas on how to run their civilizations properly He wanted them to hear and feel a sense of civilized movement of the musical expressions of man moving as he would if upholding the highest values of idealized societies One need only listen to the revolutionary opening bars of his famous Eine Kleine Nachtmusik to see this He was an extremely sophisticated and complex man His letters reveal him as remarkably creative fascinated by the arts principled religious and devoted to his father He had an energetic personality that was almost completely devoid of any cynicism pessimism or discouragement from creating music While rumors suggest that he was a lascivious individual there is no evidence of this at all in his letters Quite the contrary the evidence seems overwhelmingly to suggest the opposite and that Mozart may not have had any relations with women except with his own wife He was not as shrewd as he was civilized however He was peculiarly lax about profiting from his history changing music His promoters constantly short changed him He died nearly penniless and in debt and at his death at age thirty five an apathetic public took little notice of this man who had done so much in service to civilization He was buried in an unmarked pauper s grave with few mourners After his death the bones of this great paragon of self sacrifice for the sake of improving civilization were dug up and disposed of His grave was then re used and to this day no one knows where his bones lie Perhaps they are in a catacomb somewhere in a huge bone pile containing thousands of anonymous cadavers But the sounds he heard in his head live on stimulating millions in elevators doctors offices train terminals concert halls and myriad other places to be more civilized assuming that they pay attention to the music EDITOR S NOTE The purpose and scope of this little book will be obvious to the reader from even a cursory glance at its contents It is in a way an autobiography of Mozart written without conscious purpose and for that reason peculiarly winning illuminating and convincing The outward things in Mozart s life are all but ignored in it but there is a frank and full disclosure of the great musician s artistic intellectual and moral character made in his own words The Editor has not only taken the trouble to revise the work of the German author and compiler but for reasons which seemed to him imperative has also made a new translation of all the excerpts Most of the translations of Mozart s letters which have found their way into the books betray want of familiarity with the idioms and colloquialisms employed by Mozart as well as understanding of his careless contradictory and sprawling epistolary style Some of the intimacy of that style the new translation seeks to preserve but the purpose has chiefly been to make the meaning plain

none	none	New York June seven nineteen oh five THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MOZART Mozart What a radiance streams from the name Bright and pure as the light of the sun Mozart s music greets us We pronounce his name and behold the youthful artist is before us the merry light hearted smile upon his features which belongs only to true and naive genius It is impossible to imagine an aged Mozart an embittered and saddened Mozart glowering gloomily at a wicked world which is doing its best to make his lot still more burdensome a Mozart whose music should reflect such painful moods Mozart was a Child of the Sun Filled with a humor truly divine he strolled unconstrainedly through a multitude of cares like Prince Tamino through his fantastic trials Music was his talisman his magic flute with which he could exorcise all the petty terrors that beset him Has such a man and artist one who was completely resolved in his works and therefore still stands bodily before us with all his glorious qualities after the lapse of a century has Mozart still something to say to us who have just stepped timidly into a new century separated by another from that of the composer Much very much Many prophets have arisen since Mozart s death two of them have moved us profoundly with their evangel One of them knew all the mysteries and Nature took away his hearing lest he proclaim too much We followed him into all the depths of the world of feeling The other shook us awake and placed us in the hurly burly of national life and striving pointing to his own achievements he said If you wish it you have now a German art The one was Beethoven the other Wagner Because their music demands of us that we share with it its experiences and struggles they are the guiding spirits of a generation which has grown up in combat and is expecting an unknown world of combat beyond the morning mist of the new century But we are in the case of the man in the fairy tale who could not forget the merry tune of the forest bird which he had heard as a boy We gladly permit ourselves to be led occasionally out of the rude realities that surround us into a beautiful world that knows no care but lies forever bathed in the sunshine of cloudless happiness a world in which every loveliness of which fancy has dreamed has taken life and form It is because of this that we make pilgrimages to the masterpieces of the plastic arts that we give heed to the speech of Schiller listen to the music of Mozart When wearied by the stress of life we gladly hie to Mozart that he may tell us stories of that land of beauty and convince us that there are other and better occupations than the worries and combats of the fleeting hour This is what Mozart has to tell us today In spite of Wagner he has an individual mission to fulfill which will keep him immortal That of which Lessing convinces us only with expenditure of many words sounds clear and irresistible in The Magic Flute the longing for light and day Therefore there is something like the glory of daybreak in the tones of Mozart s opera it is wafted towards us like the morning breeze which dispels the shadows and invokes the sun Mozart remains ever young one reason is because death laid hold of him in the middle of his career While all the world was still gazing expectantly upon him he vanished from the earth and left no hope deceived His was the enviable fate of a Raphael Schiller and Korner As the German tis Schumann s utterance thinks of Beethoven when he speaks the word symphony so the name of Mozart in his mind is associated with the conception of things youthful bright and sunny Schumann was fully conscious of a purpose when he called out Do not put Beethoven in the hands of young people too early refresh and strengthen them with the fresh and lusty Mozart Another time he writes Does it not seem as if Mozart s works become fresher and fresher the oftener we hear them The more we realize that Wagner places a heavy and intoxicating draught before us the more we shall appreciate the precious mountain spring which laves us in Mozart s music and the less willing we shall be to permit any opportunity to pass unimproved which offers us the crystal cup In the mind of Goethe genius was summed up in the name of Mozart In a prophetic ecstasy he spoke the significant words What else is genius than that productive power through which deeds arise worthy of standing in the presence of God and Nature and which for this reason bear results and are lasting All the creations of Mozart are of this class within them there is a generative force which is transplanted from generation to generation and is not likely soon to be exhausted or devoured CHIPS FROM THE WORKSHOP one If one has the talent it pushes for utterance and torments one it will out and

none	none	in a letter of congratulation to his father who was born on November fourteen seventeen nineteen Despite his assertion Mozart was an admirable dancer and passionately devoted to the sport So says Herr Kerst obviously misconceiving Mozart s words It is plain to me that the composer had the classic definition of the dance in mind when he said that he was no dancer The dance of which he was thinking was that described by Charles Kingsley A dance in which every motion was a word and rest as eloquent as motion in which every attitude was a fresh motive for a sculptor of the purest school and the highest physical activity was manifested not as in coarse pantomime in fantastic bounds and unnatural distortions but in perpetual delicate modulations of a stately and self sustained grace H E K three The poets almost remind me of the trumpeters with their tricks of handicraft If we musicians were to stick as faithfully to our rules which were very good as long as we had no better we should make as worthless music as they make worthless books Vienna October thirteen seventeen eighty one to his father He is writing about the libretto of Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail by Stephanie The trumpeters at the time still made use of certain flourishes which had been traditionally preserved in their guild four I have spared neither care nor labor to produce something excellent for Prague Moreover it is a mistake to think that the practice of my art has become easy to me I assure you dear friend no one has given so much care to the study of composition as I There is scarcely a famous master in music whose works I have not frequently and diligently studied A remark to Conductor Kucharz in Prague who led the rehearsals for Don Giovanni in seventeen eighty seven five They are indeed the fruit of long and painstaking labor but the hope which some of my friends aroused in me that my work would be rewarded at least in part has given me courage and the flattering belief that these my offspring will some day bring me comfort From the dedication of the Six Quartets to Haydn in seventeen eighty five The quartets were sent back to the publisher Artaria from Italy because they contained so many misprints The unfamiliar chords and dissonances were looked upon as printers errors Grassalkowitsch a Hungarian prince thought his musicians were playing faultily in some of these passages and when he learned differently he tore the music in pieces six I can not deny but must confess that I shall be glad when I receive my release from this place Giving lessons here is no fun you must work yourself pretty tired and if you don t give a good many lessons you will make but little money You must not think that it is laziness no but it goes counter to my genius counter to my mode of life You know that so to speak I am wrapped up in music that I practice it all day long that I like to speculate study consider All this is prevented by my mode of life here I shall of course have some free hours but they will be so few that they will be necessary more for recuperation than work Paris July thirty one seventeen

none	none	The lovely aria is No two hundred ninety four in Kochel s catalogue The Bach referred to was Johann Christian the London Bach seventeen I haven t a single quiet hour here I can not write except at night and consequently can not get up early One is not always in the mood for writing Of course I could scribble all day long but these things go out into the world and I want not to be ashamed of myself when I see my name on them And then as you know I become stupid as soon as I am obliged to write for an instrument that I can not endure Occasionally for the sake of a change I have composed something else pianoforte duets with the violin and a bit of the mass Mannheim February fourteen seventeen seventy eight to his father Mozart was ill disposed toward the pianoforte at the time His love for Aloysia Weber occupied the most of his attention and time eighteen Herewith I am sending you a Prelude and a three voiced Fugue Kochel No three hundred ninety four It is awkwardly written the prelude must come first and the fugue follow The reason for its appearance is because I had made the fugue and wrote it out while I was thinking out the prelude Vienna April twenty seventeen eighty two to his sister Marianne Here Mozart gives us evidence of his manner of composing he worked out his compositions completely in his mind and was then able even after considerable time had elapsed to write them down in which proceeding nothing could disturb him In the case before us while engaged in the more or less mechanical labor of transcription he thought out a new composition Concerning the fugue and its origin he continues to gossip in the same letter nineteen The cause of this fugue seeing the light of this world is my dear Constanze Baron von Swieten to whom I go every Sunday let me carry home all the works of Handel and Sebastian Bach after I had played them through for him Constanze fell in love with the fugues as soon as she had heard them she doesn t want to hear anything but fugues especially those of Handel and Bach Having often heard me improvise fugues she asked me if I had never written any down and when I said no she gave me a good scolding for not being willing to write the most beautiful things in music and did not cease her begging until I had composed one for her and so it came about I purposely wrote the indication Andante maestoso so that it should not be played too rapidly for unless a fugue is played slowly the entrance of the subject will not be distinctly and clearly heard and the piece will be ineffective As soon as I find time and opportunity I shall write five more Vienna April twenty seventeen eighty two to his sister Marianne Cf No ninety three Mozart s remark that he carried home all the works of Handel and Bach must of course be read as meaning all that were in print at the time H E K twenty I have no small amount of work ahead of me By Sunday week I must have my opera arranged for military band or somebody will be ahead of me and carry away the profits and I must also write a new symphony How will that be possible You have no idea how difficult it is to make such an arrangement so that it shall be adapted to wind instruments and yet lose nothing of its effect Well well I shall have to do the work at night Vienna July twenty seventeen eighty two to his father who had asked for a symphony for the Hafner family in Salzburg The opera referred to is Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail twenty one I was firmly resolved to write the Adagio for the clock maker at once so that I might drop a few ducats into the hands of my dear little wife and I began it but was unlucky enough because I hate such work not to be able to finish it I write at it every day but have to drop it because it bores me If the reason for its existence were not such a momentous one rest assured I should let the thing drop I hope however to force it through in time Ah yes if it were a large clock work with a sound like an organ I d be glad to do it but as it is the thing is made up of tiny pipes only which sound too shrill and childish for me Frankfort on the Main October three seventeen ninety to his wife A Piece for an Organ in a Clock Kochel s catalogue No five hundred ninety four It was probably ordered by Count Deym for his Wax works Museum on the occasion of the death of the famous Field Marshal Laudon The dominant mood of sorrow prevails in the first movement the Allegro is in Handel s style CONCERNING THE OPERA When he was twenty two years old Mozart wrote to his father I am strongly filled with the desire to write an opera Often does he speak of this ambition It was in fact his true and individual field as the symphony was that of Beethoven He took counsel with his father by letter touching many details in his earlier operas wherefore we are advised about their origin and what is more to the purpose about Mozart s fine aesthetic judgment His four operatic masterpieces are imperishable and a few words about them are in place particularly since Mozart has left numerous and interesting comments on Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail This first German opera he composed with the confessed purpose of substituting a work designed for the national lyric stage for the conventional and customary Italian opera Despite its Hispano Turkish color the work is so ingenuous so German in feeling and above all so full of German humor that the success was unexampled and Mozart could write to his father The people are daft over my opera Here at the very outset Mozart s humor the golden one of all the gifts with which Mother Nature had endowed him was called into play With this work German comic opera took its beginning As has been remarked although it has been imitated it has never been surpassed in its musically comic effects The delightfully Falstaffian figure of Osmin most ingeniously characterized in the music will create merriment for all time and the opera acquires a new personal and peculiarly amiable charm from the fact that we are privileged to see in the love joy of Belmont and Constanze an image of that of the young composer and his Stanzerl After Die Entfuhrung seventeen eighty two came Le Nozze di Figaro seventeen eighty six Don Giovanni seventeen eighty seven and Die Zauberflote seventeen ninety one It would be a vain task to attempt to establish any internal relationship between these works Mozart was not like Wagner a strong personality capable of devoting a full sum of vital force to the carrying out of a chosen and approved principle As is generally the case with geniuses he was a child a child led by momentary conditions moreover a child of the rococo period There is therefore no cause of wonderment in the fact that Italian texts are again used in Le Nozze di Figaro and Don Giovanni and that another but this time a complete German opera does not appear until we reach Die Zauberflote Nevertheless it is possible to note a development towards a climax in the four operas respecting Mozart s conception of the world It has been denied that there is a single red thread in Mozart s life work Nevertheless our method of study will disclose to us an ever growing view of human lift and a deeper and deeper glimpse into the emotional and intellectual life of man his aims and destiny From the almost commonplace conditions of Die Entfuhrung where a rascal sings in the best of humor of first beheading and then hanging a man we reach a plane in The Marriage of Figaro in which despite the refinement and mitigation of Beaumarchais s indictment we feel the revolutionary breeze freshly blowing In Don Giovanni we see the individual set up in opposition to God and the world in order that he fulfill his destiny or live out his life as the popular phrase goes today Here the tremendous tragedy which lies in the story has received a musical expression quite without parallel notwithstanding the moderation exercised in the employment of means In Die Zauberflote finally we observe the clarification which follows the fermentation Here we breathe the pure clear atmosphere of heaven the atmosphere within which he can live who has freed himself from selfish desire thus gaining internal peace and who recognizes his ego only in the happiness and welfare of others twenty two I have an unspeakable desire to compose another opera In Italy one can acquire more honor and credit with an opera than with a hundred concerts in Germany and I am the happier because I can compose which after all is my one joy and passion I am beside myself as soon as I hear anybody talk about an opera sit in a theatre or hear singing Munich October eleven seventeen seventy seven to his father reporting an expectation of making a position for himself in Italy twenty three I beg of you do your best that we may go to Italy You know my greatest longing to write operas Do not forget my wish to write operas I am envious of every man who composes one I could almost weep from chagrin whenever I hear or see an aria But Italian not German seria not buffa Mannheim February two seventeen seventy eight to his father Mozart wanted to go with the Weber family he was in love with Aloysia his future sister in law to Italy while his father was desirous that he should go to Paris twenty four I am strongly possessed by the desire to write an opera French rather than German but Italian rather than either German or French Wendling s associates are all of the opinion that my compositions would please extraordinarily in Paris One thing is certain I would not fear the test As you know I am able to assimilate and imitate pretty much all styles of composition Mannheim February seven seventeen seventy eight to his father Wendling was a flautist in Mannheim twenty five I assure you that if I get a commission to compose an opera I shall not be frightened True the French language is of the devil s own making and I fully appreciate all the difficulties that composers have encountered but I feel myself as capable of overcoming them as any other composer Au contraire when I convince myself that all is well with my opera I feel as if my body were afire my hands and feet tremble with desire to make the Frenchman value and fear the German Why is no Frenchman ever commissioned to write a grand opera Why must it always be a foreigner In my case the most unendurable thing would be the singers Well I m ready I shall begin no dickerings but if I am challenged I shall know how to defend myself But I should prefer to get along without a duel I do not like to fight with dwarfs Paris July thirty one seventeen seventy eight to his father twenty six Do you imagine that I would write an opera comique in the same manner as an opera seria There must be as little learning and seriousness in an opera buffa as there must be much of these elements in an opera seria but all the more of playfulness and merriment I am not responsible for the fact that there is a desire also to hear comic music in an opera seria the difference is sharply drawn here I find that the buffoon has not been banished from music and in this respect the French are right Vienna June sixteen seventeen eighty one to his father Mozart draws the line of demarcation sharply between tragedy and comedy in opera Shakespeare has taught us to accept an infusion of the comic element in plays of a serious cast but Shakespeare was an innovator a Romanticist and measured by old standards his dramas are irregular The Italians who followed classic models for a reason amply explained by the genesis of the art form rigorously excluded comedy from serious operas except as intermezzi until they hit upon a third classification which they called opera semiseria in which a serious subject was enlivened with comic episodes Our dramatic tastes being grounded in Shakespeare we should be inclined to put down Don Giovanni as a musical tragedy or haunted by the Italian terminology as opera semiseria but Mozart calls it opera buffa more in deference to the librettist s work I fancy than his own How to Listen to Music page two hundred twenty one H E K twenty seven In opera willy nilly poetry must be the obedient daughter of music Why do Italian operas please everywhere even in Paris as I have been a witness despite the wretchedness of their librettos Because in them music rules and compels us to forget everything else All the more must an opera please in which the plot is well carried out and the words are written simply for the sake of the music and not here and there to please some miserable rhyme which God knows adds nothing to a theatrical representation but more often harms it Verses are the most indispensable thing in music but rhymes for the sake of rhymes the most injurious Those who go to work so pedantically will assuredly come to grief along with the music It were best if a good composer who understands the stage and is himself able to suggest something and a clever poet could be united in one like a phoenix Again one must not fear the applause of the unknowing Vienna October thirteen seventeen eighty one to his father The utterance is notable as showing Mozart s belief touching the relationship between text and music he places himself in opposition to Gluck whose ideas were at a later day accepted by Wagner It was my intention to confine music to its true dramatic province of assisting poetical expression and of augmenting the interest of the fable without interrupting the action or chilling it with useless and superfluous ornaments for the office of music when joined to poetry seemed to me to resemble that of coloring in a correct and well disposed design where the lights and shades only seem to animate the figures without altering the outline Gluck in his dedication of Alceste to the Grand Duke of Tuscany The error in the genre of opera consists herein that a means of expression music has been made the end while the end of expression the drama has been made a means Wagner Opera and Drama H E K twenty eight Nota bene what has always seemed unnatural in an aria are the asides In speech one can easily and quickly throw in a few words in an aside but in an aria in which the words must be repeated the effect is bad Munich November eight seventeen eighty to his father Mozart had been invited to Munich to compose an opera Idomeneo Re di Creta for the carnival of seventeen eighty one In contradistinction to the observations touching poetry and music in the preceding paragraph this remark shows that he nevertheless had a sense of dramatic propriety He accepted the form as he found it but protested against the things which stood in the way of its vitalization H E K twenty nine The second duet will be cut out entirely more for the good than the harm of the opera You shall see for yourself if you read over the scene that it would be weakened and cooled by an aria or duet which moreover would be extremely annoying to the other actors who would have to stand around with nothing to do besides the magnanimous contest between Ilia and Idamante would become too long and therefore lose in value Munich November thirteen seventeen eighty to his father The reference is to the opera Idomeneo thirty It will be better to write a recitative under which the instruments can do some good work for in this scene which is to be the best in the whole opera there will be so much noise and confusion on the stage that an aria would cut but a sorry figure Moreover there will be a thunder storm which is not likely to cease out of respect for an aria and the effect of a recitative between two choruses will be incomparably better Munich November fifteen to his father Mozart was at work on Idomeneo thirty one Don t you think that the speech of the subterranean voice is too long Think it over carefully Imagine the scene on the stage The voice must be terrifying it must be impressive one must believe it real How can this be so if the speech is too long the length itself convincing the listener of the fictitiousness of the scene If the speech of the Ghost in Hamlet were not so long it would be more effective Vienna November twenty nine seventeen eighty to his father who had made the following suggestions respecting the opera Idomeneo Idamante and Ilia have a short quarrel near the close of the opera in a few words of recitative which is interrupted by a subterranean noise whereupon the oracle speaks also from the depths The voice and the accompaniment must be moving terrifying and most extraordinary it ought to make a masterpiece of harmony thirty two In a word far fetched or unusual words are always out of place in an agreeable aria moreover I should like to have the aria suggest only restfulness and satisfaction and if it consisted of only one part I should still be satisfied in fact I should prefer to have it so Munich December five seventeen eighty to his father Idomeneo is still the subject of discussion thirty three As to the matter of popularity be unconcerned there is music in my opera for all sorts of persons but none for long ears Munich December sixteen seventeen eighty to his father who had expressed a fear that Mozart would not write down to the level of his public On December eleven his father had written I recommend you not to think in your work only of the musical public but also of the unmusical You know that there are a hundred ignorant people for every ten true connoisseurs so do not forget what is called popular and tickle the long ears H E K thirty four I have had a good deal of trouble with him about the quartet The oftener I fancy it performed on the stage the more effective it seems to me and it has pleased all who have heard it on the pianoforte Raaff alone thinks it will make no effect He said to me in private Non c e da spianar la voce it is too curt As if we should not speak more than we sing in a quartet He has no understanding of such things I said to him simply My dear friend if I knew a single note which might be changed in this quartet I would change it at once but I have not been so completely satisfied with anything in the opera as I am with this quartet when you have heard it sung together you will talk differently I have done my best to fit you with the two arias will do it again with the third and hope to succeed but you must let the composer have his own way in trios and quartets Whereupon he was satisfied Recently he was vexed because of one of the words in his best aria rinvigorir and ringiovenir particularly vienmi a rinvigorir five i s It is true it is very unpleasant at the conclusion of an aria Munich December twenty seven seventeen eighty to his father Raaff was the principal singer in the opera Idomeneo which Mozart had been commissioned to write by the Elector for Munich The observation shows how capable Mozart was of appreciating foreign criticism thirty five My head and hands are so full of the third act that it would not be strange if I were myself transformed into a third act It has cost me more care than an entire opera for there is scarcely a scene in it which is not interesting The accompaniment for the subterranean voice consists of five voices only three trombones and two French horns which are placed at the point from which the voice proceeds At this moment the whole orchestra is silent Munich January three seventeen eighty one to his father whom in the same letter he invites to Munich to hear the opera thirty six After the chorus of mourning the King the populace everybody leave the stage and the next scene begins with the directions Idomeneo in ginochione nel tempio Idomeneus kneeling in the temple That will never do he must come with all his following That necessitates a march and I have composed a very simple one for two violins viola bass and two oboes which is to be played a mezza voce during which the King enters and the priests make the preparations for the sacrifice Then the King sinks on his knees and begins his prayer In Electra s recitative after the subterranean voice the word Partono they go should be written in I forgot to look at the copy made for the printer and do not know whether or how the direction has been written in It seems silly to me that everybody should hurry away only in order to leave Mademoiselle Electra alone Munich January three seventeen eighty one to his father thirty seven I am glad to compose the book The time is short it is true for it must be performed about the middle of September but the circumstances connected with the performances and a number of other purposes are of such a character that they enliven my spirits in such a degree that I hurry to my writing desk and remain seated there with great joy Vienna August one seventeen eighty one to his father The opera referred to is Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail The circumstances were the court festivals which were to celebrate the coming of the Russian Grand Duke from which Mozart as was his wont expected all manner of future benefits thirty eight As regards the work of Stephanie you are right of course but nevertheless the poetry is well fitted to the character of the stupid coarse and malicious Osmin I know full well that the style of the verse is none of the best but it has so adjusted itself to the musical thoughts which were promenading in my brain in advance that the lines had to please me and I will wager there will be no disappointment at the performance So far as the songs are concerned they are not to be despised Belmont s aria O wie angstlich could scarcely have been written better for music Vienna October thirteen seventeen eighty one to his father Stephanie was the author of the libretto of Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail thirty nine An aria has been written for Osmin in the first act You have seen only the beginning and end of it which must be effective the rage of Osmin is made ridiculous by the use of Turkish music In developing the aria I have given him Fischer a bass a chance to show his beautiful low tones The By the beard of the Prophet remains in the same tempo but has quicker notes and as his anger grows continually when one thinks that the aria is come to an end the Allegro assai must make the best kind of an effect when it enters in a different measure and key Here is the reason a man who is in such a violent rage oversteps all order all moderation he forgets himself and the music must do the same Inasmuch as the passions whether violent or not must never be carried in their expression to the verge of disgust and music even in the most awful situations must not offend the ear but always please consequently always remain music I have not chosen a key foreign to F i e the key of the aria but a related one not the nearest D minor but the more distant A minor You know how I have given expression to Belmont s aria O wie angstlich O wie feurig there is a suggestion of the beating heart the violins in octaves This is the favorite aria of all who have heard it of myself as well and is written right into the voice of Adamberger One can see the reeling and trembling one can see the heaving breast which is illustrated by a crescendo one hears the lispings and sighs expressed by the muted violins with flute in unison The Janizary chorus is as such all that could be asked short and jolly written to suit the Viennese Vienna September twenty six seventeen eighty one to his father Concerning the composition of Die Entfuhrung Mozart delivered himself at greater length and more explicitly than about any other opera From the above excerpt one can learn his notions touching musical characterization and delineation Turkish music or Janizary music is that in which the percussion effects of Oriental music are imitated music utilizing the large drum cymbals et cetera H E K forty The close will make a deal of noise and that is all that is necessary for the end of an act the noisier the better the shorter the better so that the people shall not get too cool to applaud Vienna September twenty six seventeen eighty one to his father The Trio at the end of the first act is the finale referred to forty one My opera is to be performed again next Friday but I have protested against it as I do not want it to be ridden to death at once The public I may say are daft about this opera It does a fellow good to receive such applause Vienna July twenty seven seventeen eighty two to his father forty two My opera was performed again yesterday this time at the request of Gluck Gluck paid me many compliments on it I am to dine with him tomorrow Vienna August seven seventeen eighty two to his father How Mozart and Gluck differed in principle on the relation between text and music the reader has already had an opportunity to learn H E K forty three The most necessary thing is that the whole be really comical then if possible there should be two equally good female parts one seria the other mezzo carattere but one must be as good as the other The third woman may be all buffa also all the men if necessary Vienna May seven seventeen eighty three to his father in Salzburg where the Abbe Varesco was to write an opera libretto forty four It would be a pity if I should have composed this music for nothing that is to say if no regard is to be shown for things that are absolutely essential Neither you nor Abbe Varesco nor I reflected that it will be a bad thing that the opera will be a failure in fact if neither of the principal women appears on the scene until the last minute but both are kept promenading on the bastion of the fortress I credit the audience with patience enough for one act but it would never endure the second It must not be Vienna December six seventeen eighty three to his father The opera in question entitled L Oca del Cairo was never finished forty five Abbe Varesco has written over the cavatina for Lavina a cui servira la musica della cavatina antecedente that is the cavatina of Celidora But that will never do In Celidora s cavatina the words are comfortless and hopeless while in Lavina s cavatina they are full of comfort and hope Moreover it is hackneyed and no longer customary habit to let one singer echo the song of another At best it might only be done by a soubrette and her sweetheart at ultime parti Vienna December twenty four seventeen eighty three to his father The Italian phrase is a direction that the music of a preceding cavatina might be used for a second cavatina forty six It is much more natural since they have all come to an agreement in the quartetto to carry out their plan of attack that the men leave the stage to gather their helpers together and the women quietly retire to their retreat All that can be allowed them is a few lines of recitative Vienna December twenty four seventeen eighty three to his father The situation referred to was in Varesco s opera which never reached completion forty seven At six o clock I drove with Count Canal to the so called Breitfeldischen Ball where the pick of the beauties of Prague are in the habit of congregating That would have been something for you my friend I fancy seeing you not walking but limping after all the pretty girls and women I did not dance neither did I spoon the first because I was too tired the second because of my congenital bashfulness But I saw with great pleasure how all these people hopped about delightedly to the music of my Figaro turned into contradances and Allemands Here nothing is talked about except Figaro nothing played piped sung or whistled except Figaro no opera is attended except Figaro always Figaro Certainly a great honor for me Prague January fifteen seventeen eighty seven to a friend whose name is unknown forty eight Don Giovanni was not written for the Viennese rather for the people of Prague but most of all for me and my friends Reported by Nissen who also relates that Mozart often said The Bohemians are the ones who understand me When Le Nozze di Figaro received an enthusiastic reception in Prague Mozart said Because the Bohemians understand me so well I must write an opera for them The opera was Don Giovanni forty nine I am just home from the opera it was as crowded as ever The duet Mann und Weib and the bells in the first act were repeated as usual also the trio of the boys in the second act But what delights me most is the silent applause It is easy to see how this opera is ever rising Vienna October seven seventeen ninety one to his wife The opera was

none	none	The tangents as they were called had to be held against the strings as long as it was desired that the tone should sound and by gently repeating the pressure on the key a tremulousness was imparted to the tone which made the clavichord a more expressive instrument than the harpsichord or the early pianoforte The effect was called Bebung in German and Balancement in French H E K sixty six Before dinner Herr Vogler dashed through my sonata prima vista He played the first movement prestissimo the andante allegro and the rondo prestissimo with a vengeance As a rule he played a different bass than the one I had written and occasionally he changed the harmony as well as the melody That was inevitable for at such speed the eyes can not follow nor the hands grasp the music Such playing at sight and are all one to me The hearers I mean those worthy of the name can say nothing more than they have seen music and clavier playing You can imagine that it was all the more unendurable because I did not dare to say to him Much too quick Moreover it is much easier to play rapidly than slowly you can drop a few notes in passages without any one noticing it But is it beautiful At such speed you can use the hands indiscriminately but is that beautiful Mannheim January seventeen seventeen seventy eight to his father sixty seven They hurry the tempo trill or pile on the adornments because they can neither study nor sustain a tone

have so much spirit it is incredible the amount of fire in his music Mannheim November fourteen seventeen seventy seven to his father Ignaz Holzbauer was born in Vienna in seventeen eleven and died as chapelmaster in Mannheim on April seven seventeen ninety three During the last years of his life he was totally deaf The music referred to was the setting of the first great German Singspiel Gunther von Schwarzburg eighty two There is much that is pretty in many of Martini s things but in ten years nobody will notice them Reported by Nissen Martini lived in Bologna from seventeen oh six to seventeen eighty four there Mozart learned to know and admire him In seventeen seventy six he wrote a letter to him in which he said that of all people in the world he loved honored and valued him most eighty three For those who seek only light entertainment in music nobody better can be recommended than Paisiello Reported by Nissen Paisiello was born in Taranto in seventeen forty one composed over a hundred operas which like his church music won much applause He died in Naples in eighteen sixteen Mozart considered his music transparent eighty four Jomelli has his genre in which he shines and we must abandon the thought of supplanting him in that field in the judgment of the knowing But he ought not to have abandoned his field to compose church music in the old style for instance Reported by Nissen Jomelli was born in seventeen fourteen near Naples where he died in seventeen seventy four He was greatly admired as a composer of operas and church music He was Court Chapelmaster in Stuttgart from seventeen fifty three to seventeen sixty nine eighty five Wait till you know how many of his works we have in Vienna When I get back home I shall diligently study his church music

pieces for we love to entertain ourselves with all manner of masters ancient and modern Therefore I beg of you send us something of yours as soon as possible Vienna March twenty nine seventeen eighty three to his father Leopold Mozart in Salzburg himself a capable composer eighty eight In a sense Vogler is nothing but a wizard As soon as he attempts to play something majestic he becomes dry and you are glad that he too feels bored and makes a quick ending But what follows unintelligible slip slop I listened to him from a distance Afterward he began a fugue with six notes on the same tone and Presto Then I went up to him As a matter of fact I would rather watch him than hear him Mannheim December eighteen seventeen seventy seven to his father Abbe Vogler was trying the new organ in the Lutheran church at Mannheim Vogler lived from seventeen forty nine to eighteen fourteen and was the teacher of Karl Maria von Weber who esteemed him highly and Meyerbeer Mozart s criticism seems unduly severe eighty nine I was at mass a brand new composition by Vogler I had already been at the rehearsal day before yesterday afternoon but went away after the Kyrie In all my life I have heard nothing like this Frequently everything is out of tune He goes from key to key as if he wanted to drag one along by the hair of the head not in an interesting manner which might be worth while but bluntly and rudely As to the manner in which he develops his ideas I shall say nothing but this I will say that it is impossible for a mass by Vogler to please any composer worthy of the name Briefly I hear a theme which is not bad does it long remain not bad think you will it not soon become beautiful Heaven forefend It grows worse and worse in a two fold or three fold manner for instance scarcely is it begun before something else enters and spoils it or he makes so unnatural a close that it can not remain good or it is misplaced or finally it is ruined by the orchestration That s Vogler s music Mannheim November twenty seventeen seventy seven to his father ninety Clementi plays well so far as execution with the right hand is concerned his forte is passages in thirds Aside from this he hasn t a pennyworth of feeling or taste in a word he is a mere mechanician Vienna January twelve seventeen eighty two to his father Four days later Mozart expressed the same opinion of Muzio Clementi who is still in good repute after having met him in competition before the emperor Clementi preluded and played a sonata then the Emperor said to me Allons go ahead I preluded and played some variations ninety one Now I must say a few words to my sister about the Clementi sonatas Every one who plays or hears them will feel for himself that as compositions they do not signify There are in them no remarkable or striking passages with the exception of those in sixths and octaves and I beg my sister not to devote too much time to these lest she spoil her quiet and steady hand and make it lose its natural lightness suppleness and fluent rapidity What after all is the use She is expected to play the sixths and octaves with the greatest velocity which no man will accomplish not even Clementi and if she tries she will produce a frightful zig zag and nothing more Clementi is a Ciarlatano like all Italians He writes upon a sonata Presto or even Prestissimo and alla breve and plays it Allegro in four four time I know it because I have heard him What he does well is his passages in thirds but he perspired over these day and night in London Aside from this he has nothing absolutely nothing not excellence in reading nor taste nor sentiment Vienna June seven seventeen eighty three to his father and sister ninety two Handel knows better than any of us what will make an effect when he chooses he strikes like a thunderbolt even if he is often prosy after the manner of his time there is always something in his music Mozart valued Handel most highly He knew his masterpieces by heart not only the choruses but also many arias Reported by Rochlitz H E K ninety three Apropos I intended while asking you to send back the rondo to send me also the six fugues by Handel and the toccatas and fugues by Eberlin I go every Sunday to Baron von Swieten s and there nothing is played except Handel and Bach I am making a collection of the fugues those of Sebastian as well as of Emanuel and Friedemann Bach also of Handel s and here the six are lacking Besides I want to let the baron hear those of Eberlin In all likelihood you know that the English Bach is dead a pity for the world of music Vienna April ten seventeen eighty two to his father Johann Ernst Eberlin Eberle born in seventeen oh two died in seventeen sixty two as archiepiscopal chapelmaster in Salzburg Many of his unpublished works are preserved in Berlin The English Bach was Johann Christian son of the great Johann Sebastian As a child Mozart made his acquaintance in London ninety four I shall be glad if papa has not yet had the works of Eberlin copied for I have gotten them meanwhile and discovered for I could not remember that they are too trivial and surely do not deserve a place among those of Bach and Handel All respect to his four part writing but his clavier fugues are nothing but long drawn out versetti Vienna April twenty nine seventeen eighty two to his sister Nannerl ninety five Johann Christian Bach has been here Paris for a fortnight He is to write a French opera and is come only to hear the singers whereupon he will go to London write the opera and come back to put it on the stage You can easily imagine his delight and mine when we met again Perhaps his delight was not altogether sincere but one must admit that he is an honorable man and does justice to all I love him as you know with all my heart and respect him as for him one thing is certain that to my face and to others he really praised me not extravagantly like some but seriously and in earnest saint Germain August twenty seven seventeen seventy eight to his father Johann Christian Bach was the second son of Johann Sebastian and born in seventeen thirty five He lived in London where little Wolfgang learned to know him in seventeen sixty four Bach took the precocious boy on his knee and the two played on the harpsichord Bach was Music Master to the Queen He liked to play with the boy says Jahn took him upon his knee and went through a sonata with him each in turn playing a measure with such precision that no one would have suspected two performers He began a fugue which Wolfgang took up and completed when Bach broke off H E K ninety six Bach is the father we are the youngsters Those of us who can do a decent thing learned how from him and whoever will not admit it is a A remark made at a gathering in Leipsic The Bach referred to is Phillip Emanuel Bach who died in seventeen eighty eight ninety seven Here at last is something from which one can learn Mozart s ejaculation when he heard Bach s motet for double chorus Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied at Leipsic in seventeen eighty nine Rochlitz relates Scarcely had the choir sung a couple of measures when Mozart started After a few more measures he cried out What is that and now his whole soul seemed to be in his ears ninety eight Melt us two together and we will fall far short of making a Haydn Said to the pianist Leopold Kozeluch who had triumphantly pointed out a few slips due to carelessness in Haydn s compositions ninety nine It was a duty that I owed to Haydn to dedicate my quartets to him for it was from him that I learned how to write quartets Reported by Nissen Joseph Haydn once said when the worth of Don Giovanni was under discussion This I do know that Mozart is the greatest composer in the world today one hundred Nobody can do everything jest and terrify cause laughter or move profoundly like Joseph Haydn Reported by Nissen the biographer who married Mozart s widow H E K one hundred one Keep your eyes on him he ll make the world talk of himself some day A remark made by Mozart in reference to Beethoven in the spring of seventeen eighty seven It was the only meeting between the two composers The prophetic observation was called out by Beethoven s improvisation on a theme from Le Nozze di Figaro H E K one hundred two Attwood is a young man for whom I have a sincere affection and esteem he conducts himself with great propriety and I feel much pleasure in telling you that he partakes more of my style than any scholar I ever had and I predict that he will prove a sound musician Remarked in seventeen eighty six to Michael Kelly who was a friend of Attwood and a pupil of Mozart at the time Thomas Attwood was an English musician born in seventeen sixty five He was chorister of the Chapel Royal at the age of nine and at sixteen attracted the attention of the Prince of Wales afterward George IV who sent him to Italy to study He studied two years in Naples and one year in Vienna with Mozart Returned to London he first composed for the theatre and afterward largely for the church He and Mendelssohn were devoted friends H E K one hundred three If the oboist Fischer did not play better when we heard him in Holland seventeen sixty six than he plays now he certainly does not deserve the reputation which he has Yet between ourselves I was too young at the time to pronounce a judgment I remember that he pleased me exceedingly and the whole world It is explained easily enough if one but realizes that tastes have changed mightily since then You would think that he plays according to the old school but no he plays like a wretched pupil And then his concertos his compositions Every ritornello lasts a quarter of an hour then the hero appears lifts one leaden foot after the other and plumps them down alternately His tone is all nasal and his tenuto sounds like an organ tremulant Vienna April four seventeen eighty seven to his father Johann Christian Fischer seventeen thirty three eighteen hundred was a famous oboist and composer for his instrument Fischer was probably the original of the many artists of whom the story is told that having been invited by a nobleman to dinner he was asked if he had brought his instrument with him replied that he had not for that his instrument never ate Kelly tells the story in his Reminiscences and makes Fischer the hero H E K one hundred four I know nothing new except that Gellert has died in Leipsic and since then has written no more poetry Milan January twenty six seventeen

acquainted with Herr Wieland but he doesn t know me as well as I know him for he has not heard anything of mine I never imagined him to be as he is He seems to me to be a little affected in speech has a rather childish voice a fixed stare a certain learned rudeness yet at times a stupid condescension I am not surprised that he behaves as he does here and as he would not dare do in Weimar or elsewhere for the people look at him as if he had fallen direct from heaven All stand in awe no one talks everyone is silent every word is listened to when he speaks It is a pity that he keeps people in suspense so long for he has a defect of speech which compels him to speak very slowly and pause after every six words Otherwise his is as we all know an admirable brain His face is very ugly pockmarked and his nose rather long He is a little taller than papa Mannheim December twenty seven seventeen seventy seven to his father On November twenty two Mozart had reported In the coming carnival Rosamunde will be performed new poetry by Herr Wieland new music by Herr Schweitzer On January ten seventeen seventy eight he writes Rosamunde was rehearsed in the theatre today it is good but nothing more If it were bad you could not perform it at all just as you can t sleep without going to bed one hundred six Now that Herr Wieland has seen me twice he is entirely enchanted The last time we met after lauding me as highly as possible he said It is truly a piece of good fortune for me to have met you here and pressed my hand Mannheim January ten seventeen seventy eight one hundred seven Now I give you a piece of news which perhaps you know already that godless fellow and arch rascal Voltaire is dead died like a dog like a beast That is his reward Paris July three seventeen seventy eight to his father who like the son was a man of sincere piety and abhorred Voltaire s atheism one hundred eight When God gives a man an office he also gives him sense that s the case with the Archduke Before he was a priest he was much wittier and intelligent spoke less but more sensibly You ought to see him now Stupidity looks out of his eyes he talks and chatters eternally and always in falsetto His neck is swollen in short he has been completely transformed Vienna November seventeen seventeen eighty one to his father The person spoken of was Archduke Maximilian who afterward became Archbishop of Cologne and was the patron of Beethoven The ambiguity of the opening statement is probably due to carelessness in writing or Mozart s habit of using double negatives H E K WOLFGANG THE GERMAN Mozart s Germanism is a matter of pride to the German people To him German was no empty concept as it was to the majority of his contemporaries He is therefore honored as a champion of German character and German art worthy as such to stand beside Richard Wagner Properly to appreciate his patriotism it is necessary to hear in mind that in Mozart s day Germany was a figment of the imagination the French language French manners and Italian music being everywhere dominant Wagner on the contrary was privileged to see the promise of the fulfillment of his strivings in the light of the German victories of eighteen seventy eighteen seventy one When the genius of Germany soared aloft she carried Wagner with her Wagner s days of glory in August eighteen seventy six were conditioned by the great war with France How insignificant must the patronage of Joseph II scantily enough bestowed on Mozart in comparison with that showered on Salieri appear when we recall the Maecenas Ludwig II one hundred nine Frequently I fall into a mood of complete listlessness and indifference nothing gives me great pleasure The most stimulating and encouraging thought is that you dearest father and my dear sister are well that I am an honest German and that if I am not always permitted to talk I can think what I please but that is all Paris May twenty nine seventeen seventy eight to his father one hundred ten The Duke de Guines was utterly without a sense of honor and thought that here was a young fellow and a stupid German to boot as all Frenchmen think of the Germans he ll be glad to take it But the stupid German was not glad and refused to take the money For two lessons he wanted to pay me the fee of one Paris July thirty one seventeen seventy eight to his father Mozart had given lessons in composition to the Duke s daughter See No fifty one one hundred eleven An Italian ape such as he is who has lived in German countries and eaten German bread for years ought to speak German or mangle it as well or ill as his French mouth will permit Said of the violoncellist Duport the favorite of King William I of Prussia in seventeen eighty nine when Mozart was in Berlin and Duport asked him to speak French one hundred twelve I pray God every day to give me grace to remain steadfast here that I may do honor to myself and the entire German nation to His greater honor and glory and that He permit me to make my fortune so that I may help you out of your sorry condition and bring it to pass that we soon meet again and live together in happiness and joy But His will be done on earth as in heaven Paris May one seventeen seventy eight to his father who had plunged himself in debt and was giving lessons in order to promote the career of his son His sister also helped nobly one hundred thirteen If this were a place where the people had ears hearts to feel and a modicum of musical understanding and taste I should laugh heartily at all these things as it is I am among nothing but cattle and brutes so far as music is concerned How should it be otherwise since they are the same in all their acts and passions There is no place like Paris You must not think that I exaggerate when I talk thus of music Turn to whom you please except to a born Frenchman you shall hear the same thing provided you can find some one to turn to Now that I am here I must endure out of regard for you I shall thank God Almighty if I get out of here with a sound taste Paris May one seventeen seventy eight one hundred fourteen How popular I would be if I were to lift the national German stage to recognition in music And this would surely happen for I was already full of desire to write when I heard the German Singspiel Munich October two seventeen seventy seven A Singspiel is a German opera with spoken dialogue H E K one hundred fifteen If there were but a single patriot on the boards with me a different face would be put on the matter Then mayhap the budding National Theatre would blossom and that would be an eternal disgrace to Germany if we Germans should once begin to think German act German speak German and even sing German Vienna March twenty one seventeen eighty five to the playwright Anton Klein of Mannheim It was purposed to open the Singspiel theatre in October one hundred sixteen The German Opera is to be opened in October For my part I am not promising it much luck From the doings so far it looks as if an effort were making thoroughly to destroy the German opera which had suspended perhaps only for a while rather than to help it up again and preserve it Only my sister in law Lange has been engaged for the German Singspiel Cavalieri Adamberger Teyber all Germans of whom Germany can be proud must remain with the Italian opera must make war against their countrymen Vienna March twenty one seventeen eighty five to Anton Klein Madame Lange was Aloysia Weber with whom he was in love before he married her sister Constanze one hundred seventeen The gentlemen of Vienna including most particularly the Emperor must not be permitted to believe that I live only for the sake of Vienna There is no monarch on the face of the earth whom I would rather serve than the Emperor but I shall not beg service I believe that I am capable of doing honor to any court If Germany my beloved fatherland of whom you know I am proud will not accept me then must I in the name of God again make France or England richer by one capable German and to the shame of the German nation You know full well that in nearly all the arts those who excelled have nearly always been Germans But where did they find fortune where fame Certainly not in Germany Even Gluck did Germany make him a great man Alas no Vienna August seventeen seventeen eighty two to his father Mozart s answer in seventeen eighty nine when King Frederick William II of Prussia said to him Stay with me I offer you a salary of three thousand thalers was touching in the extreme Shall I leave my good Emperor Thereupon the king said Think it over I ll keep my word even if you should come after a year and a day In spite of his financial difficulties Mozart never gave serious consideration to the offer When his father advised him against some of his foreign plans he answered So far as France and England are concerned you are wholly right this opening will never be closed to me it will be better if I wait a while longer Meanwhile it is possible that conditions may change in those countries In a preceding letter he had written For some time I have been practicing myself daily in the French language and I have also taken three lessons in English In three months I hope to be able to read and understand English books fairly well one hundred eighteen The two of us played a sonata that I had composed for the occasion and which had a success This sonata I shall send you by Herr von Daubrawaick who said that he would feel proud to have it in his trunk his son who is a Salzburger told me this When the father went he said quite loud I am proud to be your countryman You are doing great honor to Salzburg I hope that times will so change that we can have you amongst us and then do not forget me I answered My fatherland has always the first claim on me Vienna November twenty four seventeen eighty one to his father Mozart is speaking of a concert which he had given The sonata is the small one in D major Kochel No three hundred eighty one Mozart often made merry over the Salzburgians he called them stupid and envious one hundred nineteen Thoroughly convinced that I was talking to a German I gave free rein to my tongue a thing which one is so seldom permitted to do that after such an outpouring of the heart it would be allowable to get a bit fuddled without risk of hurting one s health Vienna March twenty one seventeen eighty five to Anton Klein SELF RESPECT AND HONOR Beethoven is said to have been the first musician who compelled respect for his craft he who prouder than Goethe associated with royalties and said of himself I too am a king Mozart rose from a dependent position which brought him most grievous humiliations he was looked upon as a servant of the Archbishop of Salzburg and treated accordingly At the time composers and musicians had no higher standing Mozart feels the intolerableness of his position and protests against it on every opportunity he is conscious of his worth and intellectual superiority When he endures the grossest indignities from his tormentor Archbishop Hieronymus it is for the sake of his father whom he would save from annoyance In all things else he follows the example of his father but in the matter of self respect he admonishes and encourages his parent Although Beethoven rudely rejected the condescending good will of the great which would have made Mozart happy and demanded respect as an equal it must be confessed that the generally manly conduct of Mozart was an excellent preparation of the Viennese soil one hundred twenty I only wish that the Elector were here he might hear something to his advantage He knows nothing about me knows nothing about my ability What a pity that these grand gentlemen take everybody s word and are unwilling to investigate for themselves It s always the way I am willing to make a test let him summon all the composers in Munich and even invite a few from Italy Germany England and Spain I will trust myself in a competition with them all Munich October two seventeen seventy seven to his father Mozart had hoped to secure an appointment in Munich but was disappointed one hundred twenty one I could scarcely refrain from laughing when I was introduced to the people A few who knew me par renommee were very polite and respectful others who know nothing about me stared at me as if they were a bit amused They think that because I am small and young that there can be nothing great and old in me But they shall soon find out Mannheim October thirty one seventeen seventy seven to his father one hundred twenty two We poor common folk must not only take wives whom we love and who love us but we may can and want to take such because we are neither noble well born nor rich but lowly mean and poor Hence we do not need rich wives because our wealth dies with us being in our heads Of this wealth no man can rob us unless he cuts off our heads in which case we should have need of nothing more Mannheim February seven seventeen seventy eight to his father Mozart had fallen in love with Aloysia daughter of the poor musician Weber one hundred twenty three I will gladly give lessons to oblige particularly if I see that a person has talent and a joyous desire to learn But to go to a house at a fixed hour or wait at home for the arrival of some one that I can not do no matter how much it might yield me I leave that to others who can do nothing else than play the clavier for me it is impossible I am a composer and was born to be a chapelmaster I dare not thus bury the talent for composition which a kind God gave me in such generous measure I may say this without pride for I feel it now more than ever before and that is what I should do had I many pupils Teaching is a restless occupation and I would rather neglect clavier playing than composition the clavier is a side issue though thank God a strong one Mannheim February seven seventeen seventy eight to his father who must have read the words with sorrow since he and his daughter Nannerl were laboriously giving lessons and practicing economy to make Mozart s journey possible and had to advance money to him one hundred twenty four I know of a certainty that the Emperor intends to establish a German opera in Vienna and is earnestly seeking a young conductor who understands the German language has genius and is capable of giving the world something new Benda of Gotha is seeking the place and Schweitzer is also an applicant I believe this would be a good thing for me but with good pay as a matter of course If the Emperor will give me a thousand florins I will write a German opera for him and if then he does not wish to retain me all right I beg of you write to all the good friends in Vienna whom you can think of that I would do honor to the Emperor If there is no other way let him try me with an opera Mannheim January ten seventeen seventy eight to his father one hundred twenty five The greatest favor that Herr Grimm showed me was to lend me fifteen Louis d Or in driblets at the life and death of my blessed mother Is he fearful that the loan will not be returned If so he truly deserves a kick for he shows distrust of my honesty the only thing that can throw me into a rage and also of my talent In a word he belongs to the Italian party is deceitful and is seeking to oppress me Paris September eleven seventeen seventy eight to his father who was on a friendly footing with the French encyclopaedist Grimm since the first artistic tour made with little Wolfgang in seventeen sixty three when he owed many favors to Grimm Apparently Mozart here does an injustice to his patron who it is true thought highly of the Italian Piccini one hundred twenty six On my honor I can t help it it s the kind of man I am Lately when he spoke to me rudely foolishly and stupidly I did not dare to say to him that he need not worry about the fifteen Louis d Or for fear that I might offend him I did nothing but endure and ask if he were ready and then your obedient servant Paris September eleven seventeen seventy eight to his father at whose request Baron Grimm had received the young artist in Paris but at the same time had exercised a sort of artistic guardianship over him Wolfgang had written to his father as early as August twenty seven If you write to him do not be too humble in your thanks there are reasons On another occasion Grimm is able to assist children but not adults Do not imagine that he is the man he was one hundred twenty seven You know that I want nothing more than good employment good in character and good in recompense let it be where it will if the place be but Catholic but if the Salzburgians want me they must satisfy my desires or they will certainly not get me Paris July three seventeen seventy eight to his father who wished to see his son in the service of the archiepiscopal court at Salzburg one hundred twenty eight The Prince must have confidence either in you or me and give us complete control of everything relating to music otherwise all will be in vain For in Salzburg everybody or nobody has to do with music If I were to undertake it I should demand free hands In matters musical the Head Court Chamberlain should have nothing to say a cavalier can not be a conductor but a conductor can well be a cavalier Paris July nine seventeen seventy eight one hundred twenty nine If the Archbishop were to entrust it to me I would soon make his music famous that s sure But I have one request to make at Salzburg and that is that I shall not be placed among the violins where I used to be I ll never make a fiddler I will conduct at the clavier and accompany the arias It would have been a good thing if I had secured a written assurance of the conductorship Paris September eleven seventeen seventy eight to his father who had urged him to return to Salzburg to receive an appointment to the conductorship Mozart seems to have a premonition of the treatment which he received later from the Archbishop one hundred thirty I must admit that I should reach Salzburg with a lighter heart if I were not aware that I have taken service there it is only this thought that is intolerable Put yourself in my place and think it over At Salzburg I do not know who or what I am I am everything and at times nothing I do not demand too much or too little only something if I am something Strassburg October fifteen seventeen seventy eight to his father while returning from Paris filled with repugnance to the Archbishop For aside from obeying a praiseworthy and beautiful motive he means filial affection I am really committing the greatest folly in the world he writes in the same letter one hundred thirty one The Archbishop can not recompense me for the slavery in Salzburg As I have said I experience great pleasure when I think of visiting you again but nothing but vexation and fear at the thought of seeing myself at that beggarly court again The Archbishop must not attempt to put on grand airs with me as he used to it is not impossible it is even likely that I would put my fingers to my nose and I know full well that you would enjoy it as much as I Mannheim November twelve seventeen seventy eight to his father one hundred thirty two At eleven o clock in the forenoon a little too early for me unfortunately we already go to table we dine together the two temporal and spiritual valets mister the Controller mister Zetti the Confectioner Messrs the two cooks Ceccarelli Brunetti and my insignificance N B The two valets sit at the head of the table I have at least the honor of sitting above the cooks Well I simply think I am at Salzburg At dinner a great many coarse and silly jokes are cracked but not at me because I do not speak a word unless of necessity and then always with the utmost seriousness As soon as I have dined I go my way Vienna March seventeen seventeen eighty one to his father The Archbishop was visiting Vienna and had brought with him his best musicians whom however he treated shabbily At length the rupture came Mozart was dismissed literally with a kick one hundred thirty three Believe me best of fathers that I must summon all my manhood to write to you what reason commands God knows how hard it is for me to leave you but if beggary were my lot I would no longer serve such a master for that I shall never forget as long as I live and I beg of you I beg of you for the sake of everything in the world encourage me in my determination instead of trying to dissuade me That would unfit me for what I must do For it is my desire and hope to win honor fame and money and I hope to be of greater service to you in Vienna than in Salzburg Vienna May twelve seventeen eighty one to his father one hundred thirty four I did not know that I was a valet de chambre and that broke my neck I ought to have wasted a few hours every forenoon in the antechamber I was often told that I should let myself be seen but I could not recall that this was my duty and came punctually only when the Archbishop summoned me Vienna May twelve seventeen eighty one one hundred thirty five To please you best of fathers I would sacrifice my happiness my health and my life but my honor is my own and ought to be above all else to you Let Count Arco and all Salzburg read this letter Vienna May nineteen seventeen eighty one It was Count Arco who had dismissed Mozart with a kick The father was thrown into consternation at the maltreatment of his son and sought to persuade Mozart to return to Salzburg Mozart replied Best dearest father ask of me anything you please but not that the very thought makes me tremble with rage one hundred thirty six You did not think when you wrote this that such a back step would stamp me as one of the most contemptible fellows in the world All Vienna knows that I have left the Archbishop knows why knows that it is because of my injured honor of an injury inflicted three times and I am to make a public denial proclaim myself a cur and the Archbishop a noble prince No man could do the former least of all I and the second can only be done by God if He should choose to enlighten him Vienna May nineteen seventeen eighty one to his father who had asked him to return to the service of the Archbishop one hundred thirty seven If it be happiness to be rid of a prince who never pays one but torments him to death then I am happy For if I had to work from morning till night I would do it gladly rather than live off the bounty of such a I do not dare to call him by the name he deserves I was forced to take the step I did and I can not swerve a hair s breadth from it impossible Vienna May nineteen seventeen eighty one one hundred thirty eight Salzburg is nothing now to me except it offer an opportunity to give the Count a kick even if it were in the public street I desire no satisfaction from the Archbishop for he is not in a position to offer me the kind that I want and must have Within a day or two I shall write to the Count telling him what he can confidently expect to receive from me the first time I meet him be it where it may except a place that commands my respect Vienna June thirteen seventeen eighty one to his father Count Arco s offence has been mentioned On June sixteen Mozart wrote The hungry ass shall not escape my chastisement if I have to wait twenty years for as soon as I see him he shall come in contact with my foot unless I should be so unfortunate as to see him in the sanctuary The reader will probably guess that the translator is resorting to euphemisms in rendering Mozart s language H E K one hundred thirty nine It is the heart that confers the patent of nobility on man and although I am no count I probably have more honor within me than many a count Menial or count whoever insults me is a cur I shall begin by representing to him with complete gravity how badly he did his business but at the end I shall have to assure him in writing that he is to expect a kick and a box on the ear from me for if a man insults me I have got to be revenged and if I give him no more than he gave me it is mere retaliation and not punishment Besides I should thus put myself on a level with him and I am too proud to compare myself with such a stupid gelding Vienna June twenty seventeen eighty one to his father These expressions called out by the insulting treatment received from the Archbishop and Count Arco are in striking contrast to Mozart s habitual amiability one hundred forty I can easily believe that the court parasites will look askance at you but why need you disturb yourself about such a miserable pack The more inimical such persons are to you the greater the pride and contempt with which you should look down upon them Vienna June twenty seventeen seventy eight to his father who fears that some of the consequences of his son s step may be visited upon him one hundred forty one I do not ask of you that you make a disturbance or enter the least complaint but the Archbishop and the whole pack must fear to speak to you about this matter for you if compelled can without the slightest alarm say frankly that you would be ashamed to have reared a son who would have accepted abuse from such an infamous cur as Arco and you may assure all that if I had the good luck to meet him today I should treat him as he deserves and that he would have occasion to remember me the rest of his life All that I want is that everybody shall see in your bearing that you have nothing to fear Keep quiet but if necessary speak and then to some purpose Vienna July four seventeen eighty one to his father one hundred forty two I may say that because of Vogler Winter was always my greatest enemy But because he is a beast in his mode of life and in all other matters a child I would be ashamed to set down a single word on his account he deserves the contempt of all honorable men I will therefore not tell infamous truths rather than infamous lies about him Vienna December twenty two seventeen eighty one to his father to whose ears Peter Winter a composer had brought slanderous reports concerning Mozart and his Constanze Winter was a pupil of Abbe Vogler See No sixty six one hundred forty three He is a nice fellow and a good friend of mine I might often dine with him but it is a custom with me never to take pay for my favors nor would a dish of soup pay them Yet such people have wonderful notions of what they accomplish with one I am fond of doing favors for people but they must not plague me She the daughter is not satisfied if I spend two hours every day with her but wants me to loll about the whole day yet she tries to play the well behaved one Vienna August twenty two seventeen eighty one to his father Mozart is writing about a landlord and his daughter concerning whom favorable reports had reached the ears of the father Mozart explains matters and soon thereafter announces a change of lodgings one hundred forty four I beg of you that when you write to me about something in my conduct which is displeasing to you and I in turn give you my views let it always be a matter between father and son and therefore a secret not to be divulged to others Let our letters suffice and do not address yourself to others for by heaven I will not give a finger s length of accounting concerning my doings or omissions to others not even to the Emperor himself I have cares and anxieties of my own and have no use for petulant letters Vienna September five seventeen eighty one to his father who lent a willing ear to gossips and was never chary of his reproaches Mozart was already twenty five years old one hundred forty five If I were Wiedmer I would demand the following satisfaction from the Emperor he should endure fifty strokes at the same place in my presence and then he should pay me six thousand ducats If I could not obtain this satisfaction I should take none but thrust a dagger through his heart at the first opportunity N B He has already had an offer of three thousand ducats on condition that he does not come to Vienna but permits the matter to drop The people of Innsbruck say of Wiedmer he who was scourged for our sake will also redeem us Vienna August eight seventeen eighty one to his father Herr von Wiedmer was a nobleman and theatre director who without cause had been sentenced to a whipping by the president Count Wolkenstein on the complaint of another nobleman Mozart s bloodthirstiness was probably due to memories of Arco s kick still rankling in his heart It was only after long solicitation from his father that he abandoned his plan to send Arco the threatened letter H E K one hundred forty six You perhaps already know that the musico Marquesi Marquesius di Milano was poisoned in Naples but how He was in love with a duchess and her real amant grew jealous and sent three or four bravos to Marquesi and left him the choice of drinking poison or being massacred He chose the poison Being a timid Italian he died alone and left his gentlemen murderers to live in rest and peace Had they come into my room I would have taken a few of them with me into the other world as long as some one had to die Pity for so excellent a singer Munich December thirty seventeen eighty to his father Mozart on the whole was one of the most peaceable men on earth but he was not wanting in personal courage and he could fly into transports of rage one hundred forty seven If you were to write also to Prince Zeil I should be glad But short and good Do not by any means crawl That I can not endure Mannheim December ten seventeen seventy seven to his father Count Ferdinand von Zeil was Prince Bishop of Chimsee and favorably disposed towards Mozart who was hoping for an appointment in Munich If he wants to do something he can all Munich told me that Nothing came of it one hundred forty eight Whoever judges me by such bagatelles is also a scamp Mozart wrote many occasional pieces for his friends fitting them to the players capacities Mozart said that the publisher who bought some of these bagatelles and printed them without applying to him was a scamp Lump but took no proceedings against him one hundred forty nine Very well then I shall earn nothing more go hungry and the devil a bit will I care Mozart s answer to Hofmeister the Leipsic publisher who had said Write in a more popular style or I can neither print nor pay for anything of yours STRIVINGS AND LABORS one hundred fifty We live in this world only that we may go onward without ceasing a peculiar help in this direction being that one enlightens the other by communicating his ideas in the sciences and fine arts there is always more to learn Salzburg September seven seventeen seventy six to Padre Martini of Bologna whose opinion he asks concerning a motet which the Archbishop of Salzburg had faulted one hundred fifty one I am just now reading Telemachus I am in the second part Bologna September eight seventeen seventy to his mother and sister one hundred fifty two Because you said yesterday that you could understand anything and that I might write what I please in Latin curiosity has led me to try you with some Latin lines Have the kindness when you have solved the problem to send the result to me by the Hagenauer servant maid Cuperem scire de qua causa a quam plurimis adolescentibus ottium usque adeo aestimetur ut ipsi se nec verbis nec verberibus ab hoc sinant abduci The Archiepiscopal concertmaster aged thirteen writes thus to a girl friend one hundred fifty three Since then I have exercised myself daily in the French language and already taken three lessons in English In three months I hope to be able to read and understand the English books fairly well Vienna August seventeen seventeen eighty two to his father Mozart had given it out that he intended to go to Paris or London Prince Kaunitz had said to Archduke Maximilian that men like Mozart lived but once in a hundred years and should not be driven out of Germany Mozart however writes to his father But I do not want to wait on charity I find that even if it were the Emperor I am not dependent on his bounty one hundred fifty four I place my confidence in three friends and they are strong and invincible friends viz God your head and my head True our heads differ but each is very good serviceable and useful in its genre and in time I hope that my head will be as good as yours in the field in which now yours is superior Mannheim February twenty eight seventeen seventy eight to his father one hundred fifty five Believe me I do not love idleness but work True it was difficult in Salzburg and cost me an effort and I could scarcely persuade myself Why Because I was not happy there You must admit that for me at least there was not a pennyworth of entertainment in Salzburg I do not want to associate with many and of the majority of the rest I am not fond There is no encouragement for my talent If I play or one of my compositions is performed the audience might as well consist of tables and chairs In Salzburg I sigh for a hundred amusements and here for not one to live in Vienna is amusement enough Vienna May twenty six seventeen eighty one to his father who was concerned as to the progress making in Vienna one hundred fifty six I beg of you best and dearest of fathers do not write me any more letters of this kind I conjure you for they serve no other purpose than to heat my head and disturb my heart and mood And I who must compose continually need a clear head and quiet mood Vienna June nine seventeen eighty one to his father who had reproached him because of his rupture with the Archbishop one hundred fifty seven If there ever was a time when I was not thinking about marriage it is now I wish for nothing less than a rich wife and if I could make my fortune by marriage now I should perforce have to wait because I have very different things in my head God did not give me my talent to put it a dangle on a wife and spend my young life in inactivity I am just beginning life and shall I embitter it myself I have nothing against matrimony but for me it would be an evil just now Vienna July twenty five seventeen eighty one to his father who was solicitous lest he fall in love with one of the daughters in the Weber family with whom he was living All manner of rumors had been carried to him The father persuaded his son to seek other lodgings but Constanze Weber eventually became Mozart s wife nevertheless one hundred fifty eight This sort of composer can do nothing in this genre He has no conception of what is wanted Lord if God had only given me such a place in the church and before such an orchestra A remark made in Leipsic in seventeen eighty nine in reference to a composer who was suited to comic opera work but had received an appointment as Church composer Mozart examined a mass of his and said It sounds all very well but not in church He then played it through with new words improvised by himself such as in the Cum sancto spiritu Stolen property gentlemen but no offence one hundred fifty nine You see my intentions are good but if you can t you can t I do not want to scribble and therefore can not send you the whole symphony before next post day Vienna July thirty one seventeen eighty two to his father who had asked for a symphony for the Hafner family in Salzburg one hundred sixty I do not beg pardon no But I beg of Herr Bullinger that he himself apply to himself for pardon in my behalf with the assurance that as soon as I can do so in quiet I shall write to him Until now no such occasion has offered itself for as soon as I know that in all likelihood I must leave a place I have no restful hour And although I still have a modicum of hope I am not at ease and shall not be until I know my status Mannheim November twenty two seventeen seventy seven to his father Abbe Bullinger was the most intimate friend that the Mozart family had in Salzburg Mozart had been negligent in his correspondence one hundred sixty one To live well and to live happily are different things and the latter would be impossible for me without witchcraft it would have to be supernatural and that is impossible for there are no witches now a days Paris August seven seventeen seventy eight to his friend Bullinger who had sought to persuade him to return to Salzburg one hundred sixty two The Duke de Chabot sat himself down beside me and listened attentively and I I forgot the cold and the headache and played regardless of the wretched clavier as I play when I am in the mood Give me the best clavier in Europe and at the same time hearers who understand nothing or want to understand nothing and who do not feel what I play with me and all my joy is gone Paris May one seventeen seventy eight to his father The Duchess had behaved very haughtily and kept Mozart sitting in a cold room for a long time before the Duke came AT HOME AND ABROAD one hundred sixty three I assure you that without travel we at least men of the arts and sciences are miserable creatures A man of mediocre talent will remain mediocre whether he travel or not but a man of superior talent which I can not deny I am without doing wrong deteriorates if he remains continually in one place Paris September eleven seventeen seventy eight to his father who had secured an appointment for him at Salzburg which he was loath to accept He asked that the Archbishop permit him to travel once in two years He feared that he would find no congenial society in Salzburg where moreover music did not stand in large appreciation Mozart s subsequent experiences were of the most pitiable character one hundred sixty four Write me how is mister Canary Does he still sing Does he still pipe Do you know why I am thinking of the canary Because there is one in our anteroom that makes the same little sounds as ours Naples May nineteen seventeen seventy to his sister Mozart was very fond of animals In a letter from Vienna to his sister on August twenty one seventeen seventy three he writes How is Miss Bimbes Please present all manner of compliments to her Miss Bimbes was a dog At another time he wrote a pathetic little poem on the death of a starling While in the midst of the composition and rehearsal of Idomeneo he wrote to his father Give Pimperl a dog a pinch of Spanish snuff a good wine biscuit and three busses one hundred sixty five Because of my disposition which leans towards a quiet domestic life rather than to boisterousness and the fact that since my youth I have never given a thought to my linen clothing or such things I can think of nothing more necessary than a wife I assure you that I frequently spend money unnecessarily because I am negligent of these things I am convinced that I could get along better than I do now on the same income if I had a wife How many unnecessary expenditures would be saved Others are added it is true but you know in advance what they are and can adjust them in a word you lead a regulated life In my opinion an unmarried man lives only half a life that is my conviction and I can not help it I have resolved the matter over and over in my mind and am of the same opinion still Vienna December fifteen seventeen eighty one to his father one hundred sixty six At present I have only one pupil I could have several if I were to lower my fee but as soon as one does that one loses credit My price is twelve lessons for six ducats and I make it understood besides that I give the lessons as a favor I would rather have three pupils who pay well than six who pay ill I am writing this to you to prevent you from thinking that it is selfishness which prevents me from sending you more than thirty ducats Vienna June sixteen seventeen eighty one to his father In American money Mozart s fee is represented by one dollar twenty cents per lesson H E K one hundred sixty seven I could not go about Vienna looking like a tramp particularly just at this time My linen was pitiable no servant here has shirts of such coarse stuff as mine and that certainly is a frightful thing for a man Consequently there were again expenditures I had only one pupil she suspended her lessons for three weeks and I was again the loser One must not throw one s self away here that is a first principle or one is ruined forever The most audacious man wins the day Vienna September five seventeen eighty one to his father excusing himself for not having made remittances one hundred sixty eight Resent anything and at once you receive smaller pay Besides all this the Emperor is a skinflint If the Emperor wants me he ought to pay for me the mere honor of being in his employ is not enough If the Emperor were to offer me one thousand florins and a count two thousand I should present my compliments to the Emperor and go to the count assuming a guarantee of course Vienna April ten seventeen eighty two to his father Mozart was not too industrious in the pursuit of a court appointment yet had reason to be hopeful Near the end of his short life the appointment came from Joseph II to whom Mozart had been too faithful one hundred sixty nine I described my manner of life to my father only recently and I will now repeat it to you At six o clock in the morning I am already done with my friseur and at seven I am fully dressed Thereupon I compose until nine o clock From nine to one I give lessons then I eat unless I am a guest at places where they dine at two or even three o clock as for instance today and tomorrow with Countess Zichy and Countess Thun I can not work before five or six o clock in the evening and I am often prevented even then by a concert if not I write till nine Then I go to my dear Constanze where the delight of our meeting is generally embittered by the words of her mother hence my desire to free and save her as soon as possible At half after ten or eleven I am again at home Since owing to the occasional concerts and the uncertainty as to whether or not I may be called out I can not depend on having time for composition in the evening I am in the habit particularly when I come home early of writing something before I go to bed Frequently I forget myself and write till one o clock then up again at six Vienna February thirteen seventeen eighty two to his sister Marianne Nannerl as he called her one hundred seventy We do not go to bed before twelve o clock and get up half after five or five because nearly every day we take an early walk in the Augarten Vienna May twenty six seventeen eighty four to his father to whom he complains of his maid servant who came from Salzburg and who had written to the father that she was not permitted to sleep except between eleven and six o clock one hundred seventy one Now as to my mode of life As soon as you were gone I played two games of billiards with Herr von Mozart who wrote the opera for Schickaneder s theatre then I sold my nag for fourteen ducats then I had Joseph call my primus and bring a black coffee to which I smoked a glorious pipe of tobacco At five thirty I went out of the door and took my favorite promenade through the Glacis to the theatre What do I see What do I smell It is the primus with the cutlet Gusto I eat to your health It has just struck eleven o clock Perhaps you are already asleep Sh sh sh I do not want to wake you Saturday the eighth You ought to have seen me yesterday at supper I could not find the old dishes and therefore produced a set as white as snow flowers and had the wax candelabra in front of me Vienna October seven seventeen ninety one to his wife who was taking the waters at Baden Mozart was fond of billiards and often played alone as on this occasion He was careful of his health and had been advised by his physician to ride but he could not acquire a taste for the exercise Hence the sale of his horse The primus was his valet a servant found in every Viennese household at the time Out of the door through which he stepped on beginning his walk to the theatre his funeral procession passed two months later one hundred seventy two I have done more work during the ten days that I have lived here than in two months in any other lodgings and if it were not that I am too often harassed by gloomy thoughts which I can dispel only by force I could do still more for I live pleasantly comfortably and cheaply Vienna June twenty seven seventeen eighty eight to his friend Puchberg one hundred seventy three I have no conveniences for writing there i e at Baden and I want to avoid embarrassments as much as possible Nothing is more enjoyable than a quiet life and to obtain that one must be industrious I am glad to be that Vienna October eight seventeen ninety one to his wife at Baden Mozart probably refers to work on his Requiem He says further If I had had nothing to do I would have gone with you to spend the week one hundred seventy four Now the babe against my will yet with my consent has been provided with a wet nurse It was always my determination that whether she was able to do so or not my wife was not to suckle her child but neither was the child to guzzle the milk of another woman I want it brought up on water as I and my sister were but Vienna June eight seventeen eighty three to his father the day after his first child was born The Dear thick fat little fellow died soon after one hundred seventy five Young as I am I never go to bed without thinking that possibly I may not be alive on the morrow yet not one of the many persons who know me can say that I am morose or melancholy For this happy disposition I thank my Creator daily and wish with all my heart that it were shared by all my fellows Vienna April four seventeen eighty seven to his father shortly before the latter s death Mozart himself died when he was not quite thirty six years old one hundred seventy six If it chances to be convenient I shall call on the Fischers for a moment longer than that I could not endure their warm room and the wine at table I know very well that people of their class think they are bestowing the highest honors when they offer these things but I am not fond of such things still less of such people Vienna December twenty two seventeen eighty one to his sister Mozart was acquainted with the Fischer family from the time of his first journeys as a child The contrast which he draws between the artist and the comfort loving commonplace citizen is diverting one hundred seventy seven The Viennese are a people who soon grow weary and listless but only of the theatre My forte is too popular to be neglected This surely is Clavierland Spoken to Count Arco who had warned him against removing to Vienna because of the fickleness of the Viennese public He wanted him to return to Salzburg one hundred seventy eight I am writing at a place called Reisenberg which is an hour s distance from Vienna I once stayed here over night now I shall remain a few days The house is insignificant but the surroundings the woods in which a grotto has been built as natural as can be are splendid and very pleasant Vienna July thirteen seventeen eighty one to his father Like Beethoven Mozart loved nature and wanted a garden about his home one hundred seventy nine I wish that my sister were here in Rome I am sure she would be pleased with the city for saint Peter s church is regular and many other things in Rome are regular Rome April fourteen seventeen seventy A droll criticism from the traveling virtuoso aged fourteen in a letter to his mother and sister one hundred eighty Carefully thinking it over I conclude that in no country have I received so many honors or been so highly appreciated as in Italy You get credit in Italy if you have written an opera especially in Naples Munich October eleven seventeen seventy seven to his father An influential friend had offered to help him get an appointment in Italy one hundred eighty one Strassburg can t get along without me You have no idea how I am honored and loved here The people say that everything I do is refined that I am so sedate and courteous and have so good a bearing Everybody knows me Strassburg October twenty six seventeen seventy eight to his father on his return journey from Paris On October three he had written I beg your pardon if I cannot write much It is because unless I am in a city in which I am well known I am never in a good humor If I were acquainted here I would gladly stay for the city is truly charming beautiful houses handsome broad streets and superb squares one hundred eighty two Oh what a difference between the people of the Palatinate and of Bavaria What a language How coarse To say nothing of the mode of life Mannheim November twelve seventeen seventy eight to his father Mozart while returning from Paris had stopped at his dear Mannheim where at the moment a regiment of Bavarian soldiers were quartered and had just got news of the rudeness with which the people of Munich had treated their Elector one hundred eighty three In Regensburg we dined magnificently at noon listened to divine table music had angelic service and glorious Mosel wine We breakfasted in Nuremberg a hideous city At Wurzburg we strengthened our stomachs with coffee a beautiful a splendid city The charges were moderate everywhere Only two post relays from here in Aschaffenburg the landlord swindled us shamefully Frankfort on the Main September twenty nine seventeen ninety to his wife The remark is notable because of the judgments pronounced on the renaissance city Nuremberg and the rococo city Wurzburg one hundred eighty four All the talk about the imperial cities is mere boasting I am famous admired and loved here it is true but the people are worse than the Viennese in their parsimony Mozart went to Frankfort in seventeen ninety on the occasion of the coronation of the emperor hoping to make enough money with concerts to help himself out of financial difficulties but failed LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP Mozart s love for his father made him dependent on the latter to the end of his days He was a model son and must have loved his wife devotedly since for her sake he once in his life disobeyed his father The majority of his letters which have been preserved are addressed to his father to whom he reported all his happenings and whose advice he is forever seeking Similar were his relations with his sister Marianne Nannerl whom he loved with great tenderness The letters to his wife are unique all of them even the last seem to be the letters of a lover They were a pair of turtle doves Mozart was an ideal friend ready to sacrifice to the uttermost on the altar of friendship It was this trait of character which made him throw himself with enthusiasm into Freemasonry whose affiliations he sought to widen by drafting the constitution of a community which he called The Grotto He probably hated only one man in the world the Archbishop of Salzburg his tormentor one hundred eighty five The moment you do not trust me I shall distrust myself The time is past it is true when I used to stand on the settle sing oragna fiagata fa and kiss the tip end of your nose but have I therefore shown laxity in respect love and obedience I say no more Mannheim February nineteen seventeen seventy nine to his father who was vexed because Mozart was showing a disposition to stay in Mannheim because of a love affair instead of going to Paris Off with you to Paris and soon wrote the father The Italian words are meaningless and but a bit of child s play the nature of which can be gathered from Mozart s remark one hundred eighty six Pray do not let your mind often harbor the thought that I shall ever forget you It is intolerable to me My chief aim in life has been is and will be to strive so that we may soon be reunited and happy Reflect that you have a son who will never consciously forget his filial duty toward you and who will labor ever to grow more worthy of so good a father Mannheim February twenty eight seventeen seventy eight to his father one hundred eighty seven The first thing I did after reading your letter was to go on my knees and out of a full heart thank my dear God for this mercy Now I am again at peace since I know that I need no longer be concerned about the two persons who are the dearest things on earth to me Paris July thirty one seventeen seventy eight to his father who had written that he and Nannerl had comforted each other on the death of his mother one hundred eighty eight Dearest best of fathers I wish you all conceivable good whatever can be wished that I wish you but no I wish you nothing but myself everything For myself then I wish that you remain well and live innumerable years to my great happiness and pleasure I wish that everything that I undertake may agree with your desire and liking or rather that I may undertake nothing which might not turn out to your joy This also I hope for whatever adds to the happiness of your son must naturally be agreeable also to you Vienna November sixteen seventeen eighty one to his father congratulating him on his name day On March seventeen seventeen seventy eight Mozart had written from Mannheim Your accuracy extends to all things Papa comes directly after God was my maxim as a child and I shall stick to it one hundred eighty nine Our little cousin is pretty sensible amiable clever and merry all because she has been in society she visited Munich for a while You are right we suit each other admirably for she too is a bit naughty We play great pranks on the people hereabouts Augsburg October seventeen seventeen seventy seven to his father The little cousin was two years younger than Mozart Her father was a master bookbinder in Augsburg The maiden seems later to have had serious designs on the composer one hundred ninety I shall be right glad when I meet a place in which there is a court I tell you that if I did not have so fine a mister Cousin and Miss Cousin and so dear a little cousin my regrets that I am in Augsburg would be as numerous as the hairs of my head Augsburg October seventeen seventeen seventy seven to his father whose birthplace he was visiting on a concert tour Mozart was vexed at the insolence of the patricians one hundred ninety one In the case of Frau Lange I was a fool that s certain but what is a fellow not when he s in love I did really love her and am not indifferent toward her even now It s lucky for me that her husband is a jealous fool and never permits her to go anywhere so that I seldom see her Vienna May twelve seventeen eighty one to his father at the time when he was being outrageously treated by the Archbishop Frau Lange was Aloysia Weber sister of Constanze to whom Mozart transferred his love and whom he made his wife Aloysia married an actor at the Court Theatre Josef Lange with whom she lived unhappily one hundred ninety two I will not say that when at the house of the Mademoiselle to whom I seem already to have been married off I am morose and silent but neither am I in love I jest with her and amuse her when I have time which is only evenings when I sup at home for in the forenoons I write in my room and in the afternoons I am seldom at home only that and nothing more If I were obliged to marry all the girls with whom I have jested I should have at least two hundred wives Vienna July twenty five seventeen eighty one to his father who had heard all manner of tales concerning the relations of Mozart and Constanze Weber one hundred ninety three My good dear Constanze is the martyr and perhaps for that very reason the best hearted cleverest and in a word the best of them all She assumes all the cares of the house and yet does not seem able to accomplish anything O best of fathers I could write pages if I were to tell you all the scenes that have taken place in this house because of us two Constanze is not ugly but anything but beautiful all her beauty consists of two little black eyes and a handsome figure She is not witty but has enough common sense to be able to perform her duties as wife and mother She is not inclined to finery that is utterly false on the contrary she is generally ill clad for the little that the mother was able to do for her children was done for the other two nothing for her True she likes to be neatly and cleanly though not extravagantly dressed and she can herself make most of the clothes that a woman needs she also dresses her own hair every day understands housekeeping has the best heart in the world tell me could I wish a better wife Vienna December fifteen seventeen eighty one to his father Constanze seems to have been made for Mozart they went through the years of their brief wedded life like two children one hundred ninety four Dearest best of friends Surely you will let me call you that You can not hate me so greatly as not to permit me to be your friend and yourself to become mine And even if you do not want to be my friend longer you can not forbid me to think kindly of you as I have been in the habit of doing Consider well what you said to me today Despite my entreaties you gave me the mitten three times and told me to my face that you would have nothing further to do with me I to whom it is not such a matter of indifference as it is to you to lose a sweetheart am not so hot tempered inconsiderate or unwise as to accept that mitten I love you too dearly for that I therefore beg you to ponder on the cause of your indignation A little confession of your thoughtless conduct would have made all well if you do not take it ill dear friend may still make all well From this you see how much I love you I do not flare up as you do I think I consider and I feel If you have any feeling I am sure that I will be able to say to myself before night Constanze is the virtuous honor loving sensible and faithful sweetheart of just and well meaning Mozart Vienna April twenty nine seventeen eighty two to his fiancee Constanze Weber She had played at a game of forfeits such as was looked upon lightly by the frivolous society of the period in Vienna Mozart rebuked her and she broke off the engagement The letter followed and soon thereafter a reconciliation Mozart had said to her No girl who is jealous of her honor would do such a thing one hundred ninety five She is an honest good girl of decent parents I am able to provide her with bread we love each other and want each other It is better to put one s things to rights and be an honest fellow God will give the reward I do not want to have anything to reproach myself with Vienna July thirty one seventeen eighty two to his father who had given his consent hesitatingly and unwillingly to the marriage of his son who was twenty six years old On August seven Mozart wrote to him I kiss your hands and thank you with all the tenderness which a son should feel for his father for your kind permission and paternal blessing one hundred ninety six If I were to tell you all the things that I do with your portrait you would laugh heartily For instance when I take it out of its prison house I say God bless you Stanzerl God bless you you little rascal Krallerballer Sharpnose little Bagatelle And when I put it back I let it slip down slowly and gradually and say Nu Nu Nu Nu but with the emphasis which this highly significant word demands and at the last quickly Good night little Mouse sleep well Now I suppose I have written down a lot of nonsense at least so the world would think but for us who love each other so tenderly it isn t altogether silly Dresden April thirteen seventeen eighty nine to his wife in Vienna one hundred ninety seven Dear little wife I have a multitude of requests onemo I beg of you not to be sad twodo that you take care of your health and not trust the spring air threetio that you refrain from walking out alone or better do not walk out at all fourto that you rest assured of my love Not a letter have I written to you but that your portrait was placed in front of mine fiveto I beg of you to consider not only my honor and yours in your conduct but also in appearances Do not get angry because of this request You ought to love me all the more because I make so much of honor Dresden April sixteen seventeen eighty nine to his wife in Vienna who was fond of life s pleasures one hundred ninety eight You can not imagine how slowly time goes when you are not with me I can t describe the feeling there is a sort of sense of emptiness which hurts a certain longing which can not be satisfied and hence never ends but grows day by day When I remember how childishly merry we were in Baden and what mournful tedious hours I pass here my work gives me no pleasure because it is not possible as was my wont to chat a few words with you when stopping for a moment If I go to the Clavier and sing something from the opera Die Zauberflote I must stop at once because of my emotions Basta Vienna July seven seventeen ninety one to his wife who was taking the waters at Baden one hundred ninety nine I call only him or her a friend who is a friend under all circumstances who thinks day or night of nothing else than to promote the welfare of a friend who urges all well to do friends and works himself to make the other person happy Kaisersheim December eighteen seventeen seventy eight to his father Mozart was making the journey from Mannheim to Munich in the carriage of a prelate The parting with his Mannheim friends especially with Frau Cannabich his motherly friend was hard For me who never made a more painful parting than this the journey was only half pleasant it would even have been a bore if from childhood I had not been accustomed to leave people countries and cities two hundred Permit me to beg for a continuance of your precious friendship and to ask you to accept mine for now and forever with an honest heart I vow it to you everlastingly True it will be of little use to you but it will be the more durable and honest for that reason You know that the best and truest friends are the poor Rich people know nothing of friendship especially those who are born rich and those who have become rich fortuitously they are too often wrapped up completely in their own luck But there is nothing to fear from a man who has been placed in advantageous circumstances not through blind but deserved good fortune through merit a man who did not lose courage because of his first failures who remained true to his religion and trust in God was a good Christian and an honest man and cherished and valued his true friend in a word a man who has deserved better fortune from such a man there is nothing to fear Paris August seven seventeen seventy eight to his friend Bullinger in Salzburg to whom he felt beholden for the gentle and considerate way in which he had broken the news of his mother s death to the family two hundred one My friend had I but the money which many a man who does not deserve it wastes so miserably if I only had it O with what joy would I not help you But alas those who can will not and those who would like to can not Paris July twenty nine seventeen seventy eight to Fridolin Weber father of Constanze The letter was found but recently among some Goethe autographs WORLDLY WISDOM Mozart s father brought him up to be worldly wise While journeying at a tender age through the world with his father the lad became an eye witness of the paternal business management with all its attention to detail of the art of utilizing persons and conditions in order to achieve material results As a youth he repeats the journeys accompanied by his mother whom he loses by death in Paris Regularly from Salzburg his father sends him letters full of admonitions and advice the subjects almost systematically grouped The worldly wisdom of the son is the fruit of paternal education which he did not outgrow up to the day of his death But life experience was also an educator a seeming distrust of mankind speaks out of many a passage in his letters but on the whole he thought too well of his fellow men and remained blind to the faults of his false friends who basely exploited him for their own ends Although gifted with keen powers of observation he always followed his kind heart instead of his better judgment and his sister spoke no more than the truth when she said after his death Outside of music he was and remained nearly always a child This was the chief trait of his character on its shady side he always needed a father mother or other guardian two hundred two Reflect too on this only too certain truth it is not always wise to do all the things contemplated Often one thinks one thing would be most advisable and another unadvisable and bad when if it were done the opposite results would disclose themselves Mannheim December ten seventeen seventy seven to his father when a plan for an appointment in Mannheim came to naught two hundred three I am not indifferent but only resolved and therefore I can endure everything with patience provided only that neither my honor nor the good name of Mozart shall suffer therefrom Well since it must be so so be it only I beg do not rejoice or sorrow prematurely for let happen what may it will be all right so long as we remain well happiness exists only in the imagination Mannheim November twenty nine seventeen seventy seven to his father who had upbraided him because of his reckless expenditures At the time Mozart was hoping for an appointment at Mannheim two hundred four Dearest and best of fathers You shall see that things go better and better with me What use is this perpetual turmoil this hurried fortune It does not endure Che va piano va sano One must adjust himself to circumstances Vienna December twenty two seventeen eighty one to his father just before Mozart s marriage engagement to Constanze Weber two hundred five Now to put your mind at ease I am doing nothing without reasons and well founded ones too Vienna October twenty one seventeen eighty one to his little cousin who may still have cherished hopes of capturing her merry kinsman two hundred six I have no news except that thirty five fifty nine sixty sixty one sixty two were the winning numbers in the lottery and therefore that if we had played those numbers we would have won but that inasmuch as we did not play those numbers we neither won nor lost but had a good laugh at others Milan October twenty six seventeen seventy one to his sister two hundred seven Everybody was extremely courteous and therefore I was also very courteous for it is my custom to conduct myself towards others as they conduct themselves towards me it s the best way to get along Augsburg October fourteen seventeen seventy seven to his father two hundred eight In Vienna and all the imperial hereditaments the theatres will all open in six weeks It is wisely designed for the dead are not so much benefited by the long mourning as many people are harmed Munich December thirteen seventeen eighty to his father Empress Maria Theresa had died on November twenty nine Mozart had greatly revered her from his youth Nevertheless he takes a practical view of the situation since the production of his opera Idomeneo is imminent He requests of his father to have his black coat thoroughly dusted cleaned and put to rights and to send it to him since everybody would go into mourning and I who will be summoned hither and thither must weep along with the others two hundred nine Rest assured that I am a changed man outside of my health I know of nothing more necessary than money I am certainly not a miser it would be difficult for me to change myself into one and yet the people here think me more disposed to be stingy than prodigal and for a beginning that will suffice So far as pupils are concerned I can have as many as I want but I do not want many I want better pay than the others and therefore I am content with fewer One must put on a few airs at the beginning or one is lost i e one must travel the common road with the many Vienna May twenty six seventeen eighty one to his father two hundred ten Depend confidently on me I am no longer a fool and you will still less believe that I am a wicked and ungrateful son Meanwhile trust my brains and my good heart implicitly and you shall never be sorry How should I have learned to value money I never had enough of it in my hands I remember that once when I had twenty ducats I thought myself rich Need alone teaches the value of money Vienna May twenty six seventeen eighty one to his father two hundred eleven If it were possible that it should vex me I should do my best not to notice it as it is thank God there is no need of my deceiving myself because only the opposite could vex me and I should have had to decline which is always too bad when one is dealing with a grand gentleman Vienna October five seventeen eighty two to his father Mozart had expected to give music lessons to a princess but another teacher was chosen Continuing in the same letter he says I need only tell you his fee and you will easily be able to judge from it the strength of the master four hundred florins His name is Summerer two hundred twelve I shall compose an opera but not in order for the sake of one hundred ducats to see the theatre earn four times as much in a fortnight I shall perform my opera at my own cost and make at least twelve hundred florins in three performances then the director can have the work for fifty ducats If he does not want it I shall have received my pay and can utilize the opera elsewhere I hope that you have never observed a tendency to dishonest dealing in me One ought not to be a bad fellow but neither ought one to be a stupid who is willing to let others benefit from the work which cost him study care and labor and surrender all claims for the future Vienna October five seventeen eighty two to his father Mozart s plans for exploiting his opera were never realized two hundred thirteen Yesterday I dined with the Countess Thun and tomorrow I shall dine with her again I let her hear all that was complete she told me that she would wager her life that everything that I have written up to date would please In such matters I care nothing for the praise or censure of anybody until the whole work has been seen or heard instead I follow my own judgment and feelings Vienna August eight seventeen eighty one to his father The opera in question was Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail two hundred fourteen Magnanimity and gentleness have often reconciled the worst enemies Vienna July eight seventeen ninety one to his wife who had somewhat rudely repulsed the advances of one of the visitors at Baden where she was taking the waters IN SUFFERING It is as difficult to call up in the fancy a picture of a suffering Mozart as a merry Beethoven The effect of melancholy hours is scarcely to be found in Mozart s music When he composed i e according to his own expression speculated while walking up and down revolving musical ideas in his mind and forming them into orderly compositions so that the subsequent transcription was a mechanical occupation which required but little effort he was transported to the realm of tones far from the miseries of this world Nor would his happy disposition permit him long to remain under the influence of grief and care None of the letters which sound notes of despair lacks a jest in which the writer forcibly tears himself away from his gloomy thoughts His sufferings came to him from without the fate of a Beethoven was spared him Others brought him pain his rivals through envy the Archbishop through malevolence the Emperor through ignorance Sufferings of this character challenged opposition and called out his powers presenting to us a Mozart full of temperament and capable of measuring himself with any opponent He never lost hope even when hope seemed most deceptive It is therefore impossible to speak of a suffering Mozart in the sense that we speak of a suffering Beethoven fate was kind even at his death which was preceded by but a brief illness two hundred fifteen I am still full of gall Three times this I do not know what to call him has assailed me to my face with impertinence and abuse of a kind that I did not want to write down my best of fathers and I did not immediately avenge the insult because I thought of you He called me a wretch Buben a licentious fellow told me to get out and I suffered it all feeling that not only my honor but yours as well was attacked but it was your wish I held my tongue Vienna May nine seventeen eighty one to his father who had heard with deep concern of the treatment which his son was enduring at the hands of the Archbishop of Salzburg and who feared for his own position At the close of the letter Mozart writes I want to hear nothing more about Salzburg I hate the archbishop to the verge of madness two hundred sixteen The edifying things which the Archbishop said to me in the three audiences particularly in the last and what I have again been told by this glorious man of God had so admirable a physical effect on me that I had to leave the opera in the evening in the middle of the first act go home and to bed I was in a fever my whole body trembled and I reeled like a drunken man in the street The next day yesterday I remained at home and all forenoon in bed because I had taken the tamarind water Vienna May twelve seventeen eighty one to his father The catastrophe between Mozart and the archbishop is approaching two hundred seventeen Twice the Archbishop gave me the grossest impertinences and I answered not a word more I played for him with the same zeal as if nothing had happened Instead of recognizing the honesty of my service and my desire to please him at the moment when I was expecting something very different he begins a third tirade in the most despicable manner in the world Vienna June thirteen seventeen eighty one to his father See the chapter Self Respect and Honor two hundred eighteen All the world asserts that by my braggadocio and criticisms I have made enemies of the professional musicians Which world Presumably that of Salzburg for anybody living in Vienna sees and hears differently there is my answer Vienna July thirty one to his father who had sent Mozart what the latter called so indifferent and cold a letter when informed by his son of the great success of his opera Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail As on previous occasions Salzburg talebearers had been busying themselves two hundred nineteen I rejoice like a child at the prospect of being with you again I should have to be ashamed of myself if people could look into my heart so far as I am concerned it is cold cold as ice Yes if you were with me I might find greater pleasure in the courteous treatment which I receive from the people but as it is it is all empty Adieu Love Frankfort September thirty seventeen ninety to his wife Mozart had made the journey to Frankfort to give concerts amidst the festivities accompanying the coronation of Leopold II hoping that he could better his financial condition Not having been sent at the cost of the Emperor like other Court musicians he pawned his silver bought a carriage and took with him his brother in law a violinist named Hofer It took us only six days to make the journey He was disappointed in his expectations I have now decided to do as well as I can here and look joyfully towards a meeting with you What a glorious life we shall lead I shall work work two hundred twenty Dreams give me no concern for there is no mortal man on earth who does not sometimes dream But merry dreams quiet refreshing sweet dreams Those are the thing Dreams which if they were realities would make tolerable my life which has more of sadness in it than merriment Munich December thirty one seventeen seventy eight to his father During Mozart s sojourn in Paris the love of Aloysia Weber had grown cold and Mozart was in the dolors two hundred twenty one Happy man Now see I have got to give still another lesson in order to earn some money seventeen eighty six to Gyrowetz on the latter s departure for Italy two hundred twenty two You can not doubt my honesty for you know me too well for that Nor can you be suspicious of my words my conduct or my mode of life because you know my conduct and mode of life Therefore forgive my confidence in you I am still very unhappy always between fear and hope Vienna July seventeen seventeen eighty eight to his faithful friend Puchberg whom he has asked for money on account of the severe illness of his wife two hundred twenty three You know my circumstances to be brief since I can not find a true friend I am obliged to borrow money from usurers But as it takes time to hunt among these un Christian persons for those who are the most Christian and to find them I am so stripped that I must beg you dear friend for God s sake to help me out with what you can spare One of many requests for help sent to Puchberg It was sent in seventeen ninety and the original bears an endorsement May seventeen sent one hundred fifty florins two hundred twenty four If you worthy brother do not help me out of my present predicament I shall lose my credit and honor the only things which I care now to preserve Vienna June twenty seven seventeen eighty eight to Puchberg who had sent him two hundred florins ten days before Puchberg was a brother Mason two hundred twenty five How I felt then How I felt then Such things will never return Now we are sunk in the emptiness of everyday life Remarked on remembering that at the age of fourteen he had composed a Requiem at the command of Empress Maria Theresa and had conducted it as chapelmaster of the imperial orchestra two hundred twenty six Did I not tell you that I was composing this Requiem for myself Said on the day of his death while still working on the Requiem for which he had received so mysterious a commission The work had been ordered by a Count Walsegg who made pretensions to musical composition and who wished to palm it off as a work of his own written in memory of his wife Mozart never knew him two hundred twenty seven I shall not last much longer I am sure that I have been poisoned I can not rid myself of this thought Mozart believed that he had been poisoned by one of his Italian rivals his suspicion falling most strongly on Salieri As regards Mozart Salieri cannot escape censure for though the accusation of having been the cause of his death has been long ago disproved it is more than possible that he was not displeased at the removal of so formidable a rival At any rate though he had it in his power to influence the Emperor in Mozart s favor he not only neglected to do so but even intrigued against him as Mozart himself relates in a letter to his friend Puchberg After his death however Salieri befriended his son and gave him a testimonial which secured him his first appointment C F Pohl in Grove s Dictionary of Music and Musicians two hundred twenty eight Stay with me to night you must see me die I have long had the taste of death on my tongue I smell death and who will stand by my Constanze if you do not stay Reported by his sister in law Sophie sister of Constanze two hundred twenty nine And now I must go just as it had become possible for me to live quietly Now I must leave my art just as I had freed myself from the slavery of fashion had broken the bonds of speculators and won the privilege of following my own feelings and compose freely and independently whatever my heart prompted I must away from my family from my poor children in the moment when I should have been able better to care for their welfare Uttered on his death bed MORALS As regards his manner of life and morals Mozart long stood in a bad light before the world The slanderous stories all came from his enemies in Vienna and a long time passed before their true character was recognized A great contribution to this end was made by the publication of his letters which disclose an extraordinarily strong moral sense The tale of an alleged liaison with a certain Frau Hofdamel as a result of which the deceived husband was said to have committed suicide has been proved to be wholly untrue and without warrant It may be said indeed that Mozart was an exception among the men of his period The immorality of the Viennese was proverbial Karoline Pichler a contemporary writes as follows in her book of recollections of the eighth decade of the eighteenth century In Vienna at the time there reigned a spirit of appreciation for merriment and a susceptibility for every form of beauty and sensuous pleasure There was the greatest freedom of thought and opinion anything could be written and printed which was not in the strictest sense of the words contrary to religion and the state Little thought was bestowed on good morals There was considerable license in the current plays and novels Kotzebue created a tremendous sensation His plays and a multitude of romances and tales Meissner s sketches among other things were all based on meretricious relations All the world and every young girl read them without suspicion or offence More than once had I read and seen these things Oberon was well known to me so was Meissner s Alcibiades No mother hesitated to acquaint her daughter with such works and before our eyes there were so many living exemplars whose irregular conduct was notorious that no mother could have kept her daughter in ignorance had she tried Mozart was a passionate jester and his jokes were coarse enough of that there is no doubt But these things were innocent at the time The letters of the lad to his little cousin in Augsburg contain many passages that would be called of questionable propriety now but the little cousin does not seem to have even blushed The best witness to the morality of Mozart s life is his wife who after his death wrote to the publishing firm of Breitkopf and Hartel His letters are beyond doubt the best criterion for his mode of thought his peculiarities and his education Admirably characteristic is his extraordinary love for me which breathes through all his letters Those of his last year on earth are just as tender as those which he must have written in the first year of our married life is it not so I beg as a particular favor that special attention be called to this fact for the sake of his honor He was a Freemason with all his heart and gave expression to his humanitarian feeling in his opera The Magic Flute Without suspicion himself he thought everybody else good which led to painful experiences with some of his friends two hundred thirty Parents strive to place their children in a position which shall enable them to earn their own living and this they owe to their children and the state The greater the talents with which the children have been endowed by God the more are they bound to make use of those talents to improve the conditions of themselves and their parents to aid their parents and to care for their own present and future welfare We are taught thus to trade with our talents in the Gospels I owe it therefore to God and my conscience to pay the highest gratitude to my father who tirelessly devoted all his hours to my education and to lighten his burdens From his request for dismissal from service in August seventeen seventy seven He wished to undertake an artistic tour with his father He received his dismissal from the Archbishop of Salzburg who granted it right unwillingly however two hundred thirty one Only one thing vexed me a trifle the question whether I had forgotten confession I have no complaint to make but I do ask one favor and that is that you do not think so ill of me I am fond of merriment but believe me I can also be serious Since I left Salzburg and while still in Salzburg I have met persons whose conduct was such that I would have been ashamed to talk and act as they did though they were ten twenty or thirty years older than I Again I humbly beg of you to have a better opinion of me Mannheim December thirty seventeen seventy seven to his father in answer to a letter of reproaches two hundred thirty two With all my heart I do wish Herr von Schiedenhofen joy It is another marriage for money and nothing else I should not like to marry thus I want to make my wife happy not have her make my fortune For that reason I shall not marry but enjoy my golden freedom until I am so situated that I can support wife and children It was necessary that Herr Sch should marry a rich woman that s the consequence of being a nobleman The nobility must never marry from inclination or love but only from considerations of interest and all manner of side considerations Nor would it be becoming in such persons if they were still to love their wives after the latter had done their duty and brought forth a plump heir Mannheim February seven seventeen seventy eight to his father two hundred thirty three In my opinion there is nothing more shameful than to deceive an honest girl Paris July eighteen seventeen seventy eight to his father two hundred thirty four I am unconscious of any guilt for which I might fear your reproaches I have committed no error meaning by error any act unbecoming to a Christian and an honest man I am anticipating the pleasantest and happiest days but only in company with you and my dearest sister I swear to you on my honor that I can not endure Salzburg and its citizens I speak of the natives Their speech and mode of life are utterly intolerable Munich January eight seventeen seventy nine to his father who was urging his return from Paris to take the post of chapelmaster in Salzburg The musicians of Salzburg were notorious because of their loose lives two hundred thirty five From the way in which my last letter was received I observe to my sorrow that just as if I were an arch scoundrel or an ass or both at once you trust the tittle tattle and scribblings of other people more than you do me But I assure you that this does not give me the least concern The people may write the eyes out of their heads and you may applaud them as much as you please it will not cause me to change a hair s breadth I shall remain the same honest fellow that I have always been Vienna September five seventeen eighty one to his father who was still listening to the slander mongers Mozart could not lightly forget the fact that it was due to these gentlemen that he had been forced to leave the house of the widow Weber with whose daughter Constanze he was in love two hundred thirty six You have been deceived in your son if you could believe him capable of doing a mean thing You know that I could not have acted otherwise without outraging my conscience and my honor I beg pardon for my too hasty trust in your paternal love Through this frank confession you have a new proof of my love of truth and detestation of a lie Vienna August seven seventeen eighty two to his father whose consent to his son s marriage did not arrive till the day after two hundred thirty seven Dearest and best of fathers I beg of you for the sake of all that is good in the world give your consent to my marriage with my dear Constanze Do not think that it is alone because of my desire to get married I could well wait But I see that it is absolutely essential to my honor the honor of my sweetheart to my health and frame of mind My heart is ill at ease my mind disturbed then how shall I do any sensible thinking or work Why is this Most people think we are already married this enrages the mother and the poor girl and I are tormented almost to death All this can be easily relieved Believe me it is possible to live as cheaply in expensive Vienna as anywhere else it all depends on the housekeeping and the orderliness which is never to be found in a young man especially if he be in love Whoever gets a wife such as I am going to have can count himself fortunate We shall live simply and quietly and yet be happy Do not worry for should I which God forefend get ill today especially if I were married I wager that the first of the nobility would come to my help I await your consent with longing best of fathers I await it with confidence my honor and fame depend upon it Vienna July twenty seven seventeen eighty two two hundred thirty eight Meanwhile my striving is to secure a small certainty then with the help of the contingencies it will be easy to live here and then to marry I beg of you dearest and best of fathers listen to me I have preferred my request now listen to my reasons The calls of nature are as strong in me perhaps stronger than in many a hulking fellow I can not possibly live like the majority of our young men In the first place I have too much religion in the second too much love for my fellow man and too great a sense of honor ever to betray a girl Vienna December eighteen seventeen eighty one The whole of this letter deserves to be read by those who misled by the reports still deemed trustworthy when Jahn published the first edition of his great biography believed that Mozart was a man of bad morals Unfortunately Mozart s candor in presenting his case to his father can scarcely be adjusted to the requirements of a book designed for general circulation Let it suffice that in his confession to his father Mozart puts himself on the ground of the loftiest sexual purity and stakes life and death on the truthfulness of his statements H E K two hundred thirty nine You surely can not be angry because I want to get married I think and believe that you will recognize best my piety and honorable intentions in the circumstance O I could easily write a long answer to your last letter and offer many objections but my maxim is that it is not worth while to discuss matters that do not affect me I can t help it it s my nature I am really ashamed to defend myself when I find myself falsely accused I always think the truth will out some day Vienna January nine seventeen eighty two to his father In the same letter he continues I can not be happy and contented without my dear Constanze and without your satisfied acquiescence I could only be half happy Therefore make me wholly happy two hundred forty As I have thought and said a thousand times I would gladly leave everything in your hands with the greatest pleasure but since so to speak it is useless to you but to my advantage I deem it my duty to remember my wife and children June sixteen seventeen eighty seven to his sister concerning his inheritance from his father who had died on May twenty eight two hundred forty one Isn t it true that you are daily becoming more convinced of the truth of my corrective sermons Is not the amusement of a fickle and capricious love far as the heavens from the blessedness which true sensible love brings with it Do you not often thank me in your heart for my instruction You will soon make me vain But joking aside you do owe me a modicum of gratitude if you have made yourself worthy of Fraulein N for I certainly did not play the smallest role at your conversion Prague November four seventeen eighty seven to a wealthy young friend name unknown two hundred forty two Pray believe anything you please about me but nothing ill There are persons who believe it is impossible to love a poor girl without harboring wicked intentions and the beautiful word mistress is so lovely I am a Mozart but a young and well meaning Mozart Among many faults I have this that I think that the friends who know me know me Hence many words are not necessary If they do not know me where shall I find words enough It is bad enough that words and letters are necessary Mannheim February twenty two seventeen seventy eight to his father who had rebuked him for falling in love with Aloysia Weber who afterward became his sister in law RELIGION Mozart was of a deeply religious nature reared in Salzburg where his father was a member of the archiepiscopal chapel Throughout his life he remained a faithful son of the church for whose servants however he had little sympathy The one man whom Mozart hated from the bottom of his soul was Archbishop Hieronymus of Salzburg who sought to put all possible obstacles in the way of the youthful genius and finally by the most infamous of acts covered himself everlastingly with infamy Though Mozart frequently speaks angrily and bitterly of the priests he always differentiates between religion the church and their servants Like Beethoven Mozart stood toward God in the relationship of a child full of trust in his father His reliance on Providence was so utter that his words sometimes sound almost fatalistic His father harbored some rationalistic ideas which were even more pronounced in Mozart so that he formed his own opinion concerning ecclesiastical ceremonies and occasionally disregarded them His cheery temperament made it impossible that his religious life should be as profound as that of Beethoven two hundred forty three I hope that with the help of God Miss Martha will get well again If not you should not grieve too deeply for God s will is always the best God will know whether it is better to be in this world or the other Bologna September twenty nine seventeen seventy to his mother and sister in Salzburg The young woman died soon after two hundred forty four Tell papa to put aside his fears I live with God ever before me I recognize His omnipotence I fear His anger I acknowledge His love too His compassion and mercy towards all His creatures He will never desert those who serve Him If matters go according to His will they go according to mine consequently nothing can go wrong I must be satisfied and happy Augsburg October twenty five seventeen seventy seven to his father who was showering him with exhortations on the tour which he made with his mother through South Germany two hundred forty five Let come what will nothing can go ill so long as it is the will of God and that it may so go is my daily prayer Mannheim December six seventeen seventy seven to his father Mozart was waiting with some impatience to learn if he was to receive an appointment from Elector Karl Theodore It did not come two hundred forty six I know myself I know that I have so much religion that I shall never be able to do a thing which I would not be willing openly to do before the whole world only the thought of meeting persons on my journeys whose ideas are radically different from mine and those of all honest people frightens me Aside from that they may do what they please I haven t the heart to travel with them I would not have a single pleasant hour I would not know what to say to them in a word I do not trust them Friends who have no religion are not stable Mannheim February two seventeen seventy eight to his father For the reasons mentioned in the letter Mozart gave up his plan to travel to Paris with the musicians Wendling and Ramen In truth perhaps his love affair with Aloysia Weber may have had something to do with his resolve two hundred forty seven I prayed to God for His mercy that all might go well to His greater glory and the symphony began Immediately after the symphony full of joy I went into the Palais Royal ate an iced cream prayed the rosary as I had promised to do and went home I am always best contented at home and always will be or with a good true honest German Paris July three seventeen seventy eight to his father The symphony in question is no longer in existence although Mozart wanted to write it down again at a later date two hundred forty eight I must tell you my mother my dear mother is no more God has called her to Himself He wanted her I see that clearly and I must submit to God s will He gave her to me and it was His to take her away My friend I am comforted not but now but long ago By a singular grace of God I endured all with steadfastness and composure When her illness grew dangerous I prayed God for two things only a happy hour of death for my mother and strength and courage for myself God heard me in His loving kindness heard my prayer and bestowed the two mercies in largest measure Paris July three seventeen seventy eight to his good friend Bullinger in Salzburg who was commissioned gently to bear the intelligence to Mozart s father At the same time Mozart with considerate deception wrote to his father about his mother s illness without mentioning her death two hundred forty nine I believe and nothing shall ever persuade me differently that no doctor no man no accident can either give life to man or take it away it rests with God alone Those are only the instruments which He generally uses though not always we see men sink down and fall over dead When the time is come no remedies can avail they accelerate death rather than retard it I do not say therefore that my mother will and must die that all hope is gone she may recover and again be well and sound but only if it is God s will Paris July three seventeen seventy eight to his father from whom he is concealing the fact that his mother is dead He is seeking to prepare him for the intelligence which he has already commissioned Bullinger to convey to the family two hundred fifty Under those melancholy circumstances I comforted myself with three things viz my complete and trustful submission to the will of God then the realization of her easy and beautiful death combined with the thought of the happiness which was to come to her in a moment how much happier she now is than we so that we might even have wished to make the journey with her Out of this wish and desire there was developed my third comfort namely that she is not lost to us forever that we shall see her again that we shall be together more joyous and happy than ever we were in this world It is only the time that is unknown and that fact does not frighten me When it is God s will it shall be mine Only the divine the most sacred will be done let us then pray a devout Our Father for her soul and proceed to other matters everything has its time Paris July nine seventeen seventy eight to his father informing him of his mother s death two hundred fifty one Be without concern touching my soul s welfare best of fathers I am an erring young man like so many others but I can say to my own comfort that I wish all were as little erring as I You perhaps believe things about me which are not true My chief fault is that I do not always appear to act as I ought It is not true that I boasted that I eat fish every fast day but I did say that I was indifferent on the subject and did not consider it a sin for in my case fasting means breaking off eating less than usual I hear mass every Sunday and holy day and when it is possible on week days also you know that my father Vienna June thirteen seventeen eighty one another attempt at justification against slander two hundred fifty two Moreover take the assurance that I certainly am religious and if I should ever have the misfortune which God will forefend to go astray I shall acquit you best of fathers from all blame I alone would be the scoundrel to you I owe all my spiritual and temporal welfare and salvation Vienna June thirteen seventeen eighty one two hundred fifty three For a considerable time before we were married we went together to Holy Mass to confession and to communion and I found that I never prayed so fervently confessed and communicated so devoutly as when I was at her side and her experience was the same In a word we were made for each other and God who ordains all things and consequently has ordained this will not desert us We both thank you obediently for your paternal blessing Vienna August seventeen seventeen eighty two two hundred fifty four I have made it a habit in all things to imagine the worst Inasmuch as strictly speaking death is the real aim of our life I have for the past few years made myself acquainted with this true best friend of mankind so that the vision not only has no terror for me but much that is quieting and comforting And I thank my God that He gave me the happiness and the opportunity you understand me to learn to know Him as the key to true blessedness Vienna April four seventeen eighty seven to his father who died on the twenty eighth of the following month One of the few passages in Mozart s letters in which there are suggestions of the teachings of Freemasonry In seventeen eighty five he had persuaded his father to join the order with the result that new warmth was restored to the relationship which had cooled somewhat after Mozart s marriage two hundred fifty five To me that again is art twaddle There may be something true in it for you enlightened Protestants as you call yourselves when you have your religion in your heads I can not tell But you do not feel what Agnus Dei qui tollis peccata mundi and such things mean But when one like I has been initiated from earliest childhood in the mystical sanctuary of our religion when there one does not know whither to go with all the vague but urgent feelings but waits with a heart full of devotion for the divine service without really knowing what to expect yet rises lightened and uplifted without knowing what one has received when one deemed those fortunate who knelt under the touching strains of the Agnus Dei and received the sacrament and at the moment of reception the music spoke in gentle joy from the hearts of the kneeling ones Benedictus qui venit et cetera then it is a different matter True it is lost in the hurly burly of life but at least it is so in my case when you take up the words which you have heard a thousand times for the purpose of setting them to music everything comes back and you feel your soul moved again Spoken in Leipsic in seventeen eighty nine when somebody expressed pity for those capable musicians who were obliged to employ their powers on ecclesiastical subjects which were mostly not only unfruitful but intellectually killing Rochlitz reports the utterance but does not vouch for its literalness End of The Project Gutenberg eText of Mozart The Man and the Artist as Revealed in his own Words by Kerst
