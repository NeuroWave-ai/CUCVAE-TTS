8009-283568-0000	train-other-500	In the city where Davy lived the storm played all manner of pranks swooping down upon unwary old gentlemen and turning their umbrellas wrong side out and sometimes blowing their hats quite out of sight
8009-283568-0001	train-other-500	and as for the old ladies who chanced to be out of doors the wind came upon them
none	none	 suddenly from around corners and blew the snow into their faces 
8009-283568-0002	train-other-500	and twisted their petticoats about their ankles and even whirled the old ladies themselves about in a very painful way And in the country where Davy had come to pass Christmas with his dear old grandmother
8009-283568-0003	train-other-500	things were not much better but here people were very wise about the weather and stayed in doors huddled around great blazing wood fires and the storm finding no live game buried up the roads and the fences
8009-283568-0004	train-other-500	and such small fry of houses as could readily be put out of sight and howled and roared over the fields and through the trees in a fashion not to be forgotten Davy being of the opinion that a snow storm
8009-283568-0005	train-other-500	was a thing not to be wasted had been out with his sled trying to have a little fun with the weather but presently discovering that this particular storm was not friendly to little boys
8009-283568-0006	train-other-500	he had retreated into the house and having put his hat and his high shoes and his mittens by the kitchen fire to dry he began to find his time hang heavily on his hands
8009-283568-0007	train-other-500	He had wandered idly all over the house and had tried how cold his nose could be made by holding it against the window panes
none	none	 and I am sorry to say had even been sliding down 
8009-283568-0008	train-other-500	the balusters and teasing the cat and at last as evening was coming on had curled himself up in the big easy chair facing the fire
8009-283568-0009	train-other-500	and had begun to read once more about the marvellous things that happened to little Alice in Wonderland Then as it grew darker he laid aside the book and sat watching the blazing logs
8009-283568-0010	train-other-500	and listening to the solemn ticking of the high Dutch clock against the wall Then there stole in at the door a delicious odor of dinner cooking downstairs an odor so promising as to roast chickens
8009-283568-0011	train-other-500	and baked potatoes and gravy and pie as to make any little boy s mouth water and presently Davy began softly telling himself what he would choose for his dinner He had quite finished fancying the first part of his feast
8009-283568-0012	train-other-500	and was just coming in his mind to an extra large slice of apple pie well browned staring meanwhile very hard at one of the brass knobs of the andirons to keep his thoughts from wandering
8009-283568-0013	train-other-500	when he suddenly discovered a little man perched upon that identical knob and smiling at him with all his might This little man was a very curious looking person indeed
8009-283568-0014	train-other-500	He was only about a foot high but his head was as big as a cocoanut and he had great bulging eyes like a frog and a ridiculous turned up nose His legs were as slender as spindles and he had long pointed toes
none	none	 to his shoes or rather to his stockings or for that matter to his trousers for they were all of a piece and bright scarlet in color as were also his little coat and his high pointed hat and a queer little cloak that hung over his shoulder His mouth was so wide that when he smiled it seemed to go quite behind his ears 
8009-283568-0015	train-other-500	and there was no way of knowing where the smile ended except by looking at it from behind which Davy couldn t do as yet without getting into the fire
none	none	 Now there s no use in denying that Davy was frightened 
8009-283568-0016	train-other-500	The fact is he was frightened almost out of his wits particularly when he saw that the little man still smiling furiously
none	none	 was carefully picking the hottest and reddest embers out of the fire 
8009-283568-0017	train-other-500	and after cracking them like nuts with his teeth eating them with great relish Davy watched this alarming meal expecting every moment to see the little man burst into a blaze and disappear but he finished his coals in safety
none	none	 and then nodding cheerfully at Davy said 
8009-283568-0018	train-other-500	I know you Do you said Davy faintly Oh yes said the little man
none	none	 I know you perfectly well 
8009-283568-0019	train-other-500	You are the little boy who doesn t believe in fairies nor in giants nor in goblins
none	none	 nor in anything the story books tell you 
8009-283568-0020	train-other-500	Now the truth was that Davy having never met any giants when he was out walking nor seen any fairies peeping out of the bushes in the garden
none	none	 nor found any goblins sitting on the bedposts about the house had come to believe that all these kinds of people 
8009-283568-0021	train-other-500	were purely imaginary beings so that now he could do nothing but stare at the little man in a shamefaced sort of way and wonder what was coming next Now all that said the little man
8009-283568-0022	train-other-500	shaking his finger at him in a reproving way all that is very foolish and very wrong I m a goblin myself a hobgoblin and I ve come to take you
none	none	 on a Believing Voyage Oh 
8009-283568-0023	train-other-500	if you please I can t go cried Davy in great alarm at this proposal
none	none	 I can t indeed I haven t permission 
8009-283568-0024	train-other-500	Rubbish
none	none	 said the Goblin Ask the Colonel Now the Colonel was nothing more nor less than a silly looking little man made of lead 
8009-283568-0025	train-other-500	that stood on the mantel shelf holding a clock in his arms The clock never went but for that matter the Colonel never went either for he had been standing stock still
8009-283568-0026	train-other-500	for years and it seemed perfectly ridiculous to ask him anything about going anywhere so Davy felt quite safe in looking up at him and asking permission to go on the Believing Voyage To his dismay
8009-283568-0027	train-other-500	the Colonel nodded his head and cried out in a little cracked voice
none	none	 Why certainly 
8009-283568-0028	train-other-500	At this the Goblin jumped down off the knob of the andiron and skipping briskly across the room to the big Dutch clock rapped sharply on the front of the case with his knuckles when to Davy s amazement
8009-283568-0029	train-other-500	the great thing fell over on its face upon the floor as softly as if it had been a feather bed
none	none	 Davy now saw that instead of being full of weights and brass wheels and curious works as he had always supposed the clock was really a sort of boat with a wide seat at each end 
8009-283568-0030	train-other-500	but before he had time to make any further discoveries
none	none	 the Goblin who had vanished for a moment 
8009-283568-0031	train-other-500	suddenly reappeared carrying two large sponge cakes in his arms Now Davy was perfectly sure that he had seen his grandmother putting those very sponge cakes into the oven to bake
none	none	 but before he could utter a word of remonstrance 
8009-283568-0032	train-other-500	the Goblin clapped one into each seat and scrambling into the clock sat down upon the smaller one merely remarking
none	none	 They make prime cushions you know and we can eat em afterwards For a moment Davy had a wild idea of rushing out of the room and calling for help but the Goblin seemed so pleased with the arrangements he had made and moreover was smiling so good naturedly that the little boy thought better of it and after a moment s hesitation climbed into the clock and took his seat upon the other cake It was as warm and springy and smelt as deliciously as a morning in May Then there was a whizzing sound like a lot of wheels spinning around and the clock rose from the floor and made a great swoop toward the window I ll steer shouted the Goblin and do you look out sharp for cats and dogs and Davy had just time to notice that the Colonel was hastily scrambling down from the mantel shelf with his beloved timepiece in his arms when they seated in the long Dutch clock dashed through the window and out into the night Illustration I LL STEER SAID THE GOBLIN CHAPTER II THE BEGINNING OF THE BELIEVING VOYAGE The first thought that came into Davy s mind when he found himself out of doors was that he had started off on his journey without his hat and he was therefore exceedingly pleased to find that it had stopped snowing and that the air was quite still 
8337-283569-0001	train-other-500	and delightfully balmy and soft The moon was shining brightly and as he looked back at the house he was surprised to see that the window through which they had come
8337-283569-0002	train-other-500	and which he was quite sure had always been a straight up and down old fashioned window was now a round affair
none	none	 with flaps running to a point in the centre like the holes the harlequin jumps through in the pantomime How did that window ever get changed into a round hole he asked the Goblin pointing to it in great astonishment Oh said the Goblin carelessly that s one of the circular singumstances that happen on a Believing Voyage It s nothing to what you ll see before we come back again Ah he added there comes the Colonel Sure enough at this moment the Colonel s head appeared through the flaps The clock was still in his arms 
8337-283569-0003	train-other-500	and he seemed to be having a great deal of trouble in getting it through and his head kept coming into view and then disappearing again behind the flaps in so ridiculous a manner
8337-283569-0004	train-other-500	that Davy shouted with laughter and the Goblin smiled harder than ever Suddenly the poor little man made a desperate plunge and had almost made his way
8337-283569-0005	train-other-500	out when the flaps shut to with a loud snap and caught him about the waist In his efforts to free himself he dropped his clock to the ground outside
none	none	 when it burst with a loud explosion and the house instantly disappeared Illustration NEXT CAME MARY FARINA This was so unexpected and seemed so serious a matter that Davy was much distressed wondering what had become of his dear old grandmother and missus Frump the cook and Mary Farina 
8337-283569-0006	train-other-500	the housemaid and Solomon the cat However before he had time to make any inquiries of the Goblin his grandmother came dropping down through the air in her rocking chair
8337-283569-0007	train-other-500	She was quietly knitting and her chair was gently rocking as she went by Next came missus Frump with her apron quite full of kettles and pots and then Mary Farina
8337-283569-0008	train-other-500	sitting on a step ladder with the coal scuttle in her lap Solomon was nowhere to be seen Davy looking over the side of the clock saw them disappear one
8337-283569-0009	train-other-500	after the other in a large tree on the lawn and the Goblin informed him that they had fallen into the kitchen of a witch hazel tree and would be well taken care of Indeed
8337-283569-0010	train-other-500	as the clock sailed over the tree Davy saw that the trunk of it was hollow and that a bright light was shining far underground and to make the matter quite sure a smell of cooking was coming up through the hole
none	none	 On one of the topmost boughs of the tree was a nest with two sparrows in it 
8337-283569-0011	train-other-500	and he was much astonished at discovering
none	none	 that they were lying side by side 
8337-283569-0012	train-other-500	fast asleep with one of his mittens spread over them for a coverlet
none	none	 I am sorry to say that Davy knew perfectly well where the other mitten was and was ashamed to say anything about it Illustration THE RABBIT TAKES LIBERTIES WITH DAVY S PROPERTY I suppose my shoes are somewhere about he said sadly Perhaps the squirrels are filling them with nuts You re quite right replied the Goblin cheerfully and there s a rabbit over by the hedge putting dried leaves into your hat I rather fancy he s about moving into it for the winter Davy was about to complain against such liberties being taken with his property when the clock began rolling over in the air and he had just time to grasp the sides of it to keep himself from falling out 
8337-283569-0013	train-other-500	Don t be afraid cried the Goblin she s only rolling a little and as he said this the clock steadied itself and sailed serenely away past the spire of the village church
8337-283569-0025	train-other-500	and as he said this
none	none	 the clock steadied itself and sailed serenely away past the spire of the village church and off over the fields Davy now noticed that the Goblin was glowing with a bright rosy light as though a number of candles were burning in his stomach and shining out through his scarlet clothes That s the coals he had for his supper thought Davy but 
8337-283569-0014	train-other-500	as the Goblin continued to smile complacently and seemed to be feeling quite comfortable he did not venture to ask any questions and went on with his thoughts
none	none	 I suppose he ll soon have smoke coming out of his nose 
8337-283569-0015	train-other-500	as if he were a stove
none	none	 If it were a cold night I d ask him to come and sit in my lap 
8337-283569-0016	train-other-500	I think he must be as warm as a piece of toast and the little boy was laughing softly to himself over this conceit when the Goblin who had been staring intently at the sky
8337-283569-0017	train-other-500	suddenly ducked his head and cried
none	none	 Squalls and the next moment the air was filled with cats falling in a perfect shower from the sky They were of all sizes and colors big cats little cats black cats white cats gray cats yellow spotted 
8337-283569-0018	train-other-500	and brindle cats and at least a
none	none	 dozen of them fell sprawling 
8337-283569-0019	train-other-500	into the clock Among them to Davy s dismay was Solomon
none	none	 with the other mitten drawn over his head and the thumb sticking straight up like a horn This gave him a very extraordinary appearance and the other cats evidently regarded him with the gravest distrust 
8337-283569-0020	train-other-500	as they clustered together at Davy s end of the clock leaving Solomon standing quite alone and complaining in a muffled
none	none	 voice as he tugged frantically at the mitten 
8337-283569-0021	train-other-500	Don t scold so much said the Goblin impatiently Now Davy would never have teased Solomon if he had had the slightest idea that cats could talk
8337-283569-0022	train-other-500	and he was dreadfully mortified when Solomon cried out excitedly
none	none	 Scold I should think I had enough to scold about to day I ve had bits of worsted tied on to my tail and I ve had some milk with pepper in it and I ve had pill boxes stuck on to my feet so that I fell heels over head downstairs let alone having this nightcap on All this was certainly enough to scold about but what else Solomon had to complain of will never be known for at this moment an old 
8337-283569-0023	train-other-500	tabby cat screamed out Barkers and all the cats sprang over the side of the clock and disappeared with Solomon bringing up the rear like a little unicorn
none	none	 I think it sounds very ridiculous for a cat to talk in that way said Davy uneasily Yes but it sounds very true for all that said the Goblin gravely But it was such fun you know 
8337-283569-0024	train-other-500	said Davy feeling that he was blushing violently
none	none	 Oh I dare say Fun for you said the Goblin sarcastically Jolligong Here come the Barkers he added and as he said this a shower of little blue woolly balls came tumbling into the clock 
8337-283569-0026	train-other-500	To Davy s alarm they proved to be alive and immediately began scrambling about in all directions
none	none	 and yelping so ferociously that he climbed up on his cake in dismay while the Goblin hastily pulling a large magnifying glass out of his hat began attentively examining these strange visitors 
8337-283569-0027	train-other-500	Bless me cried the Goblin turning very pale they re sky terriers The dog star must have turned upside down What shall we do said Davy
none	none	 feeling that this was a very bad state of affairs The first thing to do said the Goblin is to get away from these fellows before the solar sisters come after them 
8337-283569-0028	train-other-500	Here jump into my hat So many wonderful things had happened already
none	none	 that this seemed to Davy quite a natural and proper thing to do 
8337-283569-0029	train-other-500	and as the Goblin had already seated himself upon the brim he took his place opposite to him without hesitation As they sailed away from the clock
8337-283569-0030	train-other-500	it quietly rolled over once
none	none	 spilling out the sponge cakes and all the little dogs 
8337-283569-0031	train-other-500	and was then wafted off gently rocking from side to side as it went Davy was much surprised at finding that the hat was as large as a clothes hamper
none	none	 with plenty of room for him to swing his legs about in the crown It proved however to be a very unpleasant thing to travel in It spun around like a 
8337-283569-0032	train-other-500	top as it sailed through the air until Davy began to feel uncomfortably dizzy and the Goblin himself seemed to be far from well He had stopped smiling
8337-283569-0033	train-other-500	and the rosy light had all faded away as though the candles inside of him had gone out His clothes too had changed from bright scarlet to a
8337-283569-0034	train-other-500	dull ashen color and he sat stupidly upon the brim of the hat as if he were going to sleep
none	none	 If he goes to sleep he will certainly fall overboard 
8337-283569-0035	train-other-500	thought Davy and with a view to rousing the Goblin he ventured to remark I had no idea your hat was so big I can make it any size I please
8337-283569-0036	train-other-500	from a thimble to a sentry box said the Goblin And speaking of sentry boxes here he stopped and looked more stupid than ever
none	none	 I verily believe he s absent minded said Davy to himself I m worse than that said the Goblin 
8337-283569-0037	train-other-500	as if Davy had spoken aloud I m absent bodied and with these words he fell out of the hat and
none	none	 instantly disappeared Davy peered anxiously over the edge of the brim but the Goblin was nowhere to be seen and the little boy found himself quite alone Illustration I M A COCKALORUM HE SOFTLY MURMURED Strange looking birds now began to swoop up and chuckle at him and others flew around him as the hat spun along through the air gravely staring him in the face for a while 
8337-283569-0038	train-other-500	and then sailed away sadly bleating like sheep Then a great creature with rumpled feathers
none	none	 perched upon the brim of the hat where the Goblin had been sitting and after solemnly gazing at him for a few moments softly murmured I m a Cockalorum 
8337-283569-0039	train-other-500	and flew heavily away All this was very sad and distressing and Davy was mournfully wondering what would happen to him next when
8337-283569-0040	train-other-500	it suddenly struck him that his legs were feeling very cold and looking down at them he discovered to his great alarm that the crown of the Goblin s hat
8337-283569-0041	train-other-500	had entirely disappeared leaving nothing but the brim upon which he was sitting He hurriedly examined this and found the hat was really nothing
none	none	 but an enormous skein of wool which was rapidly unwinding as it spun along 
8337-283569-0042	train-other-500	Indeed the brim was disappearing at such a rate
none	none	 that he had hardly made this alarming discovery before the end of the skein was 
8337-283569-0043	train-other-500	whisked away and he found himself falling through the air He was on the point of screaming out in his terror
8337-283569-0044	train-other-500	when he discovered that he was falling very slowly and gently swaying from side to side like a toy balloon The next moment he struck something hard
none	none	 which gave way with a sound like breaking glass and let him through and he had just time to notice that the air had suddenly become deliciously scented with vanilla when he fell crashing into the branches of a large tree CHAPTER III IN THE SUGAR PLUM GARDEN The bough upon which Davy had fallen bent far down with his weight then sprang back then bent again and in this way fell into a sort of delightful up and down dipping motion which he found very soothing and agreeable Indeed he was so pleased and comforted at finding himself near the ground once more that he lay back in a crotch between two branches enjoying the rocking of the bough and lazily wondering what had become of the Goblin and whether this was the end of the Believing Voyage and a great many other things until he chanced to wonder where he was Then he sat up on the branch in great astonishment for he saw that the tree was in full leaf and loaded with plums and it flashed across his mind that the winter had disappeared very suddenly and that he had fallen into a place where it was broad daylight The plum tree was the most beautiful and wonderful thing he had ever seen for the leaves were perfectly white and the plums which looked extremely delicious were of every imaginable color Now it immediately occurred to Davy that he had never in his whole life had all the plums he wanted at any one time Here was a rare chance for a feast and he carefully selected the largest and most luscious looking plum he could find to begin with To his disappointment it proved to be quite hard and as solid and heavy as a stone He was looking at it in great perplexity and punching it with his thumbs in the hope of finding a soft place in it when he heard a rustling sound among the leaves and looking up he saw the Cockalorum perched upon the bough beside him He was gazing sadly at the plum and his feathers were more rumpled than ever Presently he gave a long sigh and said in his low murmuring voice Perhaps it s a sugar plum and then flew clumsily away as before Perhaps it is exclaimed Davy joyfully taking a great bite of the plum To his surprise and disgust he found his mouth full of very bad tasting soap and at the same moment the white leaves of the plum tree suddenly turned over and showed the words APRIL FOOL printed very distinctly on their under sides To make the matter worse the Cockalorum came back and flew slowly around the branches laughing softly to himself with a sort of a chuckling sound until Davy almost crying with disappointment and mortification scrambled down from the tree to the ground He found himself in a large garden planted with plum trees like the one he had fallen into and with walks winding about among them in every direction These walks were beautifully paved with sugar almonds and bordered by long rows of many colored motto papers neatly planted in the ground He was too much distressed however by what had happened in the plum tree to be interested or pleased with this discovery and was about walking away along one of the paths in the hope of finding his way out of the garden when he suddenly caught sight of a small figure standing a little distance from him He was the strangest looking creature Davy had ever seen not even excepting the Goblin In the first place he was as flat as a pancake and about as thick as one and in the second place he was so transparent that Davy could see through his head and his arms and his legs almost as clearly as though he had been made of glass This was so surprising in itself that when Davy presently discovered that he was made of beautiful clear lemon candy it seemed the most natural thing in the world as explaining his transparency He was neatly dressed in a sort of tunic of writing paper with a cocked hat of the same material and he had under his arm a large book with the words HOLE KEEPER S VACUUM printed on the cover This curious looking creature was standing before an extremely high wall with his back to Davy intently watching a large hole in the wall about a foot from the ground There was nothing extraordinary about the appearance of the hole except that the lower edge of it was curiously tied in a large bow knot like a cravat but Davy watched it carefully for a few moments thinking that perhaps something marvellous would come out of it Nothing appeared however and Davy walking up close behind the candy man said very politely If you please sir I dropped in here Before he could finish the sentence the Hole keeper said snappishly Well drop out again quick But pleaded Davy you can t drop out of a place you know unless the place should happen to turn upside down I don t know anything about it replied the Hole keeper without moving I never saw anything drop except once Then I saw a gum drop Are you a gum he added suddenly turning around and staring at Davy Of course I m not said Davy indignantly If you ll only listen to me you ll understand exactly how it happened Well go on said the Hole keeper impatiently and don t be tiresome I fell down ever so far said Davy beginning his story over again and at last I broke through something That was the skylight shrieked the Hole keeper dashing his book upon the ground in a fury That was the barley sugar skylight and I shall certainly be boiled This was such a shocking idea that Davy stood speechless staring at the Hole keeper who rushed to and fro in a convulsion of distress Now see here said the Hole keeper at length coming up to him and speaking in a low trembling voice This must be a private secret between us Do you solemsy promilse I prolemse said Davy earnestly This wasn t at all what he meant to say and it sounded very ridiculous but somehow the words wouldn t come straight The Hole keeper however seemed perfectly satisfied and picking up his book said Well just wait till I can t find your name and began hurriedly turning over the leaves Davy saw to his astonishment that there was nothing whatever in the book all the leaves being perfectly blank and he couldn t help saying rather contemptuously How do you expect to find my name in that book There s nothing in it Ah that s just it you see said the Hole keeper exultingly I look in it for the names that ought to be out of it It s the completest system that ever was invented Oh here you aren t he added staring with great satisfaction at one of the blank pages Your name is Rupsy Frimbles It s nothing of the sort said Davy indignantly Tut Tut said the Hole keeper Don t stop to contradict or you ll be too late and Davy felt himself gently lifted off his feet and pushed head foremost into the hole It was quite dark and rather sticky and smelt strongly of burnt sugar and Davy had a most unpleasant time of it crawling through on his hands and knees To add to his distress when he came out at the further end instead of being as he had hoped in the open country he found himself in a large room with a lofty ceiling through which a brilliant light was mysteriously shining The floor was of tin and greased to such a slippery degree that Davy could hardly keep his feet and against the walls on all sides were ranged long rows of little tin chairs glistening like silver in the dazzling light The only person in the room was a little man something like the Hole keeper in appearance but denser and darker in the way of complexion and dressed in a brown paper tunic and cocked hat This little creature was carrying a pail and apparently varnishing the chairs with a little swab as he moved swiftly about the room and as he came nearer Davy determined to speak to him If you please he began The little man jumped back apparently in the greatest alarm and after a startled look at Davy shuffled rapidly away and disappeared through a door at the further end of the room The next moment a confused sound of harsh voices came through the door and the little man reappeared followed by a perfect swarm of creatures so exactly like himself that it seemed to Davy as if a thousand of him had come back At this moment a voice called out Bring Frungles this way and the crowd gathered around him and began to rudely hustle him across the room That s not my name cried Davy struggling desperately to free himself It isn t even the name I came in with Illustration THE CROWD BEGAN TO HUSTLE HIM ACROSS THE ROOM Tut Tut said a trembling voice near him and Davy caught sight of the Hole keeper also struggling in the midst of the crowd with his great book hugged tightly to his breast What does it all mean said Davy anxiously It means that we are to be taken before the king said the Hole keeper in an agitated voice Don t say a word until you are spoken to and then keep perfectly still and the next moment they were dragged up to a low platform where the king was sitting on a gorgeous tin throne He was precisely like the rest of the creatures except that he was a little larger and wore a blue paper coat and a sparkling tin crown and held in his hand a long white wand with red lines running screw wise around it like a barber s pole He stared at Davy and the Hole keeper for a moment and then called out Are the chairs buttered They are shouted the crowd like one man Then sit down roared the king The crowd shuffled off in all directions and then engaged in a confused struggle for the chairs They fought desperately for a few moments tearing each others shirts and screaming out hoarse little squawks of pain while the king thumped furiously with his wand and the Hole keeper trembled like a leaf At last all were seated and the hubbub ceased and the king frowning savagely at the Hole keeper exclaimed in a terrible voice Who broke the barley sugar skylight The Hole keeper began fumbling at the leaves of his book in great agitation when the king pointing at him with his wand roared furiously Boil him at all events Tut Tut your majesty began the Hole keeper confusedly with his stiff little tunic fairly rustling with fright but before he could utter another word he was rushed upon and dragged away screaming with terror Don t you go with them shouted Davy made really desperate by the Hole keeper s danger They re nothing but a lot of molasses candy At this the king gave a frightful shriek and aiming a furious blow at Davy with his wand rolled off the platform into the midst of the struggling crowd The wand broke into a hundred pieces and the air was instantly filled with a choking odor of peppermint then everything was wrapped in darkness and Davy felt himself being whirled along heels over head through the air Then there came a confused sound of bells and voices and he found himself running rapidly down a long street with the Goblin at his side CHAPTER IV THE BUTTERSCOTCHMEN Bells were pealing and tolling in all directions and the air was filled with the sound of distant shouts and cries What were they asked Davy breathlessly Butterscotchmen said the Goblin You see they always butter their chairs so that they won t stick fast when they sit down And what makes you that color said Davy suddenly noticing that the Goblin had changed his color to a beautiful blue Trouble and worry said the Goblin I always get blue when the Butterscotchmen are after me Are they coming after us now inquired Davy in great alarm Of course they are said the Goblin But the best of it is they can t run till they get warm and they can t get warm without running you see But the worst of it is that we can t stop without sticking fast he added anxiously We must keep it up until we get to the Amuserum What s that said Davy It s a place they have to amuse themselves with said the Goblin curiosities and all that sort of thing you know By the way how much money have you We have to pay to get in Illustration BELLS WERE PEALING IN ALL DIRECTIONS Davy began to feel in his pockets which is a very difficult thing to do when you re running fast and found to his astonishment that they were completely filled with a most extraordinary lot of rubbish First he pulled out what seemed to be an iron ball but it proved to be a hard boiled egg without the shell stuck full of small tacks Then came two slices of toast firmly tied together with a green cord Then came a curious little glass jar filled with large flies As Davy took this out of his pocket the cork came out with a loud pop and the flies flew away in all directions Then came one after another a tart filled with gravel two chicken bones a bird s nest with some pieces of brown soap in it some mustard in a pill box and a cake of beeswax stuck full of caraway seeds Davy remembered afterward that as he threw these things away they arranged themselves in a long row on the curb stone of the street The Goblin looked on with great interest as Davy fished them up out of his pockets and finally said enviously That s a splendid collection where did they all come from I m sure I don t know said Davy in great bewilderment And I m sure I don t know repeated the Goblin What else is there Davy felt about in his pockets again and found what seemed to be a piece of money On taking it out however he was mortified to find that it was nothing but an old button but the Goblin exclaimed in a tone of great satisfaction Ah hold on to that and ran on faster than ever The sound of the distant voices had grown fainter and fainter still and Davy was just hoping that their long run was almost over when the street came abruptly to an end at a brick wall over the top of which he could see the branches of trees There was a small round hole in the wall with the words PAY HERE printed above it and the Goblin whispered to Davy to hand in the button through this hole Davy did so feeling very much ashamed of himself when to his surprise instead of receiving tickets in return he heard a loud exclamation behind the wall followed by a confused sound of scuffling and the hole suddenly disappeared The next moment a little bell tinkled and the wall rose slowly before them like a curtain carrying the trees with it apparently and he and the Goblin were left standing in a large open space paved with stone Davy was exceedingly alarmed at seeing a dense mass of Butterscotchmen in the centre of the square pushing and crowding one another in a very quarrelsome manner and chattering like a flock of magpies and he was just about to propose a hasty retreat when a figure came hurrying through the square carrying on a pole a large placard bearing the words JUST RECEIVED THE GREAT FRUNGLES THING ON EXHIBITION IN THE PLUM GARDEN At the sight of these words the mob set up a terrific shout and began streaming out of the square after the pole bearer like a flock of sheep jostling and shoving one another as they went and leaving Davy and the Goblin quite alone I verily believe they re gone to look at my button cried Davy beginning to laugh in spite of his fears They called me Frungles you know That s rather a nice name said the Goblin who had begun smiling again It s better than Snubgraddle at all events Let s have a look at the curiosities and here he walked boldly into the centre of the square Davy followed close at his heels and found to his astonishment and disappointment that the curiosities were simply the things that he had fished out of his pockets but a few minutes before placed on little pedestals and carefully protected by transparent sugar shades He was on the point of laughing outright at this ridiculous exhibition when he saw that the Goblin had taken a large telescope out of his pocket and was examining the different objects with the closest attention and muttering to himself Wonderful wonderful as if he had never seen anything like them before Illustration THE GOBLIN TURNED HIS TELESCOPE TOWARD HIM Pooh said Davy contemptuously the only wonderful thing about them is how they ever came here At this remark the Goblin turned his telescope toward Davy and uttered a faint cry of surprise and Davy peering anxiously through the large end saw him suddenly shrink to the size of a small beetle and then disappear altogether Davy hastily reached out with his hands to grasp the telescope and found himself staring through a round glass window into a farm yard where a red Cow stood gazing up at him CHAPTER V JACK AND THE BEAN STALK S FARM It was quite an ordinary looking farm yard and quite an ordinary looking Cow but she stared so earnestly up at Davy 
8422-283572-0001	train-other-500	that he felt positively certain she had something to say to him Every creature I meet does have something to say he thought as he felt about for the window fastening and I should really like to hear a Cow
none	none	 and just at this moment the window suddenly flew open and he pitched head foremost out upon a pile of hay in the farm yard and rolled from it off upon the ground As he sat up feeling exceedingly foolish 
8422-283572-0002	train-other-500	he looked anxiously at the Cow expecting to see her laughing at his misfortune but she stood gazing at him with a very serious expression of countenance solemnly chewing
8422-283572-0003	train-other-500	and slowly swishing her tail from side to side As Davy really didn t know how to begin a conversation with a Cow he waited for her to speak first and there was consequently a long pause
8422-283572-0004	train-other-500	Presently the Cow said in a melancholy lowing tone of voice The old gray goose is dead I m very sorry said Davy not knowing what else to say
none	none	 She is 
8422-283572-0005	train-other-500	said the Cow positively and we ve buried her in the vegetable garden We thought gooseberries would come up but
8422-283572-0006	train-other-500	they didn t Nothing came up but feathers That s very curious said Davy Curious but comfortable replied the Cow You see
8422-283572-0007	train-other-500	it makes a feather bed in the garden The pig sleeps there and calls it his quill pen
none	none	 Now I think that pigpens should be made of 
8422-283572-0008	train-other-500	porcupine quills
8422-283572-0009	train-other-500	So do I said Davy
none	none	 laughing What else is there in the garden 
8422-283572-0010	train-other-500	Nothing but the bean stalk said the Cow You ve heard of Jack and the Bean stalk haven t you Oh yes indeed said Davy beginning to be very much interested I should like to see the bean stalk
8422-283572-0011	train-other-500	You can t see the beans talk said the Cow gravely You might hear them talk that is if they had anything to say and you listened long enough
8422-283572-0012	train-other-500	By the way that s the house that Jack built Pretty isn t it Davy turned and looked up at the house It certainly was a very pretty house
none	none	 built of bright red brick with little gables and dormer windows in the roof and with a trim little porch quite overgrown with climbing roses Suddenly an idea struck him and he exclaimed 
8422-283572-0013	train-other-500	Then you must be the Cow with a crumpled horn It s not crumpled said the Cow with great dignity There s a slight crimp in it to be sure
8422-283572-0014	train-other-500	but nothing that can properly be called a crump Then the story was all wrong about my tossing the dog It was the cat that ate the malt He was a Maltese cat and his name was Flipmegilder
8422-283572-0015	train-other-500	Did you toss him inquired Davy Certainly not said the Cow indignantly Who ever heard of a cow tossing a cat
8422-283572-0016	train-other-500	The fact is I ve never had a fair chance to toss anything
none	none	 As for the dog 
8422-283572-0017	train-other-500	Mother Hubbard never permitted any liberties to be taken with him I d dearly love to see Mother Hubbard said Davy eagerly Well you can said the Cow indifferently
none	none	 She isn t much to see If you ll look in at the kitchen window you ll probably find her performing on the piano and singing a song She s always at it Davy stole softly to the kitchen window and peeped in and as the Cow had said 
8422-283572-0018	train-other-500	Mother Hubbard was there sitting at the piano and evidently just preparing to sing The piano was very remarkable and Davy could not remember ever having seen one like it before The top of it was arranged with shelves
8422-283572-0019	train-other-500	on which stood all the kitchen crockery and in the under part of it at one end was an oven with glass doors through which he could see several pies baking Mother Hubbard was dressed
8422-283572-0020	train-other-500	just as he expected in a very ornamental flowered gown with high heeled shoes and buckles and wore a tall pointed hat over her nightcap She was so like the pictures Davy had seen of her
none	none	 that he thought he would have recognized her anywhere Illustration MOTHER HUBBARD SINGS A SONG 
8422-283572-0021	train-other-500	She sang in a high key with a very quavering voice and this was the song I had an educated pug His name was Tommy Jones
8422-283572-0022	train-other-500	He lived upon the parlor rug Exclusively on bones And if in a secluded room
none	none	 I hid one on a shelf It disappeared so I presume He used to help himself Illustration He had an entertaining trick Of feigning he was dead Then with a reassuring kick Would stand upon his head I could not take the proper change And go to buy him shoes But what he d sit upon the range And read the latest news And when I ventured out one day To order him a coat I found him in his artless way Careering on a goat Illustration I could not go to look at hats But that with childish glee He d ask in all the neighbors cats 
8422-283572-0023	train-other-500	To join him at his tea And when I went to pay a bill I think it was for
none	none	 tripe He made himself extremely ill By smoking with a pipe There was something about the prim language of this song that sounded very familiar to Davy and when Mother Hubbard chanced to turn her face towards him he was surprised to see that she looked very like old Miss Peggs his school teacher While she was singing the song little handfuls of gravel were constantly thrown at her through one of the kitchen windows and by the time the song was finished her lap was quite full of it I d just like to know who is throwing that gravel said Davy indignantly It s Gobobbles said the Cow calmly You ll find him around at the front of the house By the way have you any chewing gum about you 
8422-283572-0024	train-other-500	No said Davy greatly surprised at the question So I supposed
none	none	 said the Cow It s precisely what I should expect of a person who would fall out of a window 
8422-283572-0025	train-other-500	But I couldn t help that said Davy Of course you couldn t said the Cow yawning indolently It s precisely what I should expect of a person who hadn t any chewing gum
8422-283572-0026	train-other-500	And with this the Cow walked gravely away just as Mother Hubbard made her appearance at the window Boy said Mother Hubbard beaming mildly upon Davy through her spectacles
8422-283572-0027	train-other-500	you shouldn t throw gravel I haven t thrown any said Davy Fie said Mother Hubbard shaking her head always speak the truth I am speaking the truth said Davy
8422-283572-0028	train-other-500	indignantly It was Gobobbles So I supposed said Mother Hubbard gently shaking her head again It would have been far better if he had been cooked last Christmas instead of being left over
8422-283572-0029	train-other-500	Stuffing him and then letting him go has made a very proud creature of him You should never be proud I m not proud replied Davy provoked at being mixed up with Gobobbles in this way
8422-283572-0030	train-other-500	You may define the word proud and give a few examples continued Mother Hubbard and by this time she had grown to be so surprisingly like Miss Peggs that Davy immediately clasped his hands behind him
8422-283572-0031	train-other-500	according to rule and prepared to recite Proud means being set up I think he said respectfully but I don t think I know any examples You may take
none	none	 Gobobbles for an example replied Mother Hubbard You ll find him set up in front of the house and mind you don t aggravate him and after again beaming mildly through her spectacles 
8422-283572-0032	train-other-500	she disappeared from the window and Davy went cautiously around the corner of the house curious to see what Gobobbles might be like As he approached the front of the house he heard a loud
8422-283572-0033	train-other-500	thumping noise and presently he came in sight of Gobobbles who proved to be a large and very bold mannered turkey with all his feathers taken off except
none	none	 a frowzy tuft about his neck 
8422-283572-0034	train-other-500	He was tied fast in a baby s high chair and was thumping his chest with his wings in such a violent and ill tempered manner that Davy at once made up his mind not to aggravate him under any circumstances
8422-283572-0035	train-other-500	As Gobobbles caught sight of him he discontinued his thumping and after staring at him for a moment said sulkily
none	none	 I can t abide boys 
8422-283572-0036	train-other-500	Why not said Davy
none	none	 Oh they re so hungry 
8422-283572-0037	train-other-500	said Gobobbles passionately They re so everlastingly hungry Now don t deny that you re fond of turkey Well I do like turkey said Davy seeing no way out of the difficulty
8422-283572-0038	train-other-500	Of course you do said Gobobbles tossing his head Now you might as well know he continued resuming his thumping with increased energy that I m as hollow as a drum and as tough as a hat box
8422-283572-0039	train-other-500	Just mention that fact to any one you meet will you I suppose Christmas is coming of course Of course it is replied Davy It s always coming said Gobobbles angrily
8422-283572-0040	train-other-500	I never knew a time yet when it wasn t coming I don t mind having it come said Davy stoutly Oh don t you indeed said Gobobbles Well then
none	none	 I don t mind having you go 
8422-283572-0041	train-other-500	and here he began hopping his chair forward in such a threatening manner that Davy turned and walked away with as much dignity as he could assume As he went around the corner of the house again
8422-283572-0042	train-other-500	he found himself in a pleasant lane bordered on either side by a tall hedge and as he was now out of sight of Gobobbles
none	none	 he started off on a gentle run by way of getting out of the neighborhood as soon as possible 
8422-283572-0043	train-other-500	Before he had gone a dozen steps however he heard a thumping sound behind him and looking back he saw to his dismay that
8422-283572-0044	train-other-500	Gobobbles had in some way got loose from his high chair and was coming after him thumping himself in a perfect frenzy In fact his appearance was so formidable that Davy did not pause for a second look
8422-283572-0045	train-other-500	but started off at the top of his speed Gobobbles however proved himself to be a capital runner and in spite of all Davy s efforts he could hear the dreadful thumping sound coming nearer and nearer
8422-283572-0046	train-other-500	until it seemed to be just at his heels At this instant something sprang upon his back but before he could cry out in his terror
none	none	 a head was suddenly thrust over his shoulder and he found the Goblin who was now of a bright purple color staring him in the face and laughing with all his might CHAPTER VI THE GIANT BADORFUL Goblin said Davy very seriously as the little man jumped down from off his back if you are going to play such tricks as that upon me I should like to go home at once Where s the harm said the Goblin sitting down on the grass with his back against a wall and smiling contentedly The harm is that I thought it was Gobobbles said Davy indignantly Oh you needn t be afraid of Gobobbles said the Goblin He s got all that he can attend to taking care of himself You see he s wanted for Christmas but why anybody should want him to eat is more than I can understand Why he s seventy years old if he s a day and as indigestible as an old cork Just at this moment a loud rumbling noise like distant thunder came from behind the wall against which the Goblin was leaning followed by a tremendous sneeze that fairly shook the ground What s that whispered Davy to the Goblin in great alarm It s only Badorful said the Goblin laughing He s always snoring and waking himself up and I suppose it s sleeping on the ground that makes him sneeze Let s have a look at him and the Goblin led the way along the wall to a large grating Davy looked through the grating and was much alarmed at seeing a giant at least twenty feet in height sitting on the ground with his legs crossed under him like a tailor He was dressed in a shabby suit of red velveteen with a great leathern belt about his waist and enormous boots and Davy thought he looked terribly ferocious On the grass beside him lay a huge club thickly studded at one end with great iron knobs but Davy noticed to his great relief that some little creeping vines were twining themselves among these knobs and that moss was growing thickly upon one side of the club itself as though it had been lying there untouched for a long time The giant was talking to himself in a low tone and after listening attentively at the grating for a moment the Goblin shrieked He s making poetry and throwing himself upon the ground kicked up his heels in a perfect ecstasy of delight Oh hush hush cried Davy in terror Suppose he hears you Hears me said the Goblin discontinuing his kicking and looking very much surprised What if he does Well you know he might not like being laughed at said Davy anxiously Illustration JUST LISTEN TO THIS There s something in that said the Goblin staring reflectively at the ground And you see continued Davy a giant who doesn t like what s going on must be a dreadful creature Oh there s no fear of him said the Goblin contemptuously motioning with his head toward the giant He s too old Why I must have known him off and on for nearly two hundred years Come in and see him Will he do anything said Davy anxiously Bless you no said the Goblin He s a perfect old kitten and with these words he pushed open the grating and passed through with Davy following tremblingly at his heels Badorful looked up with a feeble smile and merely said Just listen to this My age is three hundred and seventy two And I think with the deepest regret How I used to pick up and voraciously chew The dear little boys whom I met I ve eaten them raw in their holiday suits I ve eaten them curried with rice I ve eaten them baked in their jackets and boots And found them exceedingly nice But now that my jaws are too weak for such fare I think it exceedingly rude To do such a thing when I m quite well aware Little boys do not like to be chewed And so I contentedly live upon eels And try to do nothing amiss And I pass all the time I can spare from my meals In innocent slumber like this Here Badorful rolled over upon his side and was instantly fast asleep You see said the Goblin picking up a large stone and thumping with it upon the giant s head you see he s quite weak here otherwise considering his age he s a very capable giant At this moment a farmer with bright red hair thrust his head in at the grating and calling out Here comes Gobobbles disappeared again and Davy and the Goblin rushed out and were just in time to see Gobobbles go by like a flash with a crowd of people armed with pitchforks in hot pursuit Gobobbles was going in fine style bounding over the hedges and stone walls like a kangaroo and thumping vigorously as usual with his wings and Davy and the Goblin were just setting off on a run to join in the chase when a voice said Ahem and looking up they saw Badorful staring at them over the top of the wall How does this strike you he said addressing himself to Davy Although I am a giant of the exhibition size I ve been nicely educated and I notice with surprise That the simplest rules of etiquette you don t pretend to keep For you skurry off to races while a gentleman s asleep Don t reply that I was drowsy for my nap was but a kind Of dramatic illustration of a peaceful frame of mind And you really might have waited till I woke again instead Of indelicately pounding with a stone upon my head Very probably you ll argue that our views do not agree I ve often found that little boys have disagreed with me But I m properly entitled on the compensation plan To three times as much politeness as an ordinary man Davy was greatly distressed at having these severe remarks addressed to him If you please sir he said earnestly I didn t pound you At this the giant glared savagely at the Goblin and continued My remarks have been directed at the one who I supposed Had been violently thumping on my person while I dozed By a simple calculation you will find that there is due Just six times as much politeness from a little chap like you Oh you make me ill said the Goblin flippantly Go to sleep Badorful stared at him for a moment and then with a sickly smile murmured Good afternoon and disappeared behind the wall Davy and the Goblin now hurried off in pursuit of Gobobbles and presently came upon the crowd of farmers who had joined hands in a ring and were dancing around a large white object lying on the ground Davy pushed his way eagerly through the crowd expecting to see Gobobbles but the white object proved to be the Cockalorum hemmed in by a ring of pitchforks sticking in the ground and with his feathers more rumpled than ever Dear me exclaimed Davy perfectly amazed I thought we were chasing Gobobbles Of course you did said the Goblin complacently but in this part of the world things very often turn out to be different from what they would have been if they hadn t been otherwise than as you expected they were going to be But you thought so yourself began Davy when to his distress the Goblin suddenly faded into a dull pinkish color and then disappeared altogether Davy looked about him and found that the Cockalorum and the dancing farmers had also disappeared and that he was quite alone in a dense wood Illustration COCKALORUM HEMMED IN BY A RING OF PITCHFORKS CHAPTER VII THE MOVING FOREST Oh dear cried Davy speaking aloud in his distress I do wish people and things wouldn t change about so Just so soon as ever I get to a place it goes away and I m somewhere else and the little boy s heart began to beat rapidly as he looked about him for the wood was very dark and solemn and still Presently the trees and bushes directly before him moved silently apart and showed a broad path beautifully overgrown with soft turf and as he stepped forward upon it the trees and bushes beyond moved silently aside in their turn and the path grew before him as he walked along like a green carpet slowly unrolling itself through the wood It made him a little uneasy at first to find that the trees behind him came together again quietly blotting out the path but then he thought It really doesn t matter so long as I don t want to go back and so he walked along very contentedly By and by the path seemed to give itself a shake and turning abruptly around a large tree brought Davy suddenly upon a little butcher s shop snugly buried in the wood There was a sign on the shop reading ROBIN HOOD VENISON and Robin himself wearing a clean white apron over his suit of Lincoln green stood in the door way holding a knife and steel as though he were on the lookout for customers As he caught sight of Davy he said Steaks Chops in an inquiring way quite like an every day butcher Venison is deer isn t it said Davy looking up at the sign Not at all said Robin Hood promptly It s the cheapest meat about here Oh I didn t mean that replied Davy I meant that it comes off of a deer Wrong again said Robin Hood triumphantly It comes on a deer I cut it off myself Steaks Chops No I thank you said Davy giving up the argument I don t think I want anything to eat just now Then what did you come here for said Robin Hood peevishly What s the good I d like to know of standing around and staring at an honest tradesman Well you see said Davy beginning to feel that he had somehow been very rude in coming there at all I didn t know you were this sort of person at all I always thought you were an archer like like William Tell you know Illustration VENISON IS DEER ISN T IT SAID DAVY LOOKING UP AT THE SIGN That s all a mistake about Tell said Robin Hood contemptuously He wasn t an archer He was a crossbow man the crossest one that ever lived By the way he added suddenly returning to business with the greatest earnestness you don t happen to want any steaks or chops to day do you No not to day thank you said Davy very politely To morrow inquired Robin Hood No I thank you said Davy again Will you want any yesterday inquired Robin Hood rather doubtfully I think not said Davy beginning to laugh Robin Hood stared at him for a moment with a puzzled expression and then walked into his little shop and Davy turned away As he did so the path behind him began to unfold itself through the wood and looking back over his shoulder he saw the little shop swallowed up by the trees and bushes Just as it disappeared from view he caught a glimpse of a charming little girl peeping out of a latticed window beside the door She wore a little red hood and looked wistfully after Davy as the shop went out of sight I verily believe that was Little Red Riding Hood said Davy to himself and I never knew before that Robin Hood was her father The thought of Red Riding Hood however brought the wolf to Davy s mind and he began to anxiously watch the thickets on either side of the path and even went so far as to whistle softly to himself by way of showing that he wasn t in the least afraid He went on and on hoping the forest would soon come to an end until the path shook itself again disclosing to view a trim little brick shop in the densest part of the thicket It had a neat little green door with a bright brass knocker upon it and a sign above it bearing the words SHAM SHAM BARGAINS IN WATCHES Well exclaimed Davy in amazement Of all places to sell watches in that s the preposterest but as he turned to walk away he found the trees and bushes for the first time blocking his way and refusing to move aside This distressed him very much until it suddenly occurred to him that this must mean that he was to go into the shop and after a moment s hesitation he went up and knocked timidly at the door with the bright brass knocker There was no response to the knock and Davy cautiously pushed open the door and went in The place was so dark that at first he could see nothing although he heard a rattling sound coming from the back part of the shop but presently he discovered the figure of an old man busily mixing something in a large iron pot As Davy approached him he saw that the pot was full of watches which the old man was stirring with a ladle The old creature was very curiously dressed in a suit of rusty green velvet with little silver buttons sewed over it and he wore a pair of enormous yellow leather boots and Davy was quite alarmed at seeing that a broad leathern belt about his waist was stuck full of old fashioned knives and pistols Davy was about to retreat quickly from the shop when the old man looked up and said in a peevish voice Illustration HOW MANY WATCHES DO YOU WANT SAID SHAM SHAM IN A PEEVISH VOICE How many watches do you want and Davy saw that he was a very shocking looking person with wild staring eyes and with a skin as dark as mahogany as if he had been soaked in something for ever so long How many repeated the old man impatiently If you please said Davy I don t think I ll take any watches to day I ll call Drat em interrupted the old man angrily beating the watches with his ladle I ll never get rid of em never It seems to me began Davy soothingly Of course it does again interrupted the old man as crossly as before Of course it does That s because you won t listen to the why of it But I will listen said Davy Then sit down on the floor and hold up your ears said the old man Davy did as he was told to do so far as sitting down on the floor was concerned and the old man pulled a paper out of one of his boots and glaring at Davy over the top of it said angrily You re a pretty spectacle I m another What does that make A pair of spectacles I suppose said Davy Right said the old man Here they are And pulling an enormous pair of spectacles out of the other boot he put them on and began reading aloud from his paper My recollectest thoughts are those Which I remember yet And bearing on as you d suppose The things I don t forget But my resemblest thoughts are less Alike than they should be A state of things as you ll confess You very seldom see Clever isn t it said the old man peeping proudly over the top of the paper Yes I think it is said Davy rather doubtfully Now comes the cream of the whole thing said the old man Just listen to this And yet the mostest thought I love Is what no one believes Here the old man hastily crammed the paper into his boot again and stared solemnly at Davy What is it said Davy after waiting a moment for him to complete the verse The old man glanced suspiciously about the shop and then added in a hoarse whisper That I m the sole survivor of The famous Forty Thieves But I thought the Forty Thieves were all boiled to death said Davy All but me said the old man decidedly I was in the last jar and when they came to me the oil was off the boil or the boil was off the oil I forget which it was but it ruined my digestion and made me look like a gingerbread man What larks we used to have he continued rocking himself back and forth and chuckling hoarsely Oh we were a precious lot we were I m Sham Sham you know Then there was Anamanamona Mike he was an Irishman from Hullaboo and Barcelona Boner he was a Spanish chap and boned everything he could lay his hands on Strike s real name was Gobang but we called him Strike because he was always asking for more pay Hare Ware was a poacher and used to catch Welsh rabbits in a trap we called him Hardware because he had so much steal about him Good joke wasn t it Oh very said Davy laughing Frown Whack was a scowling fellow with a club continued Sham Sham My how he could hit And Harico and Barico were a couple of bad Society Islanders Then there was Wee Wo he was a little Chinese chap and we used to send him down the chimneys to open front doors for us He used to say that sooted him to perfection Wac At this moment an extraordinary commotion began among the watches There was no doubt about it the pot was boiling and Sham Sham angrily crying out Don t tell me a watched pot never boils sprang to his feet and pulling a pair of pistols from his belt began firing at the watches which were now bubbling over the side of the pot and rolling about the floor while Davy who had had quite enough of Sham Sham by this time ran out of the door To his great surprise he found himself in a sort of underground passage lighted by grated openings overhead but as he could still hear Sham Sham who now seemed to be firing all his pistols at once he did not hesitate but ran along the passage at the top of his speed Presently he came in sight of a figure hurrying toward him with a lighted candle and as it approached he was perfectly astounded to see that it was Sham Sham himself dressed up in a neat calico frock and a dimity apron like a house keeper and with a bunch of keys hanging at his girdle Illustration SHAM SHAM EXCLAIMING DON T TELL ME A WATCHED POT NEVER BOILS BEGAN FIRING AT THE WATCHES The old man seemed to be greatly agitated and hurriedly whispering We thought you were never coming sir led the way through the passage in great haste Davy noticed that they were now in a sort of tunnel made of fine grass The grass had a delightful fragrance like new mown hay and was neatly wound around the tunnel like the inside of a bird s nest The next moment they came out into an open space in the forest where to Davy s amazement the Cockalorum was sitting bolt upright in an arm chair with his head wrapped up in flannel Illustration THE COCKALORUM IS ILL It seemed to be night but the place was lighted up by a large chandelier that hung from the branches of a tree and Davy saw that a number of odd looking birds were roosting on the chandelier among the lights gazing down upon the poor Cockalorum with a melancholy interest As Sham Sham made his appearance with Davy at his heels there was a sudden commotion among the birds and they all cried out together Here s the doctor but before Davy could reply the Hole keeper suddenly made his appearance with his great book and hurriedly turning over the leaves said pointing to Davy He isn t a doctor His name is Gloopitch At these words there arose a long wailing cry the lights disappeared and Davy found himself on a broad path in the forest with the Hole keeper walking quietly beside him CHAPTER VIII SINDBAD THE SAILOR S HOUSE You had no right to tell those birds my name was Gloopitch said Davy angrily That s the second time you ve got it wrong Well it s of no consequence said the Hole keeper complacently I ll make it something else the next time I suppose you know they ve caught Gobobbles I m glad of it said Davy heartily He s worse than the Cockalorum ten times over What did they do with him Cooked him said the Hole keeper roasted him fried him pickled him and boiled him Gracious exclaimed Davy I shouldn t think he d be good for much after all that He isn t replied the Hole keeper calmly They re going to keep him to rub out pencil marks with This was such a ridiculous idea that Davy threw back his head and laughed long and loud Do that again said the Hole keeper stopping short in his walk and gazing at him earnestly and Davy burst into another fit of laughter Do it again persisted the Hole keeper staring at him still more solemnly This was somewhat tiresome and after a rather feeble attempt at a third laugh Davy said I don t feel like it any more If I could do that said the Hole keeper earnestly I d never stop The fact is he continued gravely shaking his head I ve never laughed in my life Does it hurt much It doesn t hurt at all said Davy beginning to laugh again Well there there said the Hole keeper peevishly resuming his walk again don t keep it up forever By the way you re not the postman are you Of course I m not said Davy I m glad of that said the Hole keeper postmen are always so dreadfully busy Would you mind delivering a letter for me he added lowering his voice confidentially Oh no answered Davy rather reluctantly not if it will be in my way It s sure to be in your way because it s so big said the Hole keeper and taking the letter out of his pocket he handed it to Davy It certainly was a very large letter curiously folded like a dinner napkin and sealed in a great many places with red and white peppermint drops and Davy was much pleased to see that it was addressed Captain Robinson Crusoe Jeran Feranderperandamam B G What does B G stand for said Davy Baldergong s Geography of course said the Hole keeper But why do you put that on the letter inquired Davy Because you can t find Jeran Feranderperandamam anywhere else stupid said the Hole keeper impatiently But I can t stop to argue about it now and saying this he turned into a side path and disappeared in the wood As Davy walked mournfully along turning the big letter over and over in his hands and feeling very confused by the Hole keeper s last remark he presently saw lying on the walk before him a small book beautifully bound in crimson morocco and picking it up he saw that it was marked on the cover BALDERGONG S STUFFING FOR THE STUPID Perhaps this will tell me where to go he thought as he opened it but it proved to be far more confusing than the Hole keeper himself had been In fact it was altogether the most ridiculous and provoking book Davy had ever seen The first page was headed in large capital letters HOW TO FRILL GRIDDLEPIGS And it seemed to Davy that this ought to be something about cooking sausages but all he found below the heading was Never frill em snuggle em always And this seemed so perfectly silly that he merely said Oh bosh and turned impatiently to the next page This however was no better The heading was TWO WAYS OF FRUMPLING CRUMBLES And under this was One way Frumple your crumbles with rumbles The other way Frumple your crumbles then add two grumbles of tumbles and stir rapidly Davy read this over two or three times in the greatest perplexity and then gave it up in despair It s nothing at all except a jumbly way of cooking something tumbly he said to himself and then turned sadly to the third page Alas this was a great deal worse being headed THE BEST SNUB FOR FEASTIE SPRALLS and poor Davy began to feel as if he were taking leave of his senses He was just about to throw the book down in disgust when it was suddenly snatched out of his hands and turning hastily he saw a savage glaring at him from the bushes Now Davy knew perfectly well as all little boys should know that when you meet a savage in the woods you must get behind a tree as quickly as possible but he did this in such haste that he found to his dismay that he and the savage had chosen the same tree and in the next instant the savage was after him The tree was a very large one and Davy in his fright went around it a number of times so rapidly that he presently caught sight of the back of the savage and he was surprised to see that he was no bigger than a large monkey and moreover that he was gorgeously dressed in a beautiful blue coat with brass buttons on the tail of it and pink striped trousers He had hardly made this discovery when the savage vanished as mysteriously as he had appeared and the next moment Davy came suddenly upon a high paling of logs that began at the tree and extended in a straight line far out into the forest It was very puzzling to Davy when it occurred to him that although he had been around the tree at least a dozen times he had never seen this paling before and a door that was in it also bothered him for though it was quite an ordinary looking door it had no knob nor latch nor indeed any way of being opened that he could perceive On one side of it in the paling was a row of bell pulls marked Family Police Butcher Baker Candlestick maker and on the door itself was a large knocker marked Postman After examining all these Davy decided that as he had a letter in charge he was more of a postman than anything else and he therefore raised the knocker and rapped loudly Immediately all the bell pulls began flying in and out of their own accord with a deafening clangor of bells behind the paling and then the door swung slowly back upon its hinges Davy walked through the door way and found himself in the oddest looking little country place that could possibly be imagined There was a little lawn laid out on which a sort of soft fur was growing instead of grass and here and there about the lawn in the place of flower beds little footstools neatly covered with carpet were growing out of the fur The trees were simply large feather dusters with varnished handles but they seemed nevertheless to be growing in a very thriving manner and on a little mound at the back of the lawn stood a small house built entirely of big conch shells with their pink mouths turned outward This gave the house a very cheerful appearance as if it were constantly on a broad grin Illustration THE SAVAGE WAS SITTING IN THE SHADE OF ONE OF THE DUSTERS To Davy s dismay however the savage was sitting in the shade of one of the dusters complacently reading the little red book and he was just wondering whether or not he would be able to get out of the place without being seen when the little creature looked up at him with a tremendous smile on his face and Davy saw to his astonishment that he was the Goblin dressed up like an Ethiopian serenader Oh you dear delicious old Goblin cried Davy in an ecstasy of joy at again finding his travelling companion And were you the savage that was chasing me just now The Goblin nodded his head and exclaiming My how you did cut and run rolled over and over kicking his heels about in a delirium of enjoyment Goblin said Davy gravely I think we could have just as good a time without any such doings as that I couldn t said the Goblin sitting up again and speaking very positively it s about all the fun I have Well then said Davy I wish you wouldn t be disappearing all the time I think that is a very disagreeable habit Rubbish said the Goblin with a chuckle That s only my way of getting a vacation And where do you go inquired Davy but this proved to be a very unfortunate question for the Goblin immediately began fading away in such an alarming manner that he would certainly have gone entirely out of sight if Davy had not caught him by the coat collar and pulled him into view again with a gentle shake Oh I beg your pardon said Davy who was greatly alarmed by this narrow escape I really don t care to know about that I only want to know what place this is The Goblin stared about him in a dazed manner for a moment and then said Sindbad the Sailor s house Really and truly said the delighted Davy Really and treally truly said the Goblin And here he comes now Davy looked around and saw an old man coming toward them across the lawn He was dressed in a Turkish costume and wore a large turban and red morocco slippers turned up at the toes like skates and his white beard was so long that at every fourth step he trod upon it and fell flat on his face He took no notice whatever of either Davy or the Goblin and after falling down a number of times took his seat upon one of the little carpet footstools and taking off his turban began stirring about in it with a large wooden spoon As he took off his turban Davy saw that his head which was perfectly bald was neatly laid out in black and white squares like a chess board This here Turk is the most reckless old story teller that ever was born said the Goblin pointing with his thumb over his shoulder at Sindbad You can t believe half he tells you I d like to hear one of his stories for all that said Davy All right said the Goblin promptly just come along with me and he ll give us a whopper As they started off to join Sindbad Davy was much surprised to see that the Goblin was much taller than he had been in fact he was now almost up to Davy s shoulder Why I verily believe you ve been growing exclaimed Davy staring at him in amazement I have said the Goblin calmly But I only did it to fit these clothes It s much handier you see than having a suit made to order But suppose the clothes had been too small argued Davy Then I d have grown the other way replied the Goblin with an immense smile It doesn t make a bit of difference to me which way I grow Anything to be comfortable is my rule and as he said this they came to where Sindbad was sitting busily stirring with his great spoon As Davy and the Goblin sat down beside him Sindbad hastily put on his turban and after scowling at Davy for a moment said to the Goblin It s no use telling him anything he s as deaf as a trunk Then tell it to me said the Goblin with great presence of mind All right said Sindbad I ll give you a nautical one Here he rose for a moment hitched up his big trousers like a sailor cocked his turban on one side of his head and sitting down again began A capital ship for an ocean trip Was The Walloping Window blind No gale that blew dismayed her crew Or troubled the captain s mind The man at the wheel was taught to feel Contempt for the wildest blow And it often appeared when the weather had cleared That he d been in his bunk below The boatswain s mate was very sedate Yet fond of amusement too And he played hop scotch with the starboard watch While the captain tickled the crew And the gunner we had was apparently mad For he sat on the after rail And fired salutes with the captain s boots In the teeth of the booming gale The captain sat in a commodore s hat And dined in a royal way On toasted pigs and pickles and figs And gummery bread each day But the cook was Dutch and behaved as such For the food that he gave the crew Was a number of tons of hot cross buns Chopped up with sugar and glue And we all felt ill as mariners will On a diet that s cheap and rude And we shivered and shook as we dipped the cook In a tub of his gluesome food Then nautical pride we laid aside And we cast the vessel ashore On the Gulliby Isles where the Poohpooh smiles And the Anagazanders roar Composed of sand was that favored land And trimmed with cinnamon straws And pink and blue was the pleasing hue Of the Tickletoeteaser s claws And we sat on the edge of a sandy ledge And shot at the whistling bee And the Binnacle bats wore water proof hats As they danced in the sounding sea On rubagub bark from dawn to dark We fed till we all had grown Uncommonly shrunk when a Chinese junk Came by from the torriby zone She was stubby and square but we didn t much care And we cheerily put to sea And we left the crew of the junk to chew The bark of the rubagub tree Here Sindbad stopped and gazed solemnly at Davy and the Goblin Illustration HE PLAYED HOP SCOTCH WITH THE STARBOARD WATCH If you please sir said Davy respectfully what is gummery bread It s bread stuffed with molasses said Sindbad but I never saw it anywhere except aboard of The Prodigal Pig But said Davy in great surprise you said the name of your ship was So I did and so it was interrupted Sindbad testily The name of a ship sticks to it like wax to a wig You can t change it Who gave it that name said the Goblin What name said Sindbad looking very much astonished Why The Cantering Soup tureen said the Goblin winking at Davy Oh that name said Sindbad that was given to her by the Alamagoozelum of Popjaw But speaking of soup tureens let s go and have some pie and rising to his feet he gave one hand to Davy and the other to the Goblin and they all walked off in a row toward the little shell house This however proved to be a very troublesome arrangement for Sindbad was constantly stepping on his long beard and falling down and as he kept a firm hold of his companions hands they all went down in a heap together a great many times At last Sindbad s turban fell off and as he sat up on the grass and began stirring in it again with his wooden spoon Davy saw that it was full of broken chessmen It s a great improvement isn t it said Sindbad What is said Davy very much puzzled Illustration HE GAVE ONE HAND TO DAVY AND THE OTHER TO THE GOBLIN Why this way of playing the game said Sindbad looking up at him complacently You see you make all the moves at once It must be a very easy way said Davy It s nothing of the sort said Sindbad sharply There are more moves in one of my games than in twenty ordinary games and here he stirred up the chessmen furiously for a moment and then triumphantly calling out Check clapped the turban on his head As they set out again for the little house Davy saw that it was slowly moving around the edge of the lawn as if it were on a circular railway and Sindbad followed it around dragging Davy and the Goblin with him but never getting any nearer to the house Don t you think said Davy after a while that it would be a good plan to stand still and wait until the house came around to us Here drop that exclaimed Sindbad excitedly that s my idea I was just about proposing it myself So was I said the Goblin to Sindbad Just leave my ideas alone will you Your ideas retorted Sindbad scornfully I didn t know you d brought any with you I had to replied the Goblin with great contempt otherwise there wouldn t have been any on the premises Oh come I say cried Sindbad that s my sneer you know Don t go to putting the point of it the wrong way Take it back if it s the only one you have retorted the Goblin with another wink at Davy Thank you I believe I will replied Sindbad meekly and as the little house came along just then they all stepped in at the door as it went by As they did so to Davy s amazement Sindbad and the Goblin quietly vanished and Davy instead of being inside the house found himself standing in a dusty road quite alone CHAPTER IX LAY OVERS FOR MEDDLERS As Davy stood in the road in doubt which way to go a Roc came around the corner of the house She was a large bird nearly six feet tall and was comfortably dressed in a bonnet and a plaid shawl and wore overshoes About her neck was hung a covered basket and a door key and Davy at once concluded that she was Sindbad s house keeper I didn t mean to keep you waiting said the Roc leading the way along the road but I declare that what with combing that lawn every morning with a fine tooth comb and brushing those shells every evening with a fine tooth brush I don t get time for anything else let alone feeding the animals What animals said Davy beginning to be interested Why his of course said the Roc rattling on in her harsh voice There s an Emphasis and two Periodicals and a Spotted Disaster all crawlin and creepin and screechin Here Davy unable to control himself burst into a fit of laughter in which the Roc joined heartily rolling her head from side to side and repeating All crawlin and creepin and screechin over and over again as if that were the cream of the joke Suddenly she stopped laughing and said in a low voice You don t happen to have a beefsteak about you do you Illustration Davy confessed that he had not and the Roc continued Then I must go back Just hold my basket like a good child Here there was a scuffling sound in the basket and the Roc rapped on the cover with her hard beak and cried Hush What s in it said Davy cautiously taking the basket Lay overs for meddlers said the Roc and hurrying back along the road was soon out of sight I wonder what they re like said Davy to himself getting down upon his hands and knees and listening curiously with his ear against the cover of the basket The scuffling sound continued mingled with little sneezes and squeaking sobs as if some very small kittens had bad colds and were crying about it I think I ll take a peep said Davy looking cautiously about him There was no one in sight and he carefully raised the cover a little way and tried to look in The scuffling sound and the sobs ceased and the next instant the cover flew off the basket and out poured a swarm of little brown creatures like snuff boxes with legs As they scampered off in all directions Davy made a frantic grab at one of them when it instantly turned over on its back and blew a puff of smoke into his face and he rolled over in the road almost stifled When he was able to sit up again and look about him the empty basket was lying on its side near him and not a lay over was to be seen At that moment the Roc came in sight hurrying along the road with her shawl and her bonnet strings fluttering behind her and Davy clapping the cover on the basket took to his heels and ran for dear life CHAPTER X RIBSY The road was very dreary and dusty and wound in and out in the most tiresome way until it seemed to have no end to it and Davy ran on and on half expecting at any moment to feel the Roc s great beak pecking at his back Fortunately his legs carried him along so remarkably well that he felt he could run for a week and indeed he might have done so if he had not at a sharp turn in the road come suddenly upon a horse and cab The horse was fast asleep when Davy dashed against him but he woke up with a start and after whistling like a locomotive once or twice in a very alarming manner went to sleep again He was a very frowsy looking horse with great lumps at his knees and a long crooked neck like a camel s but what attracted Davy s attention particularly was the word RIBSY painted in whitewash on his side in large letters He was looking at this and wondering if it were the horse s name when the door of the cab flew open and a man fell out and after rolling over in the dust sat up in the middle of the road and began yawning He was even a more ridiculous looking object than the horse being dressed in a clown s suit with a morning gown over it by way of a top coat and a field marshal s cocked hat In fact if he had not had a whip in his hand no one would ever have taken him for a cabman After yawning heartily he looked up at Davy and said drowsily Where to To B G said Davy hastily referring to the Hole keeper s letter All right said the cabman yawning again Climb in and don t put your feet on the cushions Now this was a ridiculous thing for him to say for when Davy stepped inside he found the only seats were some three legged stools huddled together in the back part of the cab all the rest of the space being taken up by a large bath tub that ran across the front end of it Davy turned on one of the faucets but nothing came out except some dust and a few small bits of gravel and he shut it off again and sitting down on one of the little stools waited patiently for the cab to start Just then the cabman put his head in at the window and winking at him confidentially said Can you tell me why this horse is like an umbrella No said Davy Because he s used up said the cabman I don t think that s a very good conundrum said Davy So do I said the cabman But it s the best one I can make with this horse Did you say N B he asked No I said B G said Davy Illustration THE CABMAN HAD CLIMBED UP ON TOP OF THE CAB AND WAS THROWING STONES AT THE HORSE All right said the cabman again and disappeared from the window Presently there was a loud trampling overhead and Davy putting his head out at the window saw that the cabman had climbed up on top of the cab and was throwing stones at the horse which was still sleeping peacefully It s all right said the cabman cheerfully as he caught sight of Davy If he doesn t start pretty soon I ll give him some snuff That always wakes him up Oh don t do that said Davy anxiously I d rather get out and walk Well I wish you would said the cabman in a tone of great relief This is a very valuable stand and I don t care to lose my place on it and Davy accordingly jumped out of the cab and walked away Presently there was a clattering of hoofs behind him and Ribsy came galloping along the road with nothing on him but his collar He was holding his big head high in the air like a giraffe and gazing proudly about him as he ran He stopped short when he saw the little boy and giving a triumphant whistle said cheerfully How are you again It seemed rather strange to be spoken to by a cab horse but Davy answered that he was feeling quite well So am I said Ribsy The fact is that when it comes to beating a horse about the head with a three legged stool if that horse is going to leave at all it s time he was off I should think it was said Davy earnestly You ll observe of course that I ve kept on my shoes and my collar said Ribsy It isn t genteel to go barefoot and nothing makes a fellow look so untidy as going about without a collar The truth is he continued sitting down in the road on his hind legs the truth is I m not an ordinary horse by any means I have a history and I ve arranged it in a popular form in six canters I mean cantos he added hastily correcting himself I d like to hear it if you please said Davy politely Well I m a little hoarse began Ribsy I think you re a very big horse said Davy in great surprise I m referring to my voice said Ribsy haughtily Be good enough not to interrupt me again and giving two or three preliminary whistles to clear his throat he began It s very confining this living in stables And passing one s time among wagons and carts I much prefer dining at gentlemen s tables And living on turkeys and cranberry tarts I find with surprise that I m constantly sneezing I m stiff in the legs and I m often for sale And the blue bottle flies with their tiresome teasing Are quite out of reach of my weary old tail By the way said Ribsy getting up and turning himself around what does my tail look like I think said Davy after a careful inspection I think it looks something like an old paint brush So I supposed said Ribsy gloomily and sitting down again he went on with his history As spry as a kid and as trim as a spider Was I in the days of the Turnip top Hunt When I used to get rid of the weight of my rider And canter contentedly in at the front I never was told that this jocular feature Of mine was a trick reprehensibly rude And yet I was sold like a commonplace creature To work in a circus for lodgings and food I suppose you have never been a circus horse said Ribsy stopping short in his verses again and gazing inquiringly at Davy Never said Davy Then you don t know anything about it said Ribsy Here we go again Pray why if you please should a capable charger Perform on a ladder and prance in a show And why should his knees be made thicker and larger By teaching him tricks that he d rather not know Oh why should a horse for society fitted Be doomed to employment so utterly bad And why should a coarse looking man be permitted To dance on his back on a top heavy pad Here Ribsy paused once more and Davy feeling that he ought to make some sort of an answer to such a lot of questions said helplessly I don t know No more do I said Ribsy tossing his head scornfully It made me a wreck with no hope of improvement Too feeble to race with an invalid crab I m wry in the neck with a rickety movement Peculiarly suited for drawing a cab They pinch me with straps and they bruise me with buckles They drive me too rapidly over the stones A reason perhaps why a number of knuckles Have lately appeared on my prominent bones I see them cried Davy eagerly I thought they were corns Thank you said Ribsy haughtily As the next verse is the last you needn t trouble yourself to make any further observations I dream of a spot which I used to roam over In infancy s days with a frolicsome skip Content with my lot which was planted with clover And never annoyed by the crack of a whip But I think my remarks will determine the question Of why I am bony and thin as a rail I m off for some larks to improve my digestion And point the stern moral conveyed by my tail Here Ribsy got upon his legs again and after a refreshing fillip with his heels cantered off along the road whistling as he went Two large blue bottle flies were on his back and his tail was flying around with an angry whisk like a pin wheel but as he disappeared in the distance the flies were still sitting calmly on the ridge of his spine apparently enjoying the scenery Davy was about to start out again on his journey when he heard a voice shouting Hi Hi and looking back he saw the poor cabman coming along the road on a brisk trot dragging his cab after him He had on Ribsy s harness and seemed to be in a state of tremendous excitement As he came up with Davy the door of the cab flew open again and the three legged stools came tumbling out followed by a dense cloud of dust Get in Get in shouted the cabman excitedly Never mind the dust I ve turned it on to make believe we re going tremendously fast Davy hastily scrambled in and the cabman started off again The dust was pouring out of both faucets and a heavy shower of gravel was rattling into the bath tub and to make matters worse the cabman was now going along at such an astonishing speed that the cab rocked violently from side to side like a boat in a stormy sea Davy made a frantic attempt to shut off the dust but it seemed to come faster and faster until he was almost choked and by this time the gravel had become as large as cherry stones and was flying around in the cab and rattling about his ears like a little hail storm Now all this was a great deal more than Davy had bargained for and it was so very unpleasant that he presently sat down on the floor of the cab in the hope of getting a little out of the way of the flying gravel As he did this the rocking motion became less violent and then ceased altogether as though the cabman had suddenly come to a stop Then the dust cleared away and Davy to his surprise found himself sitting in the road directly in front of the little house that Jack built The cabman and his cab had vanished entirely but curiously enough the cab door was standing wide open in the wall of the house just above the porch and in the opening stood the red Cow gazing down upon him and solemnly chewing as before The house had such a familiar look to him that Davy felt quite at home and moreover the Cow seemed quite like an old acquaintance compared with the other creatures he had met and he was just about to begin a friendly conversation with her when she suddenly stopped chewing and said How did you get here I came in a cab said Davy We came along just behind the horse People in cabs usually do said the Cow leastwise I never heard of any of em being ahead of him But this horse was running away you know said Davy Where was the cabman said the Cow suspiciously He was drawing the cab said Davy What exclaimed the Cow while the horse was running away Oh come I say He was truly said Davy laughing you never saw anything half so ridiculous I certainly never did that I can remember said the Cow but then you see I haven t always been a cow Really said Davy Really said the Cow very solemnly The fact is I ve been changed And what did you use to be said Davy who was now fully prepared for something marvellous A calf said the Cow with a curious rumbling chuckle I don t think that s a very good joke said the disappointed little boy It s a deal funnier than your cab story said the Cow And what s more it s true Good afternoon And with this the Cow disappeared from the opening and the cab door shut to with a loud bang Davy sat still for a moment hoping that Mother Hubbard or perhaps the dog or even the cat would appear so that he might explain his story about the cab None of them came but meanwhile a very extraordinary thing happened for the house itself began to go First the chimneys sank down through the roof as if they were being lowered into the cellar Then the roof itself with its gables and dormer windows softly folded itself flat down upon the top of the house out of sight Then the cab door and the latticed windows fluttered gently for a moment as if rather uncertain how to dispose of themselves and finally faded away one by one as if they had been soaked into the bricks Then the porch gravely took itself to pieces and carried itself so to speak carefully in through the front door and finally the front door went in itself and nothing was left of the house that Jack built but a high brick wall with the climbing roses running all over it like a beautiful pink vine All this was so unexpected and so wonderful that Davy sat quite still expecting something marvellous of this wall but it proved to be a very matter of fact affair with no intention whatever of doing anything or going anywhere and after watching it attentively for a few moments Davy got up and resumed his journey along the road CHAPTER XI ROBINSON CRUSOE S ISLAND This is a very sloppy road said Davy to himself as he walked away from the Bean stalk farm and it was indeed a very sloppy road The dust had quite disappeared and the sloppiness soon changed to such a degree of wetness that Davy presently found himself in water up to his ankles He turned to go back and saw to his alarm that the land in every direction seemed to be miles away and the depth of the water increased so rapidly that before he could make up his mind what to do it had risen to his shoulders and he was carried off his feet and found himself apparently drifting out to sea The water however was warm and pleasant and he discovered that instead of sinking he was floated gently along slowly turning in the water like a float on a fishing line This was very agreeable but he was nevertheless greatly relieved when a boat came in sight sailing toward him As it came near it proved to be the clock with a sail hoisted and the Goblin sitting complacently in the stern How d ye do Gobsy said Davy Prime said the Goblin enthusiastically Well stop the clock said Davy I want to get aboard I haven t any board said the Goblin in great surprise I mean I want to get into the clock said Davy laughing I don t think you re much of a sailor I m not said the Goblin as Davy climbed in I ve been sailing one way for ever so long because I don t know how to turn around but there s a landing place just ahead Davy looked over his shoulder and found that they were rapidly approaching a little wooden pier standing about a foot out of the water Beyond it stretched a broad expanse of sandy beach What place is it said Davy It s called Hickory Dickory Dock said the Goblin All the eight day clocks stop here and at this moment the clock struck against the timbers with a violent thump and Davy was thrown out heels over head upon the dock He scrambled upon his feet again as quickly as possible and saw to his dismay that the clock had been turned completely around by the shock and was rapidly drifting out to sea again The Goblin looked back despairingly and Davy just caught the words I don t know how to turn around when the clock was carried out of hearing distance and soon disappeared on the horizon The beach was covered in every direction with little hills of sand like haycocks with scraggy bunches of sea weed sticking out of the tops of them and Davy was wondering how they came to be there when he caught sight of a man walking along the edge of the water and now and then stopping and gazing earnestly out to sea As the man drew nearer Davy saw that he was dressed in a suit of brown leather and wore a high peaked hat and that a little procession consisting of a dog a cat and a goat was following patiently at his heels while a parrot was perched upon his shoulder They all wore very large linen collars and black cravats which gave them a very serious appearance Davy was morally certain that the man was Robinson Crusoe He carried an enormous gun which he loaded from time to time and then aiming carefully at the sea fired There was nothing very alarming about this for the gun when fired only gave a faint squeak and the bullet which was about the size of a small orange dropped out quietly upon the sand Robinson for it was really he always seemed to be greatly astonished at this result peering long and anxiously down into the barrel of the gun and sometimes listening attentively with his ear at the muzzle His animal companions however seemed to be greatly alarmed whenever he prepared to fire and scampering off hid behind the little hills of sand until the gun was discharged when they would return and after solemnly watching their master reload his piece follow him along the beach as before This was all so ridiculous that Davy had great difficulty in keeping a serious expression on his face as he walked up to Robinson and handed him the Hole keeper s letter Robinson looked at him suspiciously as he took it and the animals eyed him with evident distrust Robinson had some difficulty in opening the letter which was sopping wet and took a long time to read it Davy meanwhile waiting patiently Sometimes Robinson would scowl horribly as if puzzled and then again he would chuckle to himself as if vastly amused with the contents but as he turned the letter over in reading it Davy could not help seeing that it was simply a blank sheet of paper with no writing whatever upon it except the address This however was so like the Hole keeper s way of doing things that Davy was not much surprised when Robinson remarked He has left out the greatest lot of comical things and stooping down buried the letter in the sand Then picking up his gun he said You may walk about in the grove as long as you please provided you don t pick anything What grove said Davy very much surprised This one said Robinson proudly pointing out the tufts of sea weed They re beach trees you know I planted em myself I had to have some place to go shooting in of course Can you shoot with that gun said Davy Shoot Why it s a splendid gun said Robinson gazing at it proudly I made it myself out of a spy glass It doesn t seem to go off said Davy doubtfully Illustration ROBINSON REMARKED HE HAS LEFT OUT THE GREATEST LOT OF COMICAL THINGS That s the beauty of it exclaimed Robinson with great enthusiasm Some guns go off and you never see em again But I mean that it doesn t make any noise persisted Davy Of course it doesn t said Robinson That s because I load it with tooth powder But I don t see what you can shoot with it said Davy feeling that he was somehow getting the worst of the argument Robinson stood gazing thoughtfully at him for a moment while the big bullet rolled out of the gun with a rumbling sound and fell into the sea I see what you want he said at length You re after my personal history Just take a seat in the family circle and I ll give it to you Davy looked around and saw that the dog the goat and the cat were seated respectfully in a semicircle with the parrot which had dismounted sitting beside the dog He seated himself on the sand at the other end of the line and Robinson began as follows The night was thick and hazy When the Piccadilly Daisy Carried down the crew and captain in the sea And I think the water drowned em For they never never found em And I know they didn t come ashore with me Oh twas very sad and lonely When I found myself the only Population on this cultivated shore But I ve made a little tavern In a rocky little cavern And I sit and watch for people at the door I spent no time in looking For a girl to do my cooking As I m quite a clever hand at making stews But I had that fellow Friday Just to keep the tavern tidy And to put a Sunday polish on my shoes I have a little garden That I m cultivating lard in As the things I eat are rather tough and dry For I live on toasted lizards Prickly pears and parrot gizzards And I m really very fond of beetle pie The clothes I had were furry And it made me fret and worry When I found the moths were eating off the hair And I had to scrape and sand em And I boiled em and I tanned em Till I got the fine morocco suit I wear I sometimes seek diversion In a family excursion With the few domestic animals you see And we take along a carrot As refreshment for the parrot And a little can of jungleberry tea Then we gather as we travel Bits of moss and dirty gravel And we chip off little specimens of stone And we carry home as prizes Funny bugs of handy sizes Just to give the day a scientific tone Illustration IF THE ROADS ARE WET AND MUDDY WE REMAIN AT HOME AND STUDY If the roads are wet and muddy We remain at home and study For the Goat is very clever at a sum And the Dog instead of fighting Studies ornamental writing While the Cat is taking lessons on the drum We retire at eleven And we rise again at seven And I wish to call attention as I close To the fact that all the scholars Are correct about their collars And particular in turning out their toes Here Robinson called out in a loud voice First class in arithmetic but the animals sat perfectly motionless sedately staring at him Oh by the way said Robinson confidentially to Davy this is the first class in arithmetic That s the reason they didn t move you see Now then he continued sharply addressing the class how many halves are there in a whole There was a dead silence for a moment and then the Cat said gravely What kind of a hole That has nothing to do with it said Robinson impatiently Oh hasn t it though exclaimed the Dog scornfully I should think a big hole could have more halves in it than a little one Well rather put in the Parrot contemptuously Here the Goat who apparently had been carefully thinking the matter over said in a low quavering voice Must all the halves be of the same size Certainly not said Robinson promptly then nudging Davy with his elbow he whispered He s bringing his mind to bear on it He s prodigious when he gets started Who taught him arithmetic said Davy who was beginning to think Robinson didn t know much about it himself Well the fact is said Robinson confidentially he picked it up from an old Adder that he met in the woods Here the Goat who evidently was not yet quite started inquired Must all the halves be of the same shape Not at all said Robinson cheerfully Have em any shape you like Then I give it up said the Goat So do I said the Dog And I said the Cat Me too said the Parrot Well exclaimed Davy quite out of patience You are certainly the stupidest lot of creatures I ever saw At this the animals stared mournfully at him for a moment and then rose up and walked gravely away Now you ve spoiled the exercises said Robinson peevishly I m sorry I gave em such a staggerer to begin with Pooh said Davy contemptuously If they couldn t do that sum they couldn t do anything Robinson gazed at him admiringly for a moment and then looking cautiously about him to make sure that the procession was out of hearing said coaxingly What s the right answer Tell us like a good fellow Two of course said Davy Is that all exclaimed Robinson in a tone of great astonishment Certainly said Davy who began to feel very proud of his learning Don t you know that when they divide a whole into four parts they call them fourths and when they divide it into two parts they call them halves Why don t they call them tooths said Robinson obstinately The fact is they ought to call em teeth That s what puzzled the Goat Next time I ll say How many teeth in a whole Then the Cat will ask if it s a rat hole said Davy laughing at the idea You positively convulse me you re so very humorous said Robinson without a vestige of a smile You re almost as droll as Friday was He used to call the Goat Pat because he said he was a little butter I told him that was altogether too funny for a lonely place like this and he went away and joined the minstrels Here Robinson suddenly turned pale and hastily reaching out for his gun sprang to his feet Davy looked out to sea and saw that the clock with the Goblin standing in the stern had come in sight again and was heading directly for the shore with tremendous speed The poor Goblin who had turned sea green in color was frantically waving his hands to and fro as if motioning for the beach to get out of the way and Davy watched his approach with the greatest anxiety Meanwhile the animals had mounted on four sand hills and were solemnly looking on while Robinson who seemed to have run out of tooth powder was hurriedly loading his gun with sand The next moment the clock struck the beach with great force and turning completely over on the sand buried the Goblin beneath it Robinson was just making a convulsive effort to fire off his gun when the clock began striking loudly and he and the animals fled in all directions in the wildest dismay CHAPTER XII A WHALE IN A WAISTCOAT Davy rushed up to the clock and pulling open the little door in the front of it looked inside To his great disappointment the Goblin had again disappeared and there was a smooth round hole running down into the sand as though he had gone directly through the beach He was listening at this hole in the hope of hearing from the Goblin when a voice said I suppose that s what they call going into the interior of the country and looking up he saw the Hole keeper sitting on a little mound in the sand with his great book in his lap The little man had evidently been having a hard time since Davy had seen him His complexion had quite lost its beautiful transparency and his jaunty little paper tunic was sadly rumpled and moreover he had lost his cocked hat All this however had not at all disturbed his complacent conceit he was if anything more pompous than ever How did you get here asked Davy in astonishment I m banished said the Hole keeper cheerfully That s better than being boiled any day Did you give Robinson my letter Yes I did said Davy as they walked along the beach together but I got it very wet coming here That was quite right said the Hole keeper There s nothing so tiresome as a dry letter Well I suppose Robinson is expecting me by this time isn t he I don t know I m sure said Davy He didn t say that he was expecting you He must be said the Hole keeper positively I never even mentioned it in my letter so of course he ll know I m coming By the way he added hurriedly opening his book and staring anxiously at one of the blank pages there isn t a word in here about Billyweazles This place must be full of em What are they said Davy They re great pink birds without any feathers on em replied the Hole keeper solemnly And they re particularly fond of sugar That s the worst thing about em I don t think there s anything very wicked in that said Davy Oh of course you don t said the Hole keeper fretfully But you see I haven t any trowsers on and I don t fancy having a lot of strange Billyweazles nibbling at my legs In fact if you don t mind I d like to run away from here Very well said Davy who was himself beginning to feel rather nervous about the Billyweazles and accordingly he and the Hole keeper started off along the beach as fast as they could run Presently the Hole keeper stopped short and said faintly It strikes me the sun is very hot here The sun certainly was very hot and Davy looking at the Hole keeper as he said this saw that his face was gradually and very curiously losing its expression and that his nose had almost entirely disappeared What s the matter inquired Davy anxiously The matter is that I m going back into the raw material said the Hole keeper dropping his book and sitting down helplessly in the sand See here Frinkles he continued beginning to speak very thickly wrap me up in my shirt and mark the packish distingly Take off shir quigly and Davy had just time to pull the poor creature s shirt over his head and spread it quickly on the beach when the Hole keeper fell down rolled over upon the garment and bubbling once or twice as if he were boiling melted away into a compact lump of brown sugar Davy was deeply affected by this sad incident and though he had never really liked the Hole keeper he could hardly keep back his tears as he wrapped up the lump in the paper shirt and laid it carefully on the big book In fact he was so disturbed in his mind that he was on the point of going away without marking the package when looking over his shoulder he suddenly caught sight of the Cockalorum standing close beside him carefully holding an inkstand with a pen in it in one of his claws Oh thank you very much said Davy taking the pen and dipping it in the ink And will you please tell me his name The Cockalorum who still had his head done up in flannel and was looking rather ill paused for a moment to reflect and then murmured Mark him Confectionery Illustration THE COCKALORUM CAREFULLY INSPECTED THE MARKING This struck Davy as being a very happy idea and he accordingly printed CONFEXIONRY on the package in his very best manner The Cockalorum with his head turned critically on one side carefully inspected the marking and then after earnestly gazing for a moment at the inkstand gravely drank the rest of the ink and offered the empty inkstand to Davy I don t want it thank you said Davy stepping back Illustration I M PRETTY WELL I THANK YOU SAID DAVY No more do I murmured the Cockalorum and tossing the inkstand into the sea flew away in his usual clumsy fashion Davy after a last mournful look at the package of brown sugar turned away and was setting off along the beach again when he heard a gurgling sound coming from behind a great hummock of sand and peeping cautiously around one end of it he was startled at seeing an enormous whale lying stretched out on the sand basking in the sun and lazily fanning himself with the flukes of his tail The great creature had on a huge white garment buttoned up in front with a lot of live seals flopping and wriggling at one of the button holes and with a great chain cable leading from them to a pocket at one side Before Davy could retreat the Whale caught sight of him and called out in a tremendous voice How d ye do Bub I m pretty well I thank you said Davy with his usual politeness to man and beast How are you sir Hearty thundered the Whale never felt better in all my life But it s rather warm lying here in the sun Why don t you take off your Here Davy stopped not knowing exactly what it was the Whale had on Waistcoat said the Whale condescendingly It s a canvas back duck waistcoat The front of it is made of wild duck you see and the back of it out of the fore top sail of a brig I ve heard they always have watches on board of ships but I couldn t find any on this one so I had to satisfy myself with a bit of chain cable by way of a watch guard I think this bunch of seals rather sets it off don t you Yes rather said Davy doubtfully only they slobber so Ah that reminds me that it s wash day said the Whale and here he spouted a great stream of water out of the top of his head and let it run down in a little cascade all over the front of his waistcoat The seals seemed to enjoy this amazingly and flopped about in an ecstasy What do whales eat said Davy who thought it was a good time for picking up a little information Warious whales wants warious wiands replied the Whale That s an old sea saw you know For my part I m particularly fond of small buoys I don t think that is a very nice taste said Davy beginning to feel very uneasy Oh don t be frightened bellowed the Whale good naturedly I don t mean live boys I mean the little red things that float about in the water Some of em have lights on em and them are particularly nice and crisp Is it nice being a Whale said Davy who was anxious to change the subject Illustration I M AS NIMBLE AS A SIXPENCE SAID THE WHALE Famous said the Whale with an affable roar Great fun I assure you We have fish balls every night you know Fish balls at night exclaimed Davy Why we always have ours for breakfast Nonsense thundered the Whale with a laugh that made the beach quake I don t mean anything to eat I mean dancing parties And do you dance said Davy thinking that if he did it must be a very extraordinary performance Dance said the Whale with a reverberating chuckle Bless you I m as nimble as a sixpence By the way I ll show you the advantage of having a bit of whalebone in one s composition and with these words the Whale curled himself up then flattened out suddenly with a tremendous flop and shooting through the air like a flying elephant disappeared with a great splash in the sea Davy stood anxiously watching the spot where he went down in the hope that he would come up again but he soon discovered that the Whale had gone for good The sea was violently tossed about for a few moments and then began circling out into great rings around the spot where the Whale had gone down These soon disappeared however and the water resumed its lazy ebb and flow upon the shore and Davy feeling quite lonesome and deserted sat down on the sand and gazed mournfully out upon the sea CHAPTER XIII THE TALKING WAVES AND THE OLD SEA DOG I wonder why the ocean doesn t keep still sometimes and not be moving its edge about all the time said Davy after watching the waves that constantly rolled up on the beach and then rolled back again looking like creamy soap suds That wouldn t do at all said a Wave that rolled almost up to his feet The beach gets mussed you see and we have to smooth it off again The sea is always tidy and here the Wave broke with a little murmuring laugh and rolled back again all in a foam Davy was so astonished that it almost took away his breath A talking Wave was certainly the most marvellous thing he had met with and in an instant he was lying flat on his face trembling with eagerness and waiting for the next Wave to roll up on the shore It came in a moment and gently whispered If we didn t wet the sand once in a while there wouldn t be any nuts on the beach trees no nuts on the trees and no shells on the shore and here this Wave broke in its turn into foam and ran back into the sea This is perfectly delicious said Davy joyfully and as the next Wave rolled up to him he softly asked Do you know the Whale Know him cried the Wave passionately I should think I did Many a time I ve been spanked by his horrid old tail The nasty blundering floundering walloping old and here the end of the sentence dribbled away in a sort of washy whisper Such a mouth said the next Wave taking up the story Like a fishing smack lined with red morocco And such a temper I wouldn t be so crusty for all but just here the Wave toppled over as usual and the rest of the sentence ran back into the sea Once said the next Wave still scolding about the Whale once he got so far up on the shore that he couldn t get back into the water for a long time and he blamed me for it and called me names He said I was a mean low tide but just as Davy was eagerly listening for the rest of the story this Wave like the rest broke into foam and washed away It s really too ridiculous the way they break off their sentences cried Davy impatiently Is it indeed said a big Wave coming in with a rush Perhaps you d like to get acquainted with an angry sea It was an angry sea indeed for as the Wave said this the ocean was suddenly lashed into fury the water rose into huge green billows that came tossing up on the shore and Davy scrambling to his feet ran for his life The air was filled with flying spray and he could hear the roar of the water coming on behind him with a mighty rush as he ran across the beach not daring to stop until he found himself out of reach of the angry ocean on a high bluff of sand Here he stopped quite out of breath and looked back The wind was blowing fiercely and a cloud of spray was dashed in his face as he turned toward it and presently the air was filled with lobsters eels and wriggling fishes that were being carried inshore by the gale Suddenly to Davy s astonishment a dog came sailing along He was being helplessly blown about among the lobsters uneasily jerking his tail from side to side to keep it out of reach of their great claws and giving short nervous barks from time to time as though he were firing signal guns of distress In fact he seemed to be having such a hard time of it that Davy caught him by the ear as he was going by and landed him in safety on the beach He proved to be a very shaggy battered looking animal in an old pea jacket with a weather beaten tarpaulin hat jammed on the side of his head and a patch over one eye altogether he was the most extraordinary looking animal that could be imagined and Davy stood staring at him and wondering what sort of a dog he was Are you a pointer he said at last by way of opening conversation Not I said the Dog sulkily It s rude to point I m an old Sea Dog come ashore in a gale Here he stared doubtfully at Davy for a moment and then said in a husky voice What s the difference between a dog watch and a watch dog It s a conundrum Illustration DAVY ASSISTS THE OLD SEA DOG I don t know said Davy who would have laughed if he had not been a little afraid of the Dog A dog watch keeps a watching on a bark said the old Sea Dog and a watch dog keeps a barking on a watch Here he winked at Davy and said What s your name as if he had just mentioned his own Davy began the little boy but before he could say another word the old Sea Dog growled Right you are and handing him a folded paper trotted gravely away swaggering as he went like a seafaring man The paper was addressed to Davy Jones and was headed inside Binnacle Bob His werses and below these words Davy found the following story To inactivity inclined Was Captain Parker Pitch s mind In point of fact twas fitted for A sedentary life ashore His disposition so to speak Was nautically soft and weak He feared the rolling ocean and He very much preferred the land A stronger minded man by far Was gallant Captain Thompson Tar And what was very wrong I think He marked himself with India ink He boldly sailed the Soaking Sue When angry gales and tempests blew And even from the nor nor east He didn t mind em in the least Now Captain Parker Pitch s sloop Was called the Cozy Chickencoop A truly comfortable craft With ample state rooms fore and aft No foolish customs of the deep Like watches robbed his crew of sleep That estimable lot of men Were all in bed at half past ten At seven bells one stormy day Bold Captain Tar came by that way And in a voice extremely coarse He roared Ahoy till he was hoarse Next morning of his own accord This able seaman came aboard And made the following remark Concerning Captain Pitch s bark Avast says he Belay What cheer How comes this little wessel here Come tumble up your crew says he And navigate a bit with me Says Captain Pitch I can t refuse To join you on a friendly cruise But you ll oblige me Captain Tar By not a taking of me far At this reply from Captain Pitch Bold Thompson gave himself a hitch It cut him to the heart to find A seaman in this frame of mind Avast says he we ll bear away For Madagascar and Bombay Then down the coast to Yucatan Kamtschatka Guinea and Japan Stand off for Egypt Turkey Spain Australia and the Spanish Main Then through the nor west passage for Van Dieman s Land and Labrador Illustration Says Captain Pitch The ocean swell Makes me exceedingly unwell And Captain Tar before we start Pray join me in a friendly tart And shall I go and take and hide The sneaking trick that Parker tried Oh no I very much prefer To state his actions as they were With marmalade he first began To tempt that bluff seafaring man Then fed him all the afternoon With custard in a table spoon No mariner however tough Can thrive upon this kind of stuff And Thompson soon appeared to be A feeble minded child of three Illustration He cried for cakes and lollipops He played with dolls and humming tops He even ceased to roar I m blowed And shook a rattle laughed and crowed When Parker saw the seamen gaze Upon the captain s cunning ways Base envy thrilled him through and through And he became a child of two Now Parker had in his employ A mate two seamen and a boy The mate was fond as he could be Of babies and he says says he Why messmates as we re all agreed Sea bathing is the thing they need Let s drop these hinfants off the quarter They did in fourteen fathom water and here the story came abruptly to an end Davy was quite distressed at this particularly as the dreadful thought came into his mind that some babies do not know how to swim and he was therefore very well satisfied when he saw that the old Sea Dog had apparently changed his mind about going away and was swaggering along toward him again If you please said Davy as the surly creature came within hearing distance if you please sir were the two little captains drowned Well sticking as it were to the truth they were not replied the old Sea Dog very gruffly Then why don t you say so in the story said Davy Now this was pretty bold of him for old Sea Dogs don t much like to have fault found with their verses and this particular old Sea Dog evidently did not like it at all for after staring at Davy for a moment he began walking slowly around him in such a threatening manner that Davy thinking that perhaps he meant to jump on him from behind began also turning so as to keep his face always toward the Dog Meanwhile as you may well believe he began to feel very sorry that he had said anything about the verses Presently the old Sea Dog broke into a clumsy canter like a weary old circus horse and as he went heavily around the circle he began to explain about the story You see there s more of it said he wheezing dreadfully as he galloped but then I haven t had the time to put the rest of it in rhyme It s all about old Thompson s crew as stayed aboard the Soaking Sue and saw the skippers floating by and hauled em out and got em dry and when the little creeturs cried they gave em something warm inside and being as they had no bed they stowed em in a bunk instead but just at this moment the old Sea Dog who had been constantly increasing his speed disappeared in a most extraordinary manner in a whirling cloud of sand and Davy who was by this time spinning around like a teetotum discovered that he himself was rapidly boring his way like a big screw down into the beach This was of course a very alarming state of things but before Davy could make an effort to free himself the whirling cloud of sand burst upon him with a loud roaring sound like the sea and he felt himself going directly down through the beach with the sand pouring in upon him as if he had been inside of a huge hour glass He had just time to notice that instead of scraping him the sand had a delightful ticklesome feeling about it when he went completely through the beach and landed with a gentle thump flat on his back with tall grass waving about him CHAPTER XIV THE END OF THE BELIEVING VOYAGE When Davy sat up and looked around him he found himself in a beautiful meadow with the sun shining brightly on the grass and the wild flowers The air was filled with dainty colored insects darting about in the warm sunshine and chirping cheerily as they flew and at a little distance the Goblin was sitting on the grass attentively examining a great struggling creature that he was holding down by its wings I suppose said the Goblin as if Davy s sudden appearance was the most ordinary thing in the world I suppose that this is about the funniest bug that flies What is it said Davy cautiously edging away It s a Cricket Bat said the Goblin rapping familiarly with his knuckles on its hard shell His body is like a boot jack and his wings are like a pair of umbrellas But you know a Cricket Bat is something to play with said Davy surprised at the Goblin s ignorance Well you may play with it if you like I don t want to said the Goblin carelessly tossing the great creature over to Davy and walking away The Cricket Bat made a swoop at Davy knocking him over like a feather and then with a loud snort flew away across the meadow It dashed here and there at flying things of every kind and turning on its side knocked them one after another quite out of sight until to Davy s delight the Cockalorum came into view flying across the meadow in his usual blundering fashion At sight of him the Cricket Bat gave another triumphant snort and with a wild plunge at the great creature knocked him floundering into the tall grass and with a loud whirring sound disappeared in a distant wood Davy ran to the spot where the Cockalorum had fallen and found him sitting helplessly in the grass looking dreadfully rumpled and staring about confusedly as if wondering what had happened to him As Davy came running up he murmured in a reproachful way Oh it s you is it Well then I don t want any more of it Upon my word I didn t do it cried Davy trying to keep from laughing It was the Cricket Bat And what did he want murmured the Cockalorum very sadly Oh he was only having a game of cricket with you said Davy soothingly You were the ball you know The Cockalorum pondered over this for a moment and then murmuring I prefer croquet floundered away through the waving grass Davy who for once felt sorry for the ridiculous old creature was just setting off after him when a voice cried Come on Come on and Davy looking across the meadow saw the Goblin beckoning vigorously to him apparently in great excitement What s the matter cried Davy pushing his way through the thick grass Oh my oh my shrieked the Goblin who was almost bursting with laughter Here s that literary hack again Davy peered through a clump of bushes and discovered a large red animal with white spots on its sides clumsily rummaging about in the tall grass and weeds Its appearance was so formidable that he was just about whispering to the Goblin Let s run when the monster raised its head and after gazing about for an instant gave a loud triumphant whistle Why it s Ribsy cried Davy running forward It s Ribsy only he s grown enormously fat It was Ribsy indeed eating with all his might and with his skin so stretched by his extreme fatness that the hair stood straight up all over it like a brush The name on his side was twisted about beyond all hope of making it out and his collar had quite disappeared in a deep crease about his neck In fact his whole appearance was so alarming that Davy anxiously inquired of him what he had been eating Everything said Ribsy enthusiastically grass nuts bugs birds and berries All of em taste good I could eat both of you easily he added glaring hungrily down upon Davy and the Goblin Try that fellow first said the Goblin pointing to a large round insect that went flying by humming like a top Ribsy snapped at it and swallowed it and the next instant disappeared with a tremendous explosion in a great cloud of smoke What was that said Davy in a terrified whisper A Hum Bug said the Goblin calmly When a cab horse on a vacation talks about eating you a Hum Bug is a pretty good thing to take the conceit out of him They re loaded you see and they go booming along as innocently as you please but if you touch em why There you aren t as the Hole keeper says The Hole keeper isn t himself any more said Davy mournfully Not altogether himself but somewhat said a voice and Davy looking around was astonished to find the Hole keeper standing beside him He was a most extraordinary looking object being nothing but Davy s parcel marked CONFEXIONRY with arms and legs and a head to it At the sight of him the Goblin fell flat on his back and covered his face with his hands I m quite aware that my appearance is not prepossessing said the Hole keeper with a scornful look at the Goblin In fact I m nothing but a quarter of a pound of plain and the price isn t worth mentioning But how did you ever come to be alive again at all said Davy Well said the Hole keeper the truth of the matter is that after you went away the Cockalorum fell to reading the Vacuum and if you ll believe it there wasn t a word in it about my going back into the raw material I do believe that said Davy but the Hole keeper without noticing the interruption went on Then of course I got up and came away Meanwhile the Cockalorum is gorging himself with information I saw him just now said Davy laughing and he didn t act as if he had learned anything very lately I don t think he ll find much in your book and here he went off into another fit of laughter Ah but just think of the lots and lots of things he won t find exclaimed the Hole keeper Everything he doesn t find in it is something worth knowing By the way your friend seems to be having some sort of a fit Give him some dubbygrums and with this the Hole keeper stalked pompously away The smell of sugar always gives me the craw craws said the Goblin in a stifled voice rolling on the ground and keeping his hands over his face Get me some water I haven t anything to get it in said Davy helplessly There s a buttercup behind you groaned the Goblin and Davy turning saw a buttercup growing on a stem almost as tall as he was himself He picked it and hurried away across the meadow to look for water the buttercup meanwhile growing in his hand in a surprising manner until it became a full sized teacup with a handle conveniently growing on one side Davy however had become so accustomed to this sort of thing that he would not have been greatly surprised if a saucer had also made its appearance Presently he came upon a sparkling little spring gently bubbling up in a marshy place with high sedgy grass growing about it and being a very neat little boy he took off his shoes and stockings and carefully picked his way over the oozy ground to the edge of the spring itself He was just bending over to dip the cup into the spring when the ground under his feet began trembling like jelly and then giving itself a convulsive shake threw him head foremost into the water For a moment Davy had a very curious sensation as though his head and his arms and his legs were all trying to get inside of his jacket and then he came sputtering to the top of the water and scrambled ashore To his astonishment he saw that the spring had spread itself out into a little lake and that the sedge grass had grown to an enormous height and was waving far above his head Then he was startled by a tremendous roar of laughter and looking around he saw the Goblin who was now apparently at least twenty feet high standing beside the spring Illustration DAVY FALLS INTO THE ELASTIC SPRING Oh lor Oh lor cried the Goblin in an uncontrollable fit of merriment Another minute and you wouldn t have been bigger than a peanut What s the matter with me said Davy not knowing what to make of it all Matter cried the Goblin Why you ve been and gone and fallen into an Elastic Spring that s all If you d got in at stretch tide early in the morning you d have been a perfect giraffe but you got in at shrink tide and oh my oh my and here he went off into another fit of laughter I don t think it s anything to laugh at cried Davy with the tears starting to his eyes and I m sure I don t know what I m going to do Oh don t worry said the Goblin good naturedly I ll take a dip myself just to be companionable and tomorrow morning we can get back to any size you like I wish you d take these things in with you said Davy pointing to his shoes and stockings They re big enough now for Badorful All right cried the Goblin Here we go and taking the shoes and stockings in his hand he plunged into the spring and a moment afterward scrambled out exactly Davy s size Now that s what I call a nice tidy size said the Goblin complacently while Davy was squeezing his feet into his wet shoes What do you say to a ride on a field mouse That will be glorious said Davy Illustration FRECKLES SAID THE GOBLIN WHAT TIME IS IT Well there goes the sun said the Goblin it will be moonlight presently and moonlight is the time for mouse back riding and as he spoke the sun went down with a boom like a distant gun and left them in the dark The next moment the moon rose above the trees and beamed down pleasantly upon them and the Goblin taking Davy by the hand led him into the wood Freckles said the Goblin what time is it They were now in the densest part of the wood where the moon was shining brightly on a little pool with rushes growing about it and the Goblin was speaking to a large Toad Forty croaks said the Toad in a husky whisper and then as a frog croaked in the pool he added That makes it forty one The Snoopers have come in and Thimbletoes is shaking in his boots And with these words the Toad coughed and then hopped heavily away What does he mean whispered Davy He means that the fairies are here and that means that we won t get our ride said the Goblin rather sulkily And who is Thimbletoes said Davy He s the Prime Minister said the Goblin You see if any one of the Snoopers finds out something the Queen didn t know before out goes the Prime Minister and the Snooper pops into his boots Thimbletoes doesn t fancy that you know because the Prime Minister has all the honey he wants by way of a salary Now here s the mouse stable and don t you speak a word mind As the Goblin said this they came upon a little thatched building about the size of a baby house standing just beyond the pool and the Goblin cautiously pushing open the door stole noiselessly in with Davy following at his heels trembling with excitement The little building was curiously lighted up by a vast number of fire flies hung from the ceiling by loops of cobweb and Davy could see several spiders hurrying about among them and stirring them up when the light grew dim The field mice were stabled in little stalls on either side each one with his tail neatly tied in a bow knot to a ring at one side and at the farther end of the stable was a buzzing throng of fairies with their shining clothes and gauzy wings sparkling beautifully in the soft light Just beyond them Davy saw the Queen sitting on a raised throne with a little mullen stalk for a sceptre and beside her was the Prime Minister in a terrible state of agitation Now here s this Bandybug the Prime Minister was saying What does he know about untying the knots in a cord of wood Nothing said the Queen positively Absolutely nothing And then continued the Prime Minister the idea of his presuming to tell your Gossamer Majesty that he can hear the bark of the dogwood trees Bosh cried the Queen Paint him with raspberry jam and put him to bed in a bee hive That ll make him smart at all events Here the Prime Minister began dancing about in an ecstasy until the Queen knocked him over with the mullen stalk and shouted Silence and plenty of it too Bring in Berrylegs Berrylegs who proved to be a wiry little Fairy with a silver coat and tight cherry colored trousers was immediately brought in His little wings fairly bristled with defiance and his manner as he stood before the Queen was so impudent that Davy felt morally certain there was going to be a scene May it please your Transparent Highness began Berrylegs Illustration DAVY FELT MORALLY CERTAIN THERE WAS GOING TO BE A SCENE Skip all that interrupted the Queen flourishing her mullen stalk Skip yourself said Berrylegs boldly in reply Don t you suppose I know how to talk to a Queen The Queen turned very pale and after a hurried consultation with the Prime Minister said faintly Have it your own way and Berrylegs began again May it please your Transparent Highness I ve found out how the needles get into the haystacks As Berrylegs said this a terrible commotion arose at once among the fairies The Prime Minister cried out Oh come I say That s not fair you know and the Queen became so agitated that she began taking great bites off the end of the mullen stalk in a dazed sort of way and Davy noticed that the Goblin in his excitement was trying to climb up on one of the mouse stalls so as to get a better view of what was going on At last the Queen whose mouth was now quite filled with bits of the mullen stalk mumbled Get to the point It ought to be a sharp one being about needles said the Prime Minister attempting a joke with a feeble laugh but no one paid the slightest attention to him and Berrylegs who was now positively swelling with importance called out in a loud voice It comes from using sewing machines when they sow the hay seed The Prime Minister gave a shriek and fell flat on his face and the Queen began jumping frantically up and down and beating about on all sides of her with the end of the mullen stalk when suddenly a large Cat walked into the stable and the fairies fled in all directions There was no mistaking the Cat and Davy forgetting entirely the Goblin s caution exclaimed Why it s Solomon The next instant the lights disappeared and Davy found himself in total darkness with Solomon s eyes shining at him like two balls of fire There was a confused sound of sobs and cries and the squeaking of mice among which could be heard the Goblin s voice crying Davy Davy in a reproachful way then the eyes disappeared and a moment afterward the stable was lifted off the ground and violently shaken That s Solomon trying to get at the mice thought Davy I wish the old thing had stayed away he added aloud and as he said this the little stable was broken all to bits and he found himself sitting on the ground in the forest The moon had disappeared and snow was falling rapidly and the sound of distant chimes reminded Davy that it must be past midnight and that Christmas day had come Solomon s eyes were shining in the darkness like a pair of coach lamps and as Davy sat looking at them a ruddy light began to glow between them and presently the figure of the Goblin appeared dressed in scarlet as when he had first come The reddish light was shining through his stomach again as though the coals had been fanned into life once more and as Davy gazed at him it grew brighter and stronger and finally burst into a blaze Then Solomon s eyes gradually took the form of great brass balls and presently the figure of the long lost Colonel came into view just above them affectionately hugging his clock He was gazing mournfully down upon the poor Goblin who was now blazing like a dry chip and as the light of the fire grew brighter and stronger the trees about slowly took the shape of an old fashioned fireplace with a high mantel shelf above it and then Davy found himself curled up in the big easy chair with his dear old grandmother bending over him and saying gently Davy Davy Come and have some dinner my dear In fact the Believing Voyage was ended
