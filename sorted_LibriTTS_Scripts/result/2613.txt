from Cork for France State of Ireland after the War ON the eighteenth of January sixteen ninety one the King having been detained some days by adverse winds went on board at Gravesend Four yachts had been fitted up for him and for his retinue Among his attendants were Norfolk Ormond Devonshire Dorset Portland Monmouth Zulestein and the Bishop of London Two distinguished admirals Cloudesley Shovel and George Rooke commanded the men of war which formed the convoy The passage was tedious and disagreeable During many hours the fleet was becalmed off the Godwin Sands and it was not till the fifth day that the soundings proved the coast of Holland to be near The sea fog was so thick that no land could be seen and it was not thought safe for the ships to proceed further in the darkness William tired out by the voyage and impatient to be once more in his beloved country determined to land in an open boat The noblemen who were in his train tried to dissuade him from risking so valuable a life but when they found that his mind was made up they insisted on sharing the danger That danger proved more serious than they had expected It had been supposed that in an hour the party would be on shore But great masses of floating ice impeded the progress of the skiff the night came on the fog grew thicker the waves broke over the King and the courtiers Once the keel struck on a sand bank and was with great difficulty got off The hardiest mariners showed some signs of uneasiness But William through the whole night was as composed as if he had been in the drawingroom at Kensington For shame he said to one of the dismayed sailors are you afraid to die in my company A bold Dutch seaman ventured to spring out and with great difficulty swam and scrambled through breakers ice and mud to firm ground Here he discharged a musket and lighted a fire as a signal that he was safe None of his fellow passengers however thought it prudent to follow his example They lay tossing in sight of the flame which he had kindled till the first pale light of a January morning showed them that they were close to the island of Goree The King and his Lords stiff with cold and covered with icicles gladly landed to warm and rest themselves one After reposing some hours in the hut of a peasant William proceeded to the Hague He was impatiently expected there for though the fleet which brought him was not visible from the shore the royal salutes had been heard through the mist and had apprised the whole coast of his arrival Thousands had assembled at Honslaerdyk to welcome him with applause which came from their hearts and which went to his heart That was one of the few white days of a life beneficent indeed and glorious but far from happy After more than two years passed in a strange land the exile had again set foot on his native soil He heard again the language of his nursery He saw again the scenery and the architecture which were inseparably associated in his mind with the recollections of childhood and the sacred feeling of home the dreary mounds of sand shells and weeds on which the waves of the German Ocean broke the interminable meadows intersected by trenches the straight canals the villas bright with paint and adorned with quaint images and inscriptions He had lived during many weary months among a people who did not love him who did not understand him who could never forget that he was a foreigner Those Englishmen who served him most faithfully served him without enthusiasm without personal attachment and merely from a sense of public duty In their hearts they were sorry that they had no choice but between an English tyrant and a Dutch deliverer All was now changed William was among a population by which he was adored as Elizabeth had been adored when she rode through her army at Tilbury as Charles the Second had been adored when he landed at Dover It is true that the old enemies of the House of Orange had not been inactive during the absence of the Stadtholder There had been not indeed clamours but mutterings against him He had it was said neglected his native land for his new kingdom Whenever the dignity of the English flag whenever the prosperity of the English trade was concerned he forgot that he was a Hollander But as soon as his well remembered face was again seen all jealousy all coldness was at an end There was not a boor not a fisherman not an artisan in the crowds which lined the road from Honslaerdyk to the Hague whose heart did not swell with pride at the thought that the first minister of Holland had become a great King had freed the English and had conquered the Irish It would have been madness in William to travel from Hampton Court to Westminster without a guard but in his own land he needed no swords or carbines to defend him Do not keep the people off he cried let them come close to me they are all my good friends He soon learned that sumptuous preparations were making for his entrance into the Hague At first he murmured and objected He detested he said noise and display The necessary cost of the war was quite heavy enough He hoped that his kind fellow townsmen would consider him as a neighbour born and bred among them and would not pay him so bad a compliment as to treat him ceremoniously But all his expostulations were vain The Hollanders simple and parsimonious as their ordinary habits were had set their hearts on giving their illustrious countryman a reception suited to his dignity and to his merit and he found it necessary to yield On the day of his triumph the concourse was immense All the wheeled carriages and horses of the province were too few for the multitude of those who flocked to the show Many thousands came sliding or skating along the frozen canals from Amsterdam Rotterdam Leyden Haarlem Delft At ten in the morning of the twenty sixth of January the great bell of the Town House gave the signal Sixteen hundred substantial burghers well armed and clad in the finest dresses which were to be found in the recesses of their wardrobes kept order in the crowded streets Balconies and scaffolds embowered in evergreens and hung with tapestry hid the windows The royal coach escorted by an army of halberdiers and running footmen and followed by a long train of splendid equipages passed under numerous arches rich with carving and painting amidst incessant shouts of Long live the King our Stadtholder The front of the Town House and the whole circuit of the marketplace were in a blaze with brilliant colours Civic crowns trophies emblems of arts of sciences of commerce and of agriculture appeared every where In one place William saw portrayed the glorious actions of his ancestors There was the silent prince the founder of the Batavian commonwealth passing the Meuse with his warriors There was the more impetuous Maurice leading the charge at Nieuport A little further on the hero might retrace the eventful story of his own life He was a child at his widowed mother s knee He was at the altar with Diary s hand in his He was landing at Torbay He was swimming through the Boyne There too was a boat amidst the ice and the breakers and above it was most appropriately inscribed in the majestic language of Rome the saying of the great Roman What dost thou fear Thou hast Caesar on board The task of furnishing the Latin mottoes had been intrusted to two men who till Bentley appeared held the highest place among the classical scholars of that age Spanheim whose knowledge of the Roman medals was unrivalled imitated not unsuccessfully the noble conciseness of those ancient legends which he had assiduously studied and he was assisted by Graevius who then filled a chair at Utrecht and whose just reputation had drawn to that University multitudes of students from every part of Protestant Europe two When the night came fireworks were exhibited on the great tank which washes the walls of the Palace of the Federation That tank was now as hard as marble and the Dutch boasted that nothing had ever been seen even on the terrace of Versailles more brilliant than the effect produced by the innumerable cascades of flame which were reflected in the smooth mirror of ice three The English Lords congratulated their master on his immense popularity Yes said he but I am not the favourite The shouting was nothing to what it would have been if Mary had been with me A few hours after the triumphal entry the King attended a sitting of the States General His last appearance among them had been on the day on which he embarked for England He had then amidst the broken words and loud weeping of those grave Senators thanked them for the kindness with which they had watched over his childhood trained his young mind and supported his authority in his riper years and he had solemnly commended his beloved wife to their care He now came back among them the King of three kingdoms the head of the greatest coalition that Europe had seen during a hundred and eighty years and nothing was heard in the hall but applause and congratulations four But this time the streets of the Hague were overflowing with the equipages and retinues of princes and ambassadors who came flocking to the great Congress First appeared the ambitious and ostentatious Frederic Elector of Brandenburg who a few years later took the title of King of Prussia Then arrived the young Elector of Bavaria the Regent of Wirtemberg the Landgraves of Hesse Cassel and Hesse Darmstadt and a long train of sovereign princes sprung from the illustrious houses of Brunswick of Saxony of Holstein and of Nassau The Marquess of Gastanaga Governor of the Spanish Netherlands repaired to the assembly from the viceregal Court of Brussels Extraordinary ministers had been sent by the Emperor by the Kings of Spain Poland Denmark and Sweden and by the Duke of Savoy There was scarcely room in the town and the neighbourhood for the English Lords and gentlemen and the German Counts and Barons whom curiosity or official duty had brought to the place of meeting The grave capital of the most thrifty and industrious of nations was as gay as Venice in the Carnival The walks cut among those noble limes and elms in which the villa of the Princes of Orange is embosomed were gay with the plumes the stars the flowing wigs the embroidered coats and the gold hilted swords of gallants from London Berlin and Vienna With the nobles were mingled sharpers not less gorgeously attired than they At night the hazard tables were thronged and the theatre was filled to the roof Princely banquets followed one another in rapid succession The meats were served in gold and according to that old Teutonic fashion with which Shakspeare had made his countrymen familiar as often as any of the great princes proposed a health the kettle drums and trumpets sounded Some English lords particularly Devonshire gave entertainments which vied with those of Sovereigns It was remarked that the German potentates though generally disposed to be litigious and punctilious about etiquette associated on this occasion in an unceremonious manner and seemed to have forgotten their passion for genealogical and heraldic controversy The taste for wine which was then characteristic of their nation they had not forgotten At the table of the Elector of Brandenburg much mirth was caused by the gravity of the statesmen of Holland who sober themselves confuted out of Grotius and Puffendorf the nonsense stuttered by the tipsy nobles of the Empire One of those nobles swallowed so many bumpers that he tumbled into the turf fire and was not pulled out till his fine velvet suit had been burned five In the midst of all this revelry business was not neglected A formal meeting of the Congress was held at which William presided In a short and dignified speech which was speedily circulated throughout Europe he set forth the necessity of firm union and strenuous exertion The profound respect with which he was heard by that splendid assembly caused bitter mortification to his enemies both in England and in France The German potentates were bitterly reviled for yielding precedence to an upstart Indeed the most illustrious among them paid to him such marks of deference as they would scarcely have deigned to pay to the Imperial Majesty mingled with the crowd in his antechamber and at his table behaved as respectfully as any English lord in waiting In one caricature the allied princes were represented as muzzled bears some with crowns some with caps of state William had them all in a chain and was teaching them to dance In another caricature he appeared taking his ease in an arm chair with his feet on a cushion and his hat on his head while the Electors of Brandenburg and Bavaria uncovered occupied small stools on the right and left the crowd of Landgraves and Sovereign dukes stood at humble distance and Gastanaga the unworthy successor of Alva awaited the orders of the heretic tyrant on bended knee six It was soon announced by authority that before the beginning of summer two hundred and twenty thousand men would be in the field against France seven The contingent which each of the allied powers was to furnish was made known Matters about which it would have been inexpedient to put forth any declaration were privately discussed by the King of England with his allies On this occasion as on every other important occasion during his reign he was his own minister for foreign affairs It was necessary for the sake of form that he should be attended by a Secretary of State and Nottingham had therefore followed him to Holland But Nottingham though in matters concerning the internal government of England he enjoyed a large share of his master s confidence knew little more about the business of the Congress than what he saw in the Gazettes This mode of transacting business would now be thought most unconstitutional and many writers applying the standard of their own age to the transactions of a former age have severely blamed William for acting without the advice of his ministers and his ministers for submitting to be kept in ignorance of transactions which deeply concerned the honour of the Crown and the welfare of the nation Yet surely the presumption is that what the most honest and honourable men of both parties Nottingham for example among the Tories and Somers among the Whigs not only did but avowed cannot have been altogether inexcusable and a very sufficient excuse will without difficulty be found The doctrine that the Sovereign is not responsible is doubtless as old as any part of our constitution The doctrine that his ministers are responsible is also of immemorial antiquity That where there is no responsibility there can be no trustworthy security against maladministration is a doctrine which in our age and country few people will be inclined to dispute From these three propositions it plainly follows that the administration is likely to be best conducted when the Sovereign performs no public act without the concurrence and instrumentality of a minister This argument is perfectly sound But we must remember that arguments are constructed in one way and governments in another In logic none but an idiot admits the premises and denies the legitimate conclusion But in practice we see that great and enlightened communities often persist generation after generation in asserting principles and refusing to act upon those principles It may be doubted whether any real polity that ever existed has exactly corresponded to the pure idea of that polity According to the pure idea of constitutional royalty the prince reigns and does not govern and constitutional royalty as it now exists in England comes nearer than in any other country to the pure idea Yet it would be a great error to imagine that our princes merely reign and never govern In the seventeenth century both Whigs and Tories thought it not only the right but the duty of the first magistrate to govern All parties agreed in blaming Charles the Second for not being his own Prime Minister all parties agreed in praising James for being his own Lord High Admiral and all parties thought it natural and reasonable that William should be his own Foreign Secretary It may be observed that the ablest and best informed of those who have censured the manner in which the negotiations of that time were conducted are scarcely consistent with themselves For while they blame William for being his own Ambassador Plenipotentiary at the Hague they praise him for being his own Commander in Chief in Ireland Yet where is the distinction in principle between the two cases Surely every reason which can be brought to prove that he violated the constitution when by his own sole authority he made compacts with the Emperor and the Elector of Brandenburg will equally prove that he violated the constitution when by his own sole authority he ordered one column to plunge into the water at Oldbridge and another to cross the bridge of Slane If the constitution gave him the command of the forces of the State the constitution gave him also the direction of the foreign relations of the State On what principle then can it be maintained that he was at liberty to exercise the former power without consulting any body but that he was bound to exercise the latter power in conformity with the advice of a minister Will it be said that an error in diplomacy is likely to be more injurious to the country than an error in strategy Surely not It is hardly conceivable that any blunder which William might have made at the Hague could have been more injurious to the public interests than a defeat at the Boyne Or will it be said that there was greater reason for placing confidence in his military than in his diplomatic skill Surely not In war he showed some great moral and intellectual qualities but as a tactician he did not rank high and of his many campaigns only two were decidedly successful In the talents of a negotiator on the other hand he has never been surpassed Of the interests and the tempers of the continental courts he knew more than all his Privy Council together Some of his ministers were doubtless men of great ability excellent orators in the House of Lords and versed in our insular politics But in the deliberations of the Congress Caermarthen and Nottingham would have been found as far inferior to him as he would have been found inferior to them in a parliamentary debate on a question purely English The coalition against France was his work He alone had joined together the parts of that great whole and he alone could keep them together If he had trusted that vast and complicated machine in the hands of any of his subjects it would instantly have fallen to pieces Some things indeed were to be done which none of his subjects would have ventured to do Pope Alexander was really though not in name one of the allies it was of the highest importance to have him for a friend and yet such was the temper of the English nation that an English minister might well shrink from having any dealings direct or indirect with the Vatican The Secretaries of State were glad to leave a matter so delicate and so full of risk to their master and to be able to protest with truth that not a line to which the most intolerant Protestant could object had ever gone out of their offices It must not be supposed however that William ever forgot that his especial his hereditary mission was to protect the Reformed Faith His influence with Roman Catholic princes was constantly and strenuously exerted for the benefit of their Protestant subjects In the spring of sixteen ninety one the Waldensian shepherds long and cruelly persecuted and weary of their lives were surprised by glad tidings Those who had been in prison for heresy returned to their homes Children who had been taken from their parents to be educated by priests were sent back Congregations which had hitherto met only by stealth and with extreme peril now worshipped God without molestation in the face of day Those simple mountaineers probably never knew that their fate had been a subject of discussion at the Hague and that they owed the happiness of their firesides and the security of their humble temples to the ascendency which William exercised over the Duke of Savoy eight No coalition of which history has preserved the memory has had an abler chief than William But even William often contended in vain against those vices which are inherent in the nature of all coalitions No undertaking which requires the hearty and long continued cooperation of many independent states is likely to prosper Jealousies inevitably spring up Disputes engender disputes Every confederate is tempted to throw on others some part of the burden which he ought himself to bear Scarcely one honestly furnishes the promised contingent Scarcely one exactly observes the appointed day But perhaps no coalition that ever existed was in such constant danger of dissolution as the coalition which William had with infinite difficulty formed The long list of potentates who met in person or by their representatives at the Hague looked well in the Gazettes The crowd of princely equipages attended by manycoloured guards and lacqueys looked well among the lime trees of the Voorhout But the very circumstances which made the Congress more splendid than other congresses made the league weaker than other leagues The more numerous the allies the more numerous were the dangers which threatened the alliance It was impossible that twenty governments divided by quarrels about precedence quarrels about territory quarrels about trade quarrels about religion could long act together in perfect harmony That they acted together during several years in imperfect harmony is to be ascribed to the wisdom patience and firmness of William The situation of his great enemy was very different The resources of the French monarchy though certainly not equal to those of England Holland the House of Austria and the Empire of Germany united were yet very formidable they were all collected in a central position they were all under the absolute direction of a single mind Lewis could do with two words what William could hardly bring about by two months of negotiation at Berlin Munich Brussels Turin and Vienna Thus France was found equal in effective strength to all the states which were combined against her For in the political as in the natural world there may be an equality of momentum between unequal bodies when the body which is inferior in weight is superior in velocity This was soon signally proved In March the princes and ambassadors who had been assembled at the Hague separated and scarcely had they separated when all their plans were disconcerted by a bold and skilful move of the enemy Lewis was sensible that the meeting of the Congress was likely to produce a great effect on the public mind of Europe That effect he determined to counteract by striking a sudden and terrible blow While his enemies were settling how many troops each of them should furnish he ordered numerous divisions of his army to march from widely distant points towards Mons one of the most important if not the most important of the fortresses which protected the Spanish Netherlands His purpose was discovered only when it was all but accomplished William who had retired for a few days to Loo learned with surprise and extreme vexation that cavalry infantry artillery bridges of boats were fast approaching the fated city by many converging routes A hundred thousand men had been brought together All the implements of war had been largely provided by Louvois the first of living administrators The command was entrusted to Luxemburg the first of living generals The scientific operations were directed by Vauban the first of living engineers That nothing might be wanting which could kindle emulation through all the ranks of a gallant and loyal army the magnificent King himself had set out from Versailles for the camp Yet William had still some faint hope that it might be possible to raise the siege He flew to the Hague put all the forces of the States General in motion and sent pressing messages to the German Princes Within three weeks after he had received the first hint of the danger he was in the neighbourhood of the besieged city at the head of near fifty thousand troops of different nations To attack a superior force commanded by such a captain as Luxemburg was a bold almost a desperate enterprise Yet William was so sensible that the loss of Mons would be an almost irreparable disaster and disgrace that he made up his mind to run the hazard He was convinced that the event of the siege would determine the policy of the Courts of Stockholm and Copenhagen Those Courts had lately seemed inclined to join the coalition If Mons fell they would certainly remain neutral they might possibly become hostile The risk he wrote to Heinsius is great yet I am not without hope I will do what can be done The issue is in the hands of God On the very day on which this letter was written Mons fell The siege had been vigorously pressed Lewis himself though suffering from the gout had set the example of strenuous exertion His household troops the finest body of soldiers in Europe had under his eye surpassed themselves The young nobles of his court had tried to attract his notice by exposing themselves to the hottest fire with the same gay alacrity with which they were wont to exhibit their graceful figures at his balls His wounded soldiers were charmed by the benignant courtesy with which he walked among their pallets assisted while wounds were dressed by the hospital surgeons and breakfasted on a porringer of the hospital broth While all was obedience and enthusiasm among the besiegers all was disunion and dismay among the besieged The duty of the French lines was so well performed that no messenger sent by William was able to cross them The garrison did not know that relief was close at hand The burghers were appalled by the prospect of those horrible calamities which befall cities taken by storm Showers of shells and redhot bullets were falling in the streets The town was on fire in ten places at once The peaceful inhabitants derived an unwonted courage from the excess of their fear and rose on the soldiers Thenceforth resistance was impossible and a capitulation was concluded The armies then retired into quarters Military operations were suspended during some weeks Lewis returned in triumph to Versailles and William paid a short visit to England where his presence was much needed nine He found the ministers still employed in tracing out the ramifications of the plot which had been discovered just before his departure Early in January Preston Ashton and Elliot had been arraigned at the Old Bailey They claimed the right of severing in their challenges It was therefore necessary to try them separately The audience was numerous and splendid Many peers were present The Lord President and the two Secretaries of State attended in order to prove that the papers produced in Court were the same which Billop had brought to Whitehall A considerable number of judges appeared on the bench and Holt presided A full report of the proceedings has come down to us and well deserves to be attentively studied and to be compared with the reports of other trials which had not long before taken place under the same roof The whole spirit of the tribunal had undergone in a few months a change so complete that it might seem to have been the work of ages Twelve years earlier unhappy Roman Catholics accused of wickedness which had never entered into their thoughts had stood in that dock The witnesses for the Crown had repeated their hideous fictions amidst the applauding hums of the audience The judges had shared or had pretended to share the stupid credulity and the savage passions of the populace had exchanged smiles and compliments with the perjured informers had roared down the arguments feebly stammered forth by the prisoners and had not been ashamed in passing the sentence of death to make ribald jests on purgatory and the mass As soon as the butchery of Papists was over the butchery of Whigs had commenced and the judges had applied themselves to their new work with even more than their old barbarity To these scandals the Revolution had put an end Whoever after perusing the trials of Ireland and Pickering of Grove and Berry of Sidney Cornish and Alice Lisle turns to the trials of Preston and Ashton will be astonished by the contrast The Solicitor General Somers conducted the prosecutions with a moderation and humanity of which his predecessors had left him no example I did never think he said that it was the part of any who were of counsel for the King in cases of this nature to aggravate the crime of the prisoners or to put false colours on the evidence ten Holt s conduct was faultless Pollexfen an older man than Holt or Somers retained a little and a little was too much of the tone of that bad school in which he had been bred But though he once or twice forgot the austere decorum of his place he cannot be accused of any violation of substantial justice The prisoners themselves seem to have been surprised by the fairness and gentleness with which they were treated I would not mislead the jury I ll assure you said Holt to Preston nor do Your Lordship any manner of injury in the world No my Lord said Preston I see it well enough that Your Lordship would not Whatever my fate may be said Ashton I cannot but own that I have had a fair trial for my life The culprits gained nothing by the moderation of the Solicitor General or by the impartiality of the Court for the evidence was irresistible The meaning of the papers seized by Billop was so plain that the dullest juryman could not misunderstand it Of those papers part was fully proved to be in Preston s handwriting Part was in Ashton s handwriting but this the counsel for the prosecution had not the means of proving They therefore rested the case against Ashton on the indisputable facts that the treasonable packet had been found in his bosom and that he had used language which was quite unintelligible except on the supposition that he had a guilty knowledge of the contents eleven Both Preston and Ashton were convicted and sentenced to death Ashton was speedily executed He might have saved his life by making disclosures But though he declared that if he were spared he would always be a faithful subject of Their Majesties he was fully resolved not to give up the names of his accomplices In this resolution he was encouraged by the nonjuring divines who attended him in his cell It was probably by their influence that he was induced to deliver to the Sheriffs on the scaffold a declaration which he had transcribed and signed but had not it is to be hoped composed or attentively considered In this paper he was made to complain of the unfairness of a trial which he had himself in public acknowledged to have been eminently fair He was also made to aver on the word of a dying man that he knew nothing of the papers which had been found upon him Unfortunately his declaration when inspected proved to be in the same handwriting with one of the most important of those papers He died with manly fortitude twelve Elliot was not brought to trial The evidence against him was not quite so clear as that on which his associates had been convicted and he was not worth the anger of the government The fate of Preston was long in suspense The Jacobites affected to be confident that the government would not dare to shed his blood He was they said a favourite at Versailles and his death would be followed by a terrible retaliation They scattered about the streets of London papers in which it was asserted that if any harm befell him Mountjoy and all the other Englishmen of quality who were prisoners in France would be broken on the wheel thirteen These absurd threats would not have deferred the execution one day But those who had Preston in their power were not unwilling to spare him on certain conditions He was privy to all the counsels of the disaffected party and could furnish information of the highest value He was informed that his fate depended on himself The struggle was long and severe Pride conscience party spirit were on one side the intense love of life on the other He went during a time irresolutely to and fro He listened to his brother Jacobites and his courage rose He listened to the agents of the government and his heart sank within him In an evening when he had dined and drunk his claret he feared nothing He would die like a man rather than save his neck by an act of baseness But his temper was very different when he woke the next morning when the courage which he had drawn from wine and company had evaporated when he was alone with the iron grates and stone walls and when the thought of the block the axe and the sawdust rose in his mind During some time he regularly wrote a confession every forenoon when he was sober and burned it every night when he was merry fourteen His nonjuring friends formed a plan for bringing Sancroft to visit the Tower in the hope doubtless that the exhortations of so great a prelate and so great a saint would confirm the wavering virtue of the prisoner fifteen Whether this plan would have been successful may be doubted it was not carried into effect the fatal hour drew near and the fortitude of Preston gave way He confessed his guilt and named Clarendon Dartmouth the Bishop of Ely and William Penn as his accomplices He added a long list of persons against whom he could not himself give evidence but who if he could trust to Penn s assurances were friendly to King James Among these persons were Devonshire and Dorset sixteen There is not the slightest reason to believe that either of these great noblemen ever had any dealings direct or indirect with Saint Germains It is not however necessary to accuse Penn of deliberate falsehood He was credulous and garrulous The Lord Steward and the Lord Chamberlain had shared in the vexation with which their party had observed the leaning of William towards the Tories and they had probably expressed that vexation unguardedly So weak a man as Penn wishing to find Jacobites every where and prone to believe whatever he wished might easily put an erroneous construction on invectives such as the haughty and irritable Devonshire was but too ready to utter and on sarcasms such as in moments of spleen dropped but too easily from the lips of the keenwitted Dorset Caermarthen a Tory and a Tory who had been mercilessly persecuted by the Whigs was disposed to make the most of this idle hearsay But he received no encouragement from his master who of all the great politicians mentioned in history was the least prone to suspicion When William returned to England Preston was brought before him and was commanded to repeat the confession which had already been made to the ministers The King stood behind the Lord President s chair and listened gravely while Clarendon Dartmouth Turner and Penn were named But as soon as the prisoner passing from what he could himself testify began to repeat the stories which Penn had told him William touched Caermarthen on the shoulder and said My Lord we have had too much of this seventeen This judicious magnanimity had its proper reward Devonshire and Dorset became from that day more zealous than ever in the cause of the master who in spite of calumny for which their own indiscretion had perhaps furnished some ground had continued to repose confidence in their loyalty eighteen Even those who were undoubtedly criminal were generally treated with great lenity Clarendon lay in the Tower about six months His guilt was fully established and a party among the Whigs called loudly and importunately for his head But he was saved by the pathetic entreaties of his brother Rochester by the good offices of the humane and generous Burnet and by Mary s respect for the memory of her mother The prisoner s confinement was not strict He was allowed to entertain his friends at dinner When at length his health began to suffer from restraint he was permitted to go into the country under the care of a warder the warder was soon removed and Clarendon was informed that while he led a quiet rural life he should not be molested nineteen The treason of Dartmouth was of no common dye He was an English seaman and he had laid a plan for betraying Portsmouth to the French and had offered to take the command of a French squadron against his country It was a serious aggravation of his guilt that he had been one of the very first persons who took the oaths to William and Mary He was arrested and brought to the Council Chamber A narrative of what passed there written by himself has been preserved In that narrative he admits that he was treated with great courtesy and delicacy He vehemently asserted his innocence He declared that he had never corresponded with Saint Germains that he was no favourite there and that Mary of Modena in particular owed him a grudge My Lords he said I am an Englishman I always when the interest of the House of Bourbon was strongest here shunned the French both men and women I would lose the last drop of my blood rather than see Portsmouth in the power of foreigners I am not such a fool as to think that King Lewis will conquer us merely for the benefit of King James I am certain that nothing can be truly imputed to me beyond some foolish talk over a bottle His protestations seem to have produced some effect for he was at first permitted to remain in the gentle custody of the Black Rod On further inquiry however it was determined to send him to the Tower After a confinement of a few weeks he died of apoplexy but he lived long enough to complete his disgrace by offering his sword to the new government and by expressing in fervent language his hope that he might by the goodness of God and of Their Majesties have an opportunity of showing how much he hated the French twenty Turner ran no serious risk for the government was most unwilling to send to the scaffold one of the Seven who had signed the memorable petition A warrant was however issued for his apprehension and his friends had little hope that he would escape for his nose was such as none who had seen it could forget and it was to little purpose that he put on a flowing wig and that he suffered his beard to grow The pursuit was probably not very hot for after skulking a few weeks in England he succeeded in crossing the Channel and remained some time in France twenty one A warrant was issued against Penn and he narrowly escaped the messengers It chanced that on the day on which they were sent in search of him he was attending a remarkable ceremony at some distance from his home An event had taken place which a historian whose object is to record the real life of a nation ought not to pass unnoticed While London was agitated by the news that a plot had been discovered George Fox the founder of the sect of Quakers died More than forty years had elapsed since Fox had begun to see visions and to cast out devils twenty two He was then a youth of pure morals and grave deportment with a perverse temper with the education of a labouring man and with an intellect in the most unhappy of all states that is to say too much disordered for liberty and not sufficiently disordered for Bedlam The circumstances in which he was placed were such as could scarcely fail to bring out in the strongest form the constitutional diseases of his mind At the time when his faculties were ripening Episcopalians Presbyterians Independents Baptists were striving for mastery and were in every corner of the realm refuting and reviling each other He wandered from congregation to congregation he heard priests harangue against Puritans he heard Puritans harangue against priests and he in vain applied for spiritual direction and consolation to doctors of both parties One jolly old clergyman of the Anglican communion told him to smoke tobacco and sing psalms another advised him to go and lose some blood twenty three The young inquirer turned in disgust from these advisers to the Dissenters and found them also blind guides twenty four After some time he came to the conclusion that no human being was competent to instruct him in divine things and that the truth had been communicated to him by direct inspiration from heaven He argued that as the division of languages began at Babel and as the persecutors of Christ put on the cross an inscription in Latin Greek and Hebrew the knowledge of languages and more especially of Latin Greek and Hebrew must be useless to a Christian minister twenty five Indeed he was so far from knowing many languages that he knew none nor can the most corrupt passage in Hebrew be more unintelligible to the unlearned than his English often is to the most acute and attentive reader twenty six One of the precious truths which were divinely revealed to this new apostle was that it was falsehood and adulation to use the second person plural instead of the second person singular Another was that to talk of the month of March was to worship the bloodthirsty god Mars and that to talk of Monday was to pay idolatrous homage to the moon To say Good morning or Good evening was highly reprehensible for those phrases evidently imported that God had made bad days and bad nights twenty seven A Christian was bound to face death itself rather than touch his hat to the greatest of mankind When Fox was challenged to produce any Scriptural authority for this dogma he cited the passage in which it is written that Shadrach Meshech and Abednego were thrown into the fiery furnace with their hats on and if his own narrative may be trusted the Chief Justice of England was altogether unable to answer this argument except by crying out Take him away gaoler twenty eight Fox insisted much on the not less weighty argument that the Turks never show their bare heads to their superiors and he asked with great animation whether those who bore the noble name of Christians ought not to surpass Turks in virtue twenty nine Bowing he strictly prohibited and indeed seemed to consider it as the effect of Satanical influence for as he observed the woman in the Gospel while she had a spirit of infirmity was bowed together and ceased to bow as soon as Divine power had liberated her from the tyranny of the Evil One thirty His expositions of the sacred writings were of a very peculiar kind Passages which had been in the apprehension of all the readers of the Gospels during sixteen centuries figurative he construed literally Passages which no human being before him had ever understood in any other than a literal sense he construed figuratively Thus from those rhetorical expressions in which the duty of patience under injuries is enjoined he deduced the doctrine that selfdefence against pirates and assassins is unlawful On the other hand the plain commands to baptize with water and to partake of bread and wine in commemoration of the redemption of mankind he pronounced to be allegorical He long wandered from place to place teaching this strange theology shaking like an aspen leaf in his paroxysms of fanatical excitement forcing his way into churches which he nicknamed steeple houses interrupting prayers and sermons with clamour and scurrility thirty one and pestering rectors and justices with epistles much resembling burlesques of those sublime odes in which the Hebrew prophets foretold the calamities of Babylon and Tyre thirty two He soon acquired great notoriety by these feats His strange face his strange chant his immovable hat and his leather breeches were known all over the country and he boasts that as soon as the rumour was heard The Man in Leather Breeches is coming terror seized hypocritical professors and hireling priests made haste to get out of his way thirty three He was repeatedly imprisoned and set in the stocks sometimes justly for disturbing the public worship of congregations and sometimes unjustly for merely talking nonsense He soon gathered round him a body of disciples some of whom went beyond himself in absurdity He has told us that one of his friends walked naked through Skipton declaring the truth thirty four and that another was divinely moved to go naked during several years to marketplaces and to the houses of gentlemen and clergymen thirty five Fox complains bitterly that these pious acts prompted by the Holy Spirit were requited by an untoward generation with hooting pelting coachwhipping and horsewhipping But though he applauded the zeal of the sufferers he did not go quite to their lengths He sometimes indeed was impelled to strip himself partially Thus he pulled off his shoes and walked barefoot through Lichfield crying Woe to the bloody city thirty six But it does not appear that he ever thought it his duty to appear before the public without that decent garment from which his popular appellation was derived If we form our judgment of George Fox simply by looking at his own actions and writings we shall see no reason for placing him morally or intellectually above Ludowick Muggleton or Joanna Southcote But it would be most unjust to rank the sect which regards him as its founder with the Muggletonians or the Southcotians It chanced that among the thousands whom his enthusiasm infected were a few persons whose abilities and attainments were of a very different order from his own Robert Barclay was a man of considerable parts and learning William Penn though inferior to Barclay in both natural and acquired abilities was a gentleman and a scholar That such men should have become the followers of George Fox ought not to astonish any person who remembers what quick vigorous and highly cultivated intellects were in our own times duped by the unknown tongues The truth is that no powers of mind constitute a security against errors of this description Touching God and His ways with man the highest human faculties can discover little more than the meanest In theology the interval is small indeed between Aristotle and a child between Archimedes and a naked savage It is not strange therefore that wise men weary of investigation tormented by uncertainty longing to believe something and yet seeing objections to every thing should submit themselves absolutely to teachers who with firm and undoubting faith lay claim to a supernatural commission Thus we frequently see inquisitive and restless spirits take refuge from their own scepticism in the bosom of a church which pretends to infallibility and after questioning the existence of a Deity bring themselves to worship a wafer And thus it was that Fox made some converts to whom he was immeasurably inferior in every thing except the energy of his convictions By these converts his rude doctrines were polished into a form somewhat less shocking to good sense and good taste No proposition which he had laid down was retracted No indecent or ridiculous act which he had done or approved was condemned but what was most grossly absurd in his theories and practices was softened down or at least not obtruded on the public whatever could be made to appear specious was set in the fairest light his gibberish was translated into English meanings which he would have been quite unable to comprehend were put on his phrases and his system so much improved that he would not have known it again was defended by numerous citations from Pagan philosophers and Christian fathers whose names he had never heard thirty seven Still however those who had remodelled his theology continued to profess and doubtless to feel profound reverence for him and his crazy epistles were to the last received and read with respect in Quaker meetings all over the country His death produced a sensation which was not confined to his own disciples On the morning of the funeral a great multitude assembled round the meeting house in Gracechurch Street Thence the corpse was borne to the burial ground of the sect near Bunhill Fields Several orators addressed the crowd which filled the cemetery Penn was conspicuous among those disciples who committed the venerable corpse to the earth The ceremony had scarcely been finished when he learned that warrants were out against him He instantly took flight and remained many months concealed from the public eye thirty eight A short time after his disappearance Sidney received from him a strange communication Penn begged for an interview but insisted on a promise that he should be suffered to return unmolested to his hiding place Sidney obtained the royal permission to make an appointment on these terms Penn came to the rendezvous and spoke at length in his own defence He declared that he was a faithful subject of King William and Queen Mary and that if he knew of any design against them he would discover it Departing from his Yea and Nay he protested as in the presence of God that he knew of no plot and that he did not believe that there was any plot unless the ambitious projects of the French government might be called plots Sidney amazed probably by hearing a person who had such an abhorrence of lies that he would not use the common forms of civility and such an abhorrence of oaths that he would not kiss the book in a court of justice tell something very like a lie and confirm it by something very like an oath asked how if there were really no plot the letters and minutes which had been found on Ashton were to be explained This question Penn evaded If he said I could only see the King I would confess every thing to him freely I would tell him much that it would be important for him to know It is only in that way that I can be of service to him A witness for the Crown I cannot be for my conscience will not suffer me to be sworn He assured Sidney that the most formidable enemies of the government were the discontented Whigs The Jacobites are not dangerous There is not a man among them who has common understanding Some persons who came over from Holland with the King are much more to be dreaded It does not appear that Penn mentioned any names He was suffered to depart in safety No active search was made for him He lay hid in London during some months and then stole down to the coast of Sussex and made his escape to France After about three years of wandering and lurking he by the mediation of some eminent men who overlooked his faults for the sake of his good qualities made his peace with the government and again ventured to resume his ministrations The return which he made for the lenity with which he had been treated does not much raise his character Scarcely had he again begun to harangue in public about the unlawfulness of war when he sent a message earnestly exhorting James to make an immediate descent on England with thirty thousand men thirty nine Some months passed before the fate of Preston was decided After several respites the government convinced that though he had told much he could tell more fixed a day for his execution and ordered the sheriffs to have the machinery of death in readiness forty But he was again respited and after a delay of some weeks obtained a pardon which however extended only to his life and left his property subject to all the consequences of his attainder As soon as he was set at liberty he gave new cause of offence and suspicion and was again arrested examined and sent to prison forty one At length he was permitted to retire pursued by the hisses and curses of both parties to a lonely manor house in the North Riding of Yorkshire There at least he had not to endure the scornful looks of old associates who had once thought him a man of dauntless courage and spotless honour but who now pronounced that he was at best a meanspirited coward and hinted their suspicions that he had been from the beginning a spy and a trepan forty two He employed the short and sad remains of his life in turning the Consolation of Boethius into English The translation was published after the translator s death It is remarkable chiefly on account of some very unsuccessful attempts to enrich our versification with new metres and on account of the allusions with which the preface is filled Under a thin veil of figurative language Preston exhibited to the public compassion or contempt his own blighted fame and broken heart He complained that the tribunal which had sentenced him to death had dealt with him more leniently than his former friends and that many who had never been tried by temptations like his had very cheaply earned a reputation for courage by sneering at his poltroonery and by bidding defiance at a distance to horrors which when brought near subdue even a constant spirit The spirit of the Jacobites which had been quelled for a time by the detection of Preston s plot was revived by the fall of Mons The joy of the whole party was boundless The nonjuring priests ran backwards and forwards between Sam s Coffee House and Westminster Hall spreading the praises of Lewis and laughing at the miserable issue of the deliberations of the great Congress In the Park the malecontents wore their biggest looks and talked sedition in their loudest tones The most conspicuous among these swaggerers was Sir John Fenwick who had in the late reign been high in favour and in military command and was now an indefatigable agitator and conspirator In his exultation he forgot the courtesy which man owes to woman He had more than once made himself conspicuous by his impertinence to the Queen He now ostentatiously put himself in her way when she took her airing and while all around him uncovered and bowed low gave her a rude stare and cocked his hat in her face The affront was not only brutal but cowardly For the law had provided no punishment for mere impertinence however gross and the King was the only gentleman and soldier in the kingdom who could not protect his wife from contumely with his sword All that the Queen could do was to order the parkkeepers not to admit Sir John again within the gates But long after her death a day came when he had reason to wish that he had restrained his insolence He found by terrible proof that of all the Jacobites the most desperate assassins not excepted he was the only one for whom William felt an intense personal aversion forty three A few days after this event the rage of the malecontents began to flame more fiercely than ever The detection of the conspiracy of which Preston was the chief had brought on a crisis in ecclesiastical affairs The nonjuring bishops had during the year which followed their deprivation continued to reside in the official mansions which had once been their own Burnet had at Mary s request laboured to effect a compromise His direct interference would probably have done more harm than good He therefore judiciously employed the agency of Rochester who stood higher in the estimation of the nonjurors than any statesman who was not a nonjuror and of Trevor who worthless as he was had considerable influence with the High Church party Sancroft and his brethren were informed that if they would consent to perform their spiritual duty to ordain to institute to confirm and to watch over the faith and the morality of the priesthood a bill should be brought into Parliament to excuse them from taking the oaths forty four This offer was imprudently liberal but those to whom it was made could not consistently accept it For in the ordination service and indeed in almost every service of the Church William and Mary were designated as King and Queen The only promise that could be obtained from the deprived prelates was that they would live quietly and even this promise they had not all kept One of them at least had been guilty of treason aggravated by impiety He had under the strong fear of being butchered by the populace declared that he abhorred the thought of calling in the aid of France and had invoked God to attest the sincerity of this declaration Yet a short time after he had been detected in plotting to bring a French army into England and he had written to assure the Court of Saint Germains that he was acting in concert with his brethren and especially with Sancroft The Whigs called loudly for severity Even the Tory counsellors of William owned that indulgence had been carried to the extreme point They made however a last attempt to mediate Will you and your brethren said Trevor to Lloyd the nonjuring Bishop of Norwich disown all connection with Doctor Turner and declare that what he has in his letters imputed to you is false Lloyd evaded the question It was now evident that William s forbearance had only emboldened the adversaries whom he had hoped to conciliate Even Caermarthen even Nottingham declared that it was high time to fill the vacant sees forty five Tillotson was nominated to the Archbishopric and was consecrated on Whitsunday in the church of saint Mary Le Bow Compton cruelly mortified refused to bear any part in the ceremony His place was supplied by Mew Bishop of Winchester who was assisted by Burnet Stillingfleet and Hough The congregation was the most splendid that had been seen in any place of worship since the coronation The Queen s drawingroom was on that day deserted Most of the peers who were in town met in the morning at Bedford House and went thence in procession to Cheapside Norfolk Caermarthen and Dorset were conspicuous in the throng Devonshire who was impatient to see his woods at Chatsworth in their summer beauty had deferred his departure in order to mark his respect for Tillotson The crowd which lined the streets greeted the new Primate warmly For he had during many years preached in the City and his eloquence his probity and the singular gentleness of his temper and manners had made him the favourite of the Londoners forty six But the congratulations and applauses of his friends could not drown the roar of execration which the Jacobites set up According to them he was a thief who had not entered by the door but had climbed over the fences He was a hireling whose own the sheep were not who had usurped the crook of the good shepherd and who might well be expected to leave the flock at the mercy of every wolf He was an Arian a Socinian a Deist an Atheist He had cozened the world by fine phrases and by a show of moral goodness but he was in truth a far more dangerous enemy of the Church than he could have been if he had openly proclaimed himself a disciple of Hobbes and had lived as loosely as Wilmot He had taught the fine gentlemen and ladies who admired his style and who were constantly seen round his pulpit that they might be very good Christians and yet might believe the account of the Fall in the book of Genesis to be allegorical Indeed they might easily be as good Christians as he for he had never been christened his parents were Anabaptists he had lost their religion when he was a boy and he had never found another In ribald lampoons he was nicknamed Undipped John The parish register of his baptism was produced in vain His enemies still continued to complain that they had lived to see fathers of the Church who never were her children They made up a story that the Queen had felt bitter remorse for the great crime by which she had obtained a throne that in her agony she had applied to Tillotson and that he had comforted her by assuring her that the punishment of the wicked in a future state would not be eternal forty seven The Archbishop s mind was naturally of almost feminine delicacy and had been rather softened than braced by the habits of a long life during which contending sects and factions had agreed in speaking of his abilities with admiration and of his character with esteem The storm of obloquy which he had to face for the first time at more than sixty years of age was too much for him His spirits declined his health gave way yet he neither flinched from his duty nor attempted to revenge himself on his persecutors A few days after his consecration some persons were seized while dispersing libels in which he was reviled The law officers of the Crown proposed to institute prosecutions but he insisted that nobody should be punished on his account forty eight Once when he had company with him a sealed packet was put into his hands he opened it and out fell a mask His friends were shocked and incensed by this cowardly insult but the Archbishop trying to conceal his anguish by a smile pointed to the pamphlets which covered his table and said that the reproach which the emblem of the mask was intended to convey might be called gentle when compared with other reproaches which he daily had to endure After his death a bundle of the savage lampoons which the nonjurors had circulated against him was found among his papers with this indorsement I pray God forgive them I do forty nine The temper of the deposed primate was very different He seems to have been under a complete delusion as to his own importance The immense popularity which he had enjoyed three years before the prayers and tears of the multitudes who had plunged into the Thames to implore his blessing the enthusiasm with which the sentinels of the Tower had drunk his health under the windows of his prison the mighty roar of joy which had risen from Palace Yard on the morning of his acquittal the triumphant night when every window from Hyde Park to Mile End had exhibited seven candles the midmost and tallest emblematical of him were still fresh in his recollection nor had he the wisdom to perceive that all this homage had been paid not to his person but to that religion and to those liberties of which he was for a moment the representative The extreme tenderness with which the new government had long persisted in treating him seems to have confirmed him in his error That a succession of conciliatory messages was sent to him from Kensington that he was offered terms so liberal as to be scarcely consistent with the dignity of the Crown and the welfare of the State that his cold and uncourteous answers could not tire out the royal indulgence that in spite of the loud clamours of the Whigs and of the provocations daily given by the Jacobites he was residing fifteen months after deprivation in the metropolitan palace these things seemed to him to indicate not the lenity but the timidity of the ruling powers He appears to have flattered himself that they would not dare to eject him The news therefore that his see had been filled threw him into a passion which lasted as long as his life and which hurried him into many foolish and unseemly actions Tillotson as soon as he was appointed went to Lambeth in the hope that he might be able by courtesy and kindness to soothe the irritation of which he was the innocent cause He stayed long in the antechamber and sent in his name by several servants but Sancroft would not even return an answer fifty Three weeks passed and still the deprived Archbishop showed no disposition to move At length he received an order intimating to him the royal pleasure that he should quit the dwelling which had long ceased to be his own and in which he was only a guest He resented this order bitterly and declared that he would not obey it He would stay till he was pulled out by the Sheriff s officers He would defend himself at law as long as he could do so without putting in any plea acknowledging the authority of the usurpers fifty one The case was so clear that he could not by any artifice of chicanery obtain more than a short delay When judgment had been given against him he left the palace but directed his steward to retain possession The consequence was that the steward was taken into custody and heavily fined Tillotson sent a kind message to assure his predecessor that the fine should not be exacted But Sancroft was determined to have a grievance and would pay the money fifty two From that time the great object of the narrowminded and peevish old man was to tear in pieces the Church of which he had been the chief minister It was in vain that some of those nonjurors whose virtue ability and learning were the glory of their party remonstrated against his design Our deprivation such was the reasoning of Ken is in the sight of God a nullity We are and shall be till we die or resign the true Bishops of our sees Those who assume our titles and functions will incur the guilt of schism But with us if we act as becomes us the schism will die and in the next generation the unity of the Church will be restored On the other hand if we consecrate Bishops to succeed us the breach may last through ages and we shall be justly held accountable not indeed for its origin but for its continuance These considerations ought on Sancroft s own principles to have had decisive weight with him but his angry passions prevailed Ken quietly retired from the venerable palace of Wells He had done he said with strife and should henceforth vent his feelings not in disputes but in hymns His charities to the unhappy of all persuasions especially to the followers of Monmouth and to the persecuted Huguenots had been so large that his whole private fortune consisted of seven hundred pounds and of a library which he could not bear to sell But Thomas Thynne Viscount Weymouth though not a nonjuror did himself honour by offering to the most virtuous of the nonjurors a tranquil and dignified asylum in the princely mansion of Longleat There Ken passed a happy and honoured old age during which he never regretted the sacrifice which he had made to what he thought his duty and yet constantly became more and more indulgent to those whose views of duty differed from his fifty three Sancroft was of a very different temper He had indeed as little to complain of as any man whom a revolution has ever hurled down from an exalted station He had at Fressingfield in Suffolk a patrimonial estate which together with what he had saved during a primacy of twelve years enabled him to live not indeed as he had lived when he was the first peer of Parliament but in the style of an opulent country gentleman He retired to his hereditary abode and there he passed the rest of his life in brooding over his wrongs Aversion to the Established Church became as strong a feeling in him as it had been in Martin Marprelate He considered all who remained in communion with her as heathens and publicans He nicknamed Tillotson the Mufti In the room which was used as a chapel at Fressingfield no person who had taken the oaths or who attended the ministry of any divine who had taken the oaths was suffered to partake of the sacred bread and wine A distinction however was made between two classes of offenders A layman who remained in communion with the Church was permitted to be present while prayers were read and was excluded only from the highest of Christian mysteries But with clergymen who had sworn allegiance to the Sovereigns in possession Sancroft would not even pray He took care that the rule which he had laid down should be widely known and both by precept and by example taught his followers to look on the most orthodox the most devout the most virtuous of those who acknowledged William s authority with a feeling similar to that with which the Jew regarded the Samaritan fifty four Such intolerance would have been reprehensible even in a man contending for a great principle But Sancroft was contending merely for a name He was the author of the scheme of Regency He was perfectly willing to transfer the whole kingly power from James to William The question which to this smallest and sourest of minds seemed important enough to justify the excommunicating of ten thousand priests and of five millions of laymen was whether the magistrate to whom the whole kingly power was transferred should assume the kingly title Nor could Sancroft bear to think that the animosity which he had excited would die with himself Having done all that he could to make the feud bitter he determined to make it eternal A list of the divines who had been ejected from their benefices was sent by him to Saint Germains with a request that James would nominate two who might keep up the episcopal succession James well pleased doubtless to see another sect added to that multitude of sects which he had been taught to consider as the reproach of Protestantism named two fierce and uncompromising nonjurors Hickes and Wagstaffe the former recommended by Sancroft the latter recommended by Lloyd the ejected Bishop of Norwich fifty five Such was the origin of a schismatical hierarchy which having during a short time excited alarm soon sank into obscurity and contempt but which in obscurity and contempt continued to drag on a languid existence during several generations The little Church without temples revenues or dignities was even more distracted by internal disputes than the great Church which retained possession of cathedrals tithes and peerages Some nonjurors leaned towards the ceremonial of Rome others would not tolerate the slightest departure from the Book of Common Prayer Altar was set up against altar One phantom prelate pronounced the consecration of another phantom prelate uncanonical At length the pastors were left absolutely without flocks One of these Lords spiritual very wisely turned surgeon another left what he had called his see and settled in Ireland and at length in eighteen oh five the last Bishop of that society which had proudly claimed to be the only true Church of England dropped unnoticed into the grave fifty six The places of the bishops who had been ejected with Sancroft were filled in a manner creditable to the government Patrick succeeded the traitor Turner Fowler went to Gloucester Richard Cumberland an aged divine who had no interest at Court and whose only recommendations were his piety and erudition was astonished by learning from a newsletter which he found on the table of a coffeehouse that he had been nominated to the See of Peterborough fifty seven Beveridge was selected to succeed Ken he consented and the appointment was actually announced in the London Gazette But Beveridge though an honest was not a strongminded man Some Jacobites expostulated with him some reviled him his heart failed him and he retracted While the nonjurors were rejoicing in this victory he changed his mind again but too late He had by his irresolution forfeited the favour of William and never obtained a mitre till Anne was on the throne fifty eight The bishopric of Bath and Wells was bestowed on Richard Kidder a man of considerable attainments and blameless character but suspected of a leaning towards Presbyterianism About the same time Sharp the highest churchman that had been zealous for the Comprehension and the lowest churchman that felt a scruple about succeeding a deprived prelate accepted the Archbishopric of York vacant by the death of Lamplugh fifty nine In consequence of the elevation of Tillotson to the See of Canterbury the Deanery of Saint Paul s became vacant As soon as the name of the new Dean was known a clamour broke forth such as perhaps no ecclesiastical appointment has ever produced a clamour made up of yells of hatred of hisses of contempt and of shouts of triumphant and half insulting welcome for the new Dean was William Sherlock The story of his conversion deserves to be fully told for it throws great light on the character of the parties which then divided the Church and the State Sherlock was in influence and reputation though not in rank the foremost man among the nonjurors His authority and example had induced some of his brethren who had at first wavered to resign their benefices The day of suspension came the day of deprivation came and still he was firm He seemed to have found in the consciousness of rectitude and in meditation on the invisible world ample compensation for all his losses While excluded from the pulpit where his eloquence had once delighted the learned and polite inmates of the Temple he wrote that celebrated Treatise on Death which during many years stood next to the Whole Duty of Man in the bookcases of serious Arminians Soon however it began to be suspected that his resolution was giving way He declared that he would be no party to a schism he advised those who sought his counsel not to leave their parish churches nay finding that the law which had ejected him from his cure did not interdict him from performing divine service he officiated at Saint Dunstan s and there prayed for King William and Queen Mary The apostolical injunction he said was that prayers should be made for all in authority and William and Mary were visibly in authority His Jacobite friends loudly blamed his inconsistency How they asked if you admit that the Apostle speaks in this passage of actual authority can you maintain that in other passages of a similar kind he speaks only of legitimate authority Or how can you without sin designate as King in a solemn address to God one whom you cannot without sin promise to obey as King These reasonings were unanswerable and Sherlock soon began to think them so but the conclusion to which they led him was diametrically opposed to the conclusion to which they were meant to lead him He hesitated however till a new light flashed on his mind from a quarter from which there was little reason to expect any thing but tenfold darkness In the reign of James the First Doctor John Overall Bishop of Exeter had written an elaborate treatise on the rights of civil and ecclesiastical governors This treatise had been solemnly approved by the Convocations of Canterbury and York and might therefore be considered as an authoritative exposition of the doctrine of the Church of England A copy of the manuscript was in Sancroft s possession and he soon after the Revolution sent it to the press He hoped doubtless that the publication would injure the new government but he was lamentably disappointed The book indeed condemned all resistance in terms as strong as he could himself have used but one passage which had escaped his notice was decisive against himself and his fellow schismatics Overall and the two Convocations which had given their sanction to Overall s teaching pronounced that a government which had originated in rebellion ought when thoroughly settled to be considered as ordained by God and to be obeyed by Christian men sixty Sherlock read and was convinced His venerable mother the Church had spoken and he with the docility of a child accepted her decree The government which had sprung from the Revolution might at least since the battle of the Boyne and the flight of James from Ireland be fairly called a settled government and ought therefore to be passively obeyed till it should be subverted by another revolution and succeeded by another settled government Sherlock took the oaths and speedily published in justification of his conduct a pamphlet entitled The Case of Allegiance to Sovereign Powers stated The sensation produced by this work was immense Dryden s Hind and Panther had not raised so great an uproar Halifax s Letter to a Dissenter had not called forth so many answers The replies to the Doctor the vindications of the Doctor the pasquinades on the Doctor would fill a library The clamour redoubled when it was known that the convert had not only been reappointed Master of the Temple but had accepted the Deanery of Saint Paul s which had become vacant in consequence of the deprivation of Sancroft and the promotion of Tillotson The rage of the nonjurors amounted almost to frenzy Was it not enough they asked to desert the true and pure Church in this her hour of sorrow and peril without also slandering her It was easy to understand why a greedy cowardly hypocrite should refuse to take the oaths to the usurper as long as it seemed probable that the rightful King would be restored and should make haste to swear after the battle of the Boyne Such tergiversation in times of civil discord was nothing new What was new was that the turncoat should try to throw his own guilt and shame on the Church of England and should proclaim that she had taught him to turn against the weak who were in the right and to cringe to the powerful who were in the wrong Had such indeed been her doctrine or her practice in evil days Had she abandoned her Royal Martyr in the prison or on the scaffold Had she enjoined her children to pay obedience to the Rump or to the Protector Yet was the government of the Rump or of the Protector less entitled to be called a settled government than the government of William and Mary Had not the battle of Worcester been as great a blow to the hopes of the House of Stuart as the battle of the Boyne Had not the chances of a Restoration seemed as small in sixteen fifty seven as they could seem to any judicious man in sixteen ninety one In spite of invectives and sarcasms however there was Overall s treatise there were the approving votes of the two Convocations and it was much easier to rail at Sherlock than to explain away either the treatise or the votes One writer maintained that by a thoroughly settled government must have been meant a government of which the title was uncontested Thus he said the government of the United Provinces became a settled government when it was recognised by Spain and but for that recognition would never have been a settled government to the end of time Another casuist somewhat less austere pronounced that a government wrongful in its origin might become a settled government after the lapse of a century On the thirteenth of February seventeen eighty nine therefore and not a day earlier Englishmen would be at liberty to swear allegiance to a government sprung from the Revolution The history of the chosen people was ransacked for precedents Was Eglon s a settled government when Ehud stabbed him Was Joram s a settled government when Jehe shot him But the leading case was that of Athaliah It was indeed a case which furnished the malecontents with many happy and pungent allusions a kingdom treacherously seized by an usurper near in blood to the throne the rightful prince long dispossessed a part of the sacerdotal order true through many disastrous years to the Royal House a counterrevolution at length effected by the High Priest at the head of the Levites Who it was asked would dare to blame the heroic pontiff who had restored the heir of David Yet was not the government of Athaliah as firmly settled as that of the Prince of Orange Hundreds of pages written at this time about the rights of Joash and the bold enterprise of Jehoiada are mouldering in the ancient bookcases of Oxford and Cambridge While Sherlock was thus fiercely attacked by his old friends he was not left unmolested by his old enemies Some vehement Whigs among whom Julian Johnson was conspicuous declared that Jacobitism itself was respectable when compared with the vile doctrine which had been discovered in the Convocation Book That passive obedience was due to Kings was doubtless an absurd and pernicious notion Yet it was impossible not to respect the consistency and fortitude of men who thought themselves bound to bear true allegiance at all hazards to an unfortunate a deposed an exiled oppressor But the theory which Sherlock had learned from Overall was unmixed baseness and wickedness A cause was to be abandoned not because it was unjust but because it was unprosperous Whether James had been a tyrant or had been the father of his people was quite immaterial If he had won the battle of the Boyne we should have been bound as Christians to be his slaves He had lost it and we were bound as Christians to be his foes Other Whigs congratulated the proselyte on having come by whatever road to a right practical conclusion but could not refrain from sneering at the history which he gave of his conversion He was they said a man of eminent learning and abilities He had studied the question of allegiance long and deeply He had written much about it Several months had been allowed him for reading prayer and reflection before he incurred suspension several months more before he incurred deprivation He had formed an opinion for which he had declared himself ready to suffer martyrdom he had taught that opinion to others and he had then changed that opinion solely because he had discovered that it had been not refuted but dogmatically pronounced erroneous by the two Convocations more than eighty years before Surely this was to renounce all liberty of private judgment and to ascribe to the Synods of Canterbury and York an infallibility which the Church of England had declared that even Oecumenical Councils could not justly claim If it was sarcastically said all our notions of right and wrong in matters of vital importance to the well being of society are to be suddenly altered by a few lines of manuscript found in a corner of the library at Lambeth it is surely much to be wished for the peace of mind of humble Christians that all the documents to which this sort of authority belongs should be rummaged out and sent to the press as soon as possible for unless this be done we may all like the Doctor when he refused the oaths last year be committing sins in the full persuasion that we are discharging duties In truth it is not easy to believe that the Convocation Book furnished Sherlock with any thing more than a pretext for doing what he had made up his mind to do The united force of reason and interest had doubtless convinced him that his passions and prejudices had led him into a great error That error he determined to recant and it cost him less to say that his opinion had been changed by newly discovered evidence than that he had formed a wrong judgment with all the materials for the forming of a right judgment before him The popular belief was that his retractation was the effect of the tears expostulations and reproaches of his wife The lady s spirit was high her authority in the family was great and she cared much more about her house and her carriage the plenty of her table and the prospects of her children than about the patriarchal origin of government or the meaning of the word Abdication She had it was asserted given her husband no peace by day or by night till he had got over his scruples In letters fables songs dialogues without number her powers of seduction and intimidation were malignantly extolled She was Xanthippe pouring water on the head of Socrates She was Dalilah shearing Samson She was Eve forcing the forbidden fruit into Adam s mouth She was Job s wife imploring her ruined lord who sate scraping himself among the ashes not to curse and die but to swear and live While the ballad makers celebrated the victory of missus Sherlock another class of assailants fell on the theological reputation of her spouse Till he took the oaths he had always been considered as the most orthodox of divines But the captious and malignant criticism to which his writings were now subjected would have found heresy in the Sermon on the Mount and he unfortunately was rash enough to publish at the very moment when the outcry against his political tergiversation was loudest his thoughts on the mystery of the Trinity It is probable that at another time his work would have been hailed by good Churchmen as a triumphant answer to the Socinians and Sabellians But unhappily in his zeal against Socinians and Sabellians he used expressions which might be construed into Tritheism Candid judges would have remembered that the true path was closely pressed on the right and on the left by error and that it was scarcely possible to keep far enough from danger on one side without going very close to danger on the other But candid judges Sherlock was not likely to find among the Jacobites His old allies affirmed that he had incurred all the fearful penalties denounced in the Athanasian Creed against those who divide the substance Bulky quartos were written to prove that he held the existence of three distinct Deities and some facetious malecontents who troubled themselves very little about the Catholic verity amused the town by lampoons in English and Latin on his heterodoxy We said one of these jesters plight our faith to one King and call one God to attest our promise We cannot think it strange that there should be more than one King to whom the Doctor has sworn allegiance when we consider that the Doctor has more Gods than one to swear by sixty one Sherlock would perhaps have doubted whether the government to which he had submitted was entitled to be called a settled government if he had known all the dangers by which it was threatened Scarcely had Preston s plot been detected when a new plot of a very different kind was formed in the camp in the navy in the treasury in the very bedchamber of the King This mystery of iniquity has through five generations been gradually unveiling but is not yet entirely unveiled Some parts which are still obscure may possibly by the discovery of letters or diaries now reposing under the dust of a century and a half be made clear to our posterity The materials however which are at present accessible are sufficient for the construction of a narrative not to be read without shame and loathing sixty two We have seen that in the spring of sixteen ninety Shrewsbury irritated by finding his counsels rejected and those of his Tory rivals followed suffered himself in a fatal hour to be drawn into a correspondence with the banished family We have seen also by what cruel sufferings of body and mind he expiated his fault Tortured by remorse and by disease the effect of remorse he had quitted the Court but he had left behind him men whose principles were not less lax than his and whose hearts were far harder and colder Early in sixteen ninety one some of these men began to hold secret communication with Saint Germains Wicked and base as their conduct was there was in it nothing surprising They did after their kind The times were troubled A thick cloud was upon the future The most sagacious and experienced politician could not see with any clearness three months before him To a man of virtue and honour indeed this mattered little His uncertainty as to what the morrow might bring forth might make him anxious but could not make him perfidious Though left in utter darkness as to what concerned his interests he had the sure guidance of his principles But unhappily men of virtue and honour were not numerous among the courtiers of that age Whitehall had been during thirty years a seminary of every public and private vice and swarmed with lowminded doubledealing selfseeking politicians These politicians now acted as it was natural that men profoundly immoral should act at a crisis of which none could predict the issue Some of them might have a slight predilection for William others a slight predilection for James but it was not by any such predilection that the conduct of any of the breed was guided If it had seemed certain that William would stand they would all have been for William If it had seemed certain that James would be restored they would all have been for James But what was to be done when the chances appeared to be almost exactly balanced There were honest men of one party who would have answered To stand by the true King and the true Church and if necessary to die for them like Laud There were honest men of the other party who would have answered To stand by the liberties of England and the Protestant religion and if necessary to die for them like Sidney But such consistency was unintelligible to many of the noble and the powerful Their object was to be safe in every event They therefore openly took the oath of allegiance to one King and secretly plighted their word to the other They were indefatigable in obtaining commissions patents of peerage pensions grants of crown land under the great seal of William and they had in their secret drawers promises of pardon in the handwriting of James Among those who were guilty of this wickedness three men stand preeminent Russell Godolphin and Marlborough No three men could be in head and heart more unlike to one another and the peculiar qualities of each gave a peculiar character to his villany The treason of Russell is to be attributed partly to fractiousness the treason of Godolphin is to be attributed altogether to timidity the treason of Marlborough was the treason of a man of great genius and boundless ambition It may be thought strange that Russell should have been out of humour He had just accepted the command of the united naval forces of England and Holland with the rank of Admiral of the Fleet He was Treasurer of the Navy He had a pension of three thousand pounds a year Crown property near Charing Cross to the value of eighteen thousand pounds had been bestowed on him His indirect gains must have been immense But he was still dissatisfed In truth with undaunted courage with considerable talents both for war and for administration and with a certain public spirit which showed itself by glimpses even in the very worst parts of his life he was emphatically a bad man insolent malignant greedy faithless He conceived that the great services which he had performed at the time of the Revolution had not been adequately rewarded Every thing that was given to others seemed to him to be pillaged from himself A letter is still extant which he wrote to William about this time It is made up of boasts reproaches and sneers The Admiral with ironical professions of humility and loyalty begins by asking permission to put his wrongs on paper because his bashfulness would not suffer him to explain himself by word of mouth His grievances were intolerable Other people got grants of royal domains but he could get scarcely any thing Other people could provide for their dependants but his recommendations were uniformly disregarded The income which he derived from the royal favour might seem large but he had poor relations and the government instead of doing its duty by them had most unhandsomely left them to his care He had a sister who ought to have a pension for without one she could not give portions to her daughters He had a brother who for want of a place had been reduced to the melancholy necessity of marrying an old woman for her money Russell proceeded to complain bitterly that the Whigs were neglected that the Revolution had aggrandised and enriched men who had made the greatest efforts to avert it And there is reason to believe that this complaint came from his heart For next to his own interests those of his party were dear to him and even when he was most inclined to become a Jacobite he never had the smallest disposition to become a Tory In the temper which this letter indicates he readily listened to the suggestions of David Lloyd one of the ablest and most active emissaries who at this time were constantly plying between France and England Lloyd conveyed to James assurances that Russell would when a favourable opportunity should present itself try to effect by means of the fleet what Monk had effected in the preceding generation by means of the army sixty three To what extent these assurances were sincere was a question about which men who knew Russell well and who were minutely informed as to his conduct were in doubt It seems probable that during many months he did not know his own mind His interest was to stand well as long as possible with both Kings His irritable and imperious nature was constantly impelling him to quarrel with both His spleen was excited one week by a dry answer from William and the next week by an absurd proclamation from James Fortunately the most important day of his life the day from which all his subsequent years took their colour found him out of temper with the banished King Godolphin had not and did not pretend to have any cause of complaint against the government which he served He was First Commissioner of the Treasury He had been protected trusted caressed Indeed the favour shown to him had excited many murmurs Was it fitting the Whigs had indignantly asked that a man who had been high in office through the whole of the late reign who had promised to vote for the Indulgence who had sate in the Privy Council with a Jesuit who had sate at the Board of Treasury with two Papists who had attended an idolatress to her altar should be among the chief ministers of a Prince whose title to the throne was derived from the Declaration of Rights But on William this clamour had produced no effect and none of his English servants seems to have had at this time a larger share of his confidence than Godolphin 
6512-67886-0000	train-other-500	Nevertheless the Jacobites did not despair One of the most zealous among them a gentleman named Bulkeley who had formerly been on terms of intimacy with Godolphin undertook to see what could be done
6512-67886-0001	train-other-500	He called at the Treasury and tried to draw the First Lord into political talk This was no easy matter for Godolphin was not a man to put himself lightly into the power of others His reserve was proverbial
6512-67886-0002	train-other-500	and he was especially renowned for the dexterity with which he through life turned conversation away from matters of state to a main of cocks or the pedigree of a racehorse
6512-67886-0003	train-other-500	The visit ended without his uttering a word indicating that he remembered the existence of King James Bulkeley however was not to be so repulsed
6512-67886-0004	train-other-500	He came again and introduced the subject which was nearest his heart Godolphin then asked after his old master and mistress in the mournful tone of a man who despaired of ever being reconciled to them
6512-67886-0005	train-other-500	Bulkeley assured him that King James was ready to forgive all the past May I tell His Majesty that you will try to deserve his favour At this Godolphin rose said something about the trammels of office
6512-67886-0006	train-other-500	and his wish to be released from them and put an end to the interview Bulkeley soon made a third attempt By this time Godolphin had learned some things which shook his confidence in the stability of the government
none	none	 which he served 
6512-67886-0007	train-other-500	He began to think as he would himself have expressed it that he had betted too deep on the Revolution and that it was time to hedge Evasions would no longer serve his turn It was necessary to speak out
6512-67886-0008	train-other-500	He spoke out and declared himself a devoted servant of King James I shall take an early opportunity of
none	none	 resigning my place 
6512-67886-0009	train-other-500	But till then I am under a tie I must not betray my trust To enhance the value of the sacrifice which he proposed to make he produced a most friendly and confidential letter which he had lately received from William
6512-67886-0010	train-other-500	You see how entirely the Prince of Orange trusts me He tells me that he cannot do without me and that there is no Englishman for whom he has so great a kindness but all this weighs nothing with me
none	none	 in comparison of my duty to my lawful King 
6512-67886-0011	train-other-500	If the First Lord of the Treasury really had scruples about betraying his trust those scruples were soon so effectually removed that he very complacently continued during six years to eat the bread of one master
6512-67886-0012	train-other-500	while secretly sending professions of attachment and promises of service to another The truth is that Godolphin was under the influence of a mind far more powerful and far more depraved than his own His perplexities
6512-67886-0013	train-other-500	had been imparted to Marlborough to whom he had long been bound by such friendship as two very unprincipled men are capable of feeling for each other and to whom he was afterwards bound by close domestic ties
6512-67886-0014	train-other-500	Marlborough was in a very different situation from that of William s other servants Lloyd might make overtures to Russell and Bulkeley to Godolphin But all the agents of the banished Court stood aloof from the traitor of Salisbury
6512-67886-0015	train-other-500	That shameful night seemed to have for ever separated the perjured deserter from the Prince whom he had ruined James had even in the last extremity when his army was in full retreat when his whole kingdom had risen against him declared
6512-67886-0016	train-other-500	that he would never pardon Churchill never never By all the Jacobites the name of Churchill was held in peculiar abhorrence and in the prose and verse which came forth daily from their secret presses a precedence in infamy
6512-67886-0017	train-other-500	among all the many traitors of the age was assigned to him In the order of things which had sprung from the Revolution he was one of the great men of England high in the state high in the army He had been created an Earl
6512-67886-0018	train-other-500	He had a large share in the military administration The emoluments direct and indirect of the places and commands which he held under the Crown were believed at the Dutch Embassy to amount to twelve thousand pounds a year
6512-67886-0019	train-other-500	In the event of a counterrevolution it seemed that he had nothing in prospect but a garret in Holland or a scaffold on Tower Hill It might therefore have been expected that he would serve his new master with fidelity
6512-67886-0020	train-other-500	not indeed with the fidelity of Nottingham which was the fidelity of conscientiousness not with the fidelity of Portland which was the fidelity of affection but with the not less stubborn fidelity of despair
6512-67886-0021	train-other-500	Those who thought thus knew but little of Marlborough Confident in his own powers of deception he resolved since the Jacobite agents would not seek him to seek them He therefore sent to beg an interview with Colonel Edward Sackville
6512-67886-0022	train-other-500	Sackville was astonished and not much pleased by the message He was a sturdy Cavalier of the old school He had been persecuted in the days of the Popish plot for manfully saying what he thought
none	none	 and what every body now thinks about Oates and Bedloe sixty four Since the Revolution 
6512-67886-0023	train-other-500	he had put his neck in peril for King James had been chased by officers with warrants and had been designated as a traitor in a proclamation to which Marlborough himself
none	none	 had been a party sixty five It was not without reluctance that the stanch 
6512-67886-0024	train-other-500	royalist crossed the hated threshold of the deserter He was repaid for his effort by the edifying spectacle of such an agony of repentance as he had never before seen Will you
6512-67886-0025	train-other-500	said Marlborough be my intercessor with the King Will you tell him what I suffer My crimes now appear to me in their true light and I shrink with horror from the contemplation The thought of them is with me day and night
6512-67886-0026	train-other-500	I sit down to table but I cannot eat I throw myself on my bed but I cannot sleep I am ready to sacrifice every thing to brave every thing to bring utter ruin on my fortunes
6512-67886-0027	train-other-500	if only I may be free from the misery of a wounded spirit If appearances could be trusted this great offender was as true a penitent as David or as Peter Sackville reported to his friends what had passed They could
6512-67886-0028	train-other-500	not but acknowledge that if the arch traitor who had hitherto opposed to conscience and to public opinion the same cool and placid hardihood which distinguished him on fields of battle had really begun to feel remorse
6512-67886-0029	train-other-500	it would be absurd to reject on account of his unworthiness the inestimable services which it was in his power to render to the good cause He sate in the interior council he held high command in the army
6512-67886-0030	train-other-500	he had been recently entrusted and would doubtless again be entrusted with the direction of important military operations It was true that no man had incurred equal guilt but it was true also that no man had it in his power
6512-67886-0031	train-other-500	to make equal reparation If he was sincere he might doubtless earn the pardon which he so much desired But was he sincere Had he not been just as loud in professions of loyalty on the very eve of his crime
6512-67886-0032	train-other-500	It was necessary to put him to the test Several tests were applied by Sackville and Lloyd Marlborough was required to furnish full information
none	none	 touching the strength and the distribution of all the divisions of the English army and he complied He was required to disclose the whole plan of the approaching campaign and he did so The Jacobite leaders watched carefully for inaccuracies in his reports but could find none 
6512-67886-0033	train-other-500	It was thought a still stronger proof of his fidelity that he gave valuable intelligence
none	none	 about what was doing in the office of the Secretary of State 
6512-67886-0034	train-other-500	A deposition had been sworn against one zealous royalist A warrant was preparing against another These intimations saved several of the malecontents from imprisonment if not from the gallows and it was impossible for them not to feel
6512-67886-0035	train-other-500	some relenting towards the awakened sinner to whom they owed so much He however in his secret conversations with his new allies laid no claim to merit He did not he said ask for confidence How could he
6512-67886-0036	train-other-500	after the villanies which he had committed against the best of Kings hope ever to be trusted again It was enough for a wretch like him to be permitted to make at the cost of his life some poor atonement to the gracious master
6512-67886-0037	train-other-500	whom he had indeed basely injured but whom he had never ceased to love It was not improbable that in the summer he might command the English forces in Flanders Was it wished that he should bring them over in a body to the French camp
6512-67886-0038	train-other-500	If such were the royal pleasure he would undertake that the thing should be done But on the whole he thought that it would be better to wait till the next session of Parliament And then he hinted at a plan which he afterwards more fully matured
6512-67886-0039	train-other-500	for expelling the usurper by means of the English legislature and the English army In the meantime he hoped that James would command Godolphin not to quit the Treasury A private man could do little for the good cause One
none	none	 who was the director of the national finances and the depository of the gravest secrets of state 
6512-67886-0040	train-other-500	might render inestimable services Marlborough s pretended repentance imposed so completely on those who managed the affairs of James in London that they sent Lloyd to France with the cheering intelligence that the most depraved of all rebels
6512-67886-0041	train-other-500	had been wonderfully transformed into a loyal subject The tidings filled James with delight and hope Had he been wise they would have excited in him only aversion and distrust It was absurd to imagine that a man really heartbroken
6512-67886-0042	train-other-500	by remorse and shame for one act of perfidy would determine to lighten his conscience by committing a second act of perfidy as odious and as disgraceful as the first The promised atonement was so wicked and base
none	none	 that it never could be made by any man sincerely desirous to atone for past wickedness and baseness The truth was that when Marlborough told the Jacobites that his sense of guilt prevented him from swallowing his food by day and taking his rest at night 
6512-67886-0043	train-other-500	he was laughing at them The loss of half a guinea would have done more to spoil his appetite and to disturb his slumbers than all the terrors of an evil conscience What his offers really proved was that his former crime had sprung
6512-67886-0044	train-other-500	not from an ill regulated zeal for the interests of his country and his religion but from a deep and incurable moral disease which had infected the whole man James however
6512-67886-0045	train-other-500	partly from dulness and partly from selfishness could never see any immorality in any action by which he was benefited To conspire against him to betray him to break an oath of allegiance sworn to him
6512-67886-0046	train-other-500	were crimes for which no punishment here or hereafter could be too severe But to murder his enemies to break faith with his enemies was not only innocent but laudable The desertion at Salisbury
6512-67886-0047	train-other-500	had been the worst of crimes for it had ruined him A similar desertion in Flanders would be an honourable exploit for it might restore him The penitent was informed by his Jacobite friends that he was forgiven
6512-67886-0048	train-other-500	The news was most welcome but something more was necessary to restore his lost peace of mind Might he hope to have in the royal handwriting two lines containing a promise of pardon
6512-67886-0049	train-other-500	It was not of course for his own sake that he asked this But he was confident that with such a document in his hands he could bring back to the right path some persons of great note who adhered to the usurper only because they imagined
6512-67886-0050	train-other-500	that they had no mercy to expect from the legitimate King They would return to their duty as soon as they saw that even the worst of all criminals had on his repentance been generously forgiven The promise was written sent
6512-67886-0051	train-other-500	and carefully treasured up Marlborough had now attained one object an object which was common to him with Russell and Godolphin But he had other objects which neither Russell nor Godolphin had ever contemplated There is
6512-67886-0052	train-other-500	as we shall hereafter see strong reason to believe that this wise brave wicked man was meditating a plan worthy of his fertile intellect and daring spirit and not less worthy of his deeply corrupted heart
6512-67886-0053	train-other-500	a plan which if it had not been frustrated by strange means would have ruined William without benefiting James

none	none	 and of whose recent negotiations with Saint Germains he had not the faintest suspicion At the Hague several important military and political consultations were held and on every occasion the superiority of the accomplished Englishman was felt by the most distinguished 
6512-67886-0056	train-other-500	soldiers and statesmen of the United Provinces Heinsius long after used to relate a conversation which took place at this time between William and the Prince of Vaudemont one of the ablest commanders in the Dutch service
6512-67886-0057	train-other-500	Vaudemont spoke well of several English officers and among them of Talmash and Mackay but pronounced Marlborough superior beyond comparison to the rest He has every quality of a general His very look shows it
6512-67886-0058	train-other-500	He cannot fail to achieve something great I really believe cousin answered the King
none	none	 that my Lord will make good every thing that you have said of him There was still a short interval before the commencement of military operations William passed that interval in his beloved park at Loo Marlborough spent two or three days there and was then despatched to Flanders 
6512-67886-0059	train-other-500	with orders to collect all the English forces to form a camp in the neighbourhood of Brussels and to have every thing in readiness for the King s arrival And now Marlborough had an opportunity of proving the sincerity
6512-67886-0060	train-other-500	of those professions by which he had obtained from a heart well described by himself as harder than a marble chimneypiece the pardon of an offence such as might have moved even a gentle nature to deadly resentment
6512-67886-0061	train-other-500	He received from Saint Germains a message claiming the instant performance of his promise to desert at the head of his troops He was told that this was the greatest service which he could render to the Crown His word was pledged
6512-67886-0062	train-other-500	and the gracious master who had forgiven all past errors confidently expected that it would be redeemed The hypocrite evaded the demand with characteristic dexterity
6512-67886-0063	train-other-500	In the most respectful and affectionate language he excused himself for not immediately obeying the royal commands The promise which he was required to fulfil had not been quite correctly understood
none	none	 There had been some misapprehension on the part of the messengers To carry over a regiment or two would do more harm than good To carry over a whole army was a business which would require much time and management sixty six While James was murmuring over these apologies and wishing that he had not been quite so placable 
6512-67886-0064	train-other-500	William arrived at the head quarters of the allied forces and took the chief command The military operations in Flanders recommenced early in June and terminated at the close of September
6512-67886-0065	train-other-500	No important action took place The two armies marched and countermarched drew near and receded During some time they confronted each other with less than a league between them But neither William nor Luxemburg
6512-67886-0066	train-other-500	would fight except at an advantage and neither gave the other any advantage Languid as the campaign was it is on one account remarkable During more than a century our country had sent no great force to make war by land
none	none	 out of the British isles Our aristocracy had therefore long ceased to be a military class The nobles of France of Germany of Holland were generally soldiers It would probably have been difficult to find

6512-67886-0070	train-other-500	The wars of Charles the Second had been almost entirely maritime During his reign therefore the sea service had been decidedly more the mode than the land service and repeatedly when our fleet sailed to encounter the Dutch

somewhat more vigour in other parts of Europe The French gained some advantages in Catalonia and in Piedmont Their Turkish allies who in the east menaced the dominions of the Emperor were defeated by Lewis of Baden in a great battle But nowhere were the events of the summer so important as in Ireland From October sixteen ninety till May sixteen ninety one no military operation on a large scale was attempted in that kingdom The area of the island was during the winter and spring not unequally divided between the contending races The whole of Ulster the greater part of Leinster and about one third of Munster had submitted to the English The whole of Connaught the greater part of Munster and two or three counties of Leinster were held by the Irish The tortuous boundary formed by William s garrisons ran in a north eastern direction from the bay of Castlehaven to Mallow and then inclining still further eastward proceeded to Cashel From Cashel the line went to Mullingar from Mullingar to Longford and from Longford to Cavan skirted Lough Erne on the west and met the ocean again at Ballyshannon sixty eight On the English side of this pale there was a rude and imperfect order Two Lords Justices Coningsby and Porter assisted by a Privy Council represented King William at Dublin Castle Judges Sheriffs and Justices of the Peace had been appointed and assizes were after a long interval held in several county towns The colonists had meanwhile been formed into a strong militia under the command of officers who had commissions from the Crown The trainbands of the capital consisted of two thousand five hundred foot two troops of horse and two troops of dragoons all Protestants and all well armed and clad sixty nine On the fourth of November the anniversary of William s birth and on the fifth the anniversary of his landing at Torbay the whole of this force appeared in all the pomp of war The vanquished and disarmed natives assisted with suppressed grief and anger at the triumph of the caste which they had five months before oppressed and plundered with impunity The Lords Justices went in state to Saint Patrick s Cathedral bells were rung bonfires were lighted hogsheads of ale and claret were set abroach in the streets fireworks were exhibited on College Green a great company of nobles and public functionaries feasted at the Castle and as the second course came up the trumpets sounded and Ulster King at Arms proclaimed in Latin French and English William and Mary by the grace of God King and Queen of Great Britain France and Ireland seventy Within the territory where the Saxon race was dominant trade and industry had already begun to revive The brazen counters which bore the image and superscription of James gave place to silver The fugitives who had taken refuge in England came back in multitudes and by their intelligence diligence and thrift the devastation caused by two years of confusion and robbery was soon in part repaired Merchantmen heavily laden were constantly passing and repassing Saint George s Channel The receipts of the custom houses on the eastern coast from Cork to Londonderry amounted in six months to sixty seven thousand five hundred pounds a sum such as would have been thought extraordinary even in the most prosperous times seventy one The Irish who remained within the English pale were one and all hostile to the English domination They were therefore subjected to a rigorous system of police the natural though lamentable effect of extreme danger and extreme provocation A Papist was not permitted to have a sword or a gun He was not permitted to go more than three miles out of his parish except to the market town on the market day Lest he should give information or assistance to his brethren who occupied the western half of the island he was forbidden to live within ten miles of the frontier Lest he should turn his house into a place of resort for malecontents he was forbidden to sell liquor by retail One proclamation announced that if the property of any Protestant should be injured by marauders his loss should be made good at the expense of his Popish neighbours Another gave notice that if any Papist who had not been at least three months domiciled in Dublin should be found there he should be treated as a spy Not more than five Papists were to assemble in the capital or its neighbourhood on any pretext Without a protection from the government no member of the Church of Rome was safe and the government would not grant a protection to any member of the Church of Rome who had a son in the Irish army seventy two In spite of all precautions and severities however the Celt found many opportunities of taking a sly revenge Houses and barns were frequently burned soldiers were frequently murdered and it was scarcely possible to obtain evidence against the malefactors who had with them the sympathies of the whole population On such occasions the government sometimes ventured on acts which seemed better suited to a Turkish than to an English administration One of these acts became a favourite theme of Jacobite pamphleteers and was the subject of a serious parliamentary inquiry at Westminster Six musketeers were found butchered only a few miles from Dublin The inhabitants of the village where the crime had been committed men women and children were driven like sheep into the Castle where the Privy Council was sitting The heart of one of the assassins named Gafney failed him He consented to be a witness was examined by the Board acknowledged his guilt and named some of his accomplices He was then removed in custody but a priest obtained access to him during a few minutes What passed during those few minutes appeared when he was a second time brought before the Council He had the effrontery to deny that he had owned any thing or accused any body His hearers several of whom had taken down his confession in writing were enraged at his impudence The Lords justices broke out You are a rogue You are a villain You shall be hanged Where is the Provost Marshal The Provost Marshal came Take that man said Coningsby pointing to Gafney take that man and hang him There was no gallows ready but the carriage of a gun served the purpose and the prisoner was instantly tied up without a trial without even a written order for the execution and this though the courts of law were sitting at the distance of only a few hundred yards The English House of Commons some years later after a long discussion resolved without a division that the order for the execution of Gafney was arbitrary and illegal but that Coningsby s fault was so much extenuated by the circumstances in which he was placed that it was not a proper subject for impeachment seventy three It was not only by the implacable hostility of the Irish that the Saxon of the pale was at this time harassed His allies caused him almost as much annoyance as his helots The help of troops from abroad was indeed necessary to him but it was dearly bought Even William in whom the whole civil and military authority was concentrated had found it difficult to maintain discipline in an army collected from many lands and composed in great part of mercenaries accustomed to live at free quarters The powers which had been united in him were now divided and subdivided The two Lords justices considered the civil administration as their province and left the army to the management of Ginkell who was General in Chief Ginkell kept excellent order among the auxiliaries from Holland who were under his more immediate command But his authority over the English and the Danes was less entire and unfortunately their pay was during part of the winter in arrear They indemnified themselves by excesses and exactions for the want of that which was their due and it was hardly possible to punish men with severity for not choosing to starve with arms in their hands At length in the spring large supplies of money and stores arrived arrears were paid up rations were plentiful and a more rigid discipline was enforced But too many traces of the bad habits which the soldiers had contracted were discernible till the close of the war seventy four In that part of Ireland meanwhile which still acknowledged James as King there could hardly be said to be any law any property or any government The Roman Catholics of Ulster and Leinster had fled westward by tens of thousands driving before them a large part of the cattle which had escaped the havoc of two terrible years The influx of food into the Celtic region however was far from keeping pace with the influx of consumers The necessaries of life were scarce Conveniences to which every plain farmer and burgess in England was accustomed could hardly be procured by nobles and generals No coin was to be seen except lumps of base metal which were called crowns and shillings Nominal prices were enormously high A quart of ale cost two and sixpence a quart of brandy three pounds The only towns of any note on the western coast were Limerick and Galway and the oppression which the shopkeepers of those towns underwent was such that many of them stole away with the remains of their stocks to the English territory where a Papist though he had to endure much restraint and much humiliation was allowed to put his own price on his goods and received that price in silver Those traders who remained within the unhappy region were ruined Every warehouse that contained any valuable property was broken open by ruffians who pretended that they were commissioned to procure stores for the public service and the owner received in return for bales of cloth and hogsheads of sugar some fragments of old kettles and saucepans which would not in London or Paris have been taken by a beggar As soon as a merchant ship arrived in the bay of Galway or in the Shannon she was boarded by these robbers The cargo was carried away and the proprietor was forced to content himself with such a quantity of cowhides of wool and of tallow as the gang which had plundered him chose to give him The consequence was that while foreign commodities were pouring fast into the harbours of Londonderry Carrickfergus Dublin Waterford and Cork every mariner avoided Limerick and Galway as nests of pirates seventy five The distinction between the Irish foot soldier and the Irish Rapparee had never been very strongly marked It now disappeared Great part of the army was turned loose to live by marauding An incessant predatory war raged along the line which separated the domain of William from that of James Every day companies of freebooters sometimes wrapped in twisted straw which served the purpose of armour stole into the English territory burned sacked pillaged and hastened back to their own ground To guard against these incursions was not easy for the peasantry of the plundered country had a strong fellow feeling with the plunderers To empty the granary to set fire to the dwelling to drive away the cows of a heretic was regarded by every squalid inhabitant of a mud cabin as a good work A troop engaged in such a work might confidently expect to fall in notwithstanding all the proclamations of the Lords justices with some friend who would indicate the richest booty the shortest road and the safest hiding place The English complained that it was no easy matter to catch a Rapparee Sometimes when he saw danger approaching he lay down in the long grass of the bog and then it was as difficult to find him as to find a hare sitting Sometimes he sprang into a stream and lay there like an otter with only his mouth and nostrils above the water Nay a whole gang of banditti would in the twinkling of an eye transform itself into a crowd of harmless labourers Every man took his gun to pieces hid the lock in his clothes stuck a cork in the muzzle stopped the touch hole with a quill and threw the weapon into the next pond Nothing was to be seen but a train of poor rustics who had not so much as a cudgel among them and whose humble look and crouching walk seemed to show that their spirit was thoroughly broken to slavery When the peril was over when the signal was given every man flew to the place where he had hid his arms and soon the robbers were in full march towards some Protestant mansion One band penetrated to Clonmel another to the vicinity of Maryborough a third made its den in a woody islet of firm ground surrounded by the vast bog of Allen harried the county of Wicklow and alarmed even the suburbs of Dublin Such expeditions indeed were not always successful Sometimes the plunderers fell in with parties of militia or with detachments from the English garrisons in situations in which disguise flight and resistance were alike impossible When this happened every kerne who was taken was hanged without any ceremony on the nearest tree seventy six At the head quarters of the Irish army there was during the winter no authority capable of exacting obedience even within a circle of a mile Tyrconnel was absent at the Court of France He had left the supreme government in the hands of a Council of Regency composed of twelve persons The nominal command of the army he had confided to Berwick but Berwick though as was afterwards proved a man of no common courage and capacity was young and inexperienced His powers were unsuspected by the world and by himself seventy seven and he submitted without reluctance to the tutelage of a Council of War nominated by the Lord Lieutenant Neither the Council of Regency nor the Council of War was popular at Limerick The Irish complained that men who were not Irish had been entrusted with a large share in the administration The cry was loudest against an officer named Thomas Maxwell For it was certain that he was a Scotchman it was doubtful whether he was a Roman Catholic and he had not concealed the dislike which he felt for that Celtic Parliament which had repealed the Act of Settlement and passed the Act of Attainder seventy eight The discontent fomented by the arts of intriguers among whom the cunning and unprincipled Henry Luttrell seems to have been the most active soon broke forth into open rebellion A great meeting was held Many officers of the army some peers some lawyers of high note and some prelates of the Roman Catholic Church were present It was resolved that the government set up by the Lord Lieutenant was unknown to the constitution Ireland it was said could be legally governed in the absence of the King only by a Lord Lieutenant by a Lord Deputy or by Lords Justices The King was absent The Lord Lieutenant was absent There was no Lord Deputy There were no Lords Justices The Act by which Tyrconnel had delegated his authority to a junto composed of his creatures was a mere nullity The nation was therefore left without any legitimate chief and might without violating the allegiance due to the Crown make temporary provision for its own safety A deputation was sent to inform Berwick that he had assumed a power to which he had no right but that nevertheless the army and people of Ireland would willingly acknowledge him as their head if he would consent to govern by the advice of a council truly Irish Berwick indignantly expressed his wonder that military men should presume to meet and deliberate without the permission of their general They answered that there was no general and that if His Grace did not choose to undertake the administration on the terms proposed another leader would easily be found Berwick very reluctantly yielded and continued to be a puppet in a new set of hands seventy nine Those who had effected this revolution thought it prudent to send a deputation to France for the purpose of vindicating their proceedings Of the deputation the Roman Catholic Bishop of Cork and the two Luttrells were members In the ship which conveyed them from Limerick to Brest they found a fellow passenger whose presence was by no means agreeable to them their enemy Maxwell They suspected and not without reason that he was going like them to Saint Germains but on a very different errand The truth was that Berwick had sent Maxwell to watch their motions and to traverse their designs Henry Luttrell the least scrupulous of men proposed to settle the matter at once by tossing the Scotchman into the sea But the Bishop who was a man of conscience and Simon Luttrell who was a man of honour objected to this expedient eighty Meanwhile at Limerick the supreme power was in abeyance Berwick finding that he had no real authority altogether neglected business and gave himself up to such pleasures as that dreary place of banishment afforded There was among the Irish chiefs no man of sufficient weight and ability to control the rest Sarsfield for a time took the lead But Sarsfield though eminently brave and active in the field was little skilled in the administration of war and still less skilled in civil business Those who were most desirous to support his authority were forced to own that his nature was too unsuspicious and indulgent for a post in which it was hardly possible to be too distrustful or too severe He believed whatever was told him He signed whatever was set before him The commissaries encouraged by his lenity robbed and embezzled more shamelessly than ever They sallied forth daily guarded by pikes and firelocks to seize nominally for the public service but really for themselves wool linen leather tallow domestic utensils instruments of husbandry searched every pantry every wardrobe every cellar and even laid sacrilegious hands on the property of priests and prelates eighty one Early in the spring the government if it is to be so called of which Berwick was the ostensible head was dissolved by the return of Tyrconnel The Luttrells had in the name of their countrymen implored James not to subject so loyal a people to so odious and incapable a viceroy Tyrconnel they said was old he was infirm he needed much sleep he knew nothing of war he was dilatory he was partial he was rapacious he was distrusted and hated by the whole nation The Irish deserted by him had made a gallant stand and had compelled the victorious army of the Prince of Orange to retreat They hoped soon to take the field again thirty thousand strong and they adjured their King to send them some captain worthy to command such a force Tyrconnel and Maxwell on the other hand represented the delegates as mutineers demagogues traitors and pressed James to send Henry Luttrell to keep Mountjoy company in the Bastille James bewildered by these criminations and recriminations hesitated long and at last with characteristic wisdom relieved himself from trouble by giving all the quarrellers fair words and by sending them all back to have their fight out in Ireland Berwick was at the same time recalled to France eighty two Tyrconnel was received at Limerick even by his enemies with decent respect Much as they hated him they could not question the validity of his commission and though they still maintained that they had been perfectly justified in annulling during his absence the unconstitutional arrangements which he had made they acknowledged that when he was present he was their lawful governor He was not altogether unprovided with the means of conciliating them He brought many gracious messages and promises a patent of peerage for Sarsfield some money which was not of brass and some clothing which was even more acceptable than money The new garments were not indeed very fine But even the generals had long been out at elbows and there were few of the common men whose habiliments would have been thought sufficient to dress a scarecrow in a more prosperous country Now at length for the first time in many months every private soldier could boast of a pair of breeches and a pair of brogues The Lord Lieutenant had also been authorised to announce that he should soon be followed by several ships laden with provisions and military stores This announcement was most welcome to the troops who had long been without bread and who had nothing stronger than water to drink eighty three During some weeks the supplies were impatiently expected At last Tyrconnel was forced to shut himself up for whenever he appeared in public the soldiers ran after him clamouring for food Even the beef and mutton which half raw half burned without vegetables without salt had hitherto supported the army had become scarce and the common men were on rations of horseflesh when the promised sails were seen in the mouth of the Shannon eighty four A distinguished French general named Saint Ruth was on board with his staff He brought a commission which appointed him commander in chief of the Irish army The commission did not expressly declare that he was to be independent of the viceregal authority but he had been assured by James that Tyrconnel should have secret instructions not to intermeddle in the conduct of the war Saint Ruth was assisted by another general officer named D Usson The French ships brought some arms some ammunition and a plentiful supply of corn and flour The spirits of the Irish rose and the Te Deum was chaunted with fervent devotion in the cathedral of Limerick eighty five Tyrconnel had made no preparations for the approaching campaign But Saint Ruth as soon as he had landed exerted himself strenuously to redeem the time which had been lost He was a man of courage activity and resolution but of a harsh and imperious nature In his own country he was celebrated as the most merciless persecutor that had ever dragooned the Huguenots to mass It was asserted by English Whigs that he was known in France by the nickname of the Hangman that at Rome the very cardinals had shown their abhorrence of his cruelty and that even Queen Christina who had little right to be squeamish about bloodshed had turned away from him with loathing He had recently held a command in Savoy The Irish regiments in the French service had formed part of his army and had behaved extremely well It was therefore supposed that he had a peculiar talent for managing Irish troops But there was a wide difference between the well clad well armed and well drilled Irish with whom he was familiar and the ragged marauders whom he found swarming in the alleys of Limerick Accustomed to the splendour and the discipline of French camps and garrisons he was disgusted by finding that in the country to which he had been sent a regiment of infantry meant a mob of people as naked as dirty and as disorderly as the beggars whom he had been accustomed to see on the Continent besieging the door of a monastery or pursuing a diligence up him With ill concealed contempt however he addressed himself vigorously to the task of disciplining these strange soldiers and was day and night in the saddle galloping from post to post from Limerick to Athlone from Athlone to the northern extremity of Lough Rea and from Lough Rea back to Limerick eighty six It was indeed necessary that he should bestir himself for a few days after his arrival he learned that on the other side of the Pale all was ready for action The greater part of the English force was collected before the close of May in the neighbourhood of Mullingar Ginkell commanded in chief He had under him the two best officers after Marlborough of whom our island could then boast Talmash and Mackay The Marquess of Ruvigny the hereditary chief of the refugees and elder brother of the brave Caillemot who had fallen at the Boyne had joined the army with the rank of major general The Lord Justice Coningsby though not by profession a soldier came down from Dublin to animate the zeal of the troops The appearance of the camp showed that the money voted by the English Parliament had not been spared The uniforms were new the ranks were one blaze of scarlet and the train of artillery was such as had never before been seen in Ireland eighty seven On the sixth of June Ginkell moved his head quarters from Mullingar On the seventh he reached Ballymore At Ballymore on a peninsula almost surrounded by something between a swamp and a lake stood an ancient fortress which had recently been fortified under Sarsfield s direction and which was defended by above a thousand men The English guns were instantly planted In a few hours the besiegers had the satisfaction of seeing the besieged running like rabbits from one shelter to another The governor who had at first held high language begged piteously for quarter and obtained it The whole garrison were marched off to Dublin Only eight of the conquerors had fallen eighty eight Ginkell passed some days in reconstructing the defences of Ballymore This work had scarcely been performed when he was joined by the Danish auxiliaries under the command of the Duke of Wirtemberg The whole army then moved westward and on the nineteenth of June appeared before the walls of Athlone eighty nine Athlone was perhaps in a military point of view the most important place in the island Rosen who understood war well had always maintained that it was there that the Irishry would with most advantage make a stand against the Englishry ninety The town which was surrounded by ramparts of earth lay partly in Leinster and partly in Connaught The English quarter which was in Leinster had once consisted of new and handsome houses but had been burned by the Irish some months before and now lay in heaps of ruin The Celtic quarter which was in Connaught was old and meanly built ninety one The Shannon which is the boundary of the two provinces rushed through Athlone in a deep and rapid stream and turned two large mills which rose on the arches of a stone bridge Above the bridge on the Connaught side a castle built it was said by King John towered to the height of seventy feet and extended two hundred feet along the river Fifty or sixty yards below the bridge was a narrow ford ninety two During the night of the nineteenth the English placed their cannon On the morning of the twentieth the firing began At five in the afternoon an assault was made A brave French refugee with a grenade in his hand was the first to climb the breach and fell cheering his countrymen to the onset with his latest breath Such were the gallant spirits which the bigotry of Lewis had sent to recruit in the time of his utmost need the armies of his deadliest enemies The example was not lost The grenades fell thick The assailants mounted by hundreds The Irish gave way and ran towards the bridge There the press was so great that some of the fugitives were crushed to death in the narrow passage and others were forced over the parapets into the waters which roared among the mill wheels below In a few hours Ginkell had made himself master of the English quarter of Athlone and this success had cost him only twenty men killed and forty wounded ninety three But his work was only begun Between him and the Irish town the Shannon ran fiercely The bridge was so narrow that a few resolute men might keep it against an army The mills which stood on it were strongly guarded and it was commanded by the guns of the castle That part of the Connaught shore where the river was fordable was defended by works which the Lord Lieutenant had in spite of the murmurs of a powerful party forced Saint Ruth to entrust to the care of Maxwell Maxwell had come back from France a more unpopular man than he had been when he went thither It was rumoured that he had at Versailles spoken opprobriously of the Irish nation and he had on this account been only a few days before publicly affronted by Sarsfield ninety four On the twenty first of June the English were busied in flinging up batteries along the Leinster bank On the twenty second soon after dawn the cannonade began The firing continued all that day and all the following night When morning broke again one whole side of the castle had been beaten down the thatched lanes of the Celtic town lay in ashes and one of the mills had been burned with sixty soldiers who defended it ninety five Still however the Irish defended the bridge resolutely During several days there was sharp fighting hand to hand in the strait passage The assailants gained ground but gained it inch by inch The courage of the garrison was sustained by the hope of speedy succour Saint Ruth had at length completed his preparations and the tidings that Athlone was in danger had induced him to take the field in haste at the head of an army superior in number though inferior in more important elements of military strength to the army of Ginkell The French general seems to have thought that the bridge and the ford might easily be defended till the autumnal rains and the pestilence which ordinarily accompanied them should compel the enemy to retire He therefore contented himself with sending successive detachments to reinforce the garrison The immediate conduct of the defence he entrusted to his second in command D Usson and fixed his own head quarters two or three miles from the town He expressed his astonishment that so experienced a commander as Ginkell should persist in a hopeless enterprise His master ought to hang him for trying to take Athlone and mine ought to hang me if I lose it ninety six Saint Ruth however was by no means at ease He had found to his great mortification that he had not the full authority which the promises made to him at Saint Germains had entitled him to expect The Lord Lieutenant was in the camp His bodily and mental infirmities had perceptibly increased within the last few weeks The slow and uncertain step with which he who had once been renowned for vigour and agility now tottered from his easy chair to his couch was no unapt type of the sluggish and wavering movement of that mind which had once pursued its objects with a vehemence restrained neither by fear nor by pity neither by conscience nor by shame Yet with impaired strength both physical and intellectual the broken old man clung pertinaciously to power If he had received private orders not to meddle with the conduct of the war he disregarded them He assumed all the authority of a sovereign showed himself ostentatiously to the troops as their supreme chief and affected to treat Saint Ruth as a lieutenant Soon the interference of the Viceroy excited the vehement indignation of that powerful party in the army which had long hated him Many officers signed an instrument by which they declared that they did not consider him as entitled to their obedience in the field Some of them offered him gross personal insults He was told to his face that if he persisted in remaining where he was not wanted the ropes of his pavilion should be cut He on the other hand sent his emissaries to all the camp fires and tried to make a party among the common soldiers against the French general ninety seven The only thing in which Tyrconnel and Saint Ruth agreed was in dreading and disliking Sarsfield Not only was he popular with the great body of his countrymen he was also surrounded by a knot of retainers whose devotion to him resembled the devotion of the Ismailite murderers to the Old Man of the Mountain It was known that one of these fanatics a colonel had used language which in the mouth of an officer so high in rank might well cause uneasiness The King this man had said is nothing to me I obey Sarsfield Let Sarsfield tell me to kill any man in the whole army and I will do it Sarsfield was indeed too honourable a gentleman to abuse his immense power over the minds of his worshippers But the Viceroy and the Commander in Chief might not unnaturally be disturbed by the thought that Sarsfield s honour was their only guarantee against mutiny and assassination The consequence was that at the crisis of the fate of Ireland the services of the first of Irish soldiers were not used or were used with jealous caution and that if he ventured to offer a suggestion it was received with a sneer or a frown ninety eight A great and unexpected disaster put an end to these disputes On the thirtieth of June Ginkell called a council of war Forage began to be scarce and it was absolutely necessary that the besiegers should either force their way across the river or retreat The difficulty of effecting a passage over the shattered remains of the bridge seemed almost insuperable It was proposed to try the ford The Duke of Wirtemberg Talmash and Ruvigny gave their voices in favour of this plan and Ginkell with some misgivings consented ninety nine It was determined that the attempt should be made that very afternoon The Irish fancying that the English were about to retreat kept guard carelessly Part of the garrison was idling part dosing D Usson was at table Saint Ruth was in his tent writing a letter to his master filled with charges against Tyrconnel Meanwhile fifteen hundred grenadiers each wearing in his hat a green bough were mustered on the Leinster bank of the Shannon Many of them doubtless remembered that on that day year they had at the command of King William put green boughs in their hats on the banks of the Boyne Guineas had been liberally scattered among these picked men but their alacrity was such as gold cannot purchase Six battalions were in readiness to support the attack Mackay commanded He did not approve of the plan but he executed it as zealously and energetically as if he had himself been the author of it The Duke of Wirtemberg Talmash and several other gallant officers to whom no part in the enterprise had been assigned insisted on serving that day as private volunteers and their appearance in the ranks excited the fiercest enthusiasm among the soldiers It was six o clock A peal from the steeple of the church gave the signal Prince George of Hesse Darmstadt and Gustavus Hamilton the brave chief of the Enniskilleners descended first into the Shannon Then the grenadiers lifted the Duke of Wirtemberg on their shoulders and with a great shout plunged twenty abreast up to their cravats in water The stream ran deep and strong but in a few minutes the head of the column reached dry land Talmash was the fifth man that set foot on the Connaught shore The Irish taken unprepared fired one confused volley and fled leaving their commander Maxwell a prisoner The conquerors clambered up the bank over the remains of walls shattered by a cannonade of ten days Mackay heard his men cursing and swearing as they stumbled among the rubbish My lads cried the stout old Puritan in the midst of the uproar you are brave fellows but do not swear We have more reason to thank God for the goodness which He has shown us this day than to take His name in vain The victory was complete Planks were placed on the broken arches of the bridge and pontoons laid on the river without any opposition on the part of the terrified garrison With the loss of twelve men killed and about thirty wounded the English had in a few minutes forced their way into Connaught one hundred At the first alarm D Usson hastened towards the river but he was met swept away trampled down and almost killed by the torrent of fugitives He was carried to the camp in such a state that it was necessary to bleed him Taken cried Saint Ruth in dismay It cannot be A town taken and I close by with an army to relieve it Cruelly mortified he struck his tents under cover of the night and retreated in the direction of Galway At dawn the English saw far off from the top of King John s ruined castle the Irish army moving through the dreary region which separates the Shannon from the Suck Before noon the rearguard had disappeared one hundred one Even before the loss of Athlone the Celtic camp had been distracted by factions It may easily be supposed therefore that after so great a disaster nothing was to be heard but crimination and recrimination The enemies of the Lord Lieutenant were more clamorous than ever He and his creatures had brought the kingdom to the verge of perdition He would meddle with what he did not understand He would overrule the plans of men who were real soldiers He would entrust the most important of all posts to his tool his spy the wretched Maxwell not a born Irishman not a sincere Catholic at best a blunderer and too probably a traitor Maxwell it was affirmed had left his men unprovided with ammunition When they had applied to him for powder and ball he had asked whether they wanted to shoot larks Just before the attack he had told them to go to their supper and to take their rest for that nothing more would be done that day When he had delivered himself up a prisoner he had uttered some words which seemed to indicate a previous understanding with the conquerors The Lord Lieutenant s few friends told a very different story According to them Tyrconnel and Maxwell had suggested precautions which would have made a surprise impossible The French General impatient of all interference had omitted to take those precautions Maxwell had been rudely told that if he was afraid he had better resign his command He had done his duty bravely He had stood while his men fled He had consequently fallen into the hands of the enemy and he was now in his absence slandered by those to whom his captivity was justly imputable one hundred two On which side the truth lay it is not easy at this distance of time to pronounce The cry against Tyrconnel was at the moment so loud that he gave way and sullenly retired to Limerick D Usson who had not yet recovered from the hurts inflicted by his own runaway troops repaired to Galway one hundred three Saint Ruth now left in undisputed possession of the supreme command was bent on trying the chances of a battle Most of the Irish officers with Sarsfield at their head were of a very different mind It was they said not to be dissembled that in discipline the army of Ginkell was far superior to theirs The wise course therefore evidently was to carry on the war in such a manner that the difference between the disciplined and the undisciplined soldier might be as small as possible It was well known that raw recruits often played their part well in a foray in a street fight or in the defence of a rampart but that on a pitched field they had little chance against veterans Let most of our foot be collected behind the walls of Limerick and Galway Let the rest together with our horse get in the rear of the enemy and cut off his supplies If he advances into Connaught let us overrun Leinster If he sits down before Galway which may well be defended let us make a push for Dublin which is altogether defenceless one hundred four Saint Ruth might perhaps have thought this advice good if his judgment had not been biassed by his passions But he was smarting from the pain of a humiliating defeat In sight of his tent the English had passed a rapid river and had stormed a strong town He could not but feel that though others might have been to blame he was not himself blameless He had to say the least taken things too easily Lewis accustomed to be served during many years by commanders who were not in the habit of leaving to chance any thing which could be made secure by wisdom would hardly think it a sufficient excuse that his general had not expected the enemy to make so bold and sudden an attack The Lord Lieutenant would of course represent what had passed in the most unfavourable manner and whatever the Lord Lieutenant said James would echo A sharp reprimand a letter of recall might be expected To return to Versailles a culprit to approach the great King in an agony of distress to see him shrug his shoulders knit his brow and turn his back to be sent far from courts and camps to languish at some dull country seat this was too much to be borne and yet this might well be apprehended There was one escape to fight and to conquer or to perish In such a temper Saint Ruth pitched his camp about thirty miles from Athlone on the road to Galway near the ruined castle of Aghrim and determined to await the approach of the English army His whole deportment was changed He had hitherto treated the Irish soldiers with contemptuous severity But now that he had resolved to stake life and fame on the valour of the despised race he became another man During the few days which remained to him he exerted himself to win by indulgence and caresses the hearts of all who were under his command one hundred five He at the same time administered to his troops moral stimulants of the most potent kind He was a zealous Roman Catholic and it is probable that the severity with which he had treated the Protestants of his own country ought to be partly ascribed to the hatred which he felt for their doctrines He now tried to give to the war the character of a crusade The clergy were the agents whom he employed to sustain the courage of his soldiers The whole camp was in a ferment with religious excitement In every regiment priests were praying preaching shriving holding up the host and the cup While the soldiers swore on the sacramental bread not to abandon their colours the General addressed to the officers an appeal which might have moved the most languid and effeminate natures to heroic exertion They were fighting he said for their religion their liberty and their honour Unhappy events too widely celebrated had brought a reproach on the national character Irish soldiership was every where mentioned with a sneer If they wished to retrieve the fame of their country this was the time and this the place one hundred six The spot on which he had determined to bring the fate of Ireland to issue seems to have been chosen with great judgment His army was drawn up on the slope of a hill which was almost surrounded by red bog In front near the edge of the morass were some fences out of which a breastwork was without difficulty constructed On the eleventh of July Ginkell having repaired the fortifications of Athlone and left a garrison there fixed his headquarters at Ballinasloe about four miles from Aghrim and rode forward to take a view of the Irish position On his return he gave orders that ammunition should be served out that every musket and bayonet should be got ready for action and that early on the morrow every man should be under arms without beat of drum Two regiments were to remain in charge of the camp the rest unincumbered by baggage were to march against the enemy Soon after six the next morning the English were on the way to Aghrim But some delay was occasioned by a thick fog which hung till noon over the moist valley of the Suck a further delay was caused by the necessity of dislodging the Irish from some outposts and the afternoon was far advanced when the two armies at length confronted each other with nothing but the bog and the breastwork between them The English and their allies were under twenty thousand the Irish above twenty five thousand Ginkell held a short consultation with his principal officers Should he attack instantly or wait till the next morning Mackay was for attacking instantly and his opinion prevailed At five the battle began The English foot in such order as they could keep on treacherous and uneven ground made their way sinking deep in mud at every step to the Irish works But those works were defended with a resolution such as extorted some words of ungracious eulogy even from men who entertained the strongest prejudices against the Celtic race one hundred seven Again and again the assailants were driven back Again and again they returned to the struggle Once they were broken and chased across the morass but Talmash rallied them and forced the pursuers to retire The fight had lasted two hours the evening was closing in and still the advantage was on the side of the Irish Ginkell began to meditate a retreat The hopes of Saint Ruth rose high The day is ours my boys he cried waving his hat in the air We will drive them before us to the walls of Dublin But fortune was already on the turn Mackay and Ruvigny with the English and Huguenot cavalry had succeeded in passing the bog at a place where two horsemen could scarcely ride abreast Saint Ruth at first laughed when he saw the Blues in single file struggling through the morass under a fire which every moment laid some gallant hat and feather on the earth What do they mean he asked and then he swore that it was pity to see such fine fellows rushing to certain destruction Let them cross however he said The more they are the more we shall kill But soon he saw them laying hurdles on the quagmire A broader and safer path was formed squadron after squadron reached firm ground the flank of the Irish army was speedily turned The French general was hastening to the rescue when a cannon ball carried off his head Those who were about him thought that it would be dangerous to make his fate known His corpse was wrapped in a cloak carried from the field and laid with all secresy in the sacred ground among the ruins of the ancient monastery of Loughrea Till the fight was over neither army was aware that he was no more To conceal his death from the private soldiers might perhaps have been prudent To conceal it from his lieutenants was madness The crisis of the battle had arrived and there was none to give direction Sarsfield was in command of the reserve But he had been strictly enjoined by Saint Ruth not to stir without orders and no orders came Mackay and Ruvigny with their horse charged the Irish in flank Talmash and his foot returned to the attack in front with dogged determination The breastwork was carried The Irish still fighting retreated from inclosure to inclosure But as inclosure after inclosure was forced their efforts became fainter and fainter At length they broke and fled Then followed a horrible carnage The conquerors were in a savage mood For a report had been spread among them that during the early part of the battle some English captives who had been admitted to quarter had been put to the sword Only four hundred prisoners were taken The number of the slain was in proportion to the number engaged greater than in any other battle of that age But for the coming on of a moonless night made darker by a misty rain scarcely a man would have escaped The obscurity enabled Sarsfield with a few squadrons which still remained unbroken to cover the retreat Of the conquerors six hundred were killed and about a thousand wounded The English slept that night on the field of battle On the following day they buried their companions in arms and then marched westward The vanquished were left unburied a strange and ghastly spectacle Four thousand Irish corpses were counted on the field of battle A hundred and fifty lay in one small inclosure a hundred and twenty in another But the slaughter had not been confined to the field of battle One who was there tells us that from the top of the hill on which the Celtic camp had been pitched he saw the country to the distance of near four miles white with the naked bodies of the slain The plain looked he said like an immense pasture covered by flocks of sheep As usual different estimates were formed even by eyewitnesses But it seems probable that the number of the Irish who fell was not less than seven thousand Soon a multitude of dogs came to feast on the carnage These beasts became so fierce and acquired such a taste for human flesh that it was long dangerous for men to travel this road otherwise than in companies one hundred eight The beaten army had now lost all the appearance of an army and resembled a rabble crowding home from a fair after a faction fight One great stream of fugitives ran towards Galway another towards Limerick The roads to both cities were covered with weapons which had been flung away Ginkell offered sixpence for every musket In a short time so many waggon loads were collected that he reduced the price to twopence and still great numbers of muskets came in one hundred nine The conquerors marched first against Galway D Usson was there and had under him seven regiments thinned by the slaughter of Aghrim and utterly disorganized and disheartened The last hope of the garrison and of the Roman Catholic inhabitants was that Baldearg O Donnel the promised deliverer of their race would come to the rescue But Baldearg O Donnel was not duped by the superstitious veneration of which he was the object While there remained any doubt about the issue of the conflict between the Englishry and the Irishry he had stood aloof On the day of the battle he had remained at a safe distance with his tumultuary army and as soon as he had learned that his countrymen had been put to rout he fled plundering and burning all the way to the mountains of Mayo Thence he sent to Ginkell offers of submission and service Ginkell gladly seized the opportunity of breaking up a formidable band of marauders and of turning to good account the influence which the name of a Celtic dynasty still exercised over the Celtic race The negotiation however was not without difficulties The wandering adventurer at first demanded nothing less than an earldom After some haggling he consented to sell the love of a whole people and his pretensions to regal dignity for a pension of five hundred pounds a year Yet the spell which bound his followers to hire was not altogether broken Some enthusiasts from Ulster were willing to fight under the O Donnel against their own language and their own religion With a small body of these devoted adherents he joined a division of the English army and on several occasions did useful service to William one hundred ten When it was known that no succour was to be expected from the hero whose advent had been foretold by so many seers the Irish who were shut up in Galway lost all heart D Usson had returned a stout answer to the first summons of the besiegers but he soon saw that resistance was impossible and made haste to capitulate The garrison was suffered to retire to Limerick with the honours of war A full amnesty for past offences was granted to the citizens and it was stipulated that within the walls the Roman Catholic priests should be allowed to perform in private the rites of their religion On these terms the gates were thrown open Ginkell was received with profound respect by the Mayor and Aldermen and was complimented in a set speech by the Recorder D Usson with about two thousand three hundred men marched unmolested to Limerick one hundred eleven At Limerick the last asylum of the vanquished race the authority of Tyrconnel was supreme There was now no general who could pretend that his commission made him independent of the Lord Lieutenant nor was the Lord Lieutenant now so unpopular as he had been a fortnight earlier Since the battle there had been a reflux of public feeling No part of that great disaster could be imputed to the Viceroy His opinion indeed had been against trying the chances of a pitched field and he could with some plausibility assert that the neglect of his counsels had caused the ruin of Ireland one hundred twelve He made some preparations for defending Limerick repaired the fortifications and sent out parties to bring in provisions The country many miles round was swept bare by these detachments and a considerable quantity of cattle and fodder was collected within the walls There was also a large stock of biscuit imported from France The infantry assembled at Limerick were about fifteen thousand men The Irish horse and dragoons three or four thousand in number were encamped on the Clare side of the Shannon The communication between their camp and the city was maintained by means of a bridge called the Thomond Bridge which was protected by a fort These means of defence were not contemptible But the fall of Athlone and the slaughter of Aghrim had broken the spirit of the army A small party at the head of which were Sarsfield and a brave Scotch officer named Wauchop cherished a hope that the triumphant progress of Ginkell might be stopped by those walls from which William had in the preceding year been forced to retreat But many of the Irish chiefs loudly declared that it was time to think of capitulating Henry Luttrell always fond of dark and crooked politics opened a secret negotiation with the English One of his letters was intercepted and he was put under arrest but many who blamed his perfidy agreed with him in thinking that it was idle to prolong the contest Tyrconnel himself was convinced that all was lost His only hope was that he might be able to prolong the struggle till he could receive from Saint Germains permission to treat He wrote to request that permission and prevailed with some difficulty on his desponding countrymen to bind themselves by an oath not to capitulate till an answer from James should arrive one hundred thirteen A few days after the oath had been administered Tyrconnel was no more On the eleventh of August he dined with D Usson The party was gay The Lord Lieutenant seemed to have thrown off the load which had bowed down his body and mind he drank he jested he was again the Dick Talbot who had diced and revelled with Grammont Soon after he had risen from table an apoplectic stroke deprived him of speech and sensation On the fourteenth he breathed his last The wasted remains of that form which had once been a model for statuaries were laid under the pavement of the Cathedral but no inscription no tradition preserves the memory of the spot one hundred fourteen As soon as the Lord Lieutenant was no more Plowden who had superintended the Irish finances while there were any Irish finances to superintend produced a commission under the great seal of James This commission appointed Plowden himself Fitton and Nagle Lords justices in the event of Tyrconnel s death There was much murmuring when the names were made known For both Plowden and Fitton were Saxons The commission however proved to be a mere nullity For it was accompanied by instructions which forbade the Lords justices to interfere in the conduct of the war and within the narrow space to which the dominions of James were now reduced war was the only business The government was therefore really in the hands of D Usson and Sarsfield one hundred fifteen On the day on which Tyrconnel died the advanced guard of the English army came within sight of Limerick Ginkell encamped on the same ground which William had occupied twelve months before The batteries on which were planted guns and bombs very different from those which William had been forced to use played day and night and soon roofs were blazing and walls crashing in every corner of the city Whole streets were reduced to ashes Meanwhile several English ships of war came up the Shannon and anchored about a mile below the city one hundred sixteen Still the place held out the garrison was in numerical strength little inferior to the besieging army and it seemed not impossible that the defence might be prolonged till the equinoctial rains should a second time compel the English to retire Ginkell determined on striking a bold stroke No point in the whole circle of the fortifications was more important and no point seemed to be more secure than the Thomond Bridge which joined the city to the camp of the Irish horse on the Clare bank of the Shannon The Dutch General s plan was to separate the infantry within the ramparts from the cavalry without and this plan he executed with great skill vigour and success He laid a bridge of tin boats on the river crossed it with a strong body of troops drove before him in confusion fifteen hundred dragoons who made a faint show of resistance and marched towards the quarters of the Irish horse The Irish horse sustained but ill on this day the reputation which they had gained at the Boyne Indeed that reputation had been purchased by the almost entire destruction of the best regiments Recruits had been without much difficulty found But the loss of fifteen hundred excellent soldiers was not to be repaired The camp was abandoned without a blow Some of the cavalry fled into the city The rest driving before them as many cattle as could be collected in that moment of panic retired to the hills Much beef brandy and harness was found in the magazines and the marshy plain of the Shannon was covered with firelocks and grenades which the fugitives had thrown away one hundred seventeen The conquerors returned in triumph to their camp But Ginkell was not content with the advantage which he had gained He was bent on cutting off all communication between Limerick and the county of Clare In a few days therefore he again crossed the river at the head of several regiments and attacked the fort which protected the Thomond Bridge In a short time the fort was stormed The soldiers who had garrisoned it fled in confusion to the city The Town Major a French officer who commanded at the Thomond Gate afraid that the pursuers would enter with the fugitives ordered that part of the bridge which was nearest to the city to be drawn up Many of the Irish went headlong into the stream and perished there Others cried for quarter and held up handkerchiefs in token of submission But the conquerors were mad with rage their cruelty could not be immediately restrained and no prisoners were made till the heaps of corpses rose above the parapets The garrison of the fort had consisted of about eight hundred men Of these only a hundred and twenty escaped into Limerick one hundred eighteen This disaster seemed likely to produce a general mutiny in the besieged city The Irish clamoured for the blood of the Town Major who had ordered the bridge to be drawn up in the face of their flying countrymen His superiors were forced to promise that he should be brought before a court martial Happily for him he had received a mortal wound in the act of closing the Thomond Gate and was saved by a soldier s death from the fury of the multitude one hundred nineteen The cry for capitulation became so loud and importunate that the generals could not resist it D Usson informed his government that the fight at the bridge had so effectually cowed the spirit of the garrison that it was impossible to continue the struggle one hundred twenty Some exception may perhaps be taken to the evidence of D Usson for undoubtedly he like every Frenchman who had held any command in the Irish army was weary of his banishment and impatient to see Paris again But it is certain that even Sarsfield had lost heart Up to this time his voice had been for stubborn resistance He was now not only willing but impatient to treat one hundred twenty one It seemed to him that the city was doomed There was no hope of succour domestic or foreign In every part of Ireland the Saxons had set their feet on the necks of the natives Sligo had fallen Even those wild islands which intercept the huge waves of the Atlantic from the bay of Galway had acknowledged the authority of William The men of Kerry reputed the fiercest and most ungovernable part of the aboriginal population had held out long but had at length been routed and chased to their woods and mountains one hundred twenty two A French fleet if a French fleet were now to arrive on the coast of Munster would find the mouth of the Shannon guarded by English men of war The stock of provisions within Limerick was already running low If the siege were prolonged the town would in all human probability be reduced either by force or by blockade And if Ginkell should enter through the breach or should be implored by a multitude perishing with hunger to dictate his own terms what could be expected but a tyranny more inexorably severe than that of Cromwell Would it not then be wise to try what conditions could be obtained while the victors had still something to fear from the rage and despair of the vanquished while the last Irish army could still make some show of resistance behind the walls of the last Irish fortress On the evening of the day which followed the fight at the Thomond Gate the drums of Limerick beat a parley and Wauchop from one of the towers hailed the besiegers and requested Ruvigny to grant Sarsfield an interview The brave Frenchman who was an exile on account of his attachment to one religion and the brave Irishman who was about to become an exile on account of his attachment to another met and conferred doubtless with mutual sympathy and respect one hundred twenty three Ginkell to whom Ruvigny reported what had passed willingly consented to an armistice For constant as his success had been it had not made him secure The chances were greatly on his side Yet it was possible that an attempt to storm the city might fail as a similar attempt had failed twelve months before If the siege should be turned into a blockade it was probable that the pestilence which had been fatal to the army of Schomberg which had compelled William to retreat and which had all but prevailed even against the genius and energy of Marlborough might soon avenge the carnage of Aghrim The rains had lately been heavy The whole plain might shortly be an immense pool of stagnant water It might be necessary to move the troops to a healthier situation than the bank of the Shannon and to provide for them a warmer shelter than that of tents The enemy would be safe till the spring In the spring a French army might land in Ireland the natives might again rise in arms from Donegal to Kerry and the war which was now all but extinguished might blaze forth fiercer than ever A negotiation was therefore opened with a sincere desire on both sides to put an end to the contest The chiefs of the Irish army held several consultations at which some Roman Catholic prelates and some eminent lawyers were invited to assist A preliminary question which perplexed tender consciences was submitted by the Bishops The late Lord Lieutenant had persuaded the officers of the garrison to swear that they would not surrender Limerick till they should receive an answer to the letter in which their situation had been explained to James The Bishops thought that the oath was no longer binding It had been taken at a time when the communications with France were open and in the full belief that the answer of James would arrive within three weeks More than twice that time had elapsed Every avenue leading to the city was strictly guarded by the enemy His Majesty s faithful subjects by holding out till it had become impossible for him to signify his pleasure to them had acted up to the spirit of their promise one hundred twenty four The next question was what terms should be demanded A paper containing propositions which statesmen of our age will think reasonable but which to the most humane and liberal English Protestants of the seventeenth century appeared extravagant was sent to the camp of the besiegers What was asked was that all offences should be covered with oblivion that perfect freedom of worship should be allowed to the native population that every parish should have its priest and that Irish Roman Catholics should be capable of holding all offices civil and military and of enjoying all municipal privileges one hundred twenty five Ginkell knew little of the laws and feelings of the English but he had about him persons who were competent to direct him They had a week before prevented him from breaking a Rapparee on the wheel and they now suggested an answer to the propositions of the enemy I am a stranger here said Ginkell I am ignorant of the constitution of these kingdoms but I am assured that what you ask is inconsistent with that constitution and therefore I cannot with honour consent He immediately ordered a new battery to be thrown up and guns and mortars to be planted on it But his preparations were speedily interrupted by another message from the city The Irish begged that since he could not grant what they had demanded he would tell them what he was willing to grant He called his advisers round him and after some consultation sent back a paper containing the heads of a treaty such as he had reason to believe that the government which he served would approve What he offered was indeed much less than what the Irish desired but was quite as much as when they considered their situation and the temper of the English nation they could expect They speedily notified their assent It was agreed that there should be a cessation of arms not only by land but in the ports and bays of Munster and that a fleet of French transports should be suffered to come up the Shannon in peace and to depart in peace The signing of the treaty was deferred till the Lords justices who represented William at Dublin should arrive at Ginkell s quarters But there was during some days a relaxation of military vigilance on both sides Prisoners were set at liberty The outposts of the two armies chatted and messed together The English officers rambled into the town The Irish officers dined in the camp Anecdotes of what passed at the friendly meetings of these men who had so lately been mortal enemies were widely circulated One story in particular was repeated in every part of Europe Has not this last campaign said Sarsfield to some English officers raised your opinion of Irish soldiers To tell you the truth answered an Englishman we think of them much as we always did However meanly you may think of us replied Sarsfield change Kings with us and we will willingly try our luck with you again He was doubtless thinking of the day on which he had seen the two Sovereigns at the head of two great armies William foremost in the charge and James foremost in the flight one hundred twenty six On the first of October Coningsby and Porter arrived at the English headquarters On the second the articles of capitulation were discussed at great length and definitely settled On the third they were signed They were divided into two parts a military treaty and a civil treaty The former was subscribed only by the generals on both sides The Lords justices set their names to the latter one hundred twenty seven By the military treaty it was agreed that such Irish officers and soldiers as should declare that they wished to go to France should be conveyed thither and should in the meantime remain under the command of their own generals Ginkell undertook to furnish a considerable number of transports French vessels were also to be permitted to pass and repass freely between Britanny and Munster Part of Limerick was to be immediately delivered up to the English But the island on which the Cathedral and the Castle stand was to remain for the present in the keeping of the Irish The terms of the civil treaty were very different from those which Ginkell had sternly refused to grant It was not stipulated that the Roman Catholics of Ireland should be competent to hold any political or military office or that they should be admitted into any corporation But they obtained a promise that they should enjoy such privileges in the exercise of their religion as were consistent with the law or as they had enjoyed in the reign of Charles the Second To all inhabitants of Limerick and to all officers and soldiers in the Jacobite army who should submit to the government and notify their submission by taking the oath of allegiance an entire amnesty was promised They were to retain their property they were to be allowed to exercise any profession which they had exercised before the troubles they were not to be punished for any treason felony or misdemeanour committed since the accession of the late King nay they were not to be sued for damages on account of any act of spoliation or outrage which they might have committed during the three years of confusion This was more than the Lords justices were constitutionally competent to grant It was therefore added that the government would use its utmost endeavours to obtain a Parliamentary ratification of the treaty one hundred twenty eight As soon as the two instruments had been signed the English entered the city and occupied one quarter of it A narrow but deep branch of the Shannon separated them from the quarter which was still in the possession of the Irish one hundred twenty nine In a few hours a dispute arose which seemed likely to produce a renewal of hostilities Sarsfield had resolved to seek his fortune in the service of France and was naturally desirous to carry with him to the Continent such a body of troops as would be an important addition to the army of Lewis Ginkell was as naturally unwilling to send thousands of men to swell the forces of the enemy Both generals appealed to the treaty Each construed it as suited his purpose and each complained that the other had violated it Sarsfield was accused of putting one of his officers under arrest for refusing to go to the Continent Ginkell greatly excited declared that he would teach the Irish to play tricks with him and began to make preparations for a cannonade Sarsfield came to the English camp and tried to justify what he had done The altercation was sharp I submit said Sarsfield at last I am in your power Not at all in my power said Ginkell go back and do your worst The imprisoned officer was liberated a sanguinary contest was averted and the two commanders contented themselves with a war of words one hundred thirty Ginkell put forth proclamations assuring the Irish that if they would live quietly in their own land they should be protected and favoured and that if they preferred a military life they should be admitted into the service of King William It was added that no man who chose to reject this gracious invitation and to become a soldier of Lewis must expect ever again to set foot on the island Sarsfield and Wauchop exerted their eloquence on the other side The present aspect of affairs they said was doubtless gloomy but there was bright sky beyond the cloud The banishment would be short The return would be triumphant Within a year the French would invade England In such an invasion the Irish troops if only they remained unbroken would assuredly bear a chief part In the meantime it was far better for them to live in a neighbouring and friendly country under the parental care of their own rightful King than to trust the Prince of Orange who would probably send them to the other end of the world to fight for his ally the Emperor against the Janissaries The help of the Roman Catholic clergy was called in On the day on which those who had made up their minds to go to France were required to announce their determination the priests were indefatigable in exhorting At the head of every regiment a sermon was preached on the duty of adhering to the cause of the Church and on the sin and danger of consorting with unbelievers one hundred thirty one Whoever it was said should enter the service of the usurpers would do so at the peril of his soul The heretics affirmed that after the peroration a plentiful allowance of brandy was served out to the audience and that when the brandy had been swallowed a Bishop pronounced a benediction Thus duly prepared by physical and moral stimulants the garrison consisting of about fourteen thousand infantry was drawn up in the vast meadow which lay on the Clare bank of the Shannon Here copies of Ginkell s proclamation were profusely scattered about and English officers went through the ranks imploring the men not to ruin themselves and explaining to them the advantages which the soldiers of King William enjoyed At length the decisive moment came The troops were ordered to pass in review Those who wished to remain in Ireland were directed to file off at a particular spot All who passed that spot were to be considered as having made their choice for France Sarsfield and Wauchop on one side Porter Coningsby and Ginkell on the other looked on with painful anxiety D Usson and his countrymen though not uninterested in the spectacle found it hard to preserve their gravity The confusion the clamour the grotesque appearance of an army in which there could scarcely be seen a shirt or a pair of pantaloons a shoe or a stocking presented so ludicrous a contrast to the orderly and brilliant appearance of their master s troops that they amused themselves by wondering what the Parisians would say to see such a force mustered on the plain of Grenelle one hundred thirty two First marched what was called the Royal regiment fourteen hundred strong All but seven went beyond the fatal point Ginkell s countenance showed that he was deeply mortified He was consoled however by seeing the next regiment which consisted of natives of Ulster turn off to a man There had arisen notwithstanding the community of blood language and religion an antipathy between the Celts of Ulster and those of the other three provinces nor is it improbable that the example and influence of Baldearg O Donnel may have had some effect on the

those who turned off He was rewarded for his desertion and perhaps for other services with a grant of the large estate of his elder brother Simon who firmly adhered to the cause of James with a pension of five hundred pounds a year from the Crown and with the abhorrence of the Roman Catholic population After living in wealth luxury and infamy during a quarter of a century Henry Luttrell was murdered while going through Dublin in his sedan chair and the Irish House of Commons declared that there was reason to suspect that he had fallen by the revenge of the Papists one hundred thirty four Eighty years after his death his grave near Luttrellstown was violated by the descendants of those whom he had betrayed and his skull was broken to pieces with a pickaxe one hundred thirty five The deadly hatred of which he was the object descended to his son and to his grandson and unhappily nothing in the character either of his son or of his grandson tended to mitigate the feeling which the name of Luttrell excited one hundred thirty six When the long procession had closed it was found that about a thousand men had agreed to enter into William s service About two thousand accepted passes from Ginkell and went quietly home About eleven thousand returned with Sarsfield to the city A few hours after the garrison had passed in review the horse who were encamped some miles from the town were required to make their choice and most of them volunteered for France one hundred thirty seven Sarsfield considered the troops who remained with him as under an irrevocable obligation to go abroad and lest they should be tempted to retract their consent he confined them within the ramparts and ordered the gates to be shut and strongly guarded Ginkell though in his vexation he muttered some threats seems to have felt that he could not justifiably interfere But the precautions of the Irish general were far from being completely successful It was by no means strange that a superstitious and excitable kerne with a sermon and a dram in his head should be ready to promise whatever his priests required neither was it strange that when he had slept off his liquor and when anathemas were no longer ringing in his ears he should feel painful misgivings He had bound himself to go into exile perhaps for life beyond that dreary expanse of waters which impressed his rude mind with mysterious terror

Netherlands one hundred forty four Three days later he opened the Parliament The aspect of affairs was on the whole cheering By land there had been gains and losses but the balance was in favour of England Against the fall of Mons might well be set off the taking of Athlone the victory of Aghrim the surrender of Limerick and the pacification of Ireland At sea there had been no great victory but there had been a great display of power and of activity and though many were dissatisfied because more had not been done none could deny that there had been a change for the better The ruin caused by the foibles and vices of Torrington had been repaired the fleet had been well equipped the rations had been abundant and wholesome and the health of the crews had consequently been for that age wonderfully good Russell who commanded the naval forces of the allies had in vain offered battle to the French The white flag which in the preceding year had ranged the Channel unresisted from the Land s End to the Straits of Dover now as soon as our topmasts were descried twenty leagues off abandoned the open sea and retired into the depths of the harbour of Brest The appearance of an English squadron in the estuary of the Shannon had decided the fate of the last fortress which had held out for King James and a fleet of merchantmen from the Levant valued at four millions sterling had through dangers which had caused many sleepless nights to the underwriters of Lombard Street been convoyed safe into the Thames one hundred forty five The Lords and Commons listened with signs of satisfaction to a speech in which the King congratulated them on the event of the war in Ireland and expressed his confidence that they would continue to support him in the war with France He told them that a great naval armament would be necessary and that in his opinion the conflict by land could not be effectually maintained with less than sixty five thousand men one hundred forty six He was thanked in affectionate terms the force which he asked was voted and large supplies were granted with little difficulty But when the Ways and Means were taken into consideration symptoms of discontent began to appear Eighteen months before when the Commons had been employed in settling the Civil List many members had shown a very natural disposition to complain of the amount of the salaries and fees received by official men Keen speeches had been made and what was much less usual had been printed there had been much excitement out of doors but nothing had been done The subject was now revived A report made by the Commissioners who had been appointed in the preceding year to examine the public accounts disclosed some facts which excited indignation and others which raised grave suspicion The House seemed fully determined to make an extensive reform and in truth nothing could have averted such a reform except the folly and violence of the reformers That they should have been angry is indeed not strange The enormous gains direct and indirect of the servants of the public went on increasing while the gains of every body else were diminishing Rents were falling trade was languishing every man who lived either on what his ancestors had left him or on the fruits of his own industry was forced to retrench The placeman alone throve amidst the general distress Look cried the incensed squires at the Comptroller of the Customs Ten years ago he walked and we rode Our incomes have been curtailed his salary has been doubled we have sold our horses he has bought them and now we go on foot and are splashed by his coach and six Lowther vainly endeavoured to stand up against the storm He was heard with little favour by the country gentlemen who had not long before looked up to him as one of their leaders He had left them he had become a courtier he had two good places one in the Treasury the other in the household He had recently received from the King s own hand a gratuity of two thousand guineas one hundred forty seven It seemed perfectly natural that he should defend abuses by which he profited The taunts and reproaches with which he was assailed were insupportable to his sensitive nature He lost his head almost fainted away on the floor of the House and talked about righting himself in another place one hundred forty eight Unfortunately no member rose at this conjuncture to propose that the civil establishment of the kingdom should be carefully revised that sinecures should be abolished that exorbitant official incomes should be reduced and that no servant of the State should be allowed to exact under any pretence any thing beyond his known and lawful remuneration In this way it would have been possible to diminish the public burdens and at the same time to increase the efficiency of every public department But unfortunately those who were loudest in clamouring against the prevailing abuses were utterly destitute of the qualities necessary for the work of reform On the twelfth of December some foolish man whose name has not come down to us moved that no person employed in any civil office the Speaker Judges and Ambassadors excepted should receive more than five hundred pounds a year and this motion was not only carried but carried without one dissentient voice one hundred forty nine Those who were most interested in opposing it doubtless saw that opposition would at that moment only irritate the majority and reserved themselves for a more favourable time The more favourable time soon came No man of common sense could when his blood had cooled remember without shame that he had voted for a resolution which made no distinction between sinecurists and laborious public servants between clerks employed in copying letters and ministers on whose wisdom and integrity the fate of the nation might depend The salary of the Doorkeeper of the Excise Office had been by a scandalous job raised to five hundred a year It ought to have been reduced to fifty On the other hand the services of a Secretary of State who was well qualified for his post would have been cheap at five thousand If the resolution of the Commons bad been carried into effect both the salary which ought not to have exceeded fifty pounds and the salary which might without impropriety have amounted to five thousand would have been fixed at five hundred Such absurdity must have shocked even the roughest and plainest foxhunter in the House A reaction took place and when after an interval of a few weeks it was proposed to insert in a bill of supply a clause in conformity with the resolution of the twelfth of December the Noes were loud the Speaker was of opinion that they had it the Ayes did not venture to dispute his opinion the senseless plan which had been approved without a division was rejected without a division and the subject was not again mentioned Thus a grievance so scandalous that none of those who profited by it dared to defend it was perpetuated merely by the imbecility and intemperance of those who attacked it one hundred fifty Early in the Session the Treaty of Limerick became the subject of a grave and earnest discussion The Commons in the exercise of that supreme power which the English legislature possessed over all the dependencies of England sent up to the Lords a bill providing that no person should sit in the Irish Parliament should hold any Irish office civil military or ecclesiastical or should practise law or medicine in Ireland till he had taken the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and subscribed the Declaration against Transubstantiation The Lords were not more inclined than the Commons to favour the Irish No peer was disposed to entrust Roman Catholics with political power Nay it seems that no peer objected to the principle of the absurd and cruel rule which excluded Roman Catholics from the liberal professions But it was thought that this rule though unobjectionable in principle would if adopted without some exceptions be a breach of a positive compact Their Lordships called for the Treaty of Limerick ordered it to be read at the table and proceeded to consider whether the law framed by the Lower House was consistent with the engagements into which the government had entered One discrepancy was noticed It was stipulated by the second civil article that every person actually residing in any fortress occupied by an Irish garrison should be permitted on taking the Oath of Allegiance to resume any calling which he had exercised before the Revolution It would beyond all doubt have been a violation of this covenant to require that a lawyer or a physician who had been within the walls of Limerick during the siege should take the Oath of Supremacy and subscribe the Declaration against Transubstantiation before he could receive fees Holt was consulted and was directed to prepare clauses in conformity with the terms of the capitulation The bill as amended by Holt was sent back to the Commons They at first rejected the amendment and demanded a conference The conference was granted Rochester in the Painted Chamber delivered to the managers of the Lower House a copy of the Treaty of Limerick and earnestly represented the importance of preserving the public faith inviolate This appeal was one which no honest man though inflamed by national and religious animosity could resist The Commons reconsidered the subject and after hearing the Treaty read agreed with some slight modifications to what the Lords had proposed one hundred fifty one The bill became a law It attracted at the time little notice but was after the lapse of several generations the subject of a very acrimonious controversy Many of us can well remember how strongly the public mind was stirred in the days of George the Third and George the Fourth by the question whether Roman Catholics should be permitted to sit in Parliament It may be doubted whether any dispute has produced stranger perversions of history The whole past was falsified for the sake of the present All the great events of three centuries long appeared to us distorted and discoloured by a mist sprung from our own theories and our own passions Some friends of religious liberty not content with the advantage which they possessed in the fair conflict of reason with reason weakened their case by maintaining that the law which excluded Irish Roman Catholics from Parliament was inconsistent with the civil Treaty of Limerick The First article of that Treaty it was said guaranteed to the Irish Roman Catholic such privileges in the exercise of his religion as he had enjoyed in the time of Charles the Second In the time of Charles the Second no test excluded Roman Catholics from the Irish Parliament Such a test could not therefore it was argued be imposed without a breach of public faith In the year eighteen twenty eight especially this argument was put forward in the House of Commons as if it had been the main strength of a cause which stood in need of no such support The champions of Protestant ascendency were well pleased to see the debate diverted from a political question about which they were in the wrong to a historical question about which they were in the right They had no difficulty in proving that the first article as understood by all the contracting parties meant only that the Roman Catholic worship should be tolerated as in time past That article was drawn up by Ginkell and just before he drew it up he had declared that he would rather try the chance of arms than consent that Irish Papists should be capable of holding civil and military offices of exercising liberal professions and of becoming members of municipal corporations How is it possible to believe that he would of his own accord have promised that the House of Lords and the House of Commons should be open to men to whom he would not open a guild of skinners or a guild of cordwainers How again is it possible to believe that the English Peers would while professing the most punctilious respect for public faith while lecturing the Commons on the duty of observing public faith while taking counsel with the most learned and upright jurist of the age as to the best mode of maintaining public faith have committed a flagrant violation of public faith and that not a single lord should have been so honest or so factious as to protest against an act of monstrous perfidy aggravated by hypocrisy Or if we could believe this how can we believe that no voice would have been raised in any part of the world against such wickedness that the Court of Saint Germains and the Court of Versailles would have remained profoundly silent that no Irish exile no English malecontent would have uttered a murmur that not a word of invective or sarcasm on so inviting a subject would have been found in the whole compass of the Jacobite literature and that it would have been reserved for politicians of the nineteenth century to discover that a treaty made in the seventeenth century had a few weeks after it had been signed been outrageously violated in the sight of all Europe one hundred fifty two On the same day on which the Commons read for the first time the bill which subjected Ireland to the absolute dominion of the Protestant minority they took into consideration another matter of high importance Throughout the country but especially in the capital in the seaports and in the manufacturing towns the minds of men were greatly excited on the subject of the trade with the East Indies a fierce paper war had during some time been raging and several grave questions both constitutional and commercial had been raised which the legislature only could decide It has often been repeated and ought never to be forgotten that our polity differs widely from those politics which have during the last eighty years been methodically constructed digested into articles and ratified by constituent assemblies It grew up in a rude age It is not to be found entire in any formal instrument All along the line which separates the functions of the prince from those of the legislator there was long a disputed territory Encroachments were perpetually committed and if not very outrageous were often tolerated Trespass merely as trespass was commonly suffered to pass unresented It was only when the trespass produced some positive damage that the aggrieved party stood on his right and demanded that the frontier should be set out by metes and bounds and that the landmarks should thenceforward be punctiliously respected Many of those points which had occasioned the most violent disputes between our Sovereigns and their Parliaments had been finally decided by the Bill of Rights But one question scarcely less important than any of the questions which had been set at rest for ever was still undetermined Indeed that question was never as far as can now be ascertained even mentioned in the Convention The King had undoubtedly by the ancient laws of the realm large powers for the regulation of trade but the ablest judge would have found it difficult to say what was the precise extent of those powers It was universally acknowledged that it belonged to the King to prescribe weights and measures and to coin money that no fair or market could be held without authority from him that no ship could unload in any bay or estuary which he had not declared to be a port In addition to his undoubted right to grant special commercial privileges to particular places he long claimed a right to grant special commercial privileges to particular societies and to particular individuals and our ancestors as usual did not think it worth their while to dispute this claim till it produced serious inconvenience At length in the reign of Elizabeth the power of creating monopolies began to be grossly abused and as soon as it began to be grossly abused it began to be questioned The Queen wisely declined a conflict with a House of Commons backed by the whole nation She frankly acknowledged that there was reason for complaint she cancelled the patents which had excited the public clamours and her people delighted by this concession and by the gracious manner in which it had been made did not require from her an express renunciation of the disputed prerogative The discontents which her wisdom had appeased were revived by the dishonest and pusillanimous policy which her successor called Kingcraft He readily granted oppressive patents of monopoly When he needed the help of his Parliament he as readily annulled them As soon as the Parliament had ceased to sit his Great Seal was put to instruments more odious than those which he had recently cancelled At length that excellent House of Commons which met in sixteen twenty three determined to apply a strong remedy to the evil The King was forced to give his assent to a law which declared monopolies established by royal authority to be null and void Some exceptions however were made and unfortunately were not very clearly defined It was especially provided that every Society of Merchants which had been instituted for the purpose of carrying on any trade should retain all its legal privileges one hundred fifty three The question whether a monopoly granted by the Crown to such a company were or were not a legal privilege was left unsettled and continued to exercise during many years the ingenuity of lawyers one hundred fifty four The nation however relieved at once from a multitude of impositions and vexations which were painfully felt every day at every fireside was in no humour to dispute the validity of the charters under which a few companies to London traded with distant parts of the world Of these companies by far the most important was that which had been on the last day of the sixteenth century incorporated by Queen Elizabeth under the name of the Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading to the East Indies When this celebrated body began to exist the Mogul monarchy was at the zenith of power and glory Akbar the ablest and best of the princes of the House of Tamerlane had just been borne full of years and honours to a mausoleum surpassing in magnificence any that Europe could show He had bequeathed to his posterity an empire containing more than twenty times the population and yielding more than twenty times the revenue of the England which under our great Queen held a foremost place among European powers It is curious and interesting to consider how little the two countries destined to be one day so closely connected were then known to each other The most enlightened Englishmen looked on India with ignorant admiration The most enlightened natives of India were scarcely aware that England existed Our ancestors had a dim notion of endless bazaars swarming with buyers and sellers and blazing with cloth of gold with variegated silks and with precious stones of treasuries where diamonds were piled in heaps and sequins in mountains of palaces compared with which Whitehall and Hampton Court were hovels of armies ten times as numerous as that which they had seen assembled at Tilbury to repel the Armada On the other hand it was probably not known to one of the statesmen in the Durbar of Agra that there was near the setting sun a great city of infidels called London where a woman reigned and that she had given to an association of Frank merchants the exclusive privilege of freighting ships from her dominions to the Indian seas That this association would one day rule all India from the ocean to the everlasting snow would reduce to profound obedience great provinces which had never submitted to Akbar s authority would send Lieutenant Governors to preside in his capital and would dole out a monthly pension to his heir would have seemed to the wisest of European or of Oriental politicians as impossible as that inhabitants of our globe should found an empire in Venus or Jupiter Three generations passed away and still nothing indicated that the East India Company would ever become a great Asiatic potentate The Mogul empire though undermined by internal causes of decay and tottering to its fall still presented to distant nations the appearance of undiminished prosperity and vigour Aurengzebe who in the same month in which Oliver Cromwell died assumed the magnificent title of Conqueror of the World continued to reign till Anne had been long on the English throne He was the sovereign of a larger territory than had obeyed any of his predecessors His name was great in the farthest regions of the West Here he had been made by Dryden the hero of a tragedy which would alone suffice to show how little the English of that age knew about the vast empire which their grandchildren were to conquer and to govern The poet s Mussulman princes make love in the style of Amadis preach about the death of Socrates and embellish their discourse with allusions to the mythological stories of Ovid The Brahminical metempyschosis is represented as an article of the Mussulman creed and the Mussulman Sultanas burn themselves with their husbands after the Brahminical fashion This drama once rapturously applauded by crowded theatres and known by heart to fine gentlemen and fine ladies is now forgotten But one noble passage still lives and is repeated by thousands who know not whence it comes one hundred fifty five Though nothing yet indicated the high political destiny of the East India Company that body had a great sway in the City of London The offices which stood on a very small part of the ground which the present offices cover had escaped the ravages of the fire The India House of those days was a building of timber and plaster rich with the quaint carving and lattice work of the Elizabethan age Above the windows was a painting which represented a fleet of merchantmen tossing on the waves The whole edifice was surmounted by a colossal wooden seaman who from between two dolphins looked down on the crowds of Leadenhall Street one hundred fifty six In this abode narrow and humble indeed when compared with the vast labyrinth of passages and chambers which now bears the same name the Company enjoyed during the greater part of the reign of Charles the Second a prosperity to which the history of trade scarcely furnishes any parallel and which excited the wonder the cupidity and the envious animosity of the whole capital Wealth and luxury were then rapidly increasing The taste for the spices the tissues and the jewels of the East became stronger day by day Tea which at the time when Monk brought the army of Scotland to London had been handed round to be stared at and just touched with the lips as a great rarity from China was eight years later a regular article of import and was soon consumed in such quantities that financiers began to consider it as a fit subject for taxation The progress which was making in the art of war had created an unprecedented demand for the ingredients of which gunpowder is compounded It was calculated that all Europe would hardly produce in a year saltpetre enough for the siege of one town fortified on the principles of Vauban one hundred fifty seven But for the supplies from India it was said the English government would be unable to equip a fleet without digging up the cellars of London in order to collect the nitrous particles from the walls one hundred fifty eight Before the Restoration scarcely one ship from the Thames had ever visited the Delta of the Ganges But during the twenty three years which followed the Restoration the value of the annual imports from that rich and populous district increased from eight thousand pounds to three hundred thousand The gains of the body which had the exclusive possession of this fast growing trade were almost incredible The capital which had been actually paid up did not exceed three hundred and seventy thousand pounds but the Company could without difficulty borrow money at six per cent and the borrowed money thrown into the trade produced it was rumoured thirty per cent The profits were such that in sixteen seventy six every proprietor received as a bonus a quantity of stock equal to that which he held On the capital thus doubled were paid during five years dividends amounting on an average to twenty per cent annually There had been a time when a hundred pounds of the stock could be purchased for sixty Even in sixteen sixty four the price in the market was only seventy But in sixteen seventy seven the price had risen to two hundred and forty five in sixteen eighty one it was three hundred it subsequently rose to three hundred and sixty and it is said that some sales were effected at five hundred one hundred fifty nine The enormous gains of the Indian trade might perhaps have excited little murmuring if they had been distributed among numerous proprietors But while the value of the stock went on increasing the number of stockholders went on diminishing At the time when the prosperity of the Company reached the highest point the management was entirely in the hands of a few merchants of enormous wealth A proprietor then had a vote for every five hundred pounds of stock that stood in his name It is asserted in the pamphlets of that age that five persons had a sixth part and fourteen persons a third part of the votes one hundred sixty More than one fortunate speculator was said to derive an annual income of ten thousand pounds from the monopoly and one great man was pointed out on the Royal Exchange as having by judicious or lucky purchases of stock created in no long time an estate of twenty thousand a year This commercial grandee who in wealth and in the influence which attends wealth vied with the greatest nobles of his time was Sir Josiah Child There were those who still remembered him an apprentice sweeping one of the counting houses of the City But from a humble position his abilities had raised him rapidly to opulence power and fame At the time of the Restoration he was highly considered in the mercantile world Soon after that event he published his thoughts on the philosophy of trade His speculations were not always sound but they were the speculations of an ingenious and reflecting man Into whatever errors he may occasionally have fallen as a theorist it is certain that as a practical man of business he had few equals Almost as soon as he became a member of the committee which directed the affairs of the Company his ascendency was felt Soon many of the most important posts both in Leadenhall Street and in the factories of Bombay and Bengal were filled by his kinsmen and creatures His riches though expended with ostentatious profusion continued to increase and multiply He obtained a baronetcy he purchased a stately seat at Wanstead and there he laid out immense sums in excavating fishponds and in planting whole square miles of barren land with walnut trees He married his daughter to the eldest son of the Duke of Beaufort and paid down with her a portion of fifty thousand pounds one hundred sixty one But this wonderful prosperity was not uninterrupted Towards the close of the reign of Charles the Second the Company began to be fiercely attacked from without and to be at the same time distracted by internal dissensions The profits of the Indian trade were so tempting that private adventurers had often in defiance of the royal charter fitted out ships for the Eastern seas But the competition of these interlopers did not become really formidable till the year sixteen eighty The nation was then violently agitated by the dispute about the Exclusion Bill Timid men were anticipating another civil war The two great parties newly named Whigs and Tories were fiercely contending in every county and town of England and the feud soon spread to every corner of the civilised world where Englishmen were to be found The Company was popularly considered as a Whig body Among the members of the directing committee were some of the most vehement Exclusionists in the City Indeed two of them Sir Samuel Barnardistone and Thomas Papillon drew on themselves a severe persecution by their zeal against Popery and arbitrary power one hundred sixty two Child had been originally brought into the direction by these men he had long acted in concert with them and he was supposed to hold their political opinions He had during many years stood high in the esteem of the chiefs of the parliamentary opposition and had been especially obnoxious to the Duke of York one hundred sixty three The interlopers therefore determined to affect the character of loyal men who were determined to stand by the throne against the insolent tribunes of the City They spread at all the factories in the East reports that England was in confusion that the sword had been drawn or would immediately be drawn and that the Company was forward in the rebellion against the Crown These rumours which in truth were not improbable easily found credit among people separated from London by what was then a voyage of twelve months Some servants of the Company who were in ill humour with their employers and others who were zealous royalists joined the private traders At Bombay the garrison and the great body of the English inhabitants declared that they would no longer obey any body who did not obey the King they imprisoned the Deputy Governor and they proclaimed that they held the island for the Crown At Saint Helena there was a rising The insurgents took the name of King s men and displayed the royal standard They were not without difficulty put down and some of them were executed by martial law one hundred sixty four If the Company had still been a Whig Company when the news of these commotions reached England it is probable that the government would have approved of the conduct of the mutineers and that the charter on which the monopoly depended would have had the fate which about the same time befell so many other charters But while the interlopers were at a distance of many thousands of miles making war on the Company in the name of the King the Company and the King had been reconciled When the Oxford Parliament had been dissolved when many signs indicated that a strong reaction in favour of prerogative was at hand when all the corporations which had incurred the royal displeasure were beginning to tremble for their franchises a rapid and complete revolution took place at the India House Child who was then Governor or in the modern phrase Chairman separated himself from his old friends excluded them from the direction and negotiated a treaty of peace and of close alliance with the Court one hundred sixty five It is not improbable that the near connection into which he had just entered with the great Tory house of Beaufort may have had something to do with this change in his politics Papillon Barnardistone and their adherents sold their stock their places in the committee were supplied by persons devoted to Child and he was thenceforth the autocrat of the Company The treasures of the Company were absolutely at his disposal The most important papers of the Company were kept not in the muniment room of the office in Leadenhall Street but in his desk at Wanstead The boundless power which he exercised at the India House enabled him to become a favourite at Whitehall and the favour which he enjoyed at Whitehall confirmed his power at the India House A present of ten thousand guineas was graciously received from him by Charles Ten thousand more were accepted by James who readily consented to become a holder of stock All who could help or hurt at Court ministers mistresses priests were kept in good humour by presents of shawls and silks birds nests and atar of roses bulses of diamonds and bags of guineas one hundred sixty six Of what the Dictator expended no account was asked by his colleagues and in truth he seems to have deserved the confidence which they reposed in him His bribes distributed with judicious prodigality speedily produced a large return Just when the Court became all powerful in the State he became all powerful at the Court Jeffreys pronounced a decision in favour of the monopoly and of the strongest acts which had been done in defence of the monopoly James ordered his seal to be put to a new charter which confirmed and extended all the privileges bestowed on the Company by his predecessors All captains of Indiamen received commissions from the Crown and were permitted to hoist the royal ensigns one hundred sixty seven John Child brother of Sir Josiah and Governor of Bombay was created a baronet by the style of Sir John Child of Surat he was declared General of all the English forces in the East and he was authorised to assume the title of Excellency The Company on the other hand distinguished itself among many servile corporations by obsequious homage to the throne and set to all the merchants of the kingdom the example of readily and even eagerly paying those customs which James at the commencement of his reign exacted without the authority of Parliament one hundred sixty eight It seemed that the private trade would now be utterly crushed and that the monopoly protected by the whole strength of the royal prerogative would be more profitable than ever But unfortunately just at this moment a quarrel arose between the agents of the Company in India and the Mogul Government Where the fault lay is a question which was vehemently disputed at the time and which it is now impossible to decide The interlopers threw all the blame on the Company The Governor of Bombay they affirmed had always been grasping and violent but his baronetcy and his military commission had completely turned his head The very natives who were employed about the factory had noticed the change and had muttered in their broken English that there must be some strange curse attending the word Excellency for that ever since the chief of the strangers was called Excellency every thing had gone to ruin Meanwhile it was said the brother in England had sanctioned all the unjust and impolitic acts of the brother in India till at length insolence and rapine disgraceful to the English nation and to the Christian religion had roused the just resentment of the native authorities The Company warmly recriminated The story told at the India House was that the quarrel was entirely the work of the interlopers who were now designated not only as interlopers but as traitors They had it was alleged by flattery by presents and by false accusations induced the viceroys of the Mogul to oppress and persecute the body which in Asia represented the English Crown And indeed this charge seems not to have been altogether without foundation It is certain that one of the most pertinacious enemies of the Childs went up to the Court of Aurengzebe took his station at the palace gate stopped the Great King who was in the act of mounting on horseback and lifting a petition high in the air demanded justice in the name of the common God of Christians and Mussulmans one hundred sixty nine Whether Aurengzebe paid much attention to the charges brought by infidel Franks against each other may be doubted But it is certain that a complete rupture took place between his deputies and the servants of the Company On the sea the ships of his subjects were seized by the English On land the English settlements were taken and plundered The trade was suspended and though great annual dividends were still paid in London they were no longer paid out of annual profits Just at this conjuncture while every Indiaman that arrived in the Thames was bringing unwelcome news from the East all the politics of Sir Josiah were utterly confounded by the Revolution He had flattered himself that he had secured the body of which he was the chief against the machinations of interlopers by uniting it closely with the strongest government that had existed within his memory That government had fallen and whatever had leaned on the ruined fabric began to totter The bribes had been thrown away The connections which had been the strength and boast of the corporation were now its weakness and its shame The King who had been one of its members was an exile The judge by whom all its most exorbitant pretensions had been pronounced legitimate was a prisoner All the old enemies of the Company reinforced by those great Whig merchants whom Child had expelled from the direction demanded justice and vengeance from the Whig House of Commons which had just placed William and Mary on the throne No voice was louder in accusation than that of Papillon who had some years before been more zealous for the charter than any man in London one hundred seventy The Commons censured in severe terms the persons who had inflicted death by martial law at Saint Helena and even resolved that some of those offenders should be excluded from the Act of Indemnity one hundred seventy one The great question how the trade with the East should for the future be carried on was referred to a Committee The report was to have been made on the twenty seventh of January sixteen ninety but on that very day the Parliament ceased to exist The first two sessions of the succeeding Parliament were so short and so busy that little was said about India in either House But out of Parliament all the arts both of controversy and of intrigue were employed on both sides Almost as many pamphlets were published about the India trade as about the oaths The despot of Leadenhall Street was libelled in prose and verse Wretched puns were made on his name He was compared to Cromwell to the King of France to Goliath of Gath to the Devil It was vehemently declared to be necessary that in any Act which might be passed for the regulation of our traffic with the Eastern seas Sir Josiah should be by name excluded from all trust one hundred seventy two There were however great differences of opinion among those who agreed in hating Child and the body of which he was the head The manufacturers of Spitalfields of Norwich of Yorkshire and of the Western counties considered the trade with the Eastern seas as rather injurious than beneficial to the kingdom The importation of Indian spices indeed was admitted to be harmless and the importation of Indian saltpetre to be necessary But the importation of silks and of Bengals as shawls were then called was pronounced to be a curse to the country The effect of the growing taste for such frippery was that our gold and silver went abroad and that much excellent English drapery lay in our warehouses till it was devoured by the moths Those it was said were happy days for the inhabitants both of our pasture lands and of our manufacturing towns when every gown every hanging every bed was made of materials which our own flocks had furnished to our own looms Where were now the brave old hangings of arras which had adorned the walls of lordly mansions in the days of Elizabeth And was it not a shame to see a gentleman whose ancestors had worn nothing but stuffs made by English workmen out of English fleeces flaunting in a calico shirt and a pair of silk stockings Clamours such as these had a few years before extorted from Parliament the Act which required that the dead should be wrapped in woollen and some sanguine clothiers hoped that the legislature would by excluding all Indian textures from our ports impose the same necessity on the living one hundred seventy three But this feeling was confined to a minority The public was indeed inclined rather to overrate than to underrate the benefits which might be derived by England from the Indian trade What was the most effectual mode of extending that trade was a question which excited general interest and which was answered in very different ways A small party consisting chiefly of merchants resident at Bristol and other provincial seaports maintained that the best way to extend trade was to leave it free They urged the well known arguments which prove that monopoly is injurious to commerce and having fully established the general law they asked why the commerce between England and India was to be considered as an exception to that law Any trader ought they said to be permitted to send from any port a cargo to Surat or Canton as freely as he now sent a cargo to Hamburg or Lisbon one hundred seventy four In our time these doctrines may probably be considered not only as sound but as trite and obvious In the seventeenth century however they were thought paradoxical It was then generally held to be a certain and indeed an almost selfevident truth that our trade with the countries lying beyond the Cape of Good Hope could be advantageously carried on only by means of a great Joint Stock Company There was no analogy it was said between our European trade and our Indian trade Our government had diplomatic relations with the European States If necessary a maritime force could easily be sent from hence to the mouth of the Elbe or of the Tagus But the English Kings had no envoy at the Court of Agra or Pekin There was seldom a single English man of war within ten thousand miles of the Bay of Bengal or of the Gulf of Siam As our merchants could not in those remote seas be protected by their Sovereign they must protect themselves and must for that end exercise some of the rights of sovereignty They must have forts garrisons and armed ships They must have power to send and receive embassies to make a treaty of alliance with one Asiatic prince to wage war on another It was evidently impossible that every merchant should have this power independently of the rest The merchants trading to India must therefore be joined together in a corporation which could act as one man In support of these arguments the example of the Dutch was cited and was generally considered as decisive For in that age the immense prosperity of Holland was every where regarded with admiration not the less earnest because it was largely mingled with envy and hatred In all that related to trade her statesmen were considered as oracles and her institutions as models The great majority therefore of those who assailed the Company assailed it not because it traded on joint funds and possessed exclusive privileges but because it was ruled by one man and because his rule had been mischievous to the public and beneficial only to himself and his creatures The obvious remedy it was said for the evils which his maladministration had produced was to transfer the monopoly to a new corporation so constituted as to be in no danger of falling under the dominion either of a despot or of a narrow oligarchy Many persons who were desirous to be members of such a corporation formed themselves into a society signed an engagement and entrusted the care of their interests to a committee which contained some of the chief traders of the City This society though it had in the eye of the law no personality was early designated in popular speech as the New Company and the hostilities between the New Company and the Old Company soon caused almost as much excitement and anxiety at least in that busy hive of which the Royal Exchange was the centre as the hostilities between the Allies and the French King The headquarters of the younger association were in Dowgate the Skinners lent their stately hall and the meetings were held in a parlour renowned for the fragrance which exhaled from a magnificent wainscot of cedar one hundred seventy five While the contention was hottest important news arrived from India and was announced in the London Gazette as in the highest degree satisfactory Peace had been concluded between the great Mogul and the English That mighty potentate had not only withdrawn his troops from the factories but had bestowed on the Company privileges such as it had never before enjoyed Soon however appeared a very different version of the story The enemies of Child had before this time accused him of systematically publishing false intelligence He had now they said outlied himself They had obtained a true copy of the Firman which had put an end to the war and they printed a translation of it It appeared that Aurengzebe had contemptuously granted to the English in consideration of their penitence and of a large tribute his forgiveness for their past delinquency had charged them to behave themselves better for the future and had in the tone of a master laid on them his commands to remove the principal offender Sir John Child from power and trust The death of Sir John occurred so seasonably that these commands could not be obeyed But it was only too evident that the pacification which the rulers of the India House had represented as advantageous and honourable had really been effected on terms disgraceful to the English name one hundred seventy six During the summer of sixteen ninety one the controversy which raged on this subject between the Leadenhall Street Company and the Dowgate Company kept the City in constant agitation In the autumn the Parliament had no sooner met than both the contending parties presented petitions to the House of Commons one hundred seventy seven The petitions were immediately taken into serious consideration and resolutions of grave importance were passed The first resolution was that the trade with the East Indies was beneficial to the kingdom the second was that the trade with the East Indies would be best carried on by a joint stock company possessed of exclusive privileges one hundred seventy eight It was plain therefore that neither those manufacturers who wished to prohibit the trade nor those merchants at the outports who wished to throw it open had the smallest chance of attaining their objects The only question left was the question between the Old and the New Company Seventeen years elapsed before that question ceased to disturb both political and commercial circles It was fatal to the honour and power of one great minister and to the peace and prosperity of many private families The tracts which the rival bodies put forth against each other were innumerable If the drama of that age may be trusted the feud between the India House and Skinners Hall was sometimes as serious an impediment to the course of true love in London as the feud of the Capulets and Montagues had been at Verona one hundred seventy nine Which of the two contending parties was the stronger it is not easy to say The New Company was supported by the Whigs the Old Company by the Tories The New Company was popular for it promised largely and could not be accused of having broken its promises it made no dividends and therefore was not envied it had no power to oppress and had therefore been guilty of no oppression The Old Company though generally regarded with little favour by the public had the immense advantage of being in possession and of having only to stand on the defensive The burden of framing a plan for the regulation of the India trade and of proving that plan to be better than the plan hitherto followed lay on the New Company The Old Company had merely to find objections to every change that was proposed and such objections there was little difficulty in finding The members of the New Company were ill provided with the means of purchasing support at Court and in Parliament They had no corporate existence no common treasury If any of them gave a bribe he gave it out of his own pocket with little chance of being reimbursed But the Old Company though surrounded by dangers still held its exclusive privileges and still made its enormous profits Its stock had indeed gone down greatly in value since the golden days of Charles the Second but a hundred pounds still sold for a hundred and twenty two one hundred eighty After a large dividend had been paid to the proprietors a surplus remained amply sufficient in those days to corrupt half a cabinet and this surplus was absolutely at the disposal of one able determined and unscrupulous man who maintained the fight with wonderful art and pertinacity The majority of the Commons wished to effect a compromise to retain the Old Company but to remodel it to impose on it new conditions and to incorporate with it the members of the New Company With this view it was after long and vehement debates and close divisions resolved that the capital should be increased to a million and a half In order to prevent a single person or a small junto from domineering over the whole society it was determined that five thousand pounds of stock should be the largest quantity that any single proprietor could hold and that those who held more should be required to sell the overplus at any price not below par In return for the exclusive privilege of trading to the Eastern seas the Company was to be required to furnish annually five hundred tons of saltpetre to the Crown at a low price and to export annually English manufactures to the value of two hundred thousand pounds one hundred eighty one A bill founded on these resolutions was brought in read twice and committed but was suffered to drop in consequence of the positive refusal of Child and his associates to accept the offered terms He objected to every part of the plan and his objections are highly curious and amusing The great monopolist took his stand on the principles of free trade In a luminous and powerfully written paper he exposed the absurdity of the expedients which the House of Commons had devised To limit the amount of stock which might stand in a single name would he said be most unreasonable Surely a proprietor whose whole fortune was staked on the success of the Indian trade was far more likely to exert all his faculties vigorously for the promotion of that trade than a proprietor who had risked only what it would be no great disaster to lose The demand that saltpetre should be furnished to the Crown for a fixed sum Child met by those arguments familiar to our generation which prove that prices should be left to settle themselves To the demand that the Company should bind itself to export annually two hundred thousand pounds worth of English manufactures he very properly replied that the Company would most gladly export two millions worth if the market required such a supply and that if the market were overstocked it would be mere folly to send good cloth half round the world to be eaten by white ants It was never he declared with much spirit found politic to put trade into straitlaced bodices which instead of making it grow upright and thrive must either kill it or force it awry The Commons irritated by Child s obstinacy presented an address requesting the King to dissolve the Old Company and to grant a charter to a new Company on such terms as to His Majesty s wisdom might seem fit one hundred eighty two It is plainly implied in the terms of this address that the Commons thought the King constitutionally competent to grant an exclusive privilege of trading to the East Indies The King replied that the subject was most important that he would consider it maturely and that he would at a future time give the House a more precise answer one hundred eighty three In Parliament nothing more was said on the subject during that session but out of Parliament the war was fiercer than ever and the belligerents were by no means scrupulous about the means which they employed The chief weapons of the New Company were libels the chief weapons of the Old Company were bribes In the same week in which the bill for the regulation of the Indian trade was suffered to drop another bill which had produced great excitement and had called forth an almost unprecedented display of parliamentary ability underwent the same fate During the eight years which preceded the Revolution the Whigs had complained bitterly and not more bitterly than justly of the hard measure dealt out to persons accused of political offences Was it not monstrous they asked that a culprit should be denied a sight of his indictment Often an unhappy prisoner had not known of what he was accused till he had held up his hand at the bar The crime imputed to him might be plotting to shoot the King it might be plotting to poison the King The more innocent the defendant was the less likely he was to guess the nature of the charge on which he was to be tried and how could he have evidence ready to rebut a charge the nature of which he could not guess The Crown had power to compel the attendance of witnesses The prisoner had no such power If witnesses voluntarily came forward to speak in his favour they could not be sworn Their testimony therefore made less impression on a jury than the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution whose veracity was guaranteed by the most solemn sanctions of law and of religion The juries carefully selected by Sheriffs whom the Crown had named were men animated by the fiercest party spirit men who had as little tenderness for an Exclusionist of a Dissenter as for a mad dog The government was served by a band of able experienced and unprincipled lawyers who could by merely glancing over a brief distinguish every weak and every strong point of a case whose presence of mind never failed them whose flow of speech was inexhaustible and who had passed their lives in dressing up the worse reason so as to make it appear the better Was it not horrible to see three or four of these shrewd learned and callous orators arrayed against one poor wretch who had never in his life uttered a word in public who was ignorant of the legal definition of treason and of the first principles of the law of evidence and whose intellect unequal at best to a fencing match with professional gladiators was confused by the near prospect of a cruel and ignominious death Such however was the rule and even for a man so much stupefied by sickness that he could not hold up his hand or make his voice heard even for a poor old woman who understood nothing of what was passing except that she was going to be roasted alive for doing an act of charity no advocate was suffered to utter a word That a state trial so conducted was little better than a judicial murder had been during the proscription of the Whig party a fundamental article of the Whig creed The Tories on the other hand though they could not deny that there had been some hard cases maintained that on the whole substantial justice had been done Perhaps a few seditious persons who had gone very near to the frontier of treason but had not actually passed that frontier might have suffered as traitors But was that a sufficient reason for enabling the chiefs of the Rye House Plot and of the Western Insurrection to elude by mere chicanery the punishment of their guilt On what principle was the traitor to have chances of escape which were not allowed to the felon The culprit who was accused of larceny was subject to all the same disadvantages which in the case of regicides and rebels were thought so unjust ye nobody pitied him Nobody thought it monstrous that he should not have time to study a copy of his indictment that his witnesses should be examined without being sworn that he should be left to defend himself without the help of counsel against the best abilities which the Inns of Court could furnish The Whigs it seemed reserved all their compassion for those crimes which subvert government and dissolve the whole frame of human society Guy Faux was to be treated with an indulgence which was not to be extended to a shoplifter Bradshaw was to have privileges which were refused to a boy who had robbed a henroost The Revolution produced as was natural some change in the sentiments of both the great parties In the days when none but Roundheads and Nonconformists were accused of treason even the most humane and upright Cavaliers were disposed to think that the laws which were the safeguard of the throne could hardly be too severe But as soon as loyal Tory gentlemen and venerable fathers of the Church were in danger of being called in question for corresponding with Saint Germains a new light flashed on many understandings which had been unable to discover the smallest injustice in the proceedings against Algernon Sidney and Alice Lisle It was no longer thought utterly absurd to maintain that some advantages which were withheld from a man accused of felony might reasonably be allowed to a man accused of treason What probability was there that any sheriff would pack a jury that any barrister would employ all the arts of sophistry and rhetoric that any judge would strain law and misrepresent evidence in order to convict an innocent person of burglary or sheep stealing But on a trial for high treason a verdict of acquittal must always be considered as a defeat of the government and there was but too much reason to fear that many sheriffs barristers and judges might be impelled by party spirit or by some baser motive to do any thing which might save the government from the inconvenience and shame of a defeat The cry of the whole body of Tories was that the lives of good Englishmen who happened to be obnoxious to the ruling powers were not sufficiently protected and this cry was swelled by the voices of some lawyers who had distinguished themselves by the malignant zeal and dishonest ingenuity with which they had conducted State prosecutions in the days of Charles and James The feeling of the Whigs though it had not like the feeling of the Tories undergone a complete change was yet not quite what it had been Some who had thought it most unjust that Russell should have no counsel and that Cornish should have no copy of his indictment now began to mutter that the times had changed that the dangers of the State were extreme that liberty property religion national independence were all at stake that many Englishmen were engaged in schemes of which the object was to make England the slave of France and of Rome and that it would be most unwise to relax at such a moment the laws against political offences It was true that the injustice with which in the late reigns State trials had been conducted had given great scandal But this injustice was to be ascribed to the bad kings and bad judges with whom the nation had been cursed William was now on the throne Holt was seated for life on the bench and William would never exact nor would Holt ever perform services so shameful and wicked as those for which the banished tyrant had rewarded Jeffreys with riches and titles This language however was at first held but by few The Whigs as a party seem to have felt that they could not honourably defend in the season of their prosperity what in the time of their adversity they had always designated as a crying grievance A bill for regulating trials in cases of high treason was brought into the House of Commons and was received with general applause Treby had the courage to make some objections but no division took place The chief enactments were that no person should be convicted of high treason committed more than three years before the indictment was found that every person indicted for high treason should be allowed to avail himself of the assistance of counsel and should be furnished ten days before the trial with a copy of the indictment and with a list of the freeholders from among whom the jury was to be taken that his witnesses should be sworn and that they should be cited by the same process by which the attendance of the witnesses against him was secured The Bill went to the Upper House and came back with an important amendment The Lords had long complained of the anomalous and iniquitous constitution of that tribunal which had jurisdiction over them in cases of life and death When a grand jury has found a bill of indictment against a temporal peer for any offence higher than a misdemeanour the Crown appoints a Lord High Steward and in the Lord High Steward s Court the case is tried This Court was anciently composed in two very different ways It consisted if Parliament happened to be sitting of all the members of the Upper House When Parliament was not sitting the Lord High Steward summoned any twelve or more peers at his discretion to form a jury The consequence was that a peer accused of high treason during a recess was tried by a jury which his prosecutors had packed The Lords now demanded that during a recess as well as during a session every peer accused of high treason should be tried by the whole body of the peerage The demand was resisted by the House of Commons with a vehemence and obstinacy which men of the present generation may find it difficult to understand The truth is that some invidious privileges of peerage which have since been abolished and others which have since fallen into entire desuetude were then in full force and were daily used No gentleman who had had a dispute with a nobleman could think without indignation of the advantages enjoyed by the favoured caste If His Lordship were sued at law his privilege enabled him to impede the course of justice If a rude word were spoken of him such a word as he might himself utter with perfect impunity he might vindicate his insulted dignity both by civil and criminal proceedings If a barrister in the discharge of his duty to a client spoke with severity of the conduct of a noble seducer if an honest squire on the racecourse applied the proper epithets to the tricks of a noble swindler the affronted patrician had only to complain to the proud and powerful body of which he was a member His brethren made his cause their own The offender was taken into custody by Black Rod brought to the bar flung into prison and kept there till he was glad to obtain forgiveness by the most degrading submissions Nothing could therefore be more natural than that an attempt of the Peers to obtain any new advantage for their order should be regarded by the Commons with extreme jealousy There is strong reason to suspect that some able Whig politicians who thought it dangerous to relax at that moment the laws against political offences but who could not without incurring the charge of inconsistency declare themselves adverse to any relaxation had conceived a hope that they might by fomenting the dispute about the Court of the Lord High Steward defer for at least a year the passing of a bill which they disliked and yet could not decently oppose If this really was their plan it succeeded perfectly The Lower House rejected the amendment the Upper House persisted a free conference was held and the question was argued with great force and ingenuity on both sides The reasons in favour of the amendment are obvious and indeed at first sight seem unanswerable It was surely difficult to defend a system under which the Sovereign nominated a conclave of his own creatures to decide the fate of men whom he regarded as his mortal enemies And could any thing be more absurd than that a nobleman accused of high treason should be entitled to be tried by the whole body of his peers if his indictment happened to be brought into the House of Lords the minute before a prorogation but that if the indictment arrived a minute after the prorogation he should be at the mercy of a small junto named by the very authority which prosecuted him That any thing could have been said on the other side seems strange but those who managed the conference for the Commons were not ordinary men and seem on this occasion to have put forth all their powers Conspicuous among them was Charles Montague who was rapidly attaining a foremost rank among the orators of that age To him the lead seems on this occasion to have been left and to his pen we owe an account of the discussion which gives a very high notion of his talents for debate We have framed such was in substance his reasoning we have framed a law which has in it nothing exclusive a law which will be a blessing to every class from the highest to the lowest The new securities which we propose to give to innocence oppressed by power are common between the premier peer and the humblest day labourer The clause which establishes a time of limitation for prosecutions protects us all alike To every Englishman accused of the highest crime against the state whatever be his rank we give the privilege of seeing his indictment the privilege of being defended by counsel the privilege of having his witnesses summoned by writ of subpoena and sworn on the Holy Gospels Such is the bill which we sent up to your Lordships and you return it to us with a clause of which the effect is to give certain advantages to your noble order at the expense of the ancient prerogatives of the Crown Surely before we consent to take away from the King any power which his predecessors have possessed for ages and to give it to your Lordships we ought to be satisfied that you are more likely to use it well than he Something we must risk somebody we must trust and since we are forced much against our will to institute what is necessarily an invidious comparison we must own ourselves unable to discover any reason for believing that a prince is less to be trusted than an aristocracy Is it reasonable you ask that you should be tried for your lives before a few members of your House selected by the Crown Is it reasonable we ask in our turn that you should have the privilege of being tried by all the members of your House that is to say by your brothers your uncles your first cousins your second cousins your fathers in law your brothers in law your most intimate friends You marry so much into each other s families you live so much in each other s society that there is scarcely a nobleman who is not connected by consanguinity or affinity with several others and who is not on terms of friendship with several more There have been great men whose death put a third or fourth part of the baronage of England into mourning Nor is there much danger that even those peers who may be unconnected with an accused lord will be disposed to send him to the block if they can with decency say Not Guilty upon my honour For the ignominious death of a single member of a small aristocratical body necessarily leaves a stain on the reputation of his fellows If indeed your Lordships proposed that every one of your body should be compelled to attend and vote the Crown might have some chance of obtaining justice against a guilty peer however strongly connected But you propose that attendance shall be voluntary Is it possible to doubt what the consequence will be All the prisoner s relations and friends will be in their places to vote for him Good nature and the fear of making powerful enemies will keep away many who if they voted at all would be forced by conscience and honour to vote against him The new system which you propose would therefore evidently be unfair to the Crown and you do not show any reason for believing that the old system has been found in practice unfair to yourselves We may confidently affirm that even under a government less just and merciful than that under which we have the happiness to live an innocent peer has little to fear from any set of peers that can be brought together in Westminster Hall to try him How stands the fact In what single case has a guiltless head fallen by the verdict of this packed jury It would be easy to make out a long list of squires merchants lawyers surgeons yeomen artisans ploughmen whose blood barbarously shed during the late evil times cries for vengeance to heaven But what single member of your House in our days or in the days of our fathers or in the days of our grandfathers suffered death unjustly by sentence of the Court of the Lord High Steward Hundreds of the common people were sent to the gallows by common juries for the Rye House Plot and the Western Insurrection One peer and one alone my Lord Delamere was brought at that time before the Court of the Lord High Steward and he was acquitted But it is said the evidence against him was legally insufficient Be it so So was the evidence against Sidney against Cornish against Alice Lisle yet it sufficed to destroy them But it is said the peers before whom my Lord Delamere was brought were selected with shameless unfairness by King James and by Jeffreys Be it so But this only proves that under the worst possible King and under the worst possible High Steward a lord tried by lords has a better chance for life than a commoner who puts himself on his country We cannot therefore under the mild government which we now possess feel much apprehension for the safety of any innocent peer Would that we felt as little apprehension for the safety of that government But it is notorious that the settlement with which our liberties are inseparably bound up is attacked at once by foreign and by domestic enemies We cannot consent at such a crisis to relax the restraints which have it may well be feared already proved too feeble to prevent some men of high rank from plotting the ruin of their country To sum up the whole what is asked of us is that we will consent to transfer a certain power from their Majesties to your Lordships Our answer is that at this time in our opinion their Majesties have not too much power and your Lordships have quite power enough These arguments though eminently ingenious and not without real force failed to convince the Upper House The Lords insisted that every peer should be entitled to be a Trier The Commons were with difficulty induced to consent that the number of Triers should never be less than thirty six and positively refused to make any further concession The bill was therefore suffered to drop one hundred eighty four It is certain that those who in the conference on this bill represented the Commons did not exaggerate the dangers to which the government was exposed While the constitution of the Court which was to try peers for treason was under discussion a treason planned with rare skill by a peer was all but carried into execution Marlborough had never ceased to assure the Court of Saint Germains that the great crime which he had committed was constantly present to his thoughts and that he lived only for the purpose of repentance and reparation Not only had he been himself converted he had also converted the Princess Anne In sixteen eighty eight the Churchills had with little difficulty induced her to fly from her father s palace In sixteen ninety one they with as little difficulty induced her to copy out and sign a letter expressing her deep concern for his misfortunes and her earnest wish to atone for her breach of duty one hundred eighty five At the same time Marlborough held out hopes that it might be in his power to effect the restoration of his old master in the best possible way without the help of a single foreign soldier or sailor by the votes of the English Lords and Commons and by the support of the English army We are not fully informed as to all the details of his plan But the outline is known to us from a most interesting paper written by James of which one copy is in the Bodleian Library and another among the archives of the French Foreign Office The jealousy with which the English regarded the Dutch was at this time intense There had never been a hearty friendship between the nations They were indeed near of kin to each other They spoke two dialects of one widespread language Both boasted of their political freedom Both were attached to the reformed faith Both were threatened by the same enemy and would be safe only while they were united Yet there was no cordial feeling between them They would probably have loved each other more if they had in some respects resembled each other less They were the two great commercial nations the two great maritime nations In every sea their flags were found together in the Baltic and in the Mediterranean in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Straits of Malacca Every where the merchant of London and the merchant of Amsterdam were trying to forestall each other and to undersell each other In Europe the contest was not sanguinary But too often in barbarous countries where there was no law but force the competitors had met burning with cupidity burning with animosity armed for battle each suspecting the other of hostile designs and each resolved to give the other no advantage In such circumstances it is not strange that many violent and cruel acts should have been perpetrated What had been done in those distant regions could seldom be exactly known in Europe Every thing was exaggerated and distorted by vague report and by national prejudice Here it was the popular belief that the English were always blameless and that every quarrel was to be ascribed to the avarice and inhumanity of the Dutch Lamentable events which had taken place in the Spice Islands were repeatedly brought on our stage The Englishmen were all saints and heroes the Dutchmen all fiends in human shape lying robbing ravishing murdering torturing The angry passions which these pieces indicated had more than once found vent in war Thrice in the lifetime of one generation the two nations had contended with equal courage and with various fortune for the sovereignty of the German Ocean The tyranny of James as it had reconciled Tories to Whigs and Churchmen to Nonconformists had also reconciled the English to the Dutch While our ancestors were looking to the Hague for deliverance the massacre of Amboyna and the great humiliation of Chatham had seemed to be forgotten But since the Revolution the old feeling had revived Though England and Holland were now closely bound together by treaty they were as far as ever from being bound together by affection Once just after the battle of Beachy Head our countrymen had seemed disposed to be just but a violent reaction speedily followed Torrington who deserved to be shot became a popular favourite and the allies whom he had shamefully abandoned were accused of persecuting him without a cause The partiality shown by the King to the companions of his youth was the favourite theme of the sewers of sedition The most lucrative posts in his household it was said were held by Dutchmen the House of Lords was fast filling with Dutchmen the finest manors of the Crown were given to Dutchmen the army was commanded by Dutchmen That it would have been wise in William to exhibit somewhat less obtrusively his laudable fondness for his native country and to remunerate his early friends somewhat more sparingly is perfectly true But it will not be easy to prove that on any important occasion during his whole reign he sacrificed the interests of our island to the interests of the United Provinces The English however were on this subject prone to fits of jealousy which made them quite incapable of listening to reason One of the sharpest of those fits came on in the autumn of sixteen ninety one The antipathy to the Dutch was at that time strong in all classes and nowhere stronger than in the Parliament and in the army one hundred eighty six Of that antipathy Marlborough determined to avail himself for the purpose as he assured James and James s adherents of effecting a restoration The temper of both Houses was such that they might not improbably be induced by skilful management to present a joint address requesting that all foreigners might be dismissed from the service of their Majesties Marlborough undertook to move such an address in the Lords and there would have been no difficulty in finding some gentleman of great weight to make a similar motion in the Commons If the address should be carried what could William do Would he yield Would he discard all his dearest his oldest his most trusty friends It was hardly possible to believe that he would make so painful so humiliating a concession If he did not yield there would be a rupture between him and the Parliament and the Parliament would be backed by the people Even a King reigning by a hereditary title might well shrink from such a contest with the Estates of the Realm But to a King whose title rested on a resolution of the Estates of the Realm such a contest must almost necessarily be fatal The last hope of William would be in the army The army Marlborough undertook to manage and it is highly probable that what he undertook he could have performed His courage his abilities his noble and winning manners the splendid success which had attended him on every occasion on which he had been in command had made him in spite of his sordid vices a favourite with his brethren in arms They were proud of having one countryman who had shown that he wanted nothing but opportunity to vie with the ablest Marshal of France The Dutch were even more disliked by the English troops than by the English nation generally Had Marlborough therefore after securing the cooperation of some distinguished officers presented himself at the critical moment to those regiments which he had led to victory in Flanders and in Ireland had he called on them to rally round him to protect the Parliament and to drive out the aliens there is strong reason to think that the call would have been obeyed He would then have had it in his power to fulfil the promises which he had so solemnly made to his old master Of all the schemes ever formed for the restoration of James or of his descendants this scheme promised the fairest That national pride that hatred of arbitrary power which had hitherto been on William s side would now be turned against him Hundreds of thousands who would have put their lives in jeopardy to prevent a French army from imposing a government on the English would have felt no disposition to prevent an English army from driving out the Dutch Even the Whigs could scarcely without renouncing their old doctrines support a prince who obstinately refused to comply with the general wish of his people signified to him by his Parliament The plot looked well An active canvass was made Many members of the House of Commons who did not at all suspect that there was any ulterior design promised to vote against the foreigners Marlborough was indefatigable in inflaming the discontents of the army His house was constantly filled with officers who heated each other into fury by talking against the Dutch But before the preparations were complete a strange suspicion rose in the minds of some of the Jacobites That the author of this bold and artful scheme wished to pull down the existing government there could be little doubt But was it quite certain what government he meant to set up Might he not depose William without restoring James Was it not possible that a man so wise so aspiring and so wicked might be meditating a double treason such as would have been thought a masterpiece of statecraft by the great Italian politicians of the fifteenth century such as Borgia would have envied such as Machiavel would have extolled to the skies What if this consummate dissembler should cheat both the rival kings What if when he found himself commander of the army and protector of the Parliament he should proclaim Queen Anne Was it not possible that the weary and harassed nation might gladly acquiesce in such a settlement James was unpopular because he was a Papist influenced by Popish priests William was unpopular because he was a foreigner attached to foreign favourites Anne was at once a Protestant and an Englishwoman Under her government the country would be in no danger of being overrun either by Jesuits or by Dutchmen That Marlborough had the strongest motives for placing her on the throne was evident He could never in the court of her father be more than a repentant criminal whose services were overpaid by a pardon In her court the husband of her adored friend would be what Pepin Heristal and Charles Martel had been to the Chilperics and Childeberts He would be the chief director of the civil and military government He would wield the whole power of England He would hold the balance of Europe Great kings and commonwealths would bid against each other for his favour and exhaust their treasuries in the vain hope of satiating his avarice The presumption was therefore that if he had the English crown in his hands he would put in on the head of the Princess What evidence there was to confirm this presumption is not known but it is certain that something took place which convinced some of the most devoted friends of the exiled family that he was meditating a second perfidy surpassing even the feat which he had performed at Salisbury They were afraid that if at that moment they succeeded in getting rid of William the situation of James would be more hopeless than ever So fully were they persuaded of the duplicity of their accomplice that they not only refused to proceed further in the execution of the plan which he had formed but disclosed his whole scheme to Portland William seems to have been alarmed and provoked by this intelligence to a degree very unusual with him In general he was indulgent nay wilfully blind to the baseness of the English statesmen whom he employed He suspected indeed he knew that some of his servants were in correspondence with his competitor and yet he did not punish them did not disgrace them did not even frown on them He thought meanly and he had but too good reason for thinking meanly of the whole of that breed of public men which the Restoration had formed and had bequeathed to the Revolution He knew them too well to complain because he did not find in them veracity fidelity consistency disinterestedness The very utmost that he expected from them was that they would serve him as far as they could serve him without serious danger to themselves If he learned that while sitting in his council and enriched by his bounty they were trying to make for themselves at Saint Germains an interest which might be of use to them in the event of a counterrevolution he was more inclined to bestow on them the contemptuous commendation which was bestowed of old on the worldly wisdom of the unjust steward than to call them to a severe account But the crime of Marlborough was of a very different kind His treason was not that of a fainthearted man desirous to keep a retreat open for himself in every event but that of a man of dauntless courage profound policy and measureless ambition William was not prone to fear but if there was anything on earth that he feared it was Marlborough To treat the criminal as he deserved was indeed impossible for those by whom his designs had been made known to the government would never have consented to appear against him in the witness box But to permit him to retain high command in that army which he was then engaged in seducing would have been madness Late in the evening of the ninth of January the Queen had a painful explanation with the Princess Anne Early the next morning Marlborough was informed that their Majesties had no further occasion for his services and that he must not presume to appear in the royal presence He had been loaded with honours and with what he loved better riches All was at once taken away The real history of these events was known to very few Evelyn who had in general excellent sources of information believed that the corruption and extortion of which Marlborough was notoriously guilty had roused the royal indignation The Dutch ministers could only tell the States General that six different stories were spread abroad by Marlborough s enemies Some said that he had indiscreetly suffered an important military secret to escape him some that he had spoken disrespectfully of their Majesties some that he had done ill offices between the Queen and the Princess some that he had been forming cabals in the army some that he had carried on an unauthorised correspondence with the Danish government about the general politics of Europe and some that he had been trafficking with the agents of the Court of Saint Germains one hundred eighty seven His friends contradicted every one of these stories and affirmed that his only crime was his dislike of the foreigners who were lording it over his countrymen and that he had fallen a victim to the machinations of Portland whom he was known to dislike and whom he had not very politely described as a wooden fellow The mystery which from the first overhung the story of Marlborough s disgrace was darkened after the lapse of fifty years by the shameless mendacity of his widow The concise narrative of James dispels the mystery and makes it clear not only why Marlborough was disgraced but also how several of the reports about the cause of his disgrace originated one hundred eighty eight Though William assigned to the public no reason for exercising his undoubted prerogative by dismissing his servant Anne had been informed of the truth and it had been left to her to judge whether an officer who had been guilty of a foul treason was a fit inmate of the palace Three weeks passed Lady Marlborough still retained her post and her apartments at Whitehall Her husband still resided with her and still the King and Queen gave no sign of displeasure At length the haughty and vindictive Countess emboldened by their patience determined to brave them face to face and accompanied her mistress one evening to the drawingroom at Kensington This was too much even for the gentle Mary She would indeed have expressed her indignation before the crowd which surrounded the card tables had she not remembered that her sister was in a state which entitles women to peculiar indulgence Nothing was said that night but on the following day a letter from the Queen was delivered to the Princess Mary declared that she was unwilling to give pain to a sister whom she loved and in whom she could easily pass over any ordinary fault but this was a serious matter Lady Marlborough must be dismissed While she lived at Whitehall her lord would live there Was it proper that a man in his situation should be suffered to make the palace of his injured master his home Yet so unwilling was His Majesty to deal severely with the worst offenders that even this had been borne and might have been borne longer had not Anne brought the Countess to defy the King and Queen in their own presence chamber It was unkind Mary wrote in a sister it would have been uncivil in an equal and I need not say that I have more to claim The Princess in her answer did not attempt to exculpate or excuse Marlborough but expressed a firm conviction that his wife was innocent and implored the Queen not to insist on so heartrending a separation There is no misery Anne wrote that I cannot resolve to suffer rather than the thoughts of parting from her The Princess sent for her uncle Rochester and implored him to carry her letter to Kensington and to be her advocate there Rochester declined the office of messenger and though he tried to restore harmony between his kinswomen was by no means disposed to plead the cause of the Churchills He had indeed long seen with extreme uneasiness the absolute dominion exercised over his younger niece by that unprincipled pair Anne s expostulation was sent to the Queen by a servant The only reply was a message from the Lord Chamberlain Dorset commanding Lady Marlborough to leave the palace missus Morley would not be separated from missus Freeman As to mister Morley all places where he could have his three courses and his three bottles were alike to him The Princess and her whole family therefore retired to Sion House a villa belonging to the Duke of Somerset and situated on the margin of the Thames In London she occupied Berkeley House which stood in Piccadilly on the site now covered by Devonshire House one hundred eighty nine Her income was secured by Act of Parliament but no punishment which it was in the power of the Crown to inflict on her was spared Her guard of honour was taken away The foreign ministers ceased to wait upon her When she went to Bath the Secretary of State wrote to request the Mayor of that city not to receive her with the ceremonial with which royal visitors were usually welcomed When she attended divine service at Saint James s Church she found that the rector had been forbidden to show her the customary marks of respect to bow to her from his pulpit and to send a copy of his text to be laid on her cushion Even the bellman of Piccadilly it was said perhaps falsely was ordered not to chaunt her praises in his doggrel verse under the windows of Berkeley House one hundred ninety That Anne was in the wrong is clear but it is not equally clear that the King and Queen were in the right They should have either dissembled their displeasure or openly declared the true reasons for it Unfortunately they let every body see the punishment and they let scarcely any body know the provocation They should have remembered that in the absence of information about the cause of a quarrel the public is naturally inclined to side with the weaker party and that this inclination is likely to be peculiarly strong when a sister is without any apparent reason harshly treated by a sister They should have remembered too that they were exposing to attack what was unfortunately the one vulnerable part of Mary s character A cruel fate had put enmity between her and her father Her detractors pronounced her utterly destitute of natural affection and even her eulogists when they spoke of the way in which she had discharged the duties of the filial relation were forced to speak in a subdued and apologetic tone Nothing therefore could be more unfortunate than that she should a second time appear unmindful of the ties of consanguinity She was now at open war with both the two persons who were nearest to her in blood Many who thought that her conduct towards her parent was justified by the extreme danger which had threatened her country and her religion were unable to defend her conduct towards her sister While Mary who was really guilty in this matter of nothing more than imprudence was regarded by the world as an oppressor Anne who was as culpable as her small faculties enabled her to be assumed the interesting character of a meek resigned sufferer In those private letters indeed to which the name of Morley was subscribed the Princess expressed the sentiments of a fury in the style of a fishwoman railed savagely at the whole Dutch nation and called her brother in law sometimes the abortion sometimes the monster sometimes Caliban one hundred ninety one But the nation heard nothing of her language and saw nothing of her deportment but what was decorous and submissive The truth seems to have been that the rancorous and coarseminded Countess gave the tone to Her Highness s confidential correspondence while the graceful serene and politic Earl was suffered to prescribe the course which was to be taken before the public eye During a short time the Queen was generally blamed But the charm of her temper and manners was irresistible and in a few months she regained the popularity which she had lost one hundred ninety two It was a most fortunate circumstance for Marlborough that just at the very time when all London was talking about his disgrace and trying to guess at the cause of the King s sudden anger against one who had always seemed to be a favourite an accusation of treason was brought by William Fuller against many persons of high consideration was strictly investigated and was proved to be false and malicious The consequence was that the public which rarely discriminates nicely could not at that moment be easily brought to believe in the reality of any Jacobite conspiracy That Fuller s plot is less celebrated than the Popish plot is rather the fault of the historians than of Fuller who did all that man could do to secure an eminent place among villains Every person well read in history must have observed that depravity has its temporary modes which come in and go out like modes of dress and upholstery It may be doubted whether in our country any man ever before the year sixteen seventy eight invented and related on oath a circumstantial history altogether fictitious of a treasonable plot for the purpose of making himself important by destroying men who had given him no provocation But in the year sixteen seventy eight this execrable crime became the fashion and continued to be so during the twenty years which followed Preachers designated it as our peculiar national sin and prophesied that it would draw on us some awful national judgment Legislators proposed new punishments of terrible severity for this new atrocity one hundred ninety three It was not however found necessary to resort to those punishments The fashion changed and during the last century and a half there has perhaps not been a single instance of this particular kind of wickedness The explanation is simple Oates was the founder of a school His success proved that no romance is too wild to be received with faith by understandings which fear and hatred have disordered His slanders were monstrous but they were well timed he spoke to a people made credulous by their passions and thus by impudent and cruel lying he raised himself in a week from beggary and obscurity to luxury renown and power He had once eked out the small tithes of a miserable vicarage by stealing the pigs and fowls of his parishioners one hundred ninety four He was now lodged in a palace he was followed by admiring crowds he had at his mercy the estates and lives of Howards and Herberts A crowd of imitators instantly appeared It seemed that much more might be got and that much less was risked by testifying to an imaginary conspiracy than by robbing on the highway or clipping the coin Accordingly the Bedloes Dangerfields Dugdales Turberviles made haste to transfer their industry to an employment at once more profitable and less perilous than any to which they were accustomed Till the dissolution of the Oxford Parliament Popish plots were the chief manufacture Then during seven years Whig plots were the only plots which paid After the Revolution Jacobite plots came in but the public had become cautious and though the new false witnesses were in no respect less artful than their predecessors they found much less encouragement The history of the first great check given to the practices of this abandoned race of men well deserves to be circumstantially related In sixteen eighty nine and in the beginning of sixteen ninety William Fuller had rendered to the government service such as the best governments sometimes require and such as none but the worst men ever perform His useful treachery had been rewarded by his employers as was meet with money and with contempt Their liberality enabled him to live during some months like a fine gentleman He called himself a Colonel hired servants clothed them in gorgeous liveries bought fine horses lodged in Pall Mall and showed his brazen forehead overtopped by a wig worth fifty guineas in the antechambers of the palace and in the stage box at the theatre He even gave himself the airs of a favourite of royalty and as if he thought that William could not live without him followed His Majesty first to Ireland and then to the Congress of Princes at the Hague Fuller afterwards boasted that at the Hague he appeared with a retinue fit for an ambassador that he gave ten guineas a week for an apartment and that the worst waistcoat which he condescended to wear was of silver stuff at forty shillings a yard Such profusion of course brought him to poverty Soon after his return to England he took refuge from the bailiffs in Axe Yard a place lying within the verge of Whitehall His fortunes were desperate he owed great sums on the government he had no claim his past services had been overpaid no future service was to be expected from him having appeared in the witness box as evidence for the Crown he could no longer be of any use as a spy on the Jacobites and by all men of virtue and honour to whatever party they might belong he was abhorred and shunned Just at this time when he was in the frame of mind in which men are open to the worst temptations he fell in with the worst of tempters in truth with the Devil in human shape Oates had obtained his liberty his pardon and a pension which made him a much richer man than nineteen twentieths of the members of that profession of which he was the disgrace But he was still unsatisfied He complained that he had now less than three hundred a year In the golden days of the Plot he had been allowed three times as much had been sumptuously lodged in the palace had dined on plate and had been clothed in silk He clamoured for an increase of his stipend Nay he was even impudent enough to aspire to ecclesiastical preferment and thought it hard that while so many mitres were distributed he could not get a deanery a prebend or even a living He missed no opportunity of urging his pretensions He haunted the public offices and the lobbies of the Houses of Parliament He might be seen and heard every day hurrying as fast as his uneven legs would carry him between Charing Cross and Westminster Hall puffing with haste and self importance chattering about what he had done for the good cause and reviling in the style of the boatmen on the river all the statesmen and divines whom he suspected of doing him ill offices at Court and keeping him back from a bishopric When he found that there was no hope for him in the Established Church he turned to the Baptists They at first received him very coldly but he gave such touching accounts of the wonderful work of grace which had been wrought in his soul and vowed so solemnly before Jehovah and the holy angels to be thenceforth a burning and shining light that it was difficult for simple and well meaning people to think him altogether insincere He mourned he said like a turtle On one Lord s day he thought he should have died of grief at being shut out from fellowship with the saints He was at length admitted to communion but before he had been a year among his new friends they discovered his true character and solemnly cast him out as a hypocrite Thenceforth he became the mortal enemy of the leading Baptists and persecuted them with the same treachery the same mendacity the same effrontery the same black malice which had many years before wrought the destruction of more celebrated victims Those who had lately been edified by his account of his blessed experiences stood aghast to hear him crying out that he would be revenged that revenge was God s own sweet morsel that the wretches who had excommunicated him should be ruined that they should be forced to fly their country that they should be stripped to the last shilling His designs were at length frustrated by a righteous decree of the Court of Chancery a decree which would have left a deep stain on the character of an ordinary man but which makes no perceptible addition to the infamy of Titus Oates one hundred ninety five Through all changes however he was surrounded by a small knot of hotheaded and foulmouthed agitators who abhorred and despised by every respectable Whig yet called themselves Whigs and thought themselves injured because they were not rewarded for scurrility and slander with the best places under the Crown In sixteen ninety one Titus in order to be near the focal point of political intrigue and faction had taken a house within the precinct of Whitehall To this house Fuller who lived hard by found admission The evil work which had been begun in him when he was still a child by the memoirs of Dangerfield was now completed by the conversation of Oates The Salamanca Doctor was as a witness no longer formidable but he was impelled partly by the savage malignity which he felt towards all whom he considered as his enemies and partly by mere monkeylike restlessness and love of mischief to do through the instrumentality of others what he could no longer do in person In Fuller he had found the corrupt heart the ready tongue and the unabashed front which are the first qualifications for the office of a false accuser A friendship if that word may be so used sprang up between the pair Oates opened his house and even his purse to Fuller The veteran sinner both directly and through the agency of his dependents intimated to the novice that nothing made a man so important as the discovering of a plot and that these were times when a young fellow who would stick at nothing and fear nobody might do wonders The Revolution such was the language constantly held by Titus and his parasites had produced little good The brisk boys of Shaftesbury had not been recompensed according to their merits Even the Doctor such was the ingratitude of men was looked on coldly at the new Court Tory rogues sate at the council board and were admitted to the royal closet It would be a noble feat to bring their necks to the block Above all it would be delightful to see Nottingham s long solemn face on Tower Hill For the hatred with which these bad men regarded Nottingham had no bounds and was probably excited less by his political opinions in which there was doubtless much to condemn than by his moral character in which the closest scrutiny will detect little that is not deserving of approbation Oates with the authority which experience and success entitle a preceptor to assume read his pupil a lecture on the art of bearing false witness You ought he said with many oaths and curses to have made more much more out of what you heard and saw at Saint Germains Never was there a finer foundation for a plot But you are a fool you are a coxcomb I could beat you I would not have done so I used to go to Charles and tell him his own I called Lauderdale rogue to his face I made King Ministers Lords Commons afraid of me But you young men have no spirit Fuller was greatly edified by these exhortations It was however hinted to him by some of his associates that if he meant to take up the trade of swearing away lives he would do well not to show himself so often at coffeehouses in the company of Titus The Doctor said one of the gang is an excellent person and has done great things in his time but many people are prejudiced against him and if you are really going to discover a plot the less you are seen with him the better Fuller accordingly ceased to frequent Oates s house but still continued to receive his great master s instructions in private To do Fuller justice he seems not to have taken up the trade of a false witness till he could no longer support himself by begging or swindling He lived for a time on the charity of the Queen He then levied contributions by pretending to be one of the noble family of Sidney He wheedled Tillotson out of some money and requited the good Archbishop s kindness by passing himself off as His Grace s favourite nephew But in the autumn of sixteen ninety one all these shifts were exhausted After lying in several spunging houses Fuller was at length lodged in the King s Bench prison and he now thought it time to announce that he had discovered a plot one hundred ninety six He addressed himself first to Tillotson and Portland but both Tillotson and Portland soon perceived that he was lying What he said was however reported to the King who as might have been expected treated the information and the informant with cold contempt All that remained was to try whether a flame could be raised in the Parliament Soon after the Houses met Fuller petitioned the Commons to hear what he had to say and promised to make wonderful disclosures He was brought from his prison to the bar of the House and he there repeated a long romance James he said had delegated the regal authority to six commissioners of whom Halifax was first More than fifty lords and gentlemen had signed an address to the French King imploring him to make a great effort for the restoration of the House of Stuart Fuller declared that he had seen this address and recounted many of the names appended to it Some members made severe remarks on the improbability of the story and on the character of the witness He was they said one of the greatest rogues on the face of the earth and he told such things as could scarcely be credited if he were an angel from heaven Fuller audaciously pledged himself to bring proofs which would satisfy the most incredulous He was he averred in communication with some agents of James Those persons were ready to make reparation to their country Their testimony would be decisive for they were in possession of documentary evidence which would confound the guilty They held back only because they saw some of the traitors high in office and near the royal person and were afraid of incurring the enmity of men so powerful and so wicked Fuller ended by asking for a sum of money and by assuring the Commons that he would lay it out to good account one hundred ninety seven Had his impudent request been granted he would probably have paid his debts obtained his liberty and absconded but the House very wisely insisted on seeing his witnesses first He then began to shuffle The gentlemen were on the Continent and could not come over without passports Passports were delivered to him but he complained that they were insufficient At length the Commons fully determined to get at the truth presented an address requesting the King to send Fuller a blank safe conduct in the largest terms one hundred ninety eight The safe conduct was sent Six weeks passed and nothing was heard of the witnesses The friends of the lords and gentlemen who had been accused represented strongly that the House ought not to separate for the summer without coming to some decision on charges so grave Fuller was ordered to attend He pleaded sickness and asserted not for the first time that the Jacobites had poisoned him But all his plans were confounded by the laudable promptitude and vigour with which the Commons acted A Committee was sent to his bedside with orders to ascertain whether he really had any witnesses and where those witnesses resided The members who were deputed for this purpose went to the King s Bench prison and found him suffering under a disorder produced in all probability by some emetic which he had swallowed for the purpose of deceiving them In answer to their questions he said that two of his witnesses Delaval and Hayes were in England and were lodged at the house of a Roman Catholic apothecary in Holborn The Commons as soon as the Committee had reported sent some members to the house which he had indicated That house and all the neighbouring houses were searched Delaval and Hayes were not to be found nor had any body in the vicinity ever seen such men or heard of them The House therefore on the last day of the session just before Black Rod knocked at the door unanimously resolved that William Fuller was a cheat and a false accuser that he had insulted the Government and the Parliament that he had calumniated honourable men and that an address should be carried up to the throne requesting that he might be prosecuted for his villany one hundred ninety nine He was consequently tried convicted and sentenced to fine imprisonment and the pillory The exposure more terrible than death to a mind not lost to all sense of shame he underwent with a hardihood worthy of his two favourite models Dangerfield and Oates He had the impudence to persist year after year in affirming that he had fallen a victim to the machinations of the late King who had spent six thousand pounds in order to ruin him Delaval and Hayes so this fable ran had been instructed by James in person They had in obedience to his orders induced Fuller to pledge his word for their appearance and had then absented themselves and left him exposed to the resentment of the House of Commons two hundred The story had the reception which it deserved and Fuller sank into an obscurity from which he twice or thrice at long intervals again emerged for a moment into infamy On the twenty fourth of February sixteen ninety two about an hour after the Commons had voted Fuller an impostor they were summoned to the chamber of the Lords The King thanked the Houses for their loyalty and liberality informed them that he must soon set out for the Continent and commanded them to adjourn themselves He gave his assent on that day to many bills public and private but when the title of one bill which had passed the Lower House without a single division and the Upper House without a single protest had been read by the Clerk of the Crown the Clerk of the Parliaments declared according to the ancient form that the King and the Queen would consider of the matter Those words had very rarely been pronounced before the accession of William They have been pronounced only once since his death But by him the power of putting a Veto on laws which had been passed by the Estates of the Realm was used on several important occasions His detractors truly asserted that he rejected a greater number of important bills than all the Kings of the House of Stuart put together and most absurdly inferred that the sense of the Estates of the Realm was much less respected by him than by his uncles and his grandfather A judicious student of history will have no difficulty in discovering why William repeatedly exercised a prerogative to which his predecessors very seldom had recourse and which his successors have suffered to fall into utter desuetude His predecessors passed laws easily because they broke laws easily Charles the First gave his assent to the Petition of Right and immediately violated every clause of that great statute Charles the Second gave his assent to an Act which provided that a Parliament should be held at least once in three years but when he died the country had been near four years without a Parliament The laws which abolished the Court of High Commission the laws which instituted the Sacramental Test were passed without the smallest difficulty but they did not prevent James the Second from reestablishing the Court of High Commission and from filling the Privy Council the public offices the courts of justice and the municipal corporations with persons who had never taken the Test Nothing could be more natural than that a King should not think it worth while to withhold his assent from a statute with which he could dispense whenever he thought fit The situation of William was very different He could not like those who had ruled before him pass an Act in the spring and violate it in the summer He had by assenting to the Bill of Rights solemnly renounced the dispensing power and he was restrained by prudence as well as by conscience and honour from breaking the compact under which he held his crown A law might be personally offensive to him it might appear to him to be pernicious to his people but as soon as he had passed it it was in his eyes a sacred thing He had therefore a motive which preceding Kings had not for pausing before he passed such a law They gave their word readily because they had no scruple about breaking it He gave his word slowly because he never failed to keep it But his situation though it differed widely from that of the princes of the House of Stuart was not precisely that of the princes of the House of Brunswick A prince of the House of Brunswick is guided as to the use of every royal prerogative by the advice of a responsible ministry and this ministry must be taken from the party which predominates in the two Houses or at least in the Lower House It is hardly possible to conceive circumstances in which a Sovereign so situated can refuse to assent to a bill which has been approved by both branches of the legislature Such a refusal would necessarily imply one of two things that the Sovereign acted in opposition to the advice of the ministry or that the ministry was at issue on a question of vital importance with a majority both of the Commons and of the Lords On either supposition the country would be in a most critical state in a state which if long continued must end in a revolution But in the earlier part of the reign of William there was no ministry The heads of the executive departments had not been appointed exclusively from either party Some were zealous Whigs others zealous Tories The most enlightened statesmen did not hold it to be unconstitutional that the King should exercise his highest prerogatives on the most important occasions without any other guidance than that of his own judgment His refusal therefore to assent to a bill which had passed both Houses indicated not as a similar refusal would now indicate that the whole machinery of government was in a state of fearful disorder but merely that there was a difference of opinion between him and the two other branches of the legislature as to the expediency of a particular law Such a difference of opinion might exist and as we shall hereafter see actually did exist at a time when he was not merely on friendly but on most affectionate terms with the Estates of the Realm The circumstances under which he used his Veto for the first time have never yet been correctly stated A well meant but unskilful attempt had been made to complete a reform which the Bill of Rights had left imperfect That great law had deprived the Crown of the power of arbitrarily removing the judges but had not made them entirely independent They were remunerated partly by fees and partly by salaries Over the fees the King had no control but the salaries he had full power to reduce or to withhold That William had ever abused this power was not pretended but it was undoubtedly a power which no prince ought to possess and this was the sense of both Houses A bill was therefore brought in by which a salary of a thousand a year was strictly secured to each of the twelve judges Thus far all was well But unfortunately the salaries were made a charge on the hereditary revenue No such proposition would now be entertained by the House of Commons without the royal consent previously signified by a Privy Councillor But this wholesome rule had not then been established and William could defend the proprietary rights of the Crown only by putting his negative on the bill At the time there was as far as can now be ascertained no outcry Even the Jacobite libellers were almost silent It was not till the provisions of the bill had been forgotten and till nothing but its title was remembered that William was accused of having been influenced by a wish to keep the judges in a state of dependence two hundred one The Houses broke up and the King prepared to set out for the Continent Before his departure he made some changes in his household and in several departments of the government changes however which did not indicate a very decided preference for either of the great political parties Rochester was sworn of the Council It is probable that he had earned this mark of royal favour by taking the Queen s side in the unhappy dispute between her and her sister Pembroke took charge of the Privy Seal and was succeeded at the Board of Admiralty by Charles Lord Cornwallis a moderate Tory Lowther accepted a seat at the same board and was succeeded at the Treasury by Sir Edward Seymour Many Tory country gentlemen who had looked on Seymour as their leader in the war against placemen and Dutchmen were moved to indignation by learning that he had become a courtier They remembered that he had voted for a Regency that he had taken the oaths with no good grace that he had spoken with little respect of the Sovereign whom he was now ready to serve for the sake of emoluments hardly worthy of the acceptance of a man of his wealth and parliamentary interest It was strange that the haughtiest of human beings should be the meanest that one who seethed to reverence nothing on earth but himself should abase himself for the sake of quarter day About such reflections he troubled himself very little He found however that there was one disagreeable circumstance connected with his new office At the Board of Treasury he must sit below the Chancellor of the Exchequer The First Lord Godolphin was a peer of the realm and his right to precedence according to the rules of the heralds could not be questioned But every body knew who was the first of English commoners What was Richard Hampden that he should take the place of a Seymour of the head of the Seymours With much difficulty the dispute was compromised Many concessions were made to Sir Edward s punctilious pride He was sworn of the Council He was appointed one of the Cabinet The King took him by the hand and presented him to the Queen I bring you said William a gentleman who will in my absence be a valuable friend In this way Sir Edward was so much soothed and flattered that he ceased to insist on his right to thrust himself between the First Lord and the Chancellor of the Exchequer In the same Commission of Treasury in which the name of Seymour appeared appeared also the name of a much younger politician who had during the late session raised himself to high distinction in the House of Commons Charles Montague This appointment gave great satisfaction to the Whigs in whose esteem Montague now stood higher than their veteran chiefs Sacheverell and Littleton and was indeed second to Somers alone Sidney delivered up the seals which he had held during more than a year and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Some months elapsed before the place which he had quitted was filled up and during this interval the whole business which had ordinarily been divided between two Secretaries of State was transacted by Nottingham two hundred two While these arrangements were in progress events had taken place in a distant part of the island which were not till after the lapse of many months known in the best informed circles of London but which gradually obtained a fearful notoriety and which after the lapse of more than a hundred and sixty years are never mentioned without horror Soon after the Estates of Scotland had separated in the autumn of sixteen ninety a change was made in the administration of that kingdom William was not satisfied with the way in which he had been represented in the Parliament House He thought that the rabbled curates had been hardly treated He had very reluctantly suffered the law which abolished patronage to be touched with his sceptre But what especially displeased him was that the Acts which established a new ecclesiastical polity had not been accompanied by an Act granting liberty of conscience to those who were attached to the old ecclesiastical polity He had directed his Commissioner Melville to obtain for the Episcopalians of Scotland an indulgence similar to that which Dissenters enjoyed in England two hundred three But the Presbyterian preachers were loud and vehement against lenity to Amalekites Melville with useful talents and perhaps with fair intentions had neither large views nor an intrepid spirit He shrank from uttering a word so hateful to the theological demagogues of his country as Toleration By obsequiously humouring their prejudices he quelled the clamour which was rising at Edinburgh but the effect of his timid caution was that a far more formidable clamour soon rose in the south of the island against the bigotry of the schismatics who domineered in the north and against the pusillanimity of the government which had not dared to withstand that bigotry On this subject the High Churchman and the Low Churchman were of one mind or rather the Low Churchman was the more angry of the two A man like South who had during many years been predicting that if ever the Puritans ceased to be oppressed they would become oppressors was at heart not ill pleased to see his prophecy fulfilled But in a man like Burnet the great object of whose life had been to mitigate the animosity which the ministers of the Anglican Church felt towards the Presbyterians the intolerant conduct of the Presbyterians could awaken no feeling but indignation shame and grief There was therefore at the English Court nobody to speak a good word for Melville It was impossible that in such circumstances he should remain at the head of the Scottish administration He was however gently let down from his high position He continued during more than a year to be Secretary of State but another Secretary was appointed who was to reside near the King and to have the chief direction of affairs The new Prime Minister for Scotland was the able eloquent and accomplished Sir John Dalrymple His father the Lord President of the Court of Session had lately been raised to the peerage by the title of Viscount Stair and Sir John Dalrymple was consequently according to the ancient usage of Scotland designated as the Master of Stair In a few months Melville resigned his secretaryship and accepted an office of some dignity and emolument but of no political importance two hundred four The Lowlands of Scotland were during the year which followed the parliamentary session of sixteen ninety as quiet as they had ever been within the memory of man but the state of the Highlands caused much anxiety to the government The civil war in that wild region after it had ceased to flame had continued during some time to smoulder At length early in the year sixteen ninety one the rebel chiefs informed the Court of Saint Germains that pressed as they were on every side they could hold out no longer without succour from France James had sent them a small quantity of meal brandy and tobacco and had frankly told them that he could do nothing more Money was so scarce among them that six hundred pounds sterling would have been a most acceptable addition to their funds but even such a sum he was unable to spare He could scarcely in such circumstances expect them to defend his cause against a government which had a regular army and a large revenue He therefore informed them that he should not take it ill of them if they made their peace with the new dynasty provided always that they were prepared to rise in insurrection as soon as he should call on them to do so two hundred five Meanwhile it had been determined at Kensington in spite of the opposition of the Master of Stair to try the plan which Tarbet had recommended two years before and which if it had been tried when he recommended it would probably have prevented much bloodshed and confusion It was resolved that twelve or fifteen thousand pounds should be laid out in quieting the Highlands This was a mass of treasure which to an inhabitant of Appin or Lochaber seemed almost fabulous and which indeed bore a greater proportion to the income of Keppoch or Glengarry than fifteen hundred thousand pounds bore to the income of Lord Bedford or Lord Devonshire The sum was ample but the King was not fortunate in the choice of an agent two hundred six John Earl of Breadalbane the head of a younger branch of the great House of Campbell ranked high among the petty princes of the mountains He could bring seventeen hundred claymores into the field and ten years before the Revolution he had actually marched into the Lowlands with this great force for the purpose of supporting the prelatical tyranny two hundred seven In those days he had affected zeal for monarchy and episcopacy but in truth he cared for no government and no religion He seems to have united two different sets of vices the growth of two different regions and of two different stages in the progress of society In his castle among the hills he had learned the barbarian pride and ferocity of a Highland chief In the Council Chamber at Edinburgh he had contracted the deep taint of treachery and corruption After the Revolution he had like too many of his fellow nobles joined and betrayed every party in turn had sworn fealty to William and Mary and had plotted against them To trace all the turns and doublings of his course during the year sixteen eighty nine and the earlier part of sixteen ninety would be wearisome two hundred eight That course became somewhat less tortuous when the battle of the Boyne had cowed the spirit of the Jacobites It now seemed probable that the Earl would be a loyal subject of their Majesties till some great disaster should befall them Nobody who knew him could trust him but few Scottish statesmen could then be trusted and yet Scottish statesmen must be employed His position and connections marked him out as a man who might if he would do much towards the work of quieting the Highlands and his interest seemed to be a guarantee for his zeal He had as he declared with every appearance of truth strong personal reasons for wishing to see tranquillity restored His domains were so situated that while the civil war lasted his vassals could not tend their herds or sow their oats in peace His lands were daily ravaged his cattle were daily driven away one of his houses had been burned down It was probable therefore that he would do his best to put an end to hostilities two hundred nine He was accordingly commissioned to treat with the Jacobite chiefs and was entrusted with the money which was to be distributed among them He invited them to a conference at his residence in Glenorchy They came but the treaty went on very slowly Every head of a tribe asked for a larger share of the English gold than was to be obtained Breadalbane was suspected of intending to cheat both the clans and the King The dispute between the rebels and the government was complicated with another dispute still more embarrassing The Camerons and Macdonalds were really at war not with William but with Mac Callum More and no arrangement to which Mac Callum More was not a party could really produce tranquillity A grave question therefore arose whether the money entrusted to Breadalbane should be paid directly to the discontented chiefs or should be employed to satisfy the claims which Argyle had upon them The shrewdness of Lochiel and the arrogant pretensions of Glengarry contributed to protract the discussions But no Celtic potentate was so impracticable as Macdonald of Glencoe known among the mountains by the hereditary appellation of Mac Ian two hundred ten Mac Ian dwelt in the mouth of a ravine situated not far from the southern shore of Lochleven an arm of the sea which deeply indents the western coast of Scotland and separates Argyleshire from Invernesshire Near his house were two or three small hamlets inhabited by his tribe The whole population which he governed was not supposed to exceed two hundred souls In the neighbourhood of the little cluster of villages was some copsewood and some pasture land but a little further up the defile no sign of population or of fruitfulness was to be seen In the Gaelic tongue Glencoe signifies the Glen of Weeping and in truth that pass is the most dreary and melancholy of all the Scottish passes the very Valley of the Shadow of Death Mists and storms brood over it through the greater part of the finest summer and even on those rare days when the sun is bright and when there is no cloud in the sky the impression made by the landscape is sad and awful The path lies along a stream which issues from the most sullen and gloomy of mountain pools Huge precipices of naked stone frown on both sides Even in July the streaks of snow may often be discerned in the rifts near the summits All down the sides of the crags heaps of ruin mark the headlong paths of the torrents Mile after mile the traveller looks in vain for the smoke of one hut for one human form wrapped in plaid and listens in vain for the bark of a shepherd s dog or the bleat of a lamb Mile after mile the only sound that indicates life is the faint cry of a bird of prey from some stormbeaten pinnacle of rock The progress of civilisation which has turned so many wastes into fields yellow with harvests or gay with apple blossoms has only made Glencoe more desolate All the science and industry of a peaceful age can extract nothing valuable from that wilderness but in an age of violence and rapine the wilderness itself was valued on account of the shelter which it afforded to the plunderer and his plunder Nothing could be more natural than that the clan to which this rugged desert belonged should have been noted for predatory habits For among the Highlanders generally to rob was thought at least as honourable an employment as to cultivate the soil and of all the Highlanders The Macdonalds of Glencoe had the least productive soil and the most convenient and secure den of robbers Successive governments had tried to punish this wild race but no large force had ever been employed for that purpose and a small force was easily resisted or eluded by men familiar with every recess and every outlet of the natural fortress in which they had been born and bred The people of Glencoe would probably have been less troublesome neighbours if they had lived among their own kindred But they were an outpost of the Clan Donald separated from every other branch of their own family and almost surrounded by the domains of the hostile race of Diarmid two hundred eleven They were impelled by hereditary enmity as well as by want to live at the expense of the tribe of Campbell Breadalbane s property had suffered greatly from their depredations and he was not of a temper to forgive such injuries When therefore the Chief of Glencoe made his appearance at the congress in Glenorchy he was ungraciously received The Earl who ordinarily bore himself with the solemn dignity of a Castilian grandee forgot in his resentment his wonted gravity forgot his public character forgot the laws of hospitality and with angry reproaches and menaces demanded reparation for the herds which had been driven from his lands by Mac Ian s followers Mac Ian was seriously apprehensive of some personal outrage and was glad to get safe back to his own glen two hundred twelve His pride had been wounded and the promptings of interest concurred with those of pride As the head of a people who lived by pillage he had strong reasons for wishing that the country might continue to be in a perturbed state He had little chance of receiving one guinea of the money which was to be distributed among the malecontents For his share of that money would scarcely meet Breadalbane s demands for compensation and there could be little doubt that whoever might be unpaid Breadalbane would take care to pay himself Mac Ian therefore did his best to dissuade his allies from accepting terms from which he could himself expect no benefit and his influence was not small His own vassals indeed were few in number but he came of the best blood of the Highlands he had kept up a close connection with his more powerful kinsmen nor did they like him the less because he was a robber for he never robbed them and that robbery merely as robbery was a wicked and disgraceful act had never entered into the mind of any Celtic chief Mac Ian was therefore held in high esteem by the confederates His age was venerable his aspect was majestic and he possessed in large measure those intellectual qualities which in rude societies give men an ascendency over their fellows Breadalbane found himself at every step of the negotiation thwarted by the arts of his old enemy and abhorred the name of Glencoe more and more every day two hundred thirteen But the government did not trust solely to Breadalbane s diplomatic skill The authorities at Edinburgh put forth a proclamation exhorting the clans to submit to King William and Queen Mary and offering pardon to every rebel who on or before the thirty first of December sixteen ninety one should swear to live peaceably under the government of their Majesties It was announced that those who should hold out after that day would be treated as enemies and traitors two hundred fourteen Warlike preparations were made which showed that the threat was meant in earnest The Highlanders were alarmed and though the pecuniary terms had not been satisfactorily settled thought it prudent to give the pledge which was demanded of them No chief indeed was willing to set the example of submission Glengarry blustered and pretended to fortify his house two hundred fifteen I will not said Lochiel break the ice That is a point of honour with me But my tacksmen and people may use their freedom two hundred sixteen His tacksmen and people understood him and repaired by hundreds to the Sheriff to take the oaths The Macdonalds of Sleat Clanronald Keppoch and even Glengarry imitated the Camerons and the chiefs after trying to outstay each other as long as they durst imitated their vassals The thirty first of December arrived and still the Macdonalds of Glencoe had not come in The punctilious pride of Mac Ian was doubtless gratified by the thought that he had continued to defy the government after the boastful Glengarry the ferocious Keppoch the magnanimous Lochiel had yielded but he bought his gratification dear At length on the thirty first of December he repaired to Fort William accompanied by his principal vassals and offered to take the oaths To his dismay he found that there was in the fort no person competent to administer them Colonel Hill the Governor was not a magistrate nor was there any magistrate nearer than Inverary Mac Ian now fully sensible of the folly of which he had been guilty in postponing to the very last moment an act on which his life and his estate depended set off for Inverary in great distress He carried with him a letter from Hill to the Sheriff of Argyleshire Sir Colin Campbell of Ardkinglass a respectable gentleman who in the late reign had suffered severely for his Whig principles In this letter the Colonel expressed a goodnatured hope that even out of season a lost sheep and so fine a lost sheep would be gladly received Mac Ian made all the haste in his power and did not stop even at his own house though it lay nigh to the road But at that time a journey through Argyleshire in the depth of winter was necessarily slow The old man s progress up steep mountains and along boggy valleys was obstructed by snow storms and it was not till the sixth of January that he presented himself before the Sheriff at Inverary The Sheriff hesitated His power he said was limited by the terms of the proclamation and he did not see how he could swear a rebel who had not submitted within the prescribed time Mac Ian begged earnestly and with tears that he might be sworn His people he said would follow his example If any of them proved refractory he would himself send the recusant to prison or ship him off for Islanders His entreaties and Hill s letter overcame Sir Colin s scruples The oath was administered and a certificate was transmitted to the Council at Edinburgh setting forth the special circumstances which had induced the Sheriff to do what he knew not to be strictly regular two hundred seventeen The news that Mac Ian had not submitted within the prescribed time was received with cruel joy by three powerful Scotchmen who were then at the English Court Breadalbane had gone up to London at Christmas in order to give an account of his stewardship There he met his kinsman Argyle Argyle was in personal qualities one of the most insignificant of the long line of nobles who have borne that great name He was the descendant of eminent men and the parent of eminent men He was the grandson of one of the ablest of Scottish politicians the son of one of the bravest and most truehearted of Scottish patriots the father of one Mac Callum More renowned as a warrior and as an orator as the model of every courtly grace and as the judicious patron of arts and letters and of another Mac Callum More distinguished by talents for business and command and by skill in the exact sciences Both of such an ancestry and of such a progeny Argyle was unworthy He had even been guilty of the crime common enough among Scottish politicians but in him singularly disgraceful of tampering with the agents of James while professing loyalty to William Still Argyle had the importance inseparable from high rank vast domains extensive feudal rights and almost boundless patriarchal authority To him as to his cousin Breadalbane the intelligence that the tribe of Glencoe was out of the protection of the law was most gratifying and the Master of Stair more than sympathized with them both The feeling of Argyle and Breadalbane is perfectly intelligible They were the heads of a great clan and they had an opportunity of destroying a neighbouring clan with which they were at deadly feud Breadalbane had received peculiar provocation His estate had been repeatedly devastated and he had just been thwarted in a negotiation of high moment Unhappily there was scarcely any excess of ferocity for which a precedent could not be found in Celtic tradition Among all warlike barbarians revenge is esteemed the most sacred of duties and the most exquisite of pleasures and so it had long been esteemed among the Highlanders The history of the clans abounds with frightful tales some perhaps fabulous or exaggerated some certainly true of vindictive massacres and assassinations The Macdonalds of Glengarry for example having been affronted by the people of Culloden surrounded Culloden church on a Sunday shut the doors and burned the whole congregation alive While the flames were raging the hereditary musician of the murderers mocked the shrieks of the perishing crowd with the notes of his bagpipe two hundred eighteen A band of Macgregors having cut off the head of an enemy laid it the mouth filled with bread and cheese on his sister s table and had the satisfaction of seeing her go mad with horror at the sight They then carried the ghastly trophy in triumph to their chief The whole clan met under the roof of an ancient church Every one in turn laid his hand on the dead man s scalp and vowed to defend the slayers two hundred nineteen The inhabitants of Eigg seized some Macleods bound them hand and foot and turned them adrift in a boat to be swallowed up by the waves or to perish of hunger The Macleods retaliated by driving the population of Eigg into a cavern lighting a fire at the entrance and suffocating the whole race men women and children two hundred twenty It is much less strange that the two great Earls of the house of Campbell animated by the passions of Highland chieftains should have planned a Highland revenge than that they should have found an accomplice and something more than an accomplice in the Master of Stair The Master of Stair was one of the first men of his time a jurist a statesman a fine scholar an eloquent orator His polished manners and lively conversation were the delight of aristocratical societies and none who met him in such societies would have thought it possible that he could bear the chief part in any atrocious crime His political principles were lax yet not more lax than those of most Scotch politicians of that age Cruelty had never been imputed to him Those who most disliked him did him the justice to own that where his schemes of policy were not concerned he was a very goodnatured man two hundred twenty one There is not the slightest reason to believe that he gained a single pound Scots by the act which has covered his name with infamy He had no personal reason to wish the Glencoe men ill There had been no feud between them and his family His property lay in a district where their tartan was never seen Yet he hated them with a hatred as fierce and implacable as if they had laid waste his fields burned his mansion murdered his child in the cradle To what cause are we to ascribe so strange an antipathy This question perplexed the Master s contemporaries and any answer which may now be offered ought to be offered with diffidence two hundred twenty two The most probable conjecture is that he was actuated by an inordinate an unscrupulous a remorseless zeal for what seemed to him to be the interest of the state This explanation may startle those who have not considered how large a proportion of the blackest crimes recorded in history is to be ascribed to ill regulated public spirit We daily see men do for their party for their sect for their country for their favourite schemes of political and social reform what they would not do to enrich or to avenge themselves At a temptation directly addressed to our private cupidity or to our private animosity whatever virtue we have takes the alarm But virtue itself may contribute to the fall of him who imagines that it is in his power by violating some general rule of morality to confer an important benefit on a church on a commonwealth on mankind He silences the remonstrances of conscience and hardens his heart against the most touching spectacles of misery by repeating to himself that his intentions are pure that his objects are noble that he is doing a little evil for the sake of a great good By degrees he comes altogether to forget the turpitude of the means in the excellence of the end and at length perpetrates without one internal twinge acts which would shock a buccaneer There is no reason to believe that Dominic would for the best archbishopric in christendom have incited ferocious marauders to plunder and slaughter a peaceful and industrious population that Everard Digby would for a dukedom have blown a large assembly of people into the air or that Robespierre would have murdered for hire one of the thousands whom he murdered from philanthropy The Master of Stair seems to have proposed to himself a truly great and good end the pacification and civilisation of the Highlands He was by the acknowledgment of those who most hated him a man of large views He justly thought it monstrous that a third part of Scotland should be in a state scarcely less savage than New Guinea that letters of fire and sword should through a third part of Scotland be century after century a species of legal process and that no attempt should be made to apply a radical remedy to such evils The independence affected by a crowd of petty sovereigns the contumacious resistance which they were in the habit of offering to the authority of the Crown and of the Court of Session their wars their robberies their fireraisings their practice of exacting black mail from people more peaceable and more useful than themselves naturally excited the disgust and indignation of an enlightened and politic gownsman who was both by the constitution of his mind and by the habits of his profession a lover of law and order His object was no less than a complete dissolution and reconstruction of society in the Highlands such a dissolution and reconstruction as two generations later followed the battle of Culloden In his view the clans as they existed were the plagues of the kingdom and of all the clans the worst was that which inhabited Glencoe He had it is said been particularly struck by a frightful instance of the lawlessness and ferocity of those marauders One of them who had been concerned in some act of violence or rapine had given information against his companions He had been bound to a tree and murdered The old chief had given the first stab and scores of dirks had then been plunged into the wretch s body two hundred twenty three By the mountaineers such an act was probably regarded as a legitimate exercise of patriarchal jurisdiction To the Master of Stair it seemed that people among whom such things were done and were approved ought to be treated like a pack of wolves snared by any device and slaughtered without mercy He was well read in history and doubtless knew how great rulers had in his own and other countries dealt with such banditti He doubtless knew with what energy and what severity James the Fifth had put down the mosstroopers of the border how the chief of Henderland had been hung over the gate of the castle in which he had prepared a banquet for the King how John Armstrong and his thirty six horsemen when they came forth to welcome their sovereign had scarcely been allowed time to say a single prayer before they were all tied up and turned off Nor probably was the Secretary ignorant of the means by which Sixtus the Fifth had cleared the ecclesiastical state of outlaws The eulogists of that great pontiff tell us that there was one formidable gang which could not be dislodged from a stronghold among the Apennines Beasts of burden were therefore loaded with poisoned food and wine and sent by a road which ran close to the fastness The robbers sallied forth seized the prey feasted and died and the pious old Pope exulted greatly when he heard that the corpses of thirty ruffians who had been the terror of many peaceful villages had been found lying among the mules and packages The plans of the Master of Stair were conceived in the spirit of James and of Sixtus and the rebellion of the mountaineers furnished what seemed to be an excellent opportunity for carrying those plans into effect Mere rebellion indeed he could have easily pardoned On Jacobites as Jacobites he never showed any inclination to bear hard He hated the Highlanders not as enemies of this or that dynasty but as enemies of law of industry and of trade In his private correspondence he applied to them the short and terrible form of words in which the implacable Roman pronounced the doom of Carthage His project was no less than this that the whole hill country from sea to sea and the neighbouring islands should be wasted with fire and sword that the Camerons the Macleans and all the branches of the race of Macdonald should be rooted out He therefore looked with no friendly eye on schemes of reconciliation and while others were hoping that a little money would set everything right hinted very intelligibly his opinion that whatever money was to be laid out on the clans would be best laid out in the form of bullets and bayonets To the last moment he continued to flatter himself that the rebels would be obstinate and would thus furnish him with a plea for accomplishing that great social revolution on which his heart was set two hundred twenty four The letter is still extant in which he directed the commander of the forces in Scotland how to act if the Jacobite chiefs should not come in before the end of December There is something strangely terrible in the calmness and conciseness with which the instructions are given Your troops will destroy entirely the country of Lochaber Lochiel s lands Keppoch s Glengarry s and Glencoe s Your power shall be large enough I hope the soldiers will not trouble the government with prisoners two hundred twenty five This despatch had scarcely been sent off when news arrived in London that the rebel chiefs after holding out long had at last appeared before the Sheriffs and taken the oaths Lochiel the most eminent man among them had not only declared that he would live and die a true subject to King William but had announced his intention of visiting England in the hope of being permitted to kiss His Majesty s hand In London it was announced exultingly that every clan without exception had submitted in time and the announcement was generally thought most satisfactory two hundred twenty six But the Master of Stair was bitterly disappointed The Highlands were then to continue to be what they had been the shame and curse of Scotland A golden opportunity of subjecting them to the law had been suffered to escape and might never return If only the Macdonalds would have stood out nay if an example could but have been made of the two worst Macdonalds Keppoch and Glencoe it would have been something But it seemed that even Keppoch and Glencoe marauders who in any well governed country would have been hanged thirty years before were safe two hundred twenty seven While the Master was brooding over thoughts like these Argyle brought him some comfort The report that Mac Ian had taken the oaths within the prescribed time was erroneous The Secretary was consoled One clan then was at the mercy of the government and that clan the most lawless of all One great act of justice nay of charity might be performed One terrible and memorable example might be given two hundred twenty eight Yet there was a difficulty Mac Ian had taken the oaths He had taken them indeed too late to be entitled to plead the letter of the royal promise but the fact that he had taken them was one which evidently ought not to have been concealed from those who were to decide his fate By a dark intrigue of which the history is but imperfectly known but which was in all probability directed by the Master of Stair the evidence of Mac Ian s tardy submission was suppressed The certificate which the Sheriff of Argyleshire had transmitted to the Council at Edinburgh was never laid before the board but was privately submitted to some persons high in office and particularly to Lord President Stair the father of the Secretary These persons pronounced the certificate irregular and indeed absolutely null and it was cancelled Meanwhile the Master of Stair was forming in concert with Breadalbane and Argyle a plan for the destruction of the people of Glencoe It was necessary to take the King s pleasure not indeed as to the details of what was to be done but as to the question whether Mac Ian and his people should or should not be treated as rebels out of the pale of the ordinary law The Master of Stair found no difficulty in the royal closet William had in all probability never heard the Glencoe men mentioned except as banditti He knew that they had not come in by the prescribed day That they had come in after that day he did not know If he paid any attention to the matter he must have thought that so fair an opportunity of putting an end to the devastations and depredations from which a quiet and industrious population had suffered so much ought not to be lost An order was laid before him for signature He signed it but if Burnet may be trusted did not read it Whoever has seen anything of public business knows that princes and ministers daily sign and indeed must sign documents which they have not read and of all documents a document relating to a small tribe of mountaineers living in a wilderness not set down in any map was least likely to interest a Sovereign whose mind was full of schemes on which the fate of Europe might depend two hundred twenty nine But even on the supposition that he read the order to which he affixed his name there seems to be no reason for blaming him That order directed to the Commander of the Forces in Scotland runs thus As for Mac Ian of Glencoe and that tribe if they can be well distinguished from the other Highlanders it will be proper for the vindication of public justice to extirpate that set of thieves These words naturally bear a sense perfectly innocent and would but for the horrible event which followed have been universally understood in that sense It is undoubtedly one of the first duties of every government to extirpate gangs of thieves This does not mean that every thief ought to be treacherously assassinated in his sleep or even that every thief ought to be publicly executed after a fair trial but that every gang as a gang ought to be completely broken up and that whatever severity is indispensably necessary for that end ought to be used If William had read and weighed the words which were submitted to him by his Secretary he would probably have understood them to mean that Glencoe was to be occupied by troops that resistance if resistance were attempted was to be put down with a strong hand that severe punishment was to be inflicted on those leading members of the clan who could be proved to have been guilty of great crimes that some active young freebooters who were more used to handle the broad sword than the plough and who did not seem likely to settle down into quiet labourers were to be sent to the army in the Low Countries that others were to be transported to the American plantations and that those Macdonalds who were suffered to remain in their native valley were to be disarmed and required to give hostages for good behaviour A plan very nearly resembling this had we know actually been the subject of much discussion in the political circles of Edinburgh two hundred thirty There can be little doubt that William would have deserved well of his people if he had in this manner extirpated not only the tribe of Mac Ian but every Highland tribe whose calling was to steal cattle and burn houses The extirpation planned by the Master of Stair was of a different kind His design was to butcher the whole race of thieves the whole damnable race Such was the language in which his hatred vented itself He studied the geography of the wild country which surrounded Glencoe and made his arrangements with infernal skill If possible the blow must be quick and crushing and altogether unexpected But if Mac Ian should apprehend danger and should attempt to take refuge in the territories of his neighbours he must find every road barred The pass of Rannoch must be secured The Laird of Weems who was powerful in Strath Tay must be told that if he harbours the outlaws he does so at his peril Breadalbane promised to cut off the retreat of the fugitives on one side Mac Callum More on another It was fortunate the Secretary wrote that it was winter This was the time to maul the wretches The nights were so long the mountain tops so cold and stormy that even the hardiest men could not long bear exposure to the open air without a roof or a spark of fire That the women and the children could find shelter in the desert was quite impossible While he wrote thus no thought that he was committing a great wickedness crossed his mind He was happy in the approbation of his own conscience Duty justice nay charity and mercy were the names under which he disguised his cruelty nor is it by any means improbable that the disguise imposed upon himself two hundred thirty one Hill who commanded the forces assembled at Fort William was not entrusted with the execution of the design He seems to have been a humane man he was much distressed when he learned that the government was determined on severity and it was probably thought that his heart might fail him in the most critical moment He was directed to put a strong detachment under the orders of his second in command Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton To Hamilton a significant hint was conveyed that he had now an excellent opportunity of establishing his character in the estimation of those who were at the head of affairs Of the troops entrusted to him a large proportion were Campbells and belonged to a regiment lately raised by Argyle and called by Argyle s name It was probably thought that on such an occasion humanity might prove too strong for the mere habit of military obedience and that little reliance could be placed on hearts which had not been ulcerated by a feud such as had long raged between the people of Mac Ian and the people of Mac Callum More Had Hamilton marched openly against the Glencoe men and put them to the edge of the sword the act would probably not have wanted apologists and most certainly would not have wanted precedents But the Master of Stair had strongly recommended a different mode of proceeding If the least alarm were given the nest of robbers would be found empty and to hunt them down in so wild a region would even with all the help that Breadalbane and Argyle could give be a long and difficult business Better he wrote not meddle with them than meddle to no purpose When the thing is resolved let it be secret and sudden two hundred thirty two He was obeyed and it was determined that the Glencoe men should perish not by military execution but by the most dastardly and perfidious form of assassination On the first of February a hundred and twenty soldiers of Argyle s regiment commanded by a captain named Campbell and a lieutenant named Lindsay marched to Glencoe Captain Campbell was commonly called in Scotland Glenlyon from the pass in which his property lay He had every qualification for the service on which he was employed an unblushing forehead a smooth lying tongue and a heart of adamant He was also one of the few Campbells who were likely to be trusted and welcomed by the Macdonalds for his niece was married to Alexander the second son of Mac Ian The sight of the red coats approaching caused some anxiety among the population of the valley John the eldest son of the Chief came accompanied by twenty clansmen to meet the strangers and asked what this visit meant Lieutenant Lindsay answered that the soldiers came as friends and wanted nothing but quarters They were kindly received and were lodged under the thatched roofs of the little community Glenlyon and several of his men were taken into the house of a tacksman who was named from the cluster of cabins over which he exercised authority Inverriggen Lindsay was accommodated nearer to the abode of the old chief Auchintriater one of the principal men of the clan who governed the small hamlet of Auchnaion found room there for a party commanded by a serjeant named Barbour Provisions were liberally supplied There was no want of beef which had probably fattened in distant pastures nor was any payment demanded for in hospitality as in thievery the Gaelic marauders rivalled the Bedouins During twelve days the soldiers lived familiarly with the people of the glen Old Mac Ian who had before felt many misgivings as to the relation in which he stood to the government seems to have been pleased with the visit The officers passed much of their time with him and his family The long evenings were cheerfully spent by the peat fire with the help of some packs of cards which had found their way to that remote corner of the world and of some French brandy which was probably part of James s farewell gift to his Highland supporters Glenlyon appeared to be warmly attached to his niece and her husband Alexander Every day he came to their house to take his morning draught Meanwhile he observed with minute attention all the avenues by which when the signal for the slaughter should be given the Macdonalds might attempt to escape to the hills and he reported the result of his observations to Hamilton Hamilton fixed five o clock in the morning of the thirteenth of February for the deed He hoped that before that time he should reach Glencoe with four hundred men and should have stopped all the earths in which the old fox and his two cubs so Mac Ian and his sons were nicknamed by the murderers could take refuge But at five precisely whether Hamilton had arrived or not Glenlyon was to fall on and to slay every Macdonald under seventy The night was rough Hamilton and his troops made slow progress and were long after their time While they were contending with the wind and snow Glenlyon was supping and playing at cards with those whom he meant to butcher before daybreak He and Lieutenant Lindsay had engaged themselves to dine with the old Chief on the morrow Late in the evening a vague suspicion that some evil was intended crossed the mind of the Chief s eldest son The soldiers were evidently in a restless state and some of them uttered strange cries Two men it is said were overheard whispering I do not like this job one of them muttered I should be glad to fight the Macdonalds But to kill men in their beds We must do as we are bid answered another voice If there is any thing wrong our officers must answer for it John Macdonald was so uneasy that soon after midnight he went to Glenlyon s quarters Glenlyon and his men were all up and seemed to be getting their arms ready for action John much alarmed asked what these preparations meant Glenlyon was profuse of friendly assurances Some of Glengarry s people have been harrying the country We are getting ready to march against them You are quite safe Do you think that if you were in any danger I should not have given a hint to your brother Sandy and his wife John s suspicions were quieted He returned to his house and lay down to rest It was five in the morning Hamilton and his men were still some miles off and the avenues which they were to have secured were open But the orders which Glenlyon had received were precise and he began to execute them at the little village where he was himself quartered His host Inverriggen and nine other Macdonalds were dragged out of their beds bound hand and foot and murdered A boy twelve years old clung round the Captain s legs and begged hard for life He would do any thing he would go any where he would follow Glenlyon round the world Even Glenlyon it is said showed signs of relenting but a ruffian named Drummond shot the child dead At Auchnaion the tacksman Auchintriater was up early that morning and was sitting with eight of his family round the fire when a volley of musketry laid him and seven of his companions dead or dying on the floor His brother who alone had escaped unhurt called to Serjeant Barbour who commanded the slayers and asked as a favour to be allowed to die in the open air Well said the Serjeant I will do you that favour for the sake of your meat which I have eaten The mountaineer bold athletic and favoured by the darkness came forth rushed on the soldiers who were about to level their pieces at him flung his plaid over their faces and was gone in a moment Meanwhile Lindsay had knocked at the door of the old Chief and had asked for admission in friendly language The door was opened Mac Ian while putting on his clothes and calling to his servants to bring some refreshment for his visitors was shot through the head Two of his attendants were slain with him His wife was already up and dressed in such finery as the princesses of the rude Highland glens were accustomed to wear The assassins pulled off her clothes and trinkets The rings were not easily taken from her fingers but a soldier tore them away with his teeth She died on the following day The statesman to whom chiefly this great crime is to be ascribed had planned it with consummate ability but the execution was complete in nothing but in guilt and infamy A succession of blunders saved three fourths of the Glencoe men from the fate of their chief All the moral qualities which fit men to bear a part in a massacre Hamilton and Glenlyon possessed in perfection But neither seems to have had much professional skill Hamilton had arranged his plan without making allowance for bad weather and this in a country and at a season when the weather was very likely to be bad The consequence was that the fox earths as he called them were not stopped in time Glenlyon and his men committed the error of despatching their hosts with firearms instead of using the cold steel The peal and flash of gun after gun gave notice from three different parts of the valley at once that murder was doing From fifty cottages the half naked peasantry fled under cover of the night to the recesses of their pathless glen Even the sons of Mac Ian who had been especially marked out for destruction contrived to escape They were roused from sleep by faithful servants John who by the death of his father had become the patriarch of the tribe quitted his dwelling just as twenty soldiers with fixed bayonets marched up to it It was broad day long before Hamilton arrived He found the work not even half performed About thirty corpses lay wallowing in blood on the dunghills before the doors One or two women were seen among the number and a yet more fearful and piteous sight a little hand which had been lopped in the tumult of the butchery from some infant One aged Macdonald was found alive He was probably too infirm to fly and as he was above seventy was not included in the orders under which Glenlyon had acted Hamilton murdered the old man in cold blood The deserted hamlets were then set on fire and the troops departed driving away with them many sheep and goats nine hundred kine and two hundred of the small shaggy ponies of the Highlands It is said and may but too easily be believed that the sufferings of the fugitives were terrible How many old men how many women with babes in their arms sank down and slept their last sleep in the snow how many having crawled spent with toil and hunger into nooks among the precipices died in those dark holes and were picked to the bone by the mountain ravens can never be known But it is probable that those who perished by cold weariness and want were not less numerous than those who were slain by the assassins When the troops had retired the Macdonalds crept out of the caverns of Glencoe ventured back to the spot where the huts had formerly stood collected the scorched corpses from among the smoking ruins and performed some rude rites of sepulture The tradition runs that the hereditary bard of the tribe took his seat on a rock which overhung the place of slaughter and poured forth a long lament over his murdered brethren and his desolate home Eighty years later that sad dirge was still repeated by the population of the valley two hundred thirty three The survivors might well apprehend that they had escaped the shot and the sword only to perish by famine The whole domain was a waste Houses barns furniture implements of husbandry herds flocks horses were gone Many months must elapse before the clan would be able to raise on its own ground the means of supporting even the most miserable existence two hundred thirty four It may be thought strange that these events should not have been instantly followed by a burst of execration from every part of the civilised world The fact however is that years elapsed before the public indignation was thoroughly awakened and that months elapsed before the blackest part of the story found credit even among the enemies of the government That the massacre should not have been mentioned in the London Gazettes in the Monthly Mercuries which were scarcely less courtly than the Gazettes or in pamphlets licensed by official censors is perfectly intelligible But that no allusion to it should be found in private journals and letters written by persons free from all restraint may seem extraordinary There is not a word on the subject in Evelyn s Diary In Narcissus Luttrell s Diary is a remarkable entry made five weeks after the butchery The letters from Scotland he says described that kingdom as perfectly tranquil except that there was still some grumbling about ecclesiastical questions The Dutch ministers regularly reported all the Scotch news to their government They thought it worth while about this time to mention that a collier had been taken by a privateer near Berwick that the Edinburgh mail had been robbed that a whale with a tongue seventeen feet long and seven feet broad had been stranded near Aberdeen But it is not hinted in any of their despatches that there was any rumour of any extraordinary occurrence in the Highlands Reports that some of the Macdonalds had been slain did indeed in about three weeks travel through Edinburgh up to London But these reports were vague and contradictory and the very worst of them was far from coming up to the horrible truth The Whig version of the story was that the old robber Mac Ian had laid an ambuscade for the soldiers that he had been caught in his own snare and that he and some of his clan had fallen sword in hand The Jacobite version written at Edinburgh on the twenty third of March appeared in the Paris Gazette of the seventh of April Glenlyon it was said had been sent with a detachment from Argyle s regiment under cover of darkness to surprise the inhabitants of Glencoe and had killed thirty six men and boys and four women two hundred thirty five In this there was nothing very strange or shocking A night attack on a gang of freebooters occupying a strong natural fortress may be a perfectly legitimate military operation and in the obscurity and confusion of such an attack the most humane man may be so unfortunate as to shoot a woman or a child The circumstances which give a peculiar character to the slaughter of Glencoe the breach of faith the breach of hospitality the twelve days of feigned friendship and conviviality of morning calls of social meals of healthdrinking of cardplaying were not mentioned by the Edinburgh correspondent of the Paris Gazette and we may therefore confidently infer that those circumstances were as yet unknown even to inquisitive and busy malecontents residing in the Scottish capital within a hundred miles of the spot where the deed had been done In the south of the island the matter produced as far as can now be judged scarcely any sensation To the Londoner of those days Appin was what Caffraria or Borneo is to us He was not more moved by hearing that some Highland thieves had been surprised and killed than we are by hearing that a band of Amakosah cattle stealers has been cut off or that a bark full of Malay pirates has been sunk He took it for granted that nothing had been done in Glencoe beyond what was doing in many other glens There had been a night brawl one of a hundred night brawls between the Macdonalds and the Campbells and the Campbells had knocked the Macdonalds on the head By slow degrees the whole truth came out From a letter written at Edinburgh about two months after the crime had been committed it appears that the horrible story was already current among the Jacobites of that city In the summer Argyle s regiment was quartered in the south of England and some of the men made strange confessions over their ale about what they had been forced to do in the preceding winter The nonjurors soon got hold of the clue and followed it resolutely their secret presses went to work and at length near a year after the crime had been committed it was published to the world two hundred thirty six But the world was long incredulous The habitual mendacity of the Jacobite libellers had brought on them an appropriate punishment Now when for the first time they told the truth they were supposed to be romancing They complained bitterly that the story though perfectly authentic was regarded by the public as a factious lie two hundred thirty seven So late as the year sixteen ninety five Hickes in a tract in which he endeavoured to defend his darling tale of the Theban legion against the unanswerable argument drawn from the silence of historians remarked that it might well be doubted whether any historian would make mention of the massacre of Glencoe There were in England he said many thousands of well educated men who had never heard of that massacre or who regarded it as a mere fable two hundred thirty eight Nevertheless the punishment of some of the guilty began very early Hill who indeed can hardly be called guilty was much disturbed Breadalbane hardened as he was felt the stings of conscience or the dread of retribution A few days after the Macdonalds had returned to their old dwellingplace his steward visited the ruins of the house of Glencoe and endeavoured to persuade the sons of the murdered chief to sign a paper declaring that they held the Earl guiltless of the blood which had been shed They were assured that if they would do this all His Lordship s great influence should be employed to obtain for them from the Crown a free pardon and a remission of all forfeitures two hundred thirty nine Glenlyon did his best to assume an air of unconcern He made his appearance in the most fashionable coffeehouse at Edinburgh and talked loudly and self complacently about the important service in which he had been engaged among the mountains Some of his soldiers however who observed him closely whispered that all this bravery was put on He was not the man that he had been before that night The form of his countenance was changed In all places at all hours whether he waked or slept Glencoe was for ever before him two hundred forty But whatever apprehensions might disturb Breadalbane whatever spectres might haunt Glenlyon the Master of Stair had neither fear nor remorse He was indeed mortified but he was mortified only by the blunders of Hamilton and by the escape of so many of the damnable breed Do right and fear nobody such is the language of his letters Can there be a more sacred duty than to rid the country of thieving The only thing that I regret is that any got away two hundred forty one On the sixth of March William entirely ignorant in all probability of the details of the crime which has cast a dark shade over his glory had set out for the Continent leaving the Queen his viceregent in England two hundred forty two He would perhaps have postponed his departure if he had been aware that the French Government had during some time been making great preparations for a descent on our island two hundred forty three An event had taken place which had changed the policy of the Court of Versailles Louvois was no more He had been at the head of the military administration of his country during a quarter of a century he had borne a chief part in the direction of two wars which had enlarged the French territory and had filled the world with the renown of the French arms and he had lived to see the beginning of a third war which tasked his great powers to the utmost Between him and the celebrated captains who carried his plans into execution there was little harmony His imperious temper and his confidence in himself impelled him to interfere too much with the conduct of troops in the field even when those troops were commanded by Conde by Turenne or by Luxemburg But he was the greatest Adjutant General the greatest Quartermaster General the greatest Commissary General that Europe had seen He may indeed be said to have made a revolution in the art of disciplining distributing equipping and provisioning armies In spite however of his abilities and of his services he had become odious to Lewis and to her who governed Lewis On the last occasion on which the King and the minister transacted business together the ill humour on both sides broke violently forth The servant in his vexation dashed his portfolio on the ground The master forgetting what he seldom forgot that a King should be a gentleman lifted his cane Fortunately his wife was present She with her usual prudence caught his arm She then got Louvois out of the room and exhorted him to come back the next day as if nothing had happened The next day he came but with death in his face The King though full of resentment was touched with pity and advised Louvois to go home and take care of himself That evening the great minister died two hundred forty four Louvois had constantly opposed all plans for the invasion of England His death was therefore regarded at Saint Germains as a fortunate event two hundred forty five It was however necessary to look sad and to send a gentleman to Versailles with some words of condolence The messenger found the gorgeous circle of courtiers assembled round their master on the terrace above the orangery Sir said Lewis in a tone so easy and cheerful that it filled all the bystanders with amazement present my compliments and thanks to the King and Queen of England and tell them that neither my affairs nor theirs will go on the worse by what has happened These words were doubtless meant to intimate that the influence of Louvois had not been exerted in favour of the House of Stuart two hundred forty six One compliment however a compliment which cost France dear Lewis thought it right to pay to the memory of his ablest servant The Marquess of Barbesieux son of Louvois was placed in his twenty fifth year at the head of the war department The young man was by no means deficient in abilities and had been during some years employed in business of grave importance But his passions were strong his judgment was not ripe and his sudden elevation turned his head His manners gave general disgust Old officers complained that he kept them long in his antechamber while he was amusing himself with his spaniels and his flatterers Those who were admitted to his presence went away disgusted by his rudeness and arrogance As was natural at his age he valued power chiefly as the means of procuring pleasure Millions of crowns were expended on the luxurious villa where he loved to forget the cares of office in gay conversation delicate cookery and foaming champagne He often pleaded an attack of fever as an excuse for not making his appearance at the proper hour in the royal closet when in truth he had been playing truant among his boon companions and mistresses The French King said William has an odd taste He chooses an old woman for his mistress and a young man for his minister two hundred forty seven There can be little doubt that Louvois by pursuing that course which had made him odious to the inmates of Saint Germains had deserved well of his country He was not maddened by Jacobite enthusiasm He well knew that exiles are the worst of all advisers He had excellent information he had excellent judgment he calculated the chances and he saw that a descent was likely to fail and to fail disastrously and disgracefully James might well be impatient to try the experiment though the odds should be ten to one against him He might gain and he could not lose His folly and obstinacy had left him nothing to risk His food his drink his lodging his clothes he owed to charity Nothing could be more natural than that for the very smallest chance of recovering the three kingdoms which he had thrown away he should be willing to stake what was not his own the honour of the French arms the grandeur and the safety of the French monarchy To a French statesman such a wager might well appear in a different light But Louvois was gone His master yielded to the importunity of James and determined to send an expedition against England two hundred forty eight The scheme was in some respects well concerted It was resolved that a camp should be formed on the coast of Normandy and that in this camp all the Irish regiments which were in the French service should be assembled under their countryman Sarsfield With them were to be joined about ten thousand French troops The whole army was to be commanded by Marshal Bellefonds A noble fleet of about eighty ships of the line was to convoy this force to the shores of England In the dockyards both of Brittany and of Provence immense preparations were made Four and forty men of war some of which were among the finest that had ever been built were assembled in the harbour of Brest under Tourville The Count of Estrees with thirty five more was to sail from Toulon Ushant was fixed for the place of rendezvous The very day was named In order that there might be no want either of seamen or of vessels for the intended expedition all maritime trade all privateering was for a time interdicted by a royal mandate two hundred forty nine Three hundred transports were collected near the spot where the troops were to embark It was hoped that all would be ready early in the spring before the English ships were half rigged or half manned and before a single Dutch man of war was in the Channel two hundred fifty James had indeed persuaded himself that even if the English fleet should fall in with him it would not oppose him He imagined that he was personally a favourite with the mariners of all ranks His emissaries had been busy among the naval officers and had found some who remembered him with kindness and others who were out of humour with the men now in power All the wild talk of a class of people not distinguished by taciturnity or discretion was reported to him with exaggeration till he was deluded into a belief that he had more friends than enemies on board of the vessels which guarded our coasts Yet he should have known that a rough sailor who thought himself ill used by the Admiralty might after the third bottle when drawn on by artful companions express his regret for the good old times curse the new government and curse himself for being such a fool as to fight for that government and yet might be by no means prepared to go over to the French on the day of battle Of the malecontent officers who as James believed were impatient to desert the great majority had probably given no pledge of their attachment to him except an idle word hiccoughed out when they were drunk and forgotten when they were sober One those from whom he expected support Rear Admiral Carter had indeed heard and perfectly understood what the Jacobite agents had to say had given them fair words and had reported the whole to the Queen and her ministers two hundred fifty one But the chief dependence of James was on Russell That false arrogant and wayward politician was to command the Channel Fleet He had never ceased to assure the Jacobite emissaries that he was bent on effecting a Restoration Those emissaries fully reckoned if not on his entire cooperation yet at least on his connivance and there could be no doubt that with his connivance a French fleet might easily convoy an army to our shores James flattered himself that as soon as he had landed he should be master of the island But in truth when the voyage had ended the difficulties of his enterprise would have been only beginning Two years before he had received a lesson by which he should have profited He had then deceived himself and others into the belief that the English were regretting him were pining for him were eager to rise in arms by tens of thousands to welcome him William was then as now at a distance Then as now the administration was entrusted to a woman Then as now there were few regular troops in England Torrington had then done as much to injure the government which he served as Russell could now do The French fleet had then after riding during several weeks victorious and dominant in the Channel landed some troops on the southern coast The immediate effect had been that whole counties without distinction of Tory or Whig Churchman or Dissenter had risen up as one man to repel the foreigners and that the Jacobite party which had a few days before seemed to be half the nation had crouched down in silent terror and had made itself so small that it had during some time been invisible What reason was there for believing that the multitude who had in sixteen ninety at the first lighting of the beacons snatched up firelocks pikes scythes to defend their native soil against the French would now welcome the French as allies And of the army by which James was now to be accompanied the French formed the least odious part More than half of that army was to consist of Irish Papists and the feeling compounded of hatred and scorn with which the Irish Papists had long been regarded by the English Protestants had by recent events been stimulated to a vehemence before unknown The hereditary slaves it was said had been for a moment free and that moment had sufficed to prove that they knew neither how to use nor how to defend their freedom During their short ascendency they had done nothing but slay and burn and pillage and demolish and attaint and confiscate In three years they had committed such waste on their native land as thirty years of English intelligence and industry would scarcely repair They would have maintained their independence against the world if they had been as ready to fight as they were to steal But they had retreated ignominiously from the walls of Londonderry They had fled like deer before the yeomanry of Enniskillen The Prince whom they now presumed to think that they could place by force of arms on the English throne had himself on the morning after the rout of the Boyne reproached them with their cowardice and told them that he would never again trust to their soldiership On this subject Englishmen were of one mind Tories Nonjurors even Roman Catholics were as loud as Whigs in reviling the ill fated race It is therefore not difficult to guess what effect would have been produced by the appearance on our soil of enemies whom on their own soil we had vanquished and trampled down James however in spite of the recent and severe teaching of experience believed whatever his correspondents in England told him and they told him that the whole nation was impatiently expecting him that both the West and the North were ready to rise that he would proceed from the place of landing to Whitehall with as little opposition as when in old times he returned from a progress Ferguson distinguished himself by the confidence with which he predicted a complete and bloodless victory He and his printer he was absurd enough to write would be the two first men in the realm to take horse for His Majesty Many other agents were busy up and down the country during the winter and the early part of the spring It does not appear that they had much success in the counties south of Trent But in the north particularly in Lancashire where the Roman Catholics were more numerous and more powerful than in any other part of the kingdom and where there seems to have been even among the Protestant gentry more than the ordinary proportion of bigoted Jacobites some preparations for an insurrection were made Arms were privately bought officers were appointed yeomen small farmers grooms huntsmen were induced to enlist Those who gave in their names were distributed into eight regiments of cavalry and dragoons and were directed to hold themselves in readiness to mount at the first signal two hundred fifty two One of the circumstances which filled James at this time with vain hopes was that his wife was pregnant and near her delivery He flattered himself that malice itself would be ashamed to repeat any longer the story of the warming pan and that multitudes whom that story had deceived would instantly return to their allegiance He took on this occasion all those precautions which four years before he had foolishly and perversely forborne to take He contrived to transmit to England letters summoning many Protestant women of quality to assist at the expected birth and he promised in the name of his dear brother the Most Christian King that they should be free to come and go in safety Had some of these witnesses been invited to Saint James s on the morning of the tenth of June sixteen eighty eight the House of Stuart might perhaps now be reigning in our island But it is easier to keep a crown than to regain one It might be true that a calumnious fable had done much to bring about the Revolution But it by no means followed that the most complete refutation of that fable would bring about a Restoration Not a single lady crossed the sea in obedience to James s call His Queen was safely delivered of a daughter but this event produced no perceptible effect on the state of public feeling in England two hundred fifty three Meanwhile the preparations for his expedition were going on fast He was on the point of setting out for the place of embarkation before the English government was at all aware of the danger which was impending It had been long known indeed that many thousands of Irish were assembled in Normandy but it was supposed that they had been assembled merely that they might be mustered and drilled before they were sent to Flanders Piedmont and Catalonia two hundred fifty four Now however intelligence arriving from many quarters left no doubt that an invasion would be almost immediately attempted Vigorous preparations for defence were made The equipping and manning of the ships was urged forward with vigour The regular troops were drawn together between London and the sea A great camp was formed on the down which overlooks Portsmouth The militia all over the kingdom was called out Two Westminster regiments and six City regiments making up a force of thirteen thousand fighting men were arrayed in Hyde Park and passed in review before the Queen The trainbands of Kent Sussex and Surrey marched down to the coast Watchmen were posted by the beacons Some nonjurors were imprisoned some disarmed some held to bail The house of the Earl of Huntingdon a noted Jacobite was searched He had had time to burn his papers and to hide his arms but his stables presented a most suspicious appearance Horses enough to mount a whole troop of cavalry were at the mangers and this evidence though not legally sufficient to support a charge of treason was thought sufficient at such a conjuncture to justify the Privy Council in sending him to the Tower two hundred fifty five Meanwhile James had gone down to his army which was encamped round the basin of La Hogue on the northern coast of the peninsula known by the name of the Cotentin Before he quitted Saint Germains he held a Chapter of the Garter for the purpose of admitting his son into the order Two noblemen were honoured with the same distinction Powis who among his brother exiles was now called a Duke and Melfort who had returned from Rome and was again James s Prime Minister two hundred fifty six Even at this moment when it was of the greatest importance to conciliate the members of the Church of England none but members of the Church of Rome were thought worthy of any mark of royal favour Powis indeed was an eminent member of the English aristocracy and his countrymen disliked him as little as they disliked any conspicuous Papist But Melfort was not even an Englishman he had never held office in England he had never sate in the English Parliament and he had therefore no pretensions to a dignity peculiarly English He was moreover hated by all the contending factions of all the three kingdoms Royal letters countersigned by him had been sent both to the Convention at Westminster and to the Convention at Edinburgh and both at Westminster and at Edinburgh the sight of his odious name and handwriting had made the most zealous friends of hereditary right hang down their heads in shame It seems strange that even James should have chosen at such a conjuncture to proclaim to the world that the men whom his people most abhorred were the men whom he most delighted to honour Still more injurious to his interests was the Declaration in which he announced his intentions to his subjects Of all the State papers which were put forth even by him it was the most elaborately and ostentatiously injudicious When it had disgusted and exasperated all good Englishmen of all parties the Papists at Saint Germains pretended that it had been drawn up by a stanch Protestant Edward Herbert who had been Chief Justice of the Common Pleas before the Revolution and who now bore the empty title of Chancellor two hundred fifty seven But it is certain that Herbert was never consulted about any matter of importance and that the Declaration was the work of Melfort and of Melfort alone two hundred fifty eight In truth those qualities of head and heart which had made Melfort the favourite of his master shone forth in every sentence Not a word was to be found indicating that three years of banishment had made the King wiser that he had repented of a single error that he took to himself even the smallest part of the blame of that revolution which had dethroned him or that he purposed to follow a course in any respect differing from that which had already been fatal to him All the charges which had been brought against him he pronounced to be utterly unfounded Wicked men had put forth calumnies Weak men had believed those calumnies He alone had been faultless He held out no hope that he would consent to any restriction of that vast dispensing power to which he had formerly laid claim that he would not again in defiance of the plainest statutes fill the Privy Council the bench of justice the public offices the army the navy with Papists that he would not reestablish the High Commission that he would not appoint a new set of regulators to remodel all the constituent bodies of the kingdom He did indeed condescend to say that he would maintain the legal rights of the Church of England but he had said this before and all men knew what those words meant in his mouth Instead of assuring his people of his forgiveness he menaced them with a proscription more terrible than any which our island had ever seen He published a list of persons who had no mercy to expect Among these were Ormond Caermarthen Nottingham Tillotson and Burnet After the roll of those who were doomed to death by name came a series of categories First stood all the crowd of rustics who had been rude to His Majesty when he was stopped at Sheerness in his flight These poor ignorant wretches some hundreds in number were reserved for another bloody circuit Then came all persons who had in any manner borne a part in the punishment of any Jacobite conspirator judges counsel witnesses grand jurymen petty jurymen sheriffs and undersheriffs constables and turnkeys in short all the ministers of justice from Holt down to Ketch Then vengeance was denounced against all spies and all informers who had divulged to the usurpers the designs of the Court of Saint Germains All justices of the peace who should not declare for their rightful Sovereign the moment that they heard of his landing all gaolers who should not instantly set political prisoners at liberty were to be left to the extreme rigour of the law No exception was made in favour of a justice or of a gaoler who might be within a hundred yards of one of William s regiments and a hundred miles from the nearest place where there was a single Jacobite in arms It might have been expected that James after thus denouncing vengeance against large classes of his subjects would at least have offered a general amnesty to the rest But of general amnesty he said not a word He did indeed promise that any offender who was not in any of the categories of proscription and who should by any eminent service merit indulgence should receive a special pardon But with this exception all the offenders hundreds of thousands in number were merely informed that their fate should be decided in Parliament The agents of James speedily dispersed his Declaration over every part of the kingdom and by doing so rendered a great service to William The general cry was that the banished oppressor had at least given Englishmen fair warning and that if after such a warning they welcomed him home they would have no pretence for complaining though every county town should be polluted by an assize resembling that which Jeffreys had held at Taunton That some hundreds of people the Jacobites put the number so low as five hundred were to be hanged without mercy was certain and nobody who had concurred in the Revolution nobody who had fought for the new government by sea or land no soldier who had borne a part in the conquest of Ireland no Devonshire ploughman or Cornish miner who had taken arms to defend his wife and children against Tourville could be certain that he should not be hanged How abject too how spiteful must be the nature of a man who engaged in the most momentous of all undertakings and aspiring to the noblest of all prizes could not refrain from proclaiming that he thirsted for the blood of a multitude of poor fishermen because more than three years before they had pulled him about and called him Hatchetface If at the very moment when he had the strongest motives for trying to conciliate his people by the show of clemency he could not bring himself to hold towards them any language but that of an implacable enemy what was to be expected from him when he should be again their master So savage was his nature that in a situation in which all other tyrants have resorted to blandishments and fair promises he could utter nothing but reproaches and threats The only words in his Declaration which had any show of graciousness were those in which he promised to send away the foreign troops as soon as his authority was reestablished and many said that those words when examined would be found full of sinister meaning He held out no hope that he would send away Popish troops who were his own subjects His intentions were manifest The French might go but the Irish would remain The people of England were to be kept down by these thrice subjugated barbarians No doubt a Rapparee who had run away at Newton Butler and the Boyne might find courage enough to guard the scaffolds on which his conquerors were to die and to lay waste our country as he had laid waste his own The Queen and her ministers instead of attempting to suppress James s manifesto very wisely reprinted it and sent it forth licensed by the Secretary of State and interspersed with remarks by a shrewd and severe commentator It was refuted in many keen pamphlets it was turned into doggrel rhymes and it was left undefended even by the boldest and most acrimonious libellers among the nonjurors two hundred fifty nine Indeed some of the nonjurors were so much alarmed by observing the effect which this manifesto produced that they affected to treat it as spurious and published as their master s genuine Declaration a paper full of gracious professions and promises They made him offer a free pardon to all his people with the exception of four great criminals They made him hold out hopes of great remissions of taxation They made him pledge his word that he would entrust the whole ecclesiastical administration to the nonjuring bishops But this forgery imposed on nobody and was important only as showing that even the Jacobites were ashamed of the prince whom they were labouring to restore two hundred sixty No man read the Declaration with more surprise and anger than Russell Bad as he was he was much under the influence of two feelings which though they cannot be called virtuous have some affinity to virtue and are respectable when compared with mere selfish cupidity Professional spirit and party spirit were strong in him He might be false to his country but not to his flag and even in becoming a Jacobite he had not ceased to be a Whig In truth he was a Jacobite only because he was the most intolerant and acrimonious of Whigs He thought himself and his faction ungratefully neglected by William and was for a time too much blinded by resentment to perceive that it would be mere madness in the old Roundheads the old Exclusionists to punish William by recalling James The near prospect of an invasion and the Declaration in which Englishmen were plainly told what they had to expect if that invasion should be successful produced it should seem a sudden and entire change in Russell s feelings and that change he distinctly avowed I wish he said to Lloyd to serve King James The thing might be done if it were not his own fault But he takes the wrong way with us Let him forget all the past let him grant a general pardon and then I will see what I can do for him Lloyd hinted something about the honours and rewards designed for Russell himself But the Admiral with a spirit worthy of a better man cut him short I do not wish to hear anything on that subject My solicitude is for the public And do not think that I will let the French triumph over us in our own sea Understand this that if I meet them I fight them ay though His Majesty himself should be on board This conversation was truly reported to James but it does not appear to have alarmed him He was indeed possessed with a belief that Russell even if willing would not be able to induce the officers and sailors of the English navy to fight against their old King who was also their old Admiral The hopes which James felt he and his favourite Melfort succeeded in imparting to Lewis and to Lewis s ministers two hundred sixty one But for those hopes indeed it is probable that all thoughts of invading England in the course of that year would have been laid aside For the extensive plan which had been formed in the winter had in the course of the spring been disconcerted by a succession of accidents such as are beyond the control of human wisdom The time fixed for the assembling of all the maritime forces of France at Ushant had long elapsed and not a single sail had appeared at the place of rendezvous The Atlantic squadron was still detained by bad weather in the port of Brest The Mediterranean squadron opposed by a strong west wind was vainly struggling to pass the pillars of Hercules Two fine vessels had gone to pieces on the rocks of Ceuta two hundred sixty two Meanwhile the admiralties of the allied powers had been active Before the end of April the English fleet was ready to sail Three noble ships just launched from our dockyards appeared for the first time on the water two hundred sixty three William had been hastening the maritime preparations of the United Provinces and his exertions had been successful On the twenty ninth of April a fine squadron from the Texel appeared in the Downs Soon came the North Holland squadron the Maes squadron the Zealand squadron two hundred sixty four The whole force of the confederate powers was assembled at Saint Helen s in the second week of May more than ninety sail of the line manned by between thirty and forty thousand of the finest seamen of the two great maritime nations Russell had the chief command He was assisted by Sir Ralph Delaval Sir John Ashley Sir Cloudesley Shovel Rear Admiral Carter and Rear Admiral Rooke Of the Dutch officers Van Almonde was highest in rank No mightier armament had ever appeared in the British Channel There was little reason for apprehending that such a force could be defeated in a fair conflict Nevertheless there was great uneasiness in London It was known that there was a Jacobite party in the navy Alarming rumours had worked their way round from France It was said that the enemy reckoned on the cooperation of some of those officers on whose fidelity in this crisis the safety of the State might depend Russell as far as can now be discovered was still unsuspected But others who were probably less criminal had been more indiscreet At all the coffee houses admirals and captains were mentioned by name as traitors who ought to be instantly cashiered if not shot It was even confidently affirmed that some of the guilty had been put under arrest and others turned out of the service The Queen and her counsellors were in a great strait It was not easy to say whether the danger of trusting the suspected persons or the danger of removing them were the greater Mary with many painful misgivings resolved and the event proved that she resolved wisely to treat the evil reports as calumnious to make a solemn appeal to the honour of the accused gentlemen and then to trust the safety of her kingdom to their national and professional spirit On the fifteenth of May a great assembly of officers was convoked at Saint Helen s on board the Britannia a fine three decker from which Russell s flag was flying The Admiral told them that he had received a despatch which he was charged to read to them It was from Nottingham The Queen the Secretary wrote had been informed that stories deeply affecting the character of the navy were in circulation It had even been affirmed that she had found herself under the necessity of dismissing many officers But Her Majesty was determined to believe nothing against those brave servants of the State The gentlemen who had been so foully slandered might be assured that she placed entire reliance on them This letter was admirably calculated to work on those to whom it was addressed Very few of them probably had been guilty of any worse offence than rash and angry talk over their wine They were as yet only grumblers If they had fancied that they were marked men they might in selfdefence have become traitors They became enthusiastically loyal as soon as they were assured that the Queen reposed entire confidence in their loyalty They eagerly signed an address in which they entreated her to believe that they would with the utmost resolution and alacrity venture their lives in defence of her rights of English freedom and of the Protestant religion against all foreign and Popish invaders God they added preserve your person direct your counsels and prosper your arms and let all your people say Amen two hundred sixty five The sincerity of these professions was soon brought to the test A few hours after the meeting on board of the Britannia the masts of Tourville s squadron were seen from the cliffs of Portland One messenger galloped with the news from Weymouth to London and roused Whitehall at three in the morning Another took the coast road and carried the intelligence to Russell All was ready and on the morning of the seventeenth of May the allied fleet stood out to sea two hundred sixty six Tourville had with him only his own squadron consisting of forty four ships of the line But he had received positive orders to protect the descent on England and not to decline a battle Though these orders had been given before it was known at Versailles that the Dutch and English fleets had joined he was not disposed to take on himself the responsibility of disobedience He still remembered with bitterness the reprimand which his extreme caution had drawn upon him after the fight of Beachy Head He would not again be told that he was a timid and unenterprising commander that he had no courage but the vulgar courage of a common sailor He was also persuaded that the odds against him were rather apparent than real He believed on the authority of James and Melfort that the English seamen from the flag officers down to the cabin boys were Jacobites Those who fought would fight with half a heart and there would probably be numerous desertions at the most critical moment Animated by such hopes he sailed from Brest steered first towards the north east came in sight of the coast of Dorsetshire and then struck across the Channel towards La Hogue where the army which he was to convoy to England had already begun to embark on board of the transports He was within a few leagues of Barfleur when before daybreak on the morning of the nineteenth of May he saw the great armament of the allies stretching along the eastern horizon He determined to bear down on them By eight the two lines of battle were formed but it was eleven before the firing began It soon became plain that the English from the Admiral downward were resolved to do their duty Russell had visited all his ships and exhorted all his crews If your commanders play false he said overboard with them and with myself the first There was no defection There was no slackness Carter was the first who broke the French line He was struck by a splinter of one of his own yard arms and fell dying on the deck He would not be carried below He would not let go his sword Fight the ship were his last words fight the ship as long as she can swim The battle lasted till four in the afternoon The roar of the guns was distinctly heard more than twenty miles off by the army which was encamped on the coast of Normandy During the earlier part of the day the wind was favourable to the French they were opposed to half of the allied fleet and against that half they maintained the conflict with their usual courage and with more than their usual seamanship After a hard and doubtful fight of five hours Tourville thought that enough had been done to maintain the honour of the white flag and began to draw off But by this time the wind had veered and was with the allies They were now able to avail themselves of their great superiority of force They came on fast The retreat of the French became a flight Tourville fought his own ship desperately She was named in allusion to Lewis s favourite emblem the Royal Sun and was widely renowned as the finest vessel in the world It was reported among the English sailors that she was adorned with an image of the Great King and that he appeared there as he appeared in the Place of Victories with vanquished nations in chains beneath his feet The gallant ship surrounded by enemies lay like a great fortress on the sea scattering death on every side from her hundred and four portholes She was so formidably manned that all attempts to board her failed Long after sunset she got clear of her assailants and with all her scuppers spouting blood made for the coast of Normandy She had suffered so much that Tourville hastily removed his flag to a ship of ninety guns which was named the Ambitious By this time his fleet was scattered far over the sea About twenty of his smallest ships made their escape by a road which was too perilous for any courage but the courage of despair In the double darkness of night and of a thick sea fog they ran with all their sails spread through the boiling waves and treacherous rocks of the Race of Alderney and by a strange good fortune arrived without a single disaster at Saint Maloes The pursuers did not venture to follow the fugitives into that terrible strait the place of innumerable shipwrecks two hundred sixty seven Those French vessels which were too bulky to venture into the Race of Alderney fled to the havens of the Cotentin The Royal Sun and two other three deckers reached Cherburg in safety The Ambitious with twelve other ships all first rates or second rates took refuge in the Bay of La Hogue close to the headquarters of the army of James The three ships which had fled to Cherburg were closely chased by an English squadron under the command of Delaval He found them hauled up into shoal water where no large man of war could get at them He therefore determined to attack them with his fireships and boats The service was gallantly and successfully performed In a short time the Royal Sun and her two consorts were burned to ashes Part of the crews escaped to the shore and part fell into the hands of the English two hundred sixty eight Meanwhile Russell with the greater part of his victorious fleet had blockaded the Bay of La Hogue Here as at Cherburg the French men of war had been drawn up into shallow water They lay close to the camp of the army which was destined for the invasion of England Six of them were moored under a fort named Lisset The rest lay under the guns of another fort named Saint Vaast where James had fixed his headquarters and where the Union flag variegated by the crosses of Saint George and Saint Andrew hung by the side of the white flag of France Marshal Bellefonds had planted several batteries which it was thought would deter the boldest enemy from approaching either Fort Lisset or Fort Saint Vaast James however who knew something of English seamen was not perfectly at ease and proposed to send strong bodies of soldiers on board of the ships But Tourville would not consent to put such a slur on his profession Russell meanwhile was preparing for an attack On the afternoon of the twenty third of May all was ready A flotilla consisting of sloops of fireships and of two hundred boats was entrusted to the command of Rooke The whole armament was in the highest spirits The rowers flushed by success and animated by the thought that they were going to fight under the eyes of the French and Irish troops who had been assembled for the purpose of subjugating England pulled manfully and with loud huzzas towards the six huge wooden castles which lay close to Fort Lisset The French though an eminently brave people have always been more liable to sudden panics than their phlegmatic neighbours the English and Germans On this day there was a panic both in the fleet and in the army Tourville ordered his sailors to man their boats and would have led them to encounter the enemy in the bay But his example and his exhortations were vain His boats turned round and fled in confusion The ships were abandoned The cannonade from Fort Lisset was so feeble and ill directed that it did no execution The regiments on the beach after wasting a few musket shots drew off The English boarded the men of war set them on fire and having performed this great service without the loss of a single life retreated at a late hour with the retreating tide The bay was in a blaze during the night and now and then a loud explosion announced that the flames had reached a powder room or a tier of loaded guns At eight the next morning the tide came back strong and with the tide came back Rooke and his two hundred boats The enemy made a faint attempt to defend the vessels which were near Fort Saint Vaast During a few minutes the batteries did some execution among the crews of our skiffs but the struggle was soon over The French poured fast out of their ships on one side the English poured in as fast on the other and with loud shouts turned the captured guns against the shore The batteries were speedily silenced James and Melfort Bellefonds and Tourville looked on in helpless despondency while the second conflagration proceeded The conquerors leaving the ships of war in flames made their way into an inner basin where many transports lay Eight of these vessels were set on fire Several were taken in tow The rest would have been either destroyed or carried off had not the sea again begun to ebb It was impossible to do more and the victorious flotilla slowly retired insulting the hostile camp with a thundering chant of God save the King Thus ended at noon on the twenty fourth of May the great conflict which had raged during five days over a wide extent of sea and shore One English fireship had perished in its calling Sixteen French men of war all noble vessels and eight of them three deckers had been sunk or burned down to the keel The battle is called from the place where it terminated the battle of La Hogue two hundred sixty nine The news was received in London with boundless exultation In the fight on the open sea indeed the numerical superiority of the allies had been so great that they had little reason to boast of their success But the courage and skill with which the crews of the English boats had in a French harbour in sight of a French army and under the fire of French batteries destroyed a fine French fleet amply justified the pride with which our fathers pronounced the name of La Hogue That we may fully enter into their feelings we must remember that this was the first great check that had ever been given to the arms of Lewis the Fourteenth and the first great victory that the English had gained over the French since the day of Agincourt The stain left on our fame by the shameful defeat of Beachy Head was effaced This time the glory was all our own The Dutch had indeed done their duty as they have always done it in maritime war whether fighting on our side or against us whether victorious or vanquished But the English had borne the brunt of the fight Russell who commanded in chief was an Englishman Delaval who directed the attack on Cherburg was an Englishman Rooke who led the flotilla into the Bay of La Hogue was an Englishman The only two officers of note who had fallen Admiral Carter and Captain Hastings of the Sandwich were Englishmen Yet the pleasure with which the good news was received here must not be ascribed solely or chiefly to national pride The island was safe The pleasant pastures cornfields and commons of Hampshire and Surrey would not be the seat of war The houses and gardens the kitchens and dairies the cellars and plate chests the wives and daughters of our gentry and clergy would not be at the mercy of Irish Rapparees who had sacked the dwellings and skinned the cattle of the Englishry of Leinster or of French dragoons accustomed to live at free quarters on the Protestants of Auvergne Whigs and Tories joined in thanking God for this great deliverance and the most respectable nonjurors could not but be glad at heart that the rightful King was not to be brought back by an army of foreigners The public joy was therefore all but universal During several days the bells of London pealed without ceasing Flags were flying on all the steeples Rows of candles were in all the windows Bonfires were at all the corners of the streets two hundred seventy The sense which the government entertained of the services of the navy was promptly judiciously and gracefully manifested Sidney and Portland were sent to meet the fleet at Portsmouth and were accompanied by Rochester as the representative of the Tories The three Lords took down with them thirty seven thousand pounds in coin which they were to distribute as a donative among the sailors two hundred seventy one Gold medals were given to the officers two hundred seventy two The remains of Hastings and Carter were brought on shore with every mark of honour Carter was buried at Portsmouth with a great display of military pomp two hundred seventy three The corpse of Hastings was brought up to London and laid with unusual solemnity under the pavement of Saint James s Church The footguards with reversed arms escorted the hearse Four royal state carriages each drawn by six horses were in the procession a crowd of men of quality in mourning cloaks filled the pews and the Bishop of Lincoln preached the funeral sermon two hundred seventy four While such marks of respect were paid to the slain the wounded were not neglected Fifty surgeons plentifully supplied with instruments bandages and drugs were sent down in all haste from London to Portsmouth two hundred seventy five It is not easy for us to form a notion of the difficulty which there then was in providing at short notice commodious shelter and skilful attendance for hundreds of maimed and lacerated men At present every county every large town can boast of some spacious palace in which the poorest labourer who has fractured a limb may find an excellent bed an able medical attendant a careful nurse medicines of the best quality and nourishment such as an invalid requires But there was not then in the whole realm a single infirmary supported by voluntary contribution Even in the capital the only edifices open to the wounded were the two ancient hospitals of Saint Thomas and Saint Bartholomew The Queen gave orders that in both these hospitals arrangements should be made at the public charge for the reception of patients from the fleet two hundred seventy six At the same time it was announced that a noble and lasting memorial of the gratitude which England felt for the courage and patriotism of her sailors would soon rise on a site eminently appropriate Among the suburban residences of our kings that which stood at Greenwich had long held a distinguished place Charles the Second liked the situation and determined to rebuild the house and to improve the gardens Soon after his Restoration he began to erect on a spot almost washed by the Thames at high tide a mansion of vast extent and cost Behind the palace were planted long avenues of trees which when William reigned were scarcely more than saplings but which have now covered with their massy shade the summer rambles of several generations On the slope which has long been the scene of the holiday sports of the Londoners were constructed flights of terraces of which the vestiges may still be discerned The Queen now publicly declared in her husband s name that the building commenced by Charles should be completed and should be a retreat for seamen disabled in the service of their country two hundred seventy seven One of the happiest effects produced by the good news was the calming of the public mind During about a month the nation had been hourly expecting an invasion and a rising and had consequently been in an irritable and suspicious mood In many parts of England a nonjuror could not show himself without great risk of being insulted A report that arms were hidden in a house sufficed to bring a furious mob to the door The mansion of one Jacobite gentleman in Kent had been attacked and after a fight in which several shots were fired had been stormed and pulled down two hundred seventy eight Yet such riots were by no means the worst symptoms of the fever which had inflamed the whole society The exposure of Fuller in February had as it seemed put an end to the practices of that vile tribe of which Oates was the patriarch During some weeks indeed the world was disposed to be unreasonably incredulous about plots But in April there was a reaction The French and Irish were coming There was but too much reason to believe that there were traitors in the island Whoever pretended that he could point out those traitors was sure to be heard with attention and there was not wanting a false witness to avail himself of the golden opportunity This false witness was named Robert Young His history was in his own lifetime so fully investigated and so much of his correspondence has been preserved that the whole man is before us His character is indeed a curious study His birthplace was a subject of dispute among three nations The English pronounced him Irish The Irish not being ambitious of the honour of having him for a countryman affirmed that he was born in Scotland Wherever he may have been born it is impossible to doubt where he was bred for his phraseology is precisely that of the Teagues who were in his time favourite characters on our stage He called himself a priest of the Established Church but he was in truth only a deacon and his deacon s orders he had obtained by producing forged certificates of his learning and moral character Long before the Revolution he held curacies in various parts of Ireland but he did not remain many days in any spot He was driven from one place by the scandal which was the effect of his lawless amours He rode away from another place on a borrowed horse which he never returned He settled in a third parish and was taken up for bigamy Some letters which he wrote on this occasion from the gaol of Cavan have been preserved He assured each of his wives with the most frightful imprecations that she alone was the object of his love and he thus succeeded in inducing one of them to support him in prison and the other to save his life by forswearing herself at the assizes The only specimens which remain to us of his method of imparting religious instruction are to be found in these epistles He compares himself to David the man after God s own heart who had been guilty both of adultery and murder He declares that he repents he prays for the forgiveness of the Almighty and then intreats his dear honey for Christ s sake to perjure herself Having narrowly escaped the gallows he wandered during several years about Ireland and England begging stealing cheating personating forging and lay in many prisons under many names In sixteen eighty four he was convicted at Bury of having fraudulently counterfeited Sancroft s signature and was sentenced to the pillory and to imprisonment From his dungeon he wrote to implore the Primate s mercy The letter may still be read with all the original bad grammar and bad spelling two hundred seventy nine The writer acknowledged his guilt wished that his eyes were a fountain of water declared that he should never know peace till he had received episcopal absolution and professed a mortal hatred of Dissenters As all this contrition and all this orthodoxy produced no effect the penitent after swearing bitterly to be revenged on Sancroft betook himself to another device The Western Insurrection had just broken out The magistrates all over the country were but too ready to listen to any accusation that might be brought against Whigs and Nonconformists Young declared on oath that to his knowledge a design had been formed in Suffolk against the life of King James and named a peer several gentlemen and ten Presbyterian ministers as parties to the plot Some of the accused were brought to trial and Young appeared in the witness box but the story which he told was proved by overwhelming evidence to be false Soon after the Revolution he was again convicted of forgery pilloried for the fourth or fifth time and sent to Newgate While he lay there he determined to try whether he should be more fortunate as an accuser of Jacobites than he had been as an accuser of Puritans He first addressed himself to Tillotson There was a horrible plot against their Majesties a plot as deep as hell and some of the first men in England were concerned in it Tillotson though he placed little confidence in information coming from such a source thought that the oath which he had taken as a Privy Councillor made it his duty to mention the subject to William William after his fashion treated the matter very lightly I am confident he said that this is a villany and I will have nobody disturbed on such grounds After this rebuff Young remained some time quiet But when William was on the Continent and when the nation was agitated by the apprehension of a French invasion and of a Jacobite insurrection a false accuser might hope to obtain a favourable audience The mere oath of a man who was well known to the turnkeys of twenty gaols was not likely to injure any body But Young was master of a weapon which is of all weapons the most formidable to innocence He had lived during some years by counterfeiting hands and had at length attained such consummate skill in that bad art that even experienced clerks who were conversant with manuscript could scarcely after the most minute comparison discover any difference between his imitations and the originals He had succeeded in making a collection of papers written by men of note who were suspected of disaffection Some autographs he had stolen and some he had obtained by writing in feigned names to ask after the characters of servants or curates He now drew up a paper purporting to be an Association for the Restoration of the banished King This document set forth that the subscribers bound themselves in the presence of God to take arms for His Majesty and to seize on the Prince of Orange dead or alive To the Association Young appended the names of Marlborough of Cornbury of Salisbury of Sancroft and of Sprat Bishop of Rochester and Dean of Westminster The next thing to be done was to put the paper into some hiding place in the house of one of the persons whose signatures had been counterfeited As Young could not quit Newgate he was forced to employ a subordinate agent for this purpose He selected a wretch named Blackhead who had formerly been convicted of perjury and sentenced to have his ears clipped The selection was not happy for Blackhead had none of the qualities which the trade of a false witness requires except wickedness There was nothing plausible about him His voice was harsh Treachery was written in all the lines of his yellow face He had no invention no presence of mind and could do little more than repeat by rote the lies taught him by others This man instructed by his accomplice repaired to Sprat s palace at Bromley introduced himself there as the confidential servant of an imaginary Doctor of Divinity delivered to the Bishop on bended knee a letter ingeniously manufactured by Young and received with the semblance of profound reverence the episcopal benediction The servants made the stranger welcome He was taken to the cellar drank their master s health and entreated them to let him see the house They could not venture to show any of the private apartments Blackhead therefore after begging importunately but in vain to be suffered to have one look at the study was forced to content himself with dropping the Association into a flowerpot which stood in a parlour near the kitchen Every thing having been thus prepared Young informed the ministers that he could tell them something of the highest importance to the welfare of the State and earnestly begged to be heard His request reached them on perhaps the most anxious day of an anxious month Tourville had just stood out to sea The army of James was embarking London was agitated by reports about the disaffection of the naval officers The Queen was deliberating whether she should cashier those who were suspected or try the effect of an appeal to their honour and patriotism At such a moment the ministers could not refuse to listen to any person who professed himself able to give them valuable information Young and his accomplice were brought before the Privy Council They there accused Marlborough Cornbury Salisbury Sancroft and Sprat of high treason These great men Young said had invited James to invade England and had promised to join him The eloquent and ingenious Bishop of Rochester had undertaken to draw up a Declaration which would inflame the nation against the government of King William The conspirators were bound together by a written instrument That instrument signed by their own hands would be found at Bromley if careful search was made Young particularly requested that the messengers might be ordered to examine the Bishop s flowerpots The ministers were seriously alarmed The story was circumstantial and part of it was probable Marlborough s dealings with Saint Germains were well known to Caermarthen to Nottingham and to Sidney Cornbury was a tool of Marlborough and was the son of a nonjuror and of a notorious plotter Salisbury was a Papist Sancroft had not many months before been with too much show of reason suspected of inviting the French to invade England Of all the accused persons Sprat was the most unlikely to be concerned in any hazardous design He had neither enthusiasm nor constancy Both his ambition and his party spirit had always been effectually kept in order by his love of ease and his anxiety for his own safety He had been guilty of some criminal compliances in the hope of gaining the favour of James had sate in the High Commission had concurred in several iniquitous decrees pronounced by that court and had with trembling hands and faltering voice read the Declaration of Indulgence in the choir of the Abbey But there he had stopped As soon as it began to be whispered that the civil and religious constitution of England would speedily be vindicated by extraordinary means he had resigned the powers which he had during two years exercised in defiance of law and had hastened to make his peace with his clerical brethren He had in the Convention voted for a Regency but he had taken the oaths without hesitation he had borne a conspicuous part in the coronation of the new Sovereigns and by his skilful hand had been added to the Form of Prayer used on the fifth of November those sentences in which the Church expresses her gratitude for the second great deliverance wrought on that day two hundred eighty Such a man possessed of a plentiful income of a seat in the House of Lords of one agreeable house among the elms of Bromley and of another in the cloisters of Westminster was very unlikely to run the risk of martyrdom He was not indeed on perfectly good terms with the government For the feeling which next to solicitude for his own comfort and repose seems to have had the greatest influence on his public conduct was his dislike of the Puritans a dislike which sprang not from bigotry but from Epicureanism Their austerity was a reproach to his slothful and luxurious life their phraseology shocked his fastidious taste and where they were concerned his ordinary good nature forsook him Loathing the nonconformists as he did he was not likely to be very zealous for a prince whom the nonconformists regarded as their protector But Sprat s faults afforded ample security that he would never from spleen against William engage in any plot to bring back James Why Young should have assigned the most perilous part in an enterprise full of peril to a man singularly pliant cautious and selfindulgent it is difficult to say The first step which the ministers took was to send Marlborough to the Tower He was by far the most formidable of all the accused persons and that he had held a traitorous correspondence with Saint Germains was a fact which whether Young were perjured or not the Queen and her chief advisers knew to be true One of the Clerks of the Council and several messengers were sent down to Bromley with a warrant from Nottingham Sprat was taken into custody All the apartments in which it could reasonably be supposed that he would have hidden an important document were searched the library the diningroom the drawingroom the bedchamber and the adjacent closets His papers were strictly examined Much food prose was found and probably some bad verse but no treason The messengers pried into every flowerpot that they could find but to no purpose It never occurred to them to look into the room in which Blackhead had hidden the Association for that room was near the offices occupied by the servants and was little used by the Bishop and his family The officers returned to London with their prisoner but without the document which if it had been found might have been fatal to him Late at night he was brought to Westminster and was suffered to sleep at his deanery All his bookcases and drawers were examined and sentinels were posted at the door of his bedchamber but with strict orders to behave civilly and not to disturb the family On the following day he was brought before the Council The examination was conducted by Nottingham with great humanity and courtesy The Bishop conscious of entire innocence behaved with temper and firmness He made no complaints I submit he said to the necessities of State in such a time of jealousy and danger as this He was asked whether he had drawn up a Declaration for King James whether he had held any correspondence with France whether he had signed any treasonable association and whether he knew of any such association To all these questions he with perfect truth answered in the negative on the word of a Christian and a Bishop He was taken back to his deanery He remained there in easy confinement during ten days and then as nothing tending to criminate him had been discovered was suffered to return to Bromley Meanwhile the false accusers had been devising a new scheme Blackhead paid another visit to Bromley and contrived to take the forged Association out of the place in which he had hid it and to bring it back to Young One of Young s two wives then carried it to the Secretary s Office and told a lie invented by her husband to explain how a paper of such importance had come into her hands But it was not now so easy to frighten the ministers as it had been a few days before The battle of La Hogue had put an end to all apprehensions of invasion Nottingham therefore instead of sending down a warrant to Bromley merely wrote to beg that Sprat would call on him at Whitehall The summons was promptly obeyed and the accused prelate was brought face to face with Blackhead before the Council Then the truth came out fast The Bishop remembered the villanous look and voice of the man who had knelt to ask the episcopal blessing The Bishop s secretary confirmed his master s assertions The false witness soon lost his presence of mind His cheeks always sallow grew frightfully livid His voice generally loud and coarse sank into a whisper The Privy Councillors saw his confusion and crossexamined him sharply For a time he answered their questions by repeatedly stammering out his original lie in the original words At last he found that he had no way of extricating himself but by owning his guilt He acknowledged that he had given an untrue account of his visit to Bromley and after much prevarication he related how he had hidden the Association and how he had removed it from its hiding place and confessed that he had been set on by Young The two accomplices were then confronted Young with unabashed forehead denied every thing He knew nothing about the flowerpots If so cried Nottingham and Sidney together why did you give such particular directions that the flowerpots at Bromley should be searched I never gave any directions about the flowerpots said Young Then the whole board broke forth How dare you say so We all remember it Still the knave stood up erect and exclaimed with an impudence which Oates might have envied This hiding is all a trick got up between the Bishop and Blackhead The Bishop has taken Blackhead off and they are both trying to stifle the plot This was too much There was a smile and a lifting up of hands all round the board Man cried Caermarthen wouldst thou have us believe that the Bishop contrived to have this paper put where it was ten to one that our messengers had found it and where if they had found it it might have hanged him The false accusers were removed in custody The Bishop after warmly thanking the ministers for their fair and honourable conduct took his leave of them In the antechamber he found a crowd of people staring at Young while Young sate enduring the stare with the serene fortitude of a man who had looked down on far greater multitudes from half the pillories in England Young said Sprat your conscience must tell you that you have cruelly wronged me For your own sake I am sorry that you persist in denying what your associate has confessed Confessed cried Young no all is not confessed yet and that you shall find to your sorrow There is such a thing as impeachment my Lord When Parliament sits you shall hear more of me God give you repentance answered the Bishop For depend upon it you are in much more danger of being damned than I of being impeached two hundred eighty one Forty eight hours after the detection of this execrable fraud Marlborough was admitted to bail Young and Blackhead had done him an inestimable service That he was concerned in a plot quite as criminal as that which they had falsely imputed to him and that the government was to possession of moral proofs of his guilt is now certain But his contemporaries had not as we have the evidence of his perfidy before them They knew that he had been accused of an offence of which he was innocent that perjury and forgery had been employed to ruin him and that in consequence of these machinations he had passed some weeks in the Tower There was in the public mind a very natural confusion between his disgrace and his imprisonment He had been imprisoned without sufficient cause Might it not in the absence of all information be reasonably presumed that he had been disgraced without sufficient cause It was certain that a vile calumny destitute of all foundation had caused him to be treated as a criminal in May Was it not probable then that calumny might have deprived him of his master s favour in January Young s resources were not yet exhausted As soon as he had been carried back from Whitehall to Newgate he set himself to construct a new plot and to find a new accomplice He addressed himself to a man named Holland who was in the lowest state of poverty Never said Young was there such a golden opportunity A bold shrewd fellow might easily earn five hundred pounds To Holland five hundred pounds seemed fabulous wealth What he asked was he to do for it Nothing he was told but to speak the truth that was to say substantial truth a little disguised and coloured There really was a plot and this would have been proved if Blackhead had not been bought off His desertion had made it necessary to call in the help of fiction You must swear that you and I were in a back room upstairs at the Lobster in Southwark Some men came to meet us there They gave a password before they were admitted They were all in white camlet cloaks They signed the Association in our presence Then they paid each his shilling and went away And you must be ready to identify my Lord Marlborough and the Bishop of Rochester as two of these men How can I identify them said Holland I never saw them You must contrive to see them answered the tempter as soon as you can The Bishop will be at the Abbey Anybody about the Court will point out my Lord Marlborough Holland immediately went to Whitehall and repeated this conversation to Nottingham The unlucky imitator of Oates was prosecuted by order of the government for perjury subornation of perjury and forgery He was convicted and imprisoned was again set in the pillory and underwent in addition to the exposure about which he cared little such a pelting as had seldom been known two hundred eighty two After his punishment he was during some years lost in the crowd of pilferers ringdroppers and sharpers who infested the capital At length in the year seventeen hundred he emerged from his obscurity and excited a momentary interest The newspapers announced that Robert Young Clerk once so famous had been taken up for coining then that he had been found guilty then that the dead warrant had come down and finally that the reverend gentleman had been hanged at Tyburn and had

make his arrangements for the approaching campaign two hundred eighty four The prospect which lay before him was gloomy The coalition of which he was the author and the chief had 
6512-72577-0000	train-other-500	during some months been in constant danger of dissolution By what strenuous exertions by what ingenious expedients by what blandishments by what bribes he succeeded in preventing his allies
6512-72577-0001	train-other-500	from throwing themselves one by one at the feet of France can be but imperfectly known The fullest and most authentic record of the labours and sacrifices by which he kept together during eight years
6512-72577-0002	train-other-500	a crowd of fainthearted and treacherous potentates negligent of the common interest and jealous of each other is to be found in his correspondence with Heinsius In that correspondence William is all himself
6512-72577-0003	train-other-500	He had in the course of his eventful life to sustain some high parts for which he was not eminently qualified and in those parts his success was imperfect As Sovereign of England he showed abilities and virtues
6512-72577-0004	train-other-500	which entitle him to honourable mention in history but his deficiencies were great He was to the last a stranger amongst us cold reserved never in good spirits never at his ease His kingdom
6512-72577-0005	train-other-500	was a place of exile His finest palaces were prisons He was always counting the days which must elapse before he should again see the land of his birth the clipped trees
6512-72577-0006	train-other-500	the wings of the innumerable windmills the nests of the storks on the tall gables and the long lines of painted villas reflected in the sleeping canals He took no pains to hide the preference which he felt for his native soil
6512-72577-0007	train-other-500	and for his early friends and therefore though he rendered great services to our country he did not reign in our hearts As a general in the field again he showed rare courage and capacity but from whatever cause
6512-72577-0008	train-other-500	he was as a tactician inferior to some of his contemporaries who in general powers of mind were far inferior to him The business for which he was preeminently fitted was diplomacy
6512-72577-0009	train-other-500	in the highest sense of the word It may be doubted whether he has ever had a superior in the art of conducting those great negotiations on which the welfare of the commonwealth of nations depends
6512-72577-0010	train-other-500	His skill in this department of politics was never more severely tasked or more signally proved than during the latter part of sixteen ninety one and the earlier part of sixteen ninety two
6512-72577-0011	train-other-500	One of his chief difficulties was caused by the sullen and menacing demeanour of the Northern powers Denmark and Sweden had at one time seemed disposed to join the coalition
none	none	 but they had early become cold 
6512-72577-0012	train-other-500	and were fast becoming hostile From France they flattered themselves that they had little to fear It was not very probable that her armies would cross the Elbe or that her fleets would force a passage through the Sound
none	none	 But the naval strength of England and Holland united might well excite apprehension at Stockholm and Copenhagen Soon arose vexatious questions of maritime right 
6512-72577-0013	train-other-500	questions such as in almost every extensive war of modern times have arisen between belligerents and neutrals The Scandinavian princes complained that the legitimate trade between the Baltic and France was tyrannically
6512-72577-0014	train-other-500	interrupted Though they had not in general been on very friendly terms with each other they began to draw close together
none	none	 intrigued at every petty German court and tried to form what William called a Third Party in Europe The King of Sweden who as Duke of Pomerania was bound to send three thousand men for the defence of the Empire sent instead of them his advice that the allies would make peace on the best terms which they could get two hundred eighty five The King of Denmark seized a great number of Dutch merchantships and collected in Holstein an army which caused no small uneasiness to his neighbours I fear William wrote in an hour of deep dejection 
6512-72577-0015	train-other-500	to Heinsius I fear that the object of this Third Party is a peace which will bring in its train the slavery of Europe The day will come when Sweden and her confederates will know too late how great an error they have committed
none	none	 They are farther no doubt than we from the danger and therefore it is that they are thus bent on working our ruin and their own That France will now consent to reasonable terms is not to be expected and it were better to fall sword in hand than to submit to whatever she may dictate two hundred eighty six While the King was thus disquieted by the conduct of the Northern powers ominous signs began to appear in a very different quarter It had from the first been no easy matter to induce sovereigns who hated and who in their own dominions persecuted the Protestant religion to countenance the revolution which had saved that religion from a great peril But happily the example and the authority of the Vatican 
6512-72577-0016	train-other-500	had overcome their scruples Innocent the Eleventh and Alexander the Eighth had regarded William with ill concealed partiality He was not indeed their friend but he was their enemy s enemy and James had been
6512-72577-0017	train-other-500	and if restored must again be their enemy s vassal To the heretic nephew therefore they gave their effective support to the orthodox uncle only compliments and benedictions But Alexander the Eighth
6512-72577-0018	train-other-500	had occupied the papal throne little more than fifteen months His successor Antonio Pignatelli who took the name of Innocent the Twelfth was impatient to be reconciled to Lewis
6512-72577-0019	train-other-500	Lewis was now sensible that he had committed a great error when he had roused against himself at once the spirit of Protestantism and the spirit of Popery He permitted the French Bishops to submit themselves to the Holy See
6512-72577-0020	train-other-500	The dispute which had at one time seemed likely to end in a great Gallican schism was accommodated and there was reason to believe that the influence of the head of the Church would be exerted for the purpose of severing the ties
6512-72577-0021	train-other-500	which bound so many Catholic princes to the Calvinist who had usurped the British throne Meanwhile the coalition which the Third Party on one side and the Pope on the other were trying to dissolve was in no
6512-72577-0022	train-other-500	small danger of falling to pieces from mere rottenness Two of the allied powers and two only were hearty in the common cause England drawing after her the other British kingdoms and Holland
6512-72577-0023	train-other-500	drawing after her the other Batavian commonwealths England and Holland were indeed torn by internal factions and were separated from each other by mutual jealousies and antipathies but both were fully resolved not to submit
6512-72577-0024	train-other-500	to French domination and both were ready to bear their share and more than their share of the charges of the contest
none	none	 Most of the members of the confederacy were not nations 
6512-72577-0025	train-other-500	but men an Emperor a King Electors Dukes and of these men there was scarcely one whose whole soul was in the struggle scarcely one who did not hang back who did not find some excuse
6512-72577-0026	train-other-500	for omitting to fulfil his engagements who did not expect to be hired to defend his own rights and interests against the common enemy But the war was the war of the people of England and of the people of Holland Had it not been so
6512-72577-0027	train-other-500	the burdens which it made necessary would not have been borne by either England or Holland during a single year When William said that he would rather die sword in hand than humble himself before France
6512-72577-0028	train-other-500	he expressed what was felt not by himself alone but by two great communities of which he was the first magistrate With those two communities unhappily other states had little sympathy Indeed
6512-72577-0029	train-other-500	those two communities were regarded by other states as rich plaindealing generous dupes are regarded by needy sharpers England and Holland were wealthy and they were zealous Their wealth excited the cupidity of the whole alliance and to that wealth
6512-72577-0030	train-other-500	their zeal was the key They were persecuted with sordid importunity by all their confederates from Caesar who in the pride of his solitary dignity would not honour King William with the title of Majesty
6512-72577-0031	train-other-500	down to the smallest Margrave who could see his whole principality from the cracked windows of the mean and ruinous old house which he called his palace It was not enough that England and Holland furnished much more than their contingents
6512-72577-0032	train-other-500	to the war by land and bore unassisted the whole charge of the war by sea They were beset by a crowd of illustrious mendicants some rude some obsequious but all indefatigable and insatiable
6512-72577-0033	train-other-500	One prince came mumping to them annually with a lamentable story about his distresses A more sturdy beggar threatened to join the Third Party and to make a separate peace with France if his demands were not granted
none	none	 Every Sovereign too had his ministers and favourites and these ministers and favourites were perpetually hinting that France was willing to pay them for detaching their masters from the coalition and that it would be prudent in England and Holland to outbid France Yet the embarrassment caused by the rapacity of the allied courts was scarcely greater than the embarrassment caused by their ambition and their pride This prince had set his heart on some childish distinction a title or a cross and would do nothing for the common cause till his wishes were accomplished That prince chose to fancy that he had been slighted and would not stir till reparation had been made to him The Duke of Brunswick Lunenburg would not furnish a battalion for the defence of Germany unless he was made an Elector two hundred eighty seven The Elector of Brandenburg declared that he was as hostile 
6512-72577-0034	train-other-500	as he had ever been to France but he had been ill used by the Spanish government and he therefore would not suffer his soldiers
none	none	 to be employed in the defence of the Spanish Netherlands He was willing to bear his share of the war but it must be in his own way he must have the command of a distinct army and he must be stationed between the Rhine and the Meuse two hundred eighty eight The Elector of Saxony complained that bad winter quarters had been assigned to his troops he therefore recalled them just when they should have been preparing to take the field but very coolly offered to send them back if England and Holland would give him four hundred thousand rixdollars two hundred eighty nine It might have been expected that at least the two chiefs of the House of Austria would have put forth at this conjuncture all their strength against the rival House of Bourbon Unfortunately they could not be induced to exert themselves vigorously even for their own preservation They were deeply interested in keeping the French out of Italy 
6512-72577-0035	train-other-500	Yet they could with difficulty be prevailed upon to lend the smallest assistance to the Duke of Savoy They seemed to think it the business of England and Holland to defend the passes of the Alps
none	none	 and to prevent the armies of Lewis from overflowing Lombardy To the Emperor indeed the war against France was a secondary object His first object was the war against Turkey He was dull and bigoted His mind misgave him that the war against 
6512-72577-0036	train-other-500	France was in some sense a war against the Catholic religion and the war against Turkey was a crusade His recent campaign on the Danube had been successful He might easily have concluded an honourable peace with the Porte
6512-72577-0037	train-other-500	and have turned his arms westward But he had conceived the hope that he might extend his hereditary dominions at the expense of the Infidels Visions of a triumphant entry into Constantinople and of a Te Deum in Saint Sophia s
6512-72577-0038	train-other-500	had risen in his brain He not only employed in the East a force more than sufficient to have defended Piedmont and reconquered Loraine but he seemed to think that England and Holland were bound to reward him largely for neglecting their interests
none	none	 and pursuing his own two hundred ninety Spain already was what she continued to be down to our own time Of the Spain which had domineered over the land and the ocean over the Old and the New World of the Spain which had in the short space of twelve years led captive a Pope and a King of France a Sovereign of Mexico 
6512-72577-0039	train-other-500	and a Sovereign of Peru of the Spain which had sent an army to the walls of Paris and had equipped a mighty fleet to invade England nothing remained but an arrogance which had once excited terror and hatred
none	none	 but which could now excite only derision 
6512-72577-0040	train-other-500	In extent indeed the dominions of the Catholic King exceeded those of Rome when Rome was at the zenith of power But the huge mass lay torpid and helpless and could be insulted or despoiled with impunity
6512-72577-0041	train-other-500	The whole administration military and naval financial and colonial was utterly disorganized Charles was a fit representative of his kingdom
none	none	 impotent physically intellectually and morally sunk in ignorance listlessness and superstition yet swollen with a notion of his own dignity and quick to imagine and to resent affronts So wretched had his education been that when he was told of the fall of Mons the most important fortress in his vast empire he asked whether Mons was in England two hundred ninety one Among the ministers who were raised up and pulled down by his sickly caprice was none capable of applying a remedy to the distempers of the State In truth to brace anew the nerves of that paralysed body would have been a hard task even for Ximenes No servant of the Spanish Crown occupied a more important post and none was more unfit for an important post than the Marquess of Gastanaga He was Governor of the Netherlands 
6512-72577-0042	train-other-500	and in the Netherlands it seemed probable that the fate of Christendom would be decided He had discharged his trust as every public trust was then discharged in every part of that vast monarchy
none	none	 on which it was boastfully said that the sun never set Fertile and rich as was the country which he ruled 
6512-72577-0043	train-other-500	he threw on England and Holland the whole charge of defending it
none	none	 He expected that arms ammunition waggons provisions every thing 
6512-72577-0044	train-other-500	would be furnished by the heretics It had never occurred to him that it was his business and not theirs to put Mons in a condition to stand a siege The public voice loudly accused him of having sold that celebrated stronghold to France
none	none	 But it is probable that he was guilty of nothing worse than the haughty apathy and sluggishness characteristic of his nation Such was the state of the coalition of which William was the head 
6512-72577-0045	train-other-500	There were moments when he felt himself overwhelmed when his spirits sank when his patience was wearied out and when his constitutional irritability broke forth I cannot he wrote offer a suggestion without being met
none	none	 by a demand for a subsidy two hundred ninety two I have refused point blank he wrote on another occasion 
6512-72577-0046	train-other-500	when he had been importuned for money it is impossible that the States General and England can bear the charge of the army on the Rhine of the army in Piedmont and of the whole defence of Flanders to say nothing of the immense cost of the naval war
6512-72577-0047	train-other-500	If our allies can do nothing for themselves
none	none	 the sooner the alliance goes to pieces the better two hundred ninety three But after every short fit of despondency and ill humour he called up all the force of his mind 
6512-72577-0048	train-other-500	and put a strong curb on his temper Weak mean false selfish as too many of the confederates were it was only by their help that he could accomplish what he had from his youth up considered as his mission If they abandoned him
6512-72577-0049	train-other-500	France would be dominant without a rival in Europe Well as they deserved to be punished he would not to punish them acquiesce in the subjugation of the whole civilised world He set himself therefore to surmount
none	none	 some difficulties and to evade others The Scandinavian powers he conciliated by waiving reluctantly indeed and not without a hard internal struggle some of his maritime rights two hundred ninety four At Rome his influence though indirectly exercised balanced that of the Pope himself Lewis and James found that they had not a friend at the Vatican except Innocent 
6512-72577-0050	train-other-500	and Innocent whose nature was gentle and irresolute shrank from taking a course directly opposed to the sentiments of all who surrounded him In private conversations with Jacobite agents he declared himself devoted
6512-72577-0051	train-other-500	to the interests of the House of Stuart but in his public acts he observed a strict neutrality He sent twenty thousand crowns to Saint Germains but he excused himself
none	none	 to the enemies of France by protesting that this was not a subsidy for any political purpose 
6512-72577-0052	train-other-500	but merely an alms to be distributed among poor British Catholics He permitted prayers for the good cause to be read in the English College at Rome
none	none	 but he insisted that those prayers should be drawn up in general terms 
6512-72577-0053	train-other-500	and that no name should be mentioned
none	none	 It was in vain that the ministers of the Houses of Stuart and Bourbon 
6512-72577-0054	train-other-500	adjured him to take a more decided course God knows he exclaimed on one occasion that I would gladly shed my blood to restore the King of England But what can I do If I stir I am told that I am favouring the French
none	none	 and helping them to set up an universal monarchy 
6512-72577-0055	train-other-500	I am not like the old Popes Kings will not listen to me as they listened to my predecessors There is no religion now nothing but wicked worldly policy
none	none	 The Prince of Orange is master He governs us all He has got such a hold on the Emperor and on the King of Spain that neither of them dares to displease him God help us He alone can help us And as the old man spoke he beat the table with his hand in an agony of impotent grief and indignation two hundred ninety five To keep the German princes steady was no easy task but it was accomplished Money was distributed among them much less indeed than they asked but much more than they had any decent pretence for asking With the Elector of Saxony a composition was made He had together with a strong appetite for subsidies a great desire to be a member of the most select and illustrious orders of knighthood It seems that instead of the four hundred thousand rixdollars which he had demanded he consented to accept one hundred thousand and the Garter two hundred ninety six His prime minister Schoening the most covetous and perfidious of mankind was secured by a pension two hundred ninety seven For the Duke of Brunswick Lunenburg William not without difficulty procured the long desired title of Elector of Hanover By such means as these the breaches which had divided the coalition were so skilfully repaired that it appeared still to present a firm front to the enemy William had complained bitterly to the Spanish government of the incapacity and inertness of Gastanaga The Spanish government helpless and drowsy as it was could not be altogether insensible to the dangers which threatened Flanders and Brabant Gastanaga was recalled and William was invited to take upon himself the government of the Low Countries with powers not less than regal Philip the Second would not easily have believed that within a century after his death his greatgrandson would implore the greatgrandson of William the Silent to exercise the authority of a sovereign at Brussels two hundred ninety eight The offer was in one sense tempting but William was too wise to accept it He knew that the population of the Spanish Netherlands was firmly attached to the Church of Rome Every act of a Protestant ruler was certain to be regarded with suspicion by the clergy and people of those countries Already Gastanaga mortified by his disgrace had written to inform the Court of Rome that changes were in contemplation which would make Ghent and Antwerp as heretical as Amsterdam and London two hundred ninety nine It had doubtless also occurred to William that if by governing mildly and justly and by showing a decent respect for the ceremonies and the ministers of the Roman Catholic religion he should succeed in obtaining the confidence of the Belgians he would inevitably raise against himself a storm of obloquy in our island He knew by experience what it was to govern two nations strongly attached to two different Churches A large party among the Episcopalians of England could not forgive him for having consented to the establishment of the presbyterian polity in Scotland A large party among the Presbyterians of Scotland blamed him for maintaining the episcopal polity in England If he now took under his protection masses processions graven images friaries nunneries and worst of all Jesuit pulpits Jesuit confessionals and Jesuit colleges what could he expect but that England and Scotland would join in one cry of reprobation He therefore refused to accept the government of the Low Countries and proposed that it should be entrusted to the Elector of Bavaria The Elector of Bavaria was after the Emperor the most powerful of the Roman Catholic potentates of Germany He was young brave and ambitious of military distinction The Spanish Court was willing to appoint him and he was desirous to be appointed but much delay was caused by an absurd difficulty The Elector thought it beneath him to ask for what he wished to have The formalists of the Cabinet of Madrid thought it beneath the dignity of the Catholic King to give what had not been asked Mediation was necessary and was at last successful But much time was lost and the spring was far advanced before the new Governor of the Netherlands entered on his functions three hundred William had saved the coalition from the danger of perishing by disunion But by no remonstrance by no entreaty by no bribe could he prevail on his allies to be early in the field They ought to have profited by the severe lesson which had been given them in the preceding year But again every one of them lingered and wondered why the rest were lingering and again he who singly wielded the whole power of France was found as his haughty motto had long boasted a match for a multitude of adversaries three hundred one His enemies while still unready learned with dismay that he had taken the field in person at the head of his nobility On no occasion had that gallant aristocracy appeared with more splendour in his train A single circumstance may suffice to give a notion of the pomp and luxury of his camp Among the musketeers of his household rode for the first time a stripling of seventeen who soon afterwards succeeded to the title of Duke of Saint Simon and to whom we owe those inestimable memoirs which have preserved for the delight and instruction of many lands and of many generations the vivid picture of a France which has long passed away Though the boy s family was at that time very hard pressed for money he travelled with thirty five horses and sumpter mules The princesses of the blood each surrounded by a group of highborn and graceful ladies accompanied the King and the smiles of so many charming women inspired the throng of vain and voluptuous but highspirited gentlemen with more than common courage In the brilliant crowd which surrounded the French Augustus appeared the French Virgil the graceful the tender the melodious Racine He had in conformity with the prevailing fashion become devout had given up writing for the theatre and having determined to apply himself vigorously to the discharge of the duties which belonged to him as historiographer of France he now came to see the great events which it was his office to record three hundred two In the neighbourhood of Mons Lewis entertained the ladies with the most magnificent review that had ever been seen in modern Europe A hundred and twenty thousand of the finest troops in the world were drawn up in a line eight miles long It may be doubted whether such an army had ever been brought together under the Roman eagles The show began early in the morning and was not over when the long summer day closed Racine left the ground astonished deafened dazzled and tired to death In a private letter he ventured to give utterance to an amiable wish which he probably took good care not to whisper in the courtly circle Would to heaven that all these poor fellows were in their cottages again with their wives and their little ones three hundred three After this superb pageant Lewis announced his intention of attacking Namur In five days he was under the walls of that city at the head of more than thirty thousand men Twenty thousand peasants pressed in those parts of the Netherlands which the French occupied were compelled to act as pioneers Luxemburg with eighty thousand men occupied a strong position on the road between Namur and Brussels and was prepared to give battle to any force which might attempt to raise the siege three hundred four This partition of duties excited no surprise It had long been known that the great Monarch loved sieges and that he did not love battles He professed to think that the real test of military skill was a siege The event of an encounter between two armies on an open plain was in his opinion often determined by chance but only science could prevail against ravelins and bastions which science had constructed His detractors sneeringly pronounced it fortunate that the department of the military art which His Majesty considered as the noblest was one in which it was seldom necessary for him to expose to serious risk a life invaluable to his people Namur situated at the confluence of the Sambre and the Meuse was one of the great fortresses of Europe The town lay in the plain and had no strength except what was derived from art But art and nature had combined to fortify that renowned citadel which from the summit of a lofty rock looks down on a boundless expanse of cornfields woods and meadows watered by two fine rivers The people of the city and of the surrounding region were proud of their impregnable castle Their boast was that never in all the wars which had devastated the Netherlands had skill or valour been able to penetrate those walls The neighbouring fastnesses famed throughout the world for their strength Antwerp and Ostend Ypres Lisle and Tournay Mons and Valenciennes Cambray and Charleroi Limburg and Luxemburg had opened their gates to conquerors but never once had the flag been pulled down from the battlements of Namur That nothing might be wanting to the interest of the siege the two great masters of the art of fortification were opposed to each other Vauban had during many years been regarded as the first of engineers but a formidable rival had lately arisen Menno Baron of Cohorn the ablest officer in the service of the States General The defences of Namur had been recently strengthened and repaired under Cohorn s superintendence and he was now within the walls Vauban was in the camp of Lewis It might therefore be expected that both the attack and the defence would be conducted with consummate ability By this time the allied armies had assembled but it was too late three hundred five William hastened towards Namur He menaced the French works first from the west then from the north then from the east But between him and the lines of circumvallation lay the army of Luxemburg turning as he turned and always so strongly posted that to attack it would have been the height of imprudence Meanwhile the besiegers directed by the skill of Vauban and animated by the presence of Lewis made rapid progress There were indeed many difficulties to be surmounted and many hardships to be endured The weather was stormy and on the eighth of June the feast of Saint Medard who holds in the French Calendar the same inauspicious place which in our Calendar belongs to Saint Swithin the rain fell in torrents The Sambre rose and covered many square miles on which the harvest was green The Mehaigne whirled down its bridges to the Meuse All the roads became swamps The trenches were so deep in water and mire that it was the business of three days to move a gun from one battery to another The six thousand waggons which had accompanied the French army were useless It was necessary that gunpowder bullets corn hay should be carried from place to place on the backs of the war horses Nothing but the authority of Lewis could in such circumstances have maintained order and inspired cheerfulness His soldiers in truth showed much more reverence for him than for what their religion had made sacred They cursed Saint Medard heartily and broke or burned every image of him that could be found But for their King there was nothing that they were not ready to do and to bear In spite of every obstacle they constantly gained ground Cohorn was severely wounded while defending with desperate resolution a fort which he had himself constructed and of which he was proud His place could not be supplied The governor was a feeble man whom Gastanaga had appointed and whom William had recently advised the Elector of Bavaria to remove The spirit of the garrison gave way The town surrendered on the eighth day of the siege the citadel about three weeks later three hundred six The history of the fall of Namur in sixteen ninety two bears a close resemblance to the history of the fail of Mons in sixteen ninety one Both in sixteen ninety one and in sixteen ninety two Lewis the sole and absolute master of the resources of his kingdom was able to open the campaign before William the captain of a coalition had brought together his dispersed forces In both years the advantage of having the first move decided the event of the game At Namur as at Mons Lewis assisted by Vauban conducted the siege Luxemburg covered it William vainly tried to raise it and with deep mortification assisted as a spectator at the victory of his enemy In one respect however the fate of the two fortresses was very different Mons was delivered up by its own inhabitants Namur might perhaps have been saved if the garrison had been as zealous and determined as the population Strange to say in this place so long subject to a foreign rule there was found a patriotism resembling that of the little Greek commonwealths There is no reason to believe that the burghers cared about the balance of power or had any preference for James or for William for the Most Christian King or for the Most Catholic King But every citizen considered his own honour as bound up with the honour of the maiden fortress It is true that the French did not abuse their victory No outrage was committed the privileges of the municipality were respected the magistrates were not changed Yet the people could not see a conqueror enter their hitherto unconquered castle without tears of rage and shame Even the barefooted Carmelites who had renounced all pleasures all property all society all domestic affection whose days were all fast days who passed month after month without uttering a word were strangely moved It was in vain that Lewis attempted to soothe them by marks of respect and by munificent bounty Whenever they met a French uniform they turned their heads away with a look which showed that a life of prayer of abstinence and of silence had left one earthly feeling still unsubdued three hundred seven This was perhaps the moment at which the arrogance of Lewis reached the highest point He had achieved the last and the most splendid military exploit of his life His confederated foes English Dutch and German had in their own despite swelled his triumph and had been witnesses of the glory which made their hearts sick His exultation was boundless The inscriptions on the medals which he struck to commemorate his success the letters by which he enjoined the prelates of his kingdom to sing the Te Deum were boastful and sarcastic His people a people among whose many fine qualities moderation in prosperity cannot be reckoned seemed for a time to be drunk with pride Even Boileau hurried along by the prevailing enthusiasm forgot the good sense and good taste to which he owed his reputation He fancied himself a lyric poet and gave vent to his feelings in a hundred and sixty lines of frigid bombast about Alcides Mars Bacchus Ceres the lyre of Orpheus the Thracian oaks and the Permessian nymphs He wondered whether Namur had like Troy been built by Apollo and Neptune He asked what power could subdue a city stronger than that before which the Greeks lay ten years and he returned answer to himself that such a miracle could be wrought only by Jupiter or by Lewis The feather in the hat of Lewis was the loadstar of victory To Lewis all things must yield princes nations winds waters In conclusion the poet addressed himself to the banded enemies of France and tauntingly bade them carry back to their homes the tidings that Namur had been taken in their sight Before many months had elapsed both the boastful king and the boastful poet were taught that it is prudent as well as graceful to be modest in the hour of victory One mortification Lewis had suffered even in the midst of his prosperity While he lay before Namur he heard the sounds of rejoicing from the distant camp of the allies Three peals of thunder from a hundred and forty pieces of cannon were answered by three volleys from sixty thousand muskets It was soon known that these salutes were fired on account of the battle of La Hogue The French King exerted himself to appear serene They make a strange noise he said about the burning of a few ships In truth he was much disturbed and the more so because a report had reached the Low Countries that there had been a sea fight and that his fleet had been victorious His good humour however was soon restored by the brilliant success of those operations which were under his own immediate direction When the siege was over he left Luxemburg in command of the army and returned to Versailles At Versailles the unfortunate Tourville soon presented himself and was graciously received As soon as he appeared in the circle the King welcomed him in a loud voice I am perfectly satisfied with you and with my sailors We have been beaten it is true but your honour and that of the nation are unsullied three hundred eight Though Lewis had quitted the Netherlands the eyes of all Europe were still fixed on that region The armies there had been strengthened by reinforcements drawn from many quarters Every where else the military operations of the year were languid and without interest The Grand Vizier and Lewis of Baden did little more than watch each other on the Danube Marshal Noailles and the Duke of Medina Sidonia did little more than watch each other under the Pyrenees On the Upper Rhine and along the frontier which separates France from Piedmont an indecisive predatory war was carried on by which the soldiers suffered little and the cultivators of the soil much But all men looked with anxious expectation of some great event to the frontier of Brabant where William was opposed to Luxemburg Luxemburg now in his sixty sixth year had risen by slow degrees and by the deaths of several great men to the first place among the generals of his time He was of that noble house of Montmorency which united many mythical and many historical titles to glory which boasted that it sprang from the first Frank who was baptized into the name of Christ in the fifth century and which had since the eleventh century given to France a long and splendid succession of Constables and Marshals In valour and abilities Luxemburg was not inferior to any of his illustrious race But highly descended and highly gifted as he was he had with difficulty surmounted the obstacles which impeded him in the road to fame If he owed much to the bounty of nature and fortune he had suffered still more from their spite His features were frightfully harsh his stature was diminutive a huge and pointed hump rose on his back His constitution was feeble and sickly Cruel imputations had been thrown on his morals He had been accused of trafficking with sorcerers and with vendors of poison had languished long in a dungeon and had at length regained his liberty without entirely regaining his honour three hundred nine He had always been disliked both by Louvois and by Lewis Yet the war against the European coalition had lasted but a very short time when both the minister and the King felt that the general who was personally odious to them was necessary to the state Conde and Turenne were no more and Luxemburg was without dispute the first soldier that France still possessed In vigilance diligence and perseverance he was deficient He seemed to reserve his great qualities for great emergencies It was on a pitched field of battle that he was all himself His glance was rapid and unerring His judgment was clearest and surest when responsibility pressed heaviest on him and when difficulties gathered thickest around him To his skill energy and presence of mind his country owed some glorious days But though eminently successful in battles he was not eminently successful in campaigns He gained immense renown at William s expense and yet there was as respected the objects of the war little to choose between the two commanders Luxemburg was repeatedly victorious but he had not the art of improving a victory William was repeatedly defeated but of all generals he was the best qualified to repair a defeat In the month of July William s headquarters were at Lambeque About six miles off at Steinkirk Luxemburg had encamped with the main body of his army and about six miles further off lay a considerable force commanded by the Marquess of Boufflers one of the best officers in the service of Lewis The country between Lambeque and Steinkirk was intersected by innumerable hedges and ditches and neither army could approach the other without passing through several long and narrow defiles Luxemburg had therefore little reason to apprehend that he should be attacked in his entrenchments and he felt assured that he should have ample notice before any attack was made for he had succeeded in corrupting an adventurer named Millevoix who was chief musician and private secretary of the Elector of Bavaria This man regularly sent to the French headquarters authentic information touching the designs of the allies The Marshal confident in the strength of his position and in the accuracy of his intelligence lived in his tent as he was accustomed to live in his hotel at Paris He was at once a valetudinarian and a voluptuary and in both characters he loved his ease He scarcely ever mounted his horse Light conversation and cards occupied most of his hours His table was luxurious and when he had sate down to supper it was a service of danger to disturb him Some scoffers remarked that in his military dispositions he was not guided exclusively by military reasons that he generally contrived to entrench himself in some place where the veal and the poultry were remarkably good and that he was always solicitous to keep open such communications with the sea as might ensure him from September to April a regular supply of Sandwich oysters If there were any agreeable women in the neighbourhood of his camp they were generally to be found at his banquets It may easily be supposed that under such a commander the young princes and nobles of France vied with one another in splendour and gallantry three hundred ten While he was amusing himself after his wonted fashion the confederate princes discovered that their counsels were betrayed A peasant picked up a letter which had been dropped and carried it to the Elector of Bavaria It contained full proofs of the guilt of Millevoix William conceived a hope that he might be able to take his enemies in the snare which they had laid for him The perfidious secretary was summoned to the royal presence and taxed with his crime A pen was put into his hand a pistol was held to his breast and he was commanded to write on pain of instant death His letter dictated by William was conveyed to the French camp It apprised Luxemburg that the allies meant to send out a strong foraging party on the next day In order to protect this party from molestation some battalions of infantry accompanied by artillery would march by night to occupy the defiles which lay between the armies The Marshal read believed and went to rest while William urged forward the preparations for a general assault on the French lines The whole allied army was under arms while it was still dark In the grey of the morning Luxemburg was awakened by scouts who brought tidings that the enemy was advancing in great force He at first treated the news very lightly His correspondent it seemed had been as usual diligent and exact The Prince of Orange had sent out a detachment to protect his foragers and this detachment had been magnified by fear into a great host But one alarming report followed another fast All the passes it was said were choked with multitudes of foot horse and artillery under the banners of England and of Spain of the United Provinces and of the Empire and every column was moving towards Steinkirk At length the Marshal rose got on horseback and rode out to see what was doing By this time the vanguard of the allies was close to his outposts About half a mile in advance of his army was encamped a brigade named from the province of Bourbonnais These troops had to bear the first brunt of the onset Amazed and panicstricken they were swept away in a moment and ran for their lives leaving their tents and seven pieces of cannon to the assailants Thus far William s plans had been completely successful but now fortune began to turn against him He had been misinformed as to the nature of the ground which lay between the station of the brigade of Bourbonnais and the main encampment of the enemy He had expected that he should be able to push forward without a moment s pause that he should find the French army in a state of wild disorder and that his victory would be easy and complete But his progress was obstructed by several fences and ditches there was a short delay and a short delay sufficed to frustrate his design Luxemburg was the very man for such a conjuncture He had committed great faults he had kept careless guard he had trusted implicitly to information which had proved false he had neglected information which had proved true one of his divisions was flying in confusion the other divisions were unprepared for action That crisis would have paralysed the faculties of an ordinary captain it only braced and stimulated those of Luxemburg His mind nay his sickly and distorted body seemed to derive health and vigour from disaster and dismay In a short time he had disposed every thing The French army was in battle order Conspicuous in that great array were the household troops of Lewis the most renowned body of fighting men in Europe and at their head appeared glittering in lace and embroidery hastily thrown on and half fastened a crowd of young princes and lords who had just been roused by the trumpet from their couches or their revels and who had hastened to look death in the face with the gay and festive intrepidity characteristic of French gentlemen Highest in rank among these highborn warriors was a lad of sixteen Philip Duke of Chartres son of the Duke of Orleans and nephew of the King of France It was with difficulty and by importunate solicitation that the gallant boy had extorted Luxemburg s permission to be where the fire was hottest Two other youths of royal blood Lewis Duke of Bourbon and Armand Prince of Conti showed a spirit worthy of their descent With them was a descendant of one of the bastards of Henry the Fourth Lewis Duke of Vendome a man sunk in indolence and in the foulest vice yet capable of exhibiting on a great occasion the qualities of a great soldier Berwick who was beginning to earn for himself an honourable name in arms was there and at his side rode Sarsfield whose courage and ability earned on that day the esteem of the whole French army Meanwhile Luxemburg had sent off a pressing message to summon Boufflers But the message was needless Boufflers had heard the firing and like a brave and intelligent captain was already hastening towards the point from which the sound came Though the assailants had lost all the advantage which belongs to a surprise they came on manfully In the front of the battle were the British commanded by Count Solmes The division which was to lead the way was Mackay s He was to have been supported according to William s plan by a strong body of foot and horse Though most of Mackay s men had never before been under fire their behaviour gave promise of Blenheim and Ramilies They first encountered the Swiss who held a distinguished place in the French army The fight was so close and desperate that the muzzles of the muskets crossed The Swiss were driven back with fearful slaughter More than eighteen hundred of them appear from the French returns to have been killed or wounded Luxemburg afterwards said that he had never in his life seen so furious a struggle He collected in haste the opinion of the generals who surrounded him All thought that the emergency was one which could be met by no common means The King s household must charge the English The Marshal gave the word and the household headed by the princes of the blood came on flinging their muskets back on their shoulders Sword in hand was the cry through all the ranks of that terrible brigade sword in hand No firing Do it with the cold steel After a long and desperate resistance the English were borne down They never ceased to repeat that if Solmes had done his duty by them they would have beaten even the household But Solmes gave them no effective support He pushed forward some cavalry which from the nature of the ground could do little or nothing His infantry he would not suffer to stir They could do no good he said and he would not send them to be slaughtered Ormond was eager to hasten to the assistance of his countrymen but was not permitted Mackay sent a pressing message to represent that he and his men were left to certain destruction but all was vain God s will be done said the brave veteran He died as he had lived like a good Christian and a good soldier With him fell Douglas and Lanier two generals distinguished among the conquerors of Ireland Mountjoy too was among the slain After languishing three years in the Bastile he had just been exchanged for Richard Hamilton and having been converted to Whiggism by wrongs more powerful than all the arguments of Locke and Sidney had instantly hastened to join William s camp as a volunteer three hundred eleven Five fine regiments were entirely cut to pieces No part of this devoted band would have escaped but for the courage and conduct of Auverquerque who came to the rescue in the moment of extremity with two fresh battalions The gallant manner in which he brought off the remains of Mackay s division was long remembered with grateful admiration by the British camp fires The ground where the conflict had raged was piled with corpses and those who buried the slain remarked that almost all the wounds had been given in close fighting by the sword or the bayonet It was said that William so far forgot his wonted stoicism as to utter a passionate exclamation at the way in which the English regiments had been sacrificed Soon however he recovered his equanimity and determined to fall back It was high time for the French army was every moment becoming stronger as the regiments commanded by Boufflers came up in rapid succession The allied army returned to Lambeque unpursued and in unbroken order three hundred twelve The French owned that they had about seven thousand men killed and wounded The loss of the allies had been little if at all greater The relative strength of the armies was what it had been on the preceding day and they continued to occupy their old positions But the moral effect of the battle was great The splendour of William s fame grew pale Even his admirers were forced to own that in the field he was not a match for Luxemburg In France the news was received with transports of joy and pride The Court the Capital even the peasantry of the remotest provinces gloried in the impetuous valour which had been displayed by so many youths the heirs of illustrious names It was exultingly and fondly repeated all over the kingdom that the young Duke of Chartres could not by any remonstrances be kept out of danger that a ball had passed through his coat that he had been wounded in the shoulder The people lined the roads to see the princes and nobles who returned from Steinkirk The jewellers devised Steinkirk buckles the perfumers sold Steinkirk powder But the name of the field of battle was peculiarly given to a new species of collar Lace neckcloths were then worn by men of fashion and it had been usual to arrange them with great care But at the terrible moment when the brigade of Bourbonnais was flying before the onset of the allies there was no time for foppery and the finest gentlemen of the Court came spurring to the front of the line of battle with their rich cravats in disorder It therefore became a fashion among the beauties of Paris to wear round their necks kerchiefs of the finest lace studiously disarranged and these kerchiefs were called Steinkirks three hundred thirteen In the camp of the allies all was disunion and discontent National jealousies and animosities raged without restraint or disguise The resentment of the English was loudly expressed Solmes though he was said by those who knew him well to have some valuable qualities was not a man likely to conciliate soldiers who were prejudiced against him as a foreigner His demeanour was arrogant his temper ungovernable Even before the unfortunate day of Steinkirk the English officers did not willingly communicate with him and the private men murmured at his harshness But after the battle the outcry against him became furious He was accused perhaps unjustly of having said with unfeeling levity while the English regiments were contending desperately against great odds that he was curious to see how the bulldogs would come off Would any body it was asked now pretend that it was on account of his superior skill and experience that he had been put over the heads of so many English officers It was the fashion to say that those officers had never seen war on a large scale But surely the merest novice was competent to do all that Solmes had done to misunderstand orders to send cavalry on duty which none but infantry could perform and to look on at safe distance while brave men were cut to pieces It was too much to be at once insulted and sacrificed excluded from the honours of war yet pushed on all its extreme dangers sneered at as raw recruits and then left to cope unsupported with the finest body of veterans in the world Such were the complains of the English army and they were echoed by the English nation Fortunately about this time a discovery was made which furnished both the camp at Lambeque and the coffeehouses of London with a subject of conversation much less agreeable to the Jacobites than the disaster of Steinkirk A plot against the life of William had been during some months maturing in the French War Office It should seem that Louvois had originally sketched the design and had bequeathed it still rude to his son and successor Barbesieux By Barbesieux the plan was perfected The execution was entrusted to an officer named Grandval Grandval was undoubtedly brave and full of zeal for his country and his religion He was indeed flighty and half witted but not on that account the less dangerous Indeed a flighty and half witted man is the very instrument generally preferred by cunning politicians when very hazardous work is to be done No shrewd calculator would for any bribe however enormous have exposed himself to the fate of Chatel of Ravaillac or of Gerarts three hundred fourteen Grandval secured as he conceived the assistance of two adventurers Dumont a Walloon and Leefdale a Dutchman In April soon after William had arrived in the Low Countries the murderers were directed to repair to their post Dumont was then in Westphalia Grandval and Leefdale were at Paris Uden in North Brabant was fixed as the place where the three were to meet and whence they were to proceed together to the headquarters of the allies Before Grandval left Paris he paid a visit to Saint Germains and was presented to James and to Mary of Modena I have been informed said James of the business If you and your companions do me this service you shall never want After this audience Grandval set out on his journey He had not the faintest suspicion that he had been betrayed both by the accomplice who accompanied him and by the accomplice whom he was going to meet Dumont and Leefdale were not enthusiasts They cared nothing for the restoration of James the grandeur of Lewis or the ascendency of the Church of Rome It was plain to every man of common sense that whether the design succeeded or failed the reward of the assassins would probably be to be disowned with affected abhorrence by the Courts of Versailles and Saint Germains and to be torn with redhot pincers smeared with melted lead and dismembered by four horses To vulgar natures the prospect of such a martyrdom was not alluring Both these men therefore had almost at the same time though as far as appears without any concert conveyed to William through different channels warnings that his life was in danger Dumont had acknowledged every thing to the Duke of Zell one of the confederate princes Leefdale had transmitted full intelligence through his relations who resided in Holland Meanwhile Morel a Swiss Protestant of great learning who was then in France wrote to inform Burnet that the weak and hotheaded Grandval had been heard to talk boastfully of the event which would soon astonish the world and had confidently predicted that the Prince of Orange would not live to the end of the next month These cautions were not neglected From the moment at which Grandval entered the Netherlands his steps were among snares His movements were watched his words were noted he was arrested examined confronted with his accomplices and sent to the camp of the allies About a week after the battle of Steinkirk he was brought before a Court Martial Ginkell who had been rewarded for his great services in Ireland with the title of Earl of Athlone presided and Talmash was among the judges Mackay and Lanier had been named members of the board but they were no more and their places were filled by younger officers The duty of the Court Martial was very simple for the prisoner attempted no defence His conscience had it should seem been suddenly awakened He admitted with expressions of remorse the truth of all the charges made a minute and apparently an ingenuous confession and owned that he had deserved death He was sentenced to be hanged drawn and quartered and underwent his punishment with great fortitude and with a show of piety He left behind him a few lines in which he declared that he was about to lose his life for having too faithfully obeyed the injunctions of Barbesieux His confession was immediately published in several languages and was read with very various and very strong emotions That it was genuine could not be doubted for it was warranted by the signatures of some of the most distinguished military men living That it was prompted by the hope of pardon could hardly be supposed for William had taken pains to discourage that hope Still less could it be supposed that the prisoner had uttered untruths in order to avoid the torture For though it was the universal practice in the Netherlands to put convicted assassins to the rack in order to wring out from them the names of their employers and associates William had given orders that on this occasion the rack should not be used or even named It should be added that the Court did not interrogate the prisoner closely but suffered him to tell his story in his own way It is therefore reasonable to believe that his narrative is substantially true and no part of it has a stronger air of truth than his account of the audience with which James had honoured him at Saint Germains In our island the sensation produced by the news was great The Whigs loudly called both James and Lewis assassins How it was asked was it possible without outraging common sense to put an innocent meaning on the words which Grandval declared that he had heard from the lips of the banished King of England And who that knew the Court of Versailles would believe that Barbesieux a youth a mere novice in politics and rather a clerk than a minister would have dared to do what he had done without taking his master s pleasure Very charitable and very ignorant persons might perhaps indulge a hope that Lewis had not been an accessory before the fact But that he was an accessory after the fact no human being could doubt He must have seen the proceedings of the Court Martial the evidence the confession If he really abhorred assassination as honest men abhor it would not Barbesieux have been driven with ignominy from the royal presence and flung into the Bastile Yet Barbesieux was still at the War Office and it was not pretended that he had been punished even by a word or a frown It was plain then that both Kings were partakers in the guilt of Grandval And if it were asked how two princes who made a high profession of religion could have fallen into such wickedness the answer was that they had learned their religion from the Jesuits In reply to these reproaches the English Jacobites said very little and the French government said nothing at all three hundred fifteen The campaign in the Netherlands ended without any other event deserving to be recorded On the eighteenth of October William arrived in England Late in the evening of the twentieth he reached Kensington having traversed the whole length of the capital His reception was cordial The crowd was great the acclamations were loud and all the windows along his route from Aldgate to Piccadilly were lighted up three hundred sixteen But notwithstanding these favourable symptoms the nation was disappointed and discontented The war had been unsuccessful by land By sea a great advantage had been gained but had not been improved The general expectation had been that the victory of May would be followed by a descent on the coast of France that Saint Maloes would he bombarded that the last remains of Tourville s squadron would be destroyed and that the arsenals of Brest and Rochefort would be laid in ruins This expectation was no doubt unreasonable It did not follow because Rooke and his seamen had silenced the batteries hastily thrown up by Bellefonds that it would be safe to expose ships to the fire of regular fortresses The government however was not less sanguine than the nation Great preparations were made The allied fleet having been speedily refitted at Portsmouth stood out again to sea Rooke was sent to examine the soundings and the currents along the shore of Brittany three hundred seventeen Transports were collected at Saint Helens Fourteen thousand troops were assembled on Portsdown under the command of Meinhart Schomberg who had been rewarded for his father s services and his own with the highest rank in the Irish peerage and was now Duke of Leinster Under him were Ruvigny who for his good service at Aghrim had been created Earl of Galway La Melloniere and Cambon with their gallant bands of refugees and Argyle with the regiment which bore his name and which as it began to be rumoured had last winter done something strange and horrible in a wild country of rocks and snow never yet explored by any Englishman On the twenty sixth of July the troops were all on board The transports sailed and in a few hours joined the naval armament in the neighbourhood of Portland On the twenty eighth a general council of war was held All the naval commanders with Russell at their head declared that it would be madness to carry their ships within the range of the guns of Saint Maloes and that the town must be reduced to straits by land before the men of war in the harbour could with any chance of success be attacked from the sea The military men declared with equal unanimity that the land forces could effect nothing against the town without the cooperation of the fleet It was then considered whether it would be advisable to make an attempt on Brest or Rochefort Russell and the other flag officers among whom were Rooke Shovel Almonde and Evertsen pronounced that the summer was too far spent for either enterprise three hundred eighteen We must suppose that an opinion in which so many distinguished admirals both English and Dutch concurred however strange it may seem to us was in conformity with what were then the established principles of the art of maritime war But why all these questions could not have been fully discussed a week earlier why fourteen thousand troops should have been shipped and sent to sea before it had been considered what they were to do or whether it would be possible for them to do any thing we may reasonably wonder The armament returned to Saint Helens to the astonishment and disgust of the whole nation three hundred nineteen The ministers blamed the commanders the commanders blamed the ministers The recriminations exchanged between Nottingham and Russell were loud and angry Nottingham honest industrious versed in civil business and eloquent in parliamentary debate was deficient in the qualities of a war minister and was not at all aware of his deficiencies Between him and the whole body of professional sailors there was a feud of long standing He had some time before the Revolution been a Lord of the Admiralty and his own opinion was that he had then acquired a profound knowledge of maritime affairs This opinion however he had very much to himself Men who had passed half their lives on the waves and who had been in battles storms and shipwrecks were impatient of his somewhat pompous lectures and reprimands and pronounced him a mere pedant who with all his book learning was ignorant of what every cabin boy knew Russell had always been froward arrogant and mutinous and now prosperity and glory brought out his vices in full strength With the government which he had saved he took all the liberties of an insolent servant who believes himself to be necessary treated the orders of his superiors with contemptuous levity resented reproof however gentle as an outrage furnished no plan of his own and showed a sullen determination to execute no plan furnished by any body else To Nottingham he had a strong and a very natural antipathy They were indeed an ill matched pair Nottingham was a Tory Russell was a Whig Nottingham was a speculative seaman confident in his theories Russell was a practical seaman proud of his achievements The strength of Nottingham lay in speech the strength of Russell lay in action Nottingham s demeanour was decorous even to formality Russell was passionate and rude Lastly Nottingham was an honest man and Russell was a villain They now became mortal enemies The Admiral sneered at the Secretary s ignorance of naval affairs the Secretary accused the Admiral of sacrificing the public interests to mere wayward humour and both were in the right three hundred twenty While they were wrangling the merchants of all the ports in the kingdom raised a cry against the naval administration The victory of which the nation was so proud was in the City pronounced to have been a positive disaster During some months before the battle all the maritime strength of the enemy had been collected in two great masses one in the Mediterranean and one in the Atlantic There had consequently been little privateering and the voyage to New England or Jamaica had been almost as safe as in time of peace Since the battle the remains of the force which had lately been collected under Tourville were dispersed over the ocean Even the passage from England to Ireland was insecure Every week it was announced that twenty thirty fifty vessels belonging to London or Bristol had been taken by the French More than a hundred prices were carried during that autumn into Saint Maloes alone It would have been far better in the opinion of the shipowners and of the underwriters that the Royal Sun had still been afloat with her thousand fighting men on board than that she should be lying a heap of ashes on the beach at Cherburg while her crew distributed among twenty brigantines prowled for booty over the sea between Cape Finisterre and Cape Clear three hundred twenty one The privateers of Dunkirk had long been celebrated and among them John Bart humbly born and scarcely able to sign his name but eminently brave and active had attained an undisputed preeminence In the country of Anson and Hawke of Howe and Rodney of Duncan Saint Vincent and Nelson the name of the most daring and skilful corsair would have little chance of being remembered But France among whose many unquestioned titles to glory very few are derived from naval war still ranks Bart among her great men In the autumn of sixteen ninety two this enterprising freebooter was the terror of all the English and Dutch merchants who traded with the Baltic He took and destroyed vessels close to the eastern coast of our island He even ventured to land in Northumberland and burned many houses before the trainbands could be collected to oppose him The prizes which he carried back into his native port were estimated at about a hundred thousand pounds sterling three hundred twenty two About the same time a younger adventurer destined to equal or surpass Bart Du Guay Trouin was entrusted with the command of a small armed vessel The intrepid boy for he was not yet twenty years old entered the estuary of the Shannon sacked a mansion in the county of Clare and did not reimbark till a detachment from the garrison of Limerick marched against him three hundred twenty three While our trade was interrupted and our shores menaced by these rovers some calamities which no human prudence could have averted increased the public ill humour An earthquake of terrible violence laid waste in less than three minutes the flourishing colony of Jamaica Whole plantations changed their place Whole villages were swallowed up Port Royal the fairest and wealthiest city which the English had yet built in the New World renowned for its quays for its warehouses and for its stately streets which were said to rival Cheapside was turned into a mass of ruins Fifteen hundred of the inhabitants were buried under their own dwellings The effect of this disaster was severely felt by many of the great mercantile houses of London and Bristol three hundred twenty four A still heavier calamity was the failure of the harvest The summer had been wet all over Western Europe Those heavy rains which had impeded the exertions of the French pioneers in the trenches of Namur had been fatal to the crops Old men remembered no such year since sixteen forty eight No fruit ripened The price of the quarter of wheat doubled The evil was aggravated by the state of the silver coin which had been clipped to such an extent that the words pound and shilling had ceased to have a fixed meaning Compared with France indeed England might well be esteemed prosperous Here the public burdens were heavy there they were crushing Here the labouring man was forced to husband his coarse barley loaf but there it not seldom happened that the wretched peasant was found dead on the earth with halfchewed grass in his mouth Our ancestors found some consolation in thinking that they were gradually wearing out the strength of their formidable enemy and that his resources were likely to be drained sooner than theirs Still there was much suffering and much repining In some counties mobs attacked the granaries The necessity of retrenchment was felt by families of every rank An idle man of wit and pleasure who little thought that his buffoonery would ever be cited to illustrate the history of his times complained that in this year wine ceased to be put on many hospitable tables where he had been accustomed to see it and that its place was supplied by punch three hundred twenty five A symptom of public distress much more alarming than the substitution of brandy and lemons for claret was the increase of crime During the autumn of sixteen ninety two and the following winter the capital was kept in constant terror by housebreakers One gang thirteen strong entered the mansion of the Duke of Ormond in Saint James s Square and all but succeeded in carrying off his magnificent plate and jewels Another gang made an attempt on Lambeth Palace three hundred twenty six When stately abodes guarded by numerous servants were in such danger it may easily be believed that no shopkeeper s till or stock could be safe From Bow to Hyde Park from Thames Street to Bloomsbury there was no parish in which some quiet dwelling had not been sacked by burglars three hundred twenty seven Meanwhile the great roads were made almost impassable by freebooters who formed themselves into troops larger than had before been known There was a sworn fraternity of twenty footpads which met at an alehouse in Southwark three hundred twenty eight But the most formidable band of plunderers consisted of two and twenty horsemen three hundred twenty nine It should seem that at this time a journey of fifty miles through the wealthiest and most populous shires of England was as dangerous as a pilgrimage across the deserts of Arabia The Oxford stage coach was pillaged in broad day after a bloody fight three hundred thirty A waggon laden with fifteen thousand pounds of public money was stopped and ransacked As this operation took some time all the travellers who came to the spot while the thieves were busy were seized and guarded When the booty had been secured the prisoners were suffered to depart on foot but their horses sixteen or eighteen in number were shot or hamstringed to prevent pursuit three hundred thirty one The Portsmouth mail was robbed twice in one week by men well armed and mounted three hundred thirty two Some jovial Essex squires while riding after a hare were themselves chased and run down by nine hunters of a different sort and were heartily glad to find themselves at home again though with empty pockets three hundred thirty three The friends of the government asserted that the marauders were all Jacobites and indeed there were some appearances which gave colour to the assertion For example fifteen butchers going on a market day to buy beasts at Thame were stopped by a large gang and compelled first to deliver their moneybags and then to drink King James s health in brandy three hundred thirty four The thieves however to do them justice showed in the exercise of their calling no decided preference for any political party Some of them fell in with Marlborough near Saint Albans and notwithstanding his known hostility to the Court and his recent imprisonment compelled him to deliver up five hundred guineas which he doubtless never ceased to regret to the last moment of his long career of prosperity and glory three hundred thirty five When William on his return from the Continent learned to what an extent these outrages were carried he expressed great indignation and announced his resolution to put down the malefactors with a strong hand A veteran robber was induced to turn informer and to lay before the King a list of the chief highwaymen and a full account of their habits and of their favourite haunts It was said that this list contained not less than eighty names three hundred thirty six Strong parties of cavalry were sent out to protect the roads and this precaution which would in ordinary circumstances have excited much murmuring seems to have been generally approved A fine regiment now called the Second Dragoon Guards which had distinguished itself in Ireland by activity and success in the irregular war against the Rapparees was selected to guard several of the great avenues of the capital Blackheath Barnet Hounslow became places of arms three hundred thirty seven In a few weeks the roads were as safe as usual The executions were numerous for till the evil had been suppressed the King resolutely refused to listen to any solicitations for mercy three hundred thirty eight Among those who suffered was James Whitney the most celebrated captain of banditti in the kingdom He had been during some months the terror of all who travelled from London either northward or westward and was at length with difficulty secured after a desperate conflict in which one soldier was killed and several wounded three hundred thirty nine The London Gazette announced that the famous highwayman had been taken and invited all persons who had been robbed by him to repair to Newgate and to see whether they could identify him To identify him should have been easy for he had a wound in the face and had lost a thumb three hundred forty He however in the hope of perplexing the witnesses for the Crown expended a hundred pounds in procuring a sumptuous embroidered suit against the day of trial This ingenious device was frustrated by his hardhearted keepers He was put to the bar in his ordinary clothes convicted and sentenced to death three hundred forty one He had previously tried to ransom himself by offering to raise a fine troop of cavalry all highwaymen for service in Flanders but his offer had been rejected three hundred forty two He had one resource still left He declared that he was privy to a treasonable plot Some Jacobite lords had promised him immense rewards if he would at the head of his gang fall upon the King at a stag hunt in Windsor Forest There was nothing intrinsically improbable in Whitney s story Indeed a design very similar to that which he imputed to the malecontents was only three years later actually formed by some of them and was all but carried into execution But it was far better that a few bad men should go unpunished than that all honest men should live in fear of being falsely accused by felons sentenced to the gallows Chief Justice Holt advised the King to let the law take its course William never much inclined to give credit to stories about conspiracies assented The Captain as he was called was hanged in Smithfield and made a most penitent end three hundred forty three Meanwhile in the midst of discontent distress and disorder had begun a session of Parliament singularly eventful a session from which dates a new era in the history of English finance a session in which some grave constitutional questions not yet entirely set at rest were for the first time debated It is much to be lamented that any account of this session which can be framed out of the scanty and dispersed materials now accessible must leave many things obscure The relations of the parliamentary factions were during this year in a singularly complicated state Each of the two Houses was divided and subdivided by several lines To omit minor distinctions there was the great line which separated the Whig party from the Tory party and there was the great line which separated the official men and their friends and dependents who were sometimes called the Court party from those who were sometimes nicknamed the Grumbletonians and sometimes honoured with the appellation of the Country party And these two great lines were intersecting lines For of the servants of the Crown and of their adherents about one half were Whigs and one half Tories It is also to be remembered that there was quite distinct from the feud between Whigs and Tories quite distinct also from the feud between those who were in and those who were out a feud between the Lords as Lords and the Commons as Commons The spirit both of the hereditary and of the elective chamber had been thoroughly roused in the preceding session by the dispute about the Court of the Lord High Steward and they met in a pugnacious mood The speech which the King made at the opening of the session was skilfully framed for the purpose of conciliating the Houses He came he told them to ask for their advice and assistance He congratulated them on the victory of La Hogue He acknowledged with much concern that the operations of the allies had been less successful by land than by sea but he warmly declared that both by land and by sea the valour of his English subjects had been preeminently conspicuous The distress of his people he said was his own his interest was inseparable from theirs it was painful to him to call on them to make sacrifices but from sacrifices which were necessary to the safety of the English nation and of the Protestant religion no good Englishman and no good Protestant would shrink three hundred forty four The Commons thanked the King in cordial terms for his gracious speech three hundred forty five But the Lords were in a bad humour Two of their body Marlborough and Huntingdon had during the recess when an invasion and an insurrection were hourly expected been sent to the Tower and were still under recognisances Had a country gentleman or a merchant been taken up and held to bail on even slighter grounds at so alarming a crisis the Lords would assuredly not have interfered But they were easily moved to anger by any thing that looked like an indignity offered to their own order They not only crossexamined with great severity Aaron Smith the Solicitor of the Treasury whose character to say the truth entitled him to little indulgence but passed by thirty five votes to twenty eight a resolution implying a censure on the judges of the King s Bench men certainly not inferior in probity and very far superior in legal learning to any peer of the realm The King thought it prudent to soothe the wounded pride of the nobility by ordering the recognisances to be cancelled and with this concession the House was satisfied to the great vexation of the Jacobites who had hoped that the quarrel would be prosecuted to some fatal issue and who finding themselves disappointed vented their spleen by railing at the tameness of the degenerate barons of England three hundred forty six Both Houses held long and earnest deliberations on the state of the nation The King when he requested their advice had perhaps not foreseen that his words would be construed into an invitation to scrutinise every part of the administration and to offer suggestions touching matters which parliaments have generally thought it expedient to leave entirely to the Crown Some of the discontented peers proposed that a Committee chosen partly by the Lords and partly by the Commons should be authorised to inquire into the whole management of public affairs But it was generally apprehended that such a Committee would become a second and more powerful Privy Council independent of the Crown and unknown to the Constitution The motion was therefore rejected by forty eight votes to thirty six On this occasion the ministers with scarcely an exception voted in the majority A protest was signed by eighteen of the minority among whom were the bitterest Whigs and the bitterest Tories in the whole peerage three hundred forty seven The Houses inquired each for itself into the causes of the public calamities The Commons resolved themselves into a Grand Committee to consider of the advice to be given to the King From the concise abstracts and fragments which have come down to us it seems that in this Committee which continued to sit many days the debates wandered over a vast space One member spoke of the prevalence of highway robbery another deplored the quarrel between the Queen and the Princess and proposed that two or three gentlemen should be deputed to wait on Her Majesty and try to make matters up A third described the machinations of the Jacobites in the preceding spring It was notorious he said that preparations had been made for a rising and that arms and horses had been collected yet not a single traitor had been brought to justice three hundred forty eight The events of the war by land and sea furnished matter for several earnest debates Many members complained of the preference given to aliens over Englishmen The whole battle of Steinkirk was fought over again and severe reflections were thrown on Solmes Let English soldiers be commanded by none but English generals was the almost universal cry Seymour who had once been distinguished by his hatred of the foreigners but who since he had been at the Board of Treasury had reconsidered his opinions asked where English generals were to be found I have no love for foreigners as foreigners but we have no choice Men are not born generals nay a man may be a very valuable captain or major and not be equal to the conduct of an army Nothing but experience will form great commanders Very few of our countrymen have that experience and therefore we must for the present employ strangers Lowther followed on the same side We have had a long peace and the consequence is that we have not a sufficient supply of officers fit for high commands The parks and the camp at Hounslow were very poor military schools when compared with the fields of battle and the lines of contravallation in which the great commanders of the continental nations have learned their art In reply to these arguments an orator on the other side was so absurd as to declare that he could point out ten Englishmen who if they were in the French service would be made Marshals Four or five colonels who had been at Steinkirk took part in the debate It was said of them that they showed as much modesty in speech as they had shown courage in action and from the very imperfect report which has come down to us the compliment seems to have been not undeserved They did not join in the vulgar cry against the Dutch They spoke well of the foreign officers generally and did full justice to the valour and conduct with which Auverquerque had rescued the shattered remains of Mackay s division from what seemed certain destruction But in defence of Solmes not a word was said His severity his haughty manners and above all the indifference with which he had looked on while the English borne down by overwhelming numbers were fighting hand to hand with the French household troops had made him so odious that many members were prepared to vote for an address requesting that he might be removed and that his place might be filled by Talmash who since the disgrace of Marlborough was universally allowed to be the best officer in the army But Talmash s friends judiciously interfered I have said one of them a true regard for that gentleman and I implore you not to do him an injury under the notion of doing him a kindness Consider that you are usurping what is peculiarly the King s prerogative You are turning officers out and putting officers in The debate ended without any vote of censure on Solmes But a hope was expressed in language not very parliamentary that what had been said in the Committee would be reported to the King and that His Majesty would not disregard the general wish of the representatives of his people three hundred forty nine The Commons next proceeded to inquire into the naval administration and very soon came to a quarrel with the Lords on that subject That there had been mismanagement somewhere was but too evident It was hardly possible to acquit both Russell and Nottingham and each House stood by its own member The Commons had at the opening of the session unanimously passed a vote of thanks to Russell for his conduct at La Hogue They now in the Grand Committee of Advice took into consideration the miscarriages which had followed the battle A motion was made so vaguely worded that it could hardly be said to mean any thing It was understood however to imply a censure on Nottingham and was therefore strongly opposed by his friends On the division the Ayes were a hundred and sixty five the Noes a hundred and sixty four three hundred fifty On the very next day Nottingham appealed to the Lords He told his story with all the skill of a practised orator and with all the authority which belongs to unblemished integrity He then laid on the table a great mass of papers which he requested the House to read and consider The Peers seem to have examined the papers seriously and diligently The result of the examination was by no means favourable to Russell Yet it was thought unjust to condemn him unheard and it was difficult to devise any way in which their Lordships could hear him At last it was resolved to send the papers down to the Commons with a message which imported that in the opinion of the Upper House there was a case against the Admiral which he ought to be called upon to answer With the papers was sent an abstract of the contents three hundred fifty one The message was not very respectfully received Russell had at that moment a popularity which he little deserved but which will not surprise us when we remember that the public knew nothing of his treasons and knew that he was the only living Englishman who had won a great battle The abstract of the papers was read by the clerk Russell then spoke with great applause and his friends pressed for an immediate decision Sir Christopher Musgrave very justly observed that it was impossible to pronounce judgment on such a pile of despatches without perusing them but this objection was overruled The Whigs regarded the accused member as one of themselves many of the Tories were dazzled by the splendour of his recent victory and neither Whigs nor Tories were disposed to show any deference for the authority of the Peers The House without reading the papers passed an unanimous resolution expressing warm approbation of Russell s whole conduct The temper of the assembly was such that some ardent Whigs thought that they might now venture to propose a vote of censure on Nottingham by name But the attempt failed I am ready said Lowther and he doubtless expressed what many felt I am ready to support any motion that may do honour to the Admiral but I cannot join in an attack on the Secretary of State For to my knowledge their Majesties have no more zealous laborious or faithful servant than my Lord Nottingham Finch exerted all his mellifluous eloquence in defence of his brother and contrived without directly opposing himself to the prevailing sentiment to insinuate that Russell s conduct had not been faultless The vote of censure on Nottingham was not pressed The vote which pronounced Russell s conduct to have been deserving of all praise was communicated to the Lords and the papers which they had sent down were very unceremoniously returned three hundred fifty two The Lords much offended demanded a free conference It was granted and the managers of the two Houses met in the Painted Chamber Rochester in the name of his brethren expressed a wish to be informed of the grounds on which the Admiral had been declared faultless To this appeal the gentlemen who stood on the other side of the table answered only that they had not been authorised to give any explanation but that they would report to those who had sent them what had been said three hundred fifty three By this time the Commons were thoroughly tired of the inquiry into the conduct of the war The members had got rid of much of the ill humour which they had brought up with them from their country seats by the simple process of talking it away Burnet hints that those arts of which Caermarthen and Trevor were the great masters were employed for the purpose of averting votes which would have seriously embarrassed the government But though it is not improbable that a few noisy pretenders to patriotism may have been quieted with bags of guineas it would be absurd to suppose that the House generally was influenced in this manner Whoever has seen anything of such assemblies knows that the spirit with which they enter on long inquiries very soon flags and that their resentment if not kept alive by injudicious opposition cools fast In a short time every body was sick of the Grand Committee of Advice The debates had been tedious and desultory The resolutions which had been carried were for the most part merely childish The King was to be humbly advised to employ men of ability and integrity He was to be humbly advised to employ men who would stand by him against James The patience of the House was wearied out by long discussions ending in the pompous promulgation of truisms like these At last the explosion came One of the grumblers called the attention of the Grand Committee to the alarming fact that two Dutchmen were employed in the Ordnance department and moved that the King should be humbly advised to dismiss them The motion was received with disdainful mockery It was remarked that the military men especially were loud in the expression of contempt Do we seriously think of going to the King and telling him that as he has condescended to ask our advice at this momentous crisis we humbly advise him to turn a Dutch storekeeper out of the Tower Really if we have no more important suggestion to carry up to the throne we may as well go to our dinners The members generally were of the same mind The chairman was voted out of the chair and was not directed to ask leave to sit again The Grand Committee ceased to exist The resolutions which it had passed were formally reported to the House One of them was rejected the others were suffered to drop and the Commons after considering during several weeks what advice they should give to the King ended by giving him no advice at all three hundred fifty four The temper of the Lords was different From many circumstances it appears that there was no place where the Dutch were at this time so much hated as in the Upper House The dislike with which an Englishman of the middle class regarded the King s foreign friends was merely national But the dislike with which an English nobleman regarded them was personal They stood between him and Majesty They intercepted from him the rays of royal favour The preference given to them wounded him both in his interests and in his pride His chance of the Garter was much smaller since they had become his competitors He might have been Master of the Horse but for Auverquerque Master of the Robes but for Zulestein Groom of the Stole but for Bentinck three hundred fifty five The ill humour of the aristocracy was inflamed by Marlborough who at this time affected the character of a patriot persecuted for standing up against the Dutch in defence of the interests of his native land and who did not foresee that a day would come when he would be accused of sacrificing the interests of his native land to gratify the Dutch The Peers determined to present an address requesting William not to place his English troops under the command of a foreign general They took up very seriously that question which had moved the House of Commons to laughter and solemnly counselled their Sovereign not to employ foreigners in his magazines At Marlborough s suggestion they urged the King to insist that the youngest English general should take precedence of the oldest general in the service of the States General It was they said derogatory to the dignity of the Crown that an officer who held a commission from His Majesty should ever be commanded by an officer who held a similar commission from a republic To this advice evidently dictated by an ignoble malevolence to Holland William who troubled himself little about votes of the Upper House which were not backed by the Lower returned as might have been expected a very short and dry answer three hundred fifty six While the inquiry into the conduct of the war was pending the Commons resumed the consideration of an important subject which had occupied much of their attention in the preceding year The Bill for the Regulation of Trials in cases of High Treason was again brought in but was strongly opposed by the official men both Whigs and Tories Somers now Attorney General strongly recommended delay That the law as it stood was open to grave objections was not denied but it was contended that the proposed reform would at that moment produce more harm than good Nobody would assert that under the existing government the lives of innocent subjects were in any danger Nobody would deny that the government itself was in great danger Was it the part of wise men to increase the perils of that which was already in serious peril for the purpose of giving new security to that which was already perfectly secure Those who held this language were twitted with their inconsistency and asked why they had not ventured to oppose the bill in the preceding session They answered very plausibly that the events which had taken place during the recess had taught an important lesson to all who were capable of learning The country had been threatened at once with invasion and insurrection No rational man doubted that many traitors had made preparations for joining the French and had collected arms ammunition and horses for that purpose Yet though there was abundant moral evidence against these enemies of their country it had not been possible to find legal evidence against a single one of them The law of treason might in theory be harsh and had undoubtedly in times past been grossly abused But a statesman who troubled himself less about theory than about practice and less about times past than about the time present would pronounce that law not too stringent but too lax and would while the commonwealth remained in extreme jeopardy refuse to consent to any further relaxation In spite of all opposition however the principle of the bill was approved by one hundred and seventy one votes to one hundred and fifty two But in the committee it was moved and carried that the new rules of procedure should not come into operation till after the end of the war with France When the report was brought up the House divided on this amendment and ratified it by a hundred and forty five votes to a hundred and twenty five The bill was consequently suffered to drop three hundred fifty seven Had it gone up to the Peers it would in all probability have been lost after causing another quarrel between the Houses For the Peers were fully determined that no such bill should pass unless it contained a clause altering the constitution of the Lord High Steward s Court and a clause altering the constitution of the Lord High Steward s Court would have been less likely than ever to find favour with the Commons For in the course of this session an event took place which proved that the great were only too well protected by the law as it stood and which well deserves to be recorded as a striking illustration of the state of manners and morals in that age Of all the actors who were then on the English stage the most graceful was William Mountford He had every physical qualification for his calling a noble figure a handsome face a melodious voice It was not easy to say whether he succeeded better in heroic or in ludicrous parts He was allowed to be both the best Alexander and the best Sir Courtly Nice that ever trod the boards Queen Mary whose knowledge was very superficial but who had naturally a quick perception of what was excellent in art admired him greatly He was a dramatist as well as a player and has left us one comedy which is not contemptible three hundred fifty eight The most popular actress of the time was Anne Bracegirdle There were on the stage many women of more faultless beauty but none whose features and deportment had such power to fascinate the senses and the hearts of men The sight of her bright black eyes and of her rich brown cheek sufficed to put the most turbulent audience into good humour It was said of her that in the crowded theatre she had as many lovers as she had male spectators Yet no lover however rich however high in rank had prevailed on her to be his mistress Those who are acquainted with the parts which she was in the habit of playing and with the epilogues which it was her especial business to recite will not easily give her credit for any extraordinary measure of virtue or of delicacy She seems to have been a cold vain and interested coquette who perfectly understood how much the influence of her charms was increased by the fame of a severity which cost her nothing and who could venture to flirt with a succession of admirers in the just confidence that no flame which she might kindle in them would thaw her own ice three hundred fifty nine Among those who pursued her with an insane desire was a profligate captain in the army named Hill With Hill was closely bound in a league of debauchery and violence Charles Lord Mohun a young nobleman whose life was one long revel and brawl Hill finding that the beautiful brunette was invincible took it into his head that he was rejected for a more favoured rival and that this rival was the brilliant Mountford The jealous lover swore over his wine at a tavern that he would stab the villain And I said Mohun will stand by my friend From the tavern the pair went with some soldiers whose services Hill had secured to Drury Lane where the lady resided They lay some time in wait for her As soon as she appeared in the street she was seized and hurried to a coach She screamed for help her mother clung round her the whole neighbourhood rose and she was rescued Hill and Mohun went away vowing vengeance They swaggered sword in hand during two hours about the streets near Mountford s dwelling The watch requested them to put up their weapons But when the young lord announced that he was a peer and bade the constables touch him if they durst they let him pass So strong was privilege then and so weak was law Messengers were sent to warn Mountford of his danger but unhappily they missed him He came A short altercation took place between him and Mohun and while they were wrangling Hill ran the unfortunate actor through the body and fled The grand jury of Middlesex consisting of gentlemen of note found a bill of murder against Hill and Mohun Hill escaped Mohun was taken His mother threw herself at William s feet but in vain It was a cruel act said the King I shall leave it to the law The trial came on in the Court of the Lord High Steward and as Parliament happened to be sitting the culprit had the advantage of being judged by the whole body of the peerage There was then no lawyer in the Upper House It therefore became necessary for the first time since Buckhurst had pronounced sentence on Essex and Southampton that a peer who had never made jurisprudence his special study should preside over that grave tribunal Caermarthen who as Lord President took precedence of all the nobility was appointed Lord High Steward A full report of the proceedings has come down to us No person who carefully examines that report and attends to the opinion unanimously given by the judges in answer to a question which Nottingham drew up and in which the facts brought out by the evidence are stated with perfect fairness can doubt that the crime of murder was fully brought home to the prisoner Such was the opinion of the King who was present during the trial and such was the almost unanimous opinion of the public Had the issue been tried by Holt and twelve plain men at the Old Bailey there can be no doubt that a verdict of Guilty would have been returned The Peers however by sixty nine votes to fourteen acquitted their accused brother One great nobleman was so brutal and stupid as to say After all the fellow was but a player and players are rogues All the newsletters all the coffeehouse orators complained that the blood of the poor was shed with impunity by the great Wits remarked that the only fair thing about the trial was the show of ladies in the galleries Letters and journals are still extant in which men of all shades of opinion Whigs Tories Nonjurors condemn the partiality of the tribunal It was not to be expected that while the memory of this scandal was fresh in the public mind the Commons would be induced to give any new advantage to accused peers three hundred sixty The Commons had in the meantime resumed the consideration of another highly important matter the state of the trade with India They had towards the close of the preceding session requested the King to dissolve the old Company and to constitute a new Company on such terms as he should think fit and he had promised to take their request into his serious consideration He now sent a message to inform them that it was out of his power to do what they had asked He had referred the charter of the old Company to the Judges and the judges had pronounced that under the provisions of that charter the old Company could not be dissolved without three years notice and must retain during those three years the exclusive privilege of trading to the East Indies He added that being sincerely desirous to gratify the Commons and finding himself unable to do so in the way which they had pointed out he had tried to prevail on the old Company to agree to a compromise but that body stood obstinately on its extreme rights and his endeavours had been frustrated three hundred sixty one This message reopened the whole question The two factions which divided the City were instantly on the alert The debates in the House were long and warm Petitions against the old Company were laid on the table Satirical handbills against the new Company were distributed in the lobby At length after much discussion it was resolved to present an address requesting the King to give the notice which the judges had pronounced necessary He promised to bear the subject in mind and to do his best to promote the welfare of the kingdom With this answer the House was satisfied and the subject was not again mentioned till the next session three hundred sixty two The debates of the Commons on the conduct of the war on the law of treason and on the trade with India occupied much time and produced no important result But meanwhile real business was doing in the Committee of Supply and the Committee of Ways and Means In the Committee of Supply the estimates passed rapidly A few members declared it to be their opinion that England ought to withdraw her troops from the Continent to carry on the war with vigour by sea and to keep up only such an army as might be sufficient to repel any invader who might elude the vigilance of her fleets But this doctrine which speedily became and long continued to be the badge of one of the great parties in the state was as yet professed only by a small minority which did not venture to call for a division three hundred sixty three In the Committee of Ways and Means it was determined that a great part of the charge of the year should be defrayed by means of an impost which though old in substance was new in form From a very early period to the middle of the seventeenth century our Parliaments had provided for the extraordinary necessities of the government chiefly by granting subsidies A subsidy was raised by an impost on the people of the realm in respect of their reputed estates Landed property was the chief subject of taxation and was assessed nominally at four shillings in the pound But the assessment was made in such a way that it not only did not rise in proportion to the rise in the value of land or to the fall in the value of the precious metals but went on constantly sinking till at length the rate was in truth less than twopence in the pound In the time of Charles the First a real tax of four shillings in the pound on land would probably have yielded near a million and a half but a subsidy amounted to little more than fifty thousand pounds three hundred sixty four The financiers of the Long Parliament devised a more efficient mode of taxing estates The sum which was to be raised was fixed It was then distributed among the counties in proportion to their supposed wealth and was levied within each county by a rate The revenue derived from these assessments in the time of the Commonwealth varied from thirty five thousand pounds to a hundred and twenty thousand pounds a month After the Restoration the legislature seemed for a time inclined to revert in finance as in other things to the ancient practice Subsidies were once or twice granted to Charles the Second But it soon appeared that the old system was much less convenient than the new system The Cavaliers condescended to take a lesson in the art of taxation from the Roundheads and during the interval between the Restoration and the Revolution extraordinary calls were occasionally met by assessments resembling the assessments of the Commonwealth After the Revolution the war with France made it necessary to have recourse annually to this abundant source of revenue In sixteen eighty nine in sixteen ninety and in sixteen ninety one great sums had been raised on the land At length in sixteen ninety two it was determined to draw supplies from real property more largely than ever The Commons resolved that a new and more accurate valuation of estates should be made over the whole realm and that on the rental thus ascertained a pound rate should be paid to the government Such was the origin of the existing land tax The valuation made in sixteen ninety two has remained unaltered down to our own time According to that valuation one shilling in the pound on the rental of the kingdom amounted in round numbers to half a million During a hundred and six years a land tax bill was annually presented to Parliament and was annually passed though not always without murmurs from the country gentlemen The rate was in time of war four shillings in the pound In time of peace before the reign of George the Third only two or three shillings were usually granted and during a short part of the prudent and gentle administration of Walpole the government asked for only one shilling But after the disastrous year in which England drew the sword against her American colonies the rate was never less than four shillings At length in the year seventeen ninety eight the Parliament relieved itself from the trouble of passing a new Act every spring The land tax at four shillings in the pound was made permanent and those who were subject to it were permitted to redeem it A great part has been redeemed and at present little more than a fiftieth of the ordinary revenue required in time of peace is raised by that impost which was once regarded as the most productive of all the resources of the State three hundred sixty five The land tax was fixed for the year sixteen ninety three at four shillings in the pound and consequently brought about two millions into the Treasury That sum small as it may seem to a generation which has expended a hundred and twenty millions in twelve months was such as had never before been raised here in one year by direct taxation It seemed immense both to Englishmen and to foreigners Lewis who found it almost impossible to wring by cruel exactions from the beggared peasantry of France the means of supporting the greatest army and the most gorgeous court that had existed in Europe since the downfall of the Roman empire broke out it is said into an exclamation of angry surprise when he learned that the Commons of England had from dread and hatred of his power unanimously determined to lay on themselves in a year of scarcity and of commercial embarrassment a burden such as neither they nor their fathers had ever before borne My little cousin of Orange he said seems to be firm in the saddle He afterwards added No matter the last piece of gold will win This however was a consideration from which if he had been well informed touching the resources of England he would not have derived much comfort Kensington was certainly a mere hovel when compared to his superb Versailles The display of jewels plumes and lace led horses and gilded coaches which daily surrounded him far outshone the splendour which even on great public occasions our princes were in the habit of displaying But the condition of the majority of the people of England was beyond all doubt such as the majority of the people of France might well have envied In truth what was called severe distress here would have been called unexampled prosperity there The land tax was not imposed without a quarrel between the Houses The Commons appointed commissioners to make the assessment These commissioners were the principal gentlemen of every county and were named in the bill The Lords thought this arrangement inconsistent with the dignity of the peerage They therefore inserted a clause providing that their estates should be valued by twenty of their own order The Lower House indignantly rejected this amendment and demanded an instant conference After some delay which increased the ill humour of the Commons the conference took place The bill was returned to the Peers with a very concise and haughty intimation that they must not presume to alter laws relating to money A strong party among the Lords was obstinate Mulgrave spoke at great length against the pretensions of the plebeians He told his brethren that if they gave way they would abdicate that authority which had belonged to the baronage of England ever since the foundation of the monarchy and that they would have nothing left of their old greatness except their coronets and ermines Burnet says that this speech was the finest that he ever heard in Parliament and Burnet was undoubtedly a good judge of speaking and was neither partial to Mulgrave nor zealous for the privileges of the aristocracy The orator however though he charmed his hearers did not succeed in convincing them Most of them shrank from a conflict in which they would have had against them the Commons united as one man and the King who in case of necessity would undoubtedly have created fifty peers rather than have suffered the land tax bill to be lost Two strong protests however signed the first by twenty seven the second by twenty one dissentients show how obstinately many nobles were prepared to contend at all hazards for the dignity of their caste Another conference was held and Rochester announced that the Lords for the sake of the public interest waived what they must nevertheless assert to be their clear right and would not insist on their amendment three hundred sixty six The bill passed and was followed by bills for laying additional duties on imports and for taxing the dividends of joint stock companies Still however the estimated revenue was not equal to the estimated expenditure The year sixteen ninety two had bequeathed a large deficit to the year sixteen ninety three and it seemed probable that the charge for sixteen ninety three would exceed by about five hundred thousand pounds the charge for sixteen ninety two More than two millions had been voted for the army and ordnance near two millions for the navy three hundred sixty seven Only eight years before fourteen hundred thousand pounds had defrayed the whole annual charge of government More than four times that sum was now required Taxation both direct and indirect had been carried to an unprecedented point yet the income of the state still fell short of the outlay by about a million It was necessary to devise something Something was devised something of which the effects are felt to this day in every part of the globe There was indeed nothing strange or mysterious in the expedient to which the government had recourse It was an expedient familiar during two centuries to the financiers of the Continent and could hardly fail to occur to any English statesman who compared the void in the Exchequer with the overflow in the money market During the interval between the Restoration and the Revolution the riches of the nation had been rapidly increasing Thousands of busy men found every Christmas that after the expenses of the year s housekeeping had been defrayed out of the year s income a surplus remained and how that surplus was to be employed was a question of some difficulty In our time to invest such a surplus at something more than three per cent on the best security that has ever been known in the world is the work of a few minutes But in the seventeenth century a lawyer a physician a retired merchant who had saved some thousands and who wished to place them safely and profitably was often greatly embarrassed Three generations earlier a man who had accumulated wealth in a profession generally purchased real property or lent his savings on mortgage But the number of acres in the kingdom had remained the same and the value of those acres though it had greatly increased had by no means increased so fast as the quantity of capital which was seeking for employment Many too wished to put their money where they could find it at an hour s notice and looked about for some species of property which could be more readily transferred than a house or a field A capitalist might lend on bottomry or on personal security but if he did so he ran a great risk of losing interest and principal There were a few joint stock companies among which the East India Company held the foremost place but the demand for the stock of such companies was far greater than the supply Indeed the cry for a new East India Company was chiefly raised by persons who had found difficulty in placing their savings at interest on good security So great was that difficulty that the practice of hoarding was common We are told that the father of Pope the poet who retired from business in the City about the time of the Revolution carried to a retreat in the country a strong box containing near twenty thousand pounds and took out from time to time what was required for household expenses and it is highly probable that this was not a solitary case At present the quantity of coin which is hoarded by private persons is so small that it would if brought forth make no perceptible addition to the circulation But in the earlier part of the reign of William the Third all the greatest writers on currency were of opinion that a very considerable mass of gold and silver was hidden in secret drawers and behind wainscots The natural effect of this state of things was that a crowd of projectors ingenious and absurd honest and knavish employed themselves in devising new schemes for the employment of redundant capital It was about the year sixteen eighty eight that the word stockjobber was first heard in London In the short space of four years a crowd of companies every one of which confidently held out to subscribers the hope of immense gains sprang into existence the Insurance Company the Paper Company the Lutestring Company the Pearl Fishery Company the Glass Bottle Company the Alum Company the Blythe Coal Company the Swordblade Company There was a Tapestry Company which would soon furnish pretty hangings for all the parlours of the middle class and for all the bedchambers of the higher There was a Copper Company which proposed to explore the mines of England and held out a hope that they would prove not less valuable than those of Potosi There was a Diving Company which undertook to bring up precious effects from shipwrecked vessels and which announced that it had laid in a stock of wonderful machines resembling complete suits of armour In front of the helmet was a huge glass eye like that of a cyclop and out of the crest went a pipe through which the air was to be admitted The whole process was exhibited on the Thames Fine gentlemen and fine ladies were invited to the show were hospitably regaled and were delighted by seeing the divers in their panoply descend into the river and return laden with old iron and ship s tackle There was a Greenland Fishing Company which could not fail to drive the Dutch whalers and herring busses out of the Northern Ocean There was a Tanning Company which promised to furnish leather superior to the best that was brought from Turkey or Russia There was a society which undertook the office of giving gentlemen a liberal education on low terms and which assumed the sounding name of the Royal Academies Company In a pompous advertisement it was announced that the directors of the Royal Academies Company had engaged the best masters in every branch of knowledge and were about to issue twenty thousand tickets at twenty shillings each There was to be a lottery two thousand prizes were to be drawn and the fortunate holders of the prizes were to be taught at the charge of the Company Latin Greek Hebrew French Spanish conic sections trigonometry heraldry japanning fortification bookkeeping and the art of playing the theorbo Some of these companies took large mansions and printed their advertisements in gilded letters Others less ostentatious were content with ink and met at coffeehouses in the neighbourhood of the Royal Exchange Jonathan s and Garraway s were in a constant ferment with brokers buyers sellers meetings of directors meetings of proprietors Time bargains soon came into fashion Extensive combinations were formed and monstrous fables were circulated for the purpose of raising or depressing the price of shares Our country witnessed for the first time those phenomena with which a long experience has made us familiar A mania of which the symptoms were essentially the same with those of the mania of seventeen twenty of the mania of eighteen twenty five of the mania of eighteen forty five seized the public mind An impatience to be rich a contempt for those slow but sure gains which are the proper reward of industry patience and thrift spread through society The spirit of the cogging dicers of Whitefriars took possession of the grave Senators of the City Wardens of Trades Deputies Aldermen It was much easier and much more lucrative to put forth a lying prospectus announcing a new stock to persuade ignorant people that the dividends could not fall short of twenty per cent and to part with five thousand pounds of this imaginary wealth for ten thousand solid guineas than to load a ship with a well chosen cargo for Virginia or the Levant Every day some new bubble was puffed into existence rose buoyant shone bright burst and was forgotten three hundred sixty eight The new form which covetousness had taken furnished the comic poets and satirists with an excellent subject nor was that subject the less welcome to them because some of the most unscrupulous and most successful of the new race of gamesters were men in sad coloured clothes and lank hair men who called cards the Devil s books men who thought it a sin and a scandal to win or lose twopence over a backgammon board It was in the last drama of Shadwell that the hypocrisy and knavery of these speculators was for the first time exposed to public ridicule He died in November sixteen ninety two just before his Stockjobbers came on the stage and the epilogue was spoken by an actor dressed in deep mourning The best scene is that in which four or five stern Nonconformists clad in the full Puritan costume after discussing the prospects of the Mousetrap Company and the Fleakilling Company examine the question whether the godly may lawfully hold stock in a Company for bringing over Chinese ropedancers Considerable men have shares says one austere person in cropped hair and bands but verily I question whether it be lawful or not These doubts are removed by a stout old Roundhead colonel who had fought at Marston Moor and who reminds his weaker brother that the saints need not themselves see the ropedancing and that in all probability there will be no ropedancing to see The thing he says is like to take the shares will sell well and then we shall not care whether the dancers come over or no It is important to observe that this scene was exhibited and applauded before one farthing of the national debt had been contracted So ill informed were the numerous writers who at a later period ascribed to the national debt the existence of stockjobbing and of all the immoralities connected with stockjobbing The truth is that society had in the natural course of its growth reached a point at which it was inevitable that there should be stockjobbing whether there were a national debt or not and inevitable also that if there were a long and costly war there should be a national debt How indeed was it possible that a debt should not have been contracted when one party was impelled by the strongest motives to borrow and another was impelled by equally strong motives to lend A moment had arrived at which the government found it impossible without exciting the most formidable discontents to raise by taxation the supplies necessary to defend the liberty and independence of the nation and at that very moment numerous capitalists were looking round them in vain for some good mode of investing their savings and for want of such a mode were keeping their wealth locked up or were lavishing it on absurd projects Riches sufficient to equip a navy which would sweep the German Ocean and the Atlantic of French privateers riches sufficient to maintain an army which might retake Namur and avenge the disaster of Steinkirk were lying idle or were passing away from the owners into the hands of sharpers A statesman might well think that some part of the wealth which was daily buried or squandered might with advantage to the proprietor to the taxpayer and to the State be attracted into the Treasury Why meet the extraordinary charge of a year of war by seizing the chairs the tables the beds of hardworking families by compelling one country gentleman to cut down his trees before they were ready for the axe another to let the cottages on his land fall to ruin a third to take away his hopeful son from the University when Change Alley was swarming with people who did not know what to do with their money and who were pressing every body to borrow it It was often asserted at a later period by Tories who hated the national debt most of all things and who hated Burnet most of all men that Burnet was the person who first advised the government to contract a national debt But this assertion is proved by no trustworthy evidence and seems to be disproved by the Bishop s silence Of all men he was the least likely to conceal the fact that an important fiscal revolution had been his work Nor was the Board of Treasury at that time one which much needed or was likely much to regard the counsels of a divine At that Board sate Godolphin the most prudent and experienced and Montague the most daring and inventive of financiers Neither of these eminent men could be ignorant that it had long been the practice of the neighbouring states to spread over many years of peace the excessive taxation which was made necessary by one year of war In Italy this practice had existed through many generations France had during the war which began in sixteen seventy two and ended in sixteen seventy nine borrowed not less than thirty millions of our money Sir William Temple in his interesting work on the Batavian federation had told his countrymen that when he was ambassador at the Hague the single province of Holland then ruled by the frugal and prudent De Witt owed about five millions sterling for which interest at four per cent was always ready to the day and that when any part of the principal was paid off the public creditor received his money with tears well knowing that he could find no other investment equally secure The wonder is not that England should have at length imitated the example both of her enemies and of her allies but that the fourth year of her arduous and exhausting struggle against Lewis should have been drawing to a close before she resorted to an expedient so obvious On the fifteenth of December sixteen ninety two the House of Commons resolved itself into a Committee of Ways and Means Somers took the chair Montague proposed to raise a million by way of loan the proposition was approved and it was ordered that a bill should be brought in The details of the scheme were much discussed and modified but the principle appears to have been popular with all parties The moneyed men were glad to have a good opportunity of investing what they had hoarded The landed men hard pressed by the load of taxation were ready to consent to any thing for the sake of present ease No member ventured to divide the House On the twentieth of January the bill was read a third time carried up to the Lords by Somers and passed by them without any amendment three hundred sixty nine By this memorable law new duties were imposed on beer and other liquors These duties were to be kept in the Exchequer separate from all other receipts and were to form a fund on the credit of which a million was to be raised by life annuities As the annuitants dropped off their annuities were to be divided among the survivors till the number of survivors was reduced to seven After that time whatever fell in was to go to the public It was therefore certain that the eighteenth century would be far advanced before the debt would be finally extinguished The rate of interest was to be ten per cent till the year seventeen hundred and after that year seven per cent The advantages offered to the public creditor by this scheme may seem great but were not more than sufficient to compensate him for the risk which he ran It was not impossible that there might be a counterrevolution and it was certain that if there were a counterrevolution those who had lent money to William would lose both interest and principal Such was the origin of that debt which has since become the greatest prodigy that ever perplexed the sagacity and confounded the pride of statesmen and philosophers At every stage in the growth of that debt the nation has set up the same cry of anguish and despair At every stage in the growth of that debt it has been seriously asserted by wise men that bankruptcy and ruin were at hand Yet still the debt went on growing and still bankruptcy and ruin were as remote as ever When the great contest with Lewis the Fourteenth was finally terminated by the Peace of Utrecht the nation owed about fifty millions and that debt was considered not merely by the rude multitude not merely by foxhunting squires and coffeehouse orators but by acute and profound thinkers as an incumbrance which would permanently cripple the body politic Nevertheless trade flourished wealth increased the nation became richer and richer Then came the war of the Austrian Succession and the debt rose to eighty millions Pamphleteers historians and orators pronounced that now at all events our case was desperate Yet the signs of increasing prosperity signs which could neither be counterfeited nor concealed ought to have satisfied observant and reflecting men that a debt of eighty millions was less to the England which was governed by Pelham than a debt of fifty millions had been to the England which was governed by Oxford Soon war again broke forth and under the energetic and prodigal administration of the first William Pitt the debt rapidly swelled to a hundred and forty millions As soon as the first intoxication of victory was over men of theory and men of business almost unanimously pronounced that the fatal day had now really arrived The only statesman indeed active or speculative who did not share in the general delusion was Edmund Burke David Hume undoubtedly one of the most profound political economists of his time declared that our madness had exceeded the madness of the Crusaders Richard Coeur de Lion and Saint Lewis had not gone in the face of arithmetical demonstration It was impossible to prove by figures that the road to Paradise did not lie through the Holy Land but it was possible to prove by figures that the road to national ruin was through the national debt It was idle however now to talk about the road we had done with the road we had reached the goal all was over all the revenues of the island north of Trent and west of Reading were mortgaged Better for us to have been conquered by Prussia or Austria than to be saddled with the interest of a hundred and forty millions three hundred seventy And yet this great philosopher for such he was had only to open his eyes and to see improvement all around him cities increasing cultivation extending marts too small for the crowd of buyers and sellers harbours insufficient to contain the shipping artificial rivers joining the chief inland seats of industry to the chief seaports streets better lighted houses better furnished richer wares exposed to sale in statelier shops swifter carriages rolling along smoother roads He had indeed only to compare the Edinburgh of his boyhood with the Edinburgh of his old age His prediction remains to posterity a memorable instance of the weakness from which the strongest minds are not exempt Adam Smith saw a little and but a little further He admitted that immense as the burden was the nation did actually sustain it and thrive under it in a way which nobody could have foreseen But he warned his countrymen not to repeat so hazardous an experiment The limit had been reached Even a small increase might be fatal three hundred seventy one Not less gloomy was the view which George Grenville a minister eminently diligent and practical took of our financial situation The nation must he conceived sink under a debt of a hundred and forty millions unless a portion of the load were borne by the American colonies The attempt to lay a portion of the load on the American colonies produced another war That war left us with an additional hundred millions of debt and without the colonies whose help had been represented as indispensable Again England was given over and again the strange patient persisted in becoming stronger and more blooming in spite of all the diagnostics and prognostics of State physicians As she had been visibly more prosperous with a debt of a hundred and forty millions than with a debt of fifty millions so she as visibly more prosperous with a debt of two hundred and forty millions than with a debt of a hundred and forty millions Soon however the wars which sprang from the French Revolution and which far exceeded in cost any that the world had ever seen tasked the powers of public credit to the utmost When the world was again at rest the funded debt of England amounted to eight hundred millions If the most enlightened man had been told in seventeen ninety two that in eighteen fifteen the interest on eight hundred millions would be duly paid to the day at the Bank he would have been as hard of belief as if he had been told that the government would be in possession of the lamp of Aladdin or of the purse of Fortunatus It was in truth a gigantic a fabulous debt and we can hardly wonder that the cry of despair should have been louder than ever But again that cry was found to have been as unreasonable as ever After a few years of exhaustion England recovered herself Yet like Addison s valetudinarian who continued to whimper that he was dying of consumption till he became so fat that he was shamed into silence she went on complaining that she was sunk in poverty till her wealth showed itself by tokens which made her complaints ridiculous The beggared the bankrupt society not only proved able to meet all its obligations but while meeting those obligations grew richer and richer so fast that the growth could almost be discerned by the eye In every county we saw wastes recently turned into gardens in every city we saw new streets and squares and markets more brilliant lamps more abundant supplies of water in the suburbs of every great seat of industry we saw villas multiplying fast each embosomed in its gay little paradise of lilacs and roses While shallow politicians were repeating that the energies of the people were borne down by the weight of the public burdens the first journey was performed by steam on a railway Soon the island was intersected by railways A sum exceeding the whole amount of the national debt at the end of the American war was in a few years voluntarily expended by this ruined people in viaducts tunnels embankments bridges stations engines Meanwhile taxation was almost constantly becoming lighter and lighter yet still the Exchequer was full It may be now affirmed without fear of contradiction that we find it as easy to pay the interest of eight hundred millions as our ancestors found it a century ago to pay the interest of eighty millions It can hardly be doubted that there must have been some great fallacy in the notions of those who uttered and of those who believed that long succession of confident predictions so signally falsified by a long succession of indisputable facts To point out that fallacy is the office rather of the political economist than of the historian Here it is sufficient to say that the prophets of evil were under a double delusion They erroneously imagined that there was an exact analogy between the case of an individual who is in debt to another individual and the case of a society which is in debt to a part of itself and this analogy led them into endless mistakes about the effect of the system of funding They were under an error not less serious touching the resources of the country They made no allowance for the effect produced by the incessant progress of every experimental science and by the incessant efforts of every man to get on in life They saw that the debt grew and they forgot that other things grew as well as the debt A long experience justifies us in believing that England may in the twentieth century be better able to bear a debt of sixteen hundred millions than she is at the present time to bear her present load But be this as it may those who so confidently predicted that she must sink first under a debt of fifty millions then under a debt of eighty millions then under a debt of a hundred and forty millions then under a debt of two hundred and forty millions and lastly under a debt of eight hundred millions were beyond all doubt under a twofold mistake They greatly overrated the pressure of the burden they greatly underrated the strength by which the burden was to be borne It may be desirable to add a few words touching the way in which the system of funding has affected the interests of the great commonwealth of nations If it be true that whatever gives to intelligence an advantage over brute force and to honesty an advantage over dishonesty has a tendency to promote the happiness and virtue of our race it can scarcely be denied that in the largest view the effect of this system has been salutary For it is manifest that all credit depends on two things on the power of a debtor to pay debts and on his inclination to pay them The power of a society to pay debts is proportioned to the progress which that society has made in industry in commerce and in all the arts and sciences which flourish under the benignant influence of freedom and of equal law The inclination of a society to pay debts is proportioned to the degree in which that society respects the obligations of plighted faith Of the strength which consists in extent of territory and in number of fighting men a rude despot who knows no law but his own childish fancies and headstrong passions or a convention of socialists which proclaims all property to be robbery may have more than falls to the lot of the best and wisest government But the strength which is derived from the confidence of capitalists such a despot such a convention never can possess That strength and it is a strength which has decided the event of more than one great conflict flies by the law of its nature from barbarism and fraud from tyranny and anarchy to follow civilisation and virtue liberty and order While the bill which first created the funded debt of England was passing with general approbation through the regular stages the two Houses discussed for the first time the great question of Parliamentary Reform It is to be observed that the object of the reformers of that generation was merely to make the representative body a more faithful interpreter of the sense of the constituent body It seems scarcely to have occurred to any of them that the constituent body might be an unfaithful interpreter of the sense of the nation It is true that those deformities in the structure of the constituent body which at length in our own days raised an irresistible storm of public indignation were far less numerous and far less offensive in the seventeenth century than they had become in the nineteenth Most of the boroughs which were disfranchised in eighteen thirty two were if not positively yet relatively much more important places in the reign of William the Third than in the reign of William the Fourth Of the populous and wealthy manufacturing towns seaports and watering places to which the franchise was given in the reign of William the Fourth some were in the reign of William the Third small hamlets where a few ploughmen or fishermen lived under thatched roofs some were fields covered with harvests or moors abandoned to grouse With the exception of Leeds and Manchester there was not at the time of the Revolution a single town of five thousand inhabitants which did not send two representatives to the House of Commons Even then however there was no want of startling anomalies Looe East and West which contained not half the population or half the wealth of the smallest of the hundred parishes of London returned as many members as London three hundred seventy two Old Sarum a deserted ruin which the traveller feared to enter at night lest he should find robbers lurking there had as much weight in the legislature as Devonshire or Yorkshire three hundred seventy three Some eminent individuals of both parties Clarendon for example among the Tories and Pollexfen among the Whigs condemned this system Yet both parties were for very different reasons unwilling to alter it It was protected by the prejudices of one faction and by the interests of the other Nothing could be more repugnant to the genius of Toryism than the thought of destroying at a blow institutions which had stood through ages for the purpose of building something more symmetrical out of the ruins The Whigs on the other hand could not but know that they were much more likely to lose than to gain by a change in this part of our polity It would indeed be a great mistake to imagine that a law transferring political power from small to large constituent bodies would have operated in sixteen ninety two as it operated in eighteen thirty two In eighteen thirty two the effect of the transfer was to increase the power of the town population In sixteen ninety two the effect would have been to make the power of the rural population irresistible Of the one hundred and forty two members taken away in eighteen thirty two from small boroughs more than half were given to large and flourishing towns But in sixteen ninety two there was hardly one large and flourishing town which had not already as many members as it could with any show of reason claim Almost all therefore that was taken from the small boroughs must have been given to the counties and there can be no doubt that whatever tended to raise the counties and to depress the towns must on the whole have tended to raise the Tories and to depress the Whigs From the commencement of our civil troubles the towns had been on the side of freedom and progress the country gentlemen and the country clergymen on the side of authority and prescription If therefore a reform bill disfranchising small constituent bodies and giving additional members to large constituent bodies had become law soon after the Revolution there can be little doubt that a decided majority of the House of Commons would have consisted of rustic baronets and squires high Churchmen high Tories and half Jacobites With such a House of Commons it is almost certain that there would have been a persecution of the Dissenters it is not easy to understand how there could have been an union with Scotland and it is not improbable that there would have been a restoration of the Stuarts Those parts of our constitution therefore which in recent times politicians of the liberal school have generally considered as blemishes were five generations ago regarded with complacency by the men who were most zealous for civil and religious freedom But while Whigs and Tories agreed in wishing to maintain the existing rights of election both Whigs and Tories were forced to admit that the relation between the elector and the representative was not what it ought to be Before the civil wars the House of Commons had enjoyed the fullest confidence of the nation A House of Commons distrusted despised hated by the Commons was a thing unknown The very words would to Sir Peter Wentworth or Sir Edward Coke have sounded like a contradiction in terms But by degrees a change took place The Parliament elected in sixteen sixty one during that fit of joy and fondness which followed the return of the royal family represented not the deliberate sense but the momentary caprice of the nation Many of the members were men who a few months earlier or a few months later would have had no chance of obtaining seats men of broken fortunes and of dissolute habits men whose only claim to public confidence was the ferocious hatred which they bore to rebels and Puritans The people as soon as they had become sober saw with dismay to what an assembly they had during their intoxication confided the care of their property their liberty and their religion And the choice made in a moment of frantic enthusiasm might prove to be a choice for life As the law then stood it depended entirely on the King s pleasure whether during his reign the electors should have an opportunity of repairing their error Eighteen years passed away A new generation grew up To the fervid loyalty with which Charles had been welcomed back to Dover succeeded discontent and disaffection The general cry was that the kingdom was misgoverned degraded given up as a prey to worthless men and more worthless women that our navy had been found unequal to a contest with Holland that our independence had been bartered for the gold of France that our consciences were in danger of being again subjected to the yoke of Rome The people had become Roundheads but the body which alone was authorised to speak in the name of the people was still a body of Cavaliers It is true that the King occasionally found even that House of Commons unmanageable From the first it had contained not a few true Englishmen others had been introduced into it as vacancies were made by death and even the majority courtly as it was could not but feel some sympathy with the nation A country party grew up and became formidable But that party constantly found its exertions frustrated by systematic corruption That some members of the legislature received direct bribes was with good reason suspected but could not be proved That the patronage of the Crown was employed on an extensive scale for the purpose of influencing votes was matter of notoriety A large proportion of those who gave away the public money in supplies received part of that money back in salaries and thus was formed a mercenary band on which the Court might in almost any extremity confidently rely The servility of this Parliament had left a deep impression on the public mind It was the general opinion that England ought to be protected against all risk of being ever again represented during a long course of years by men who had forfeited her confidence and who were retained by a fee to vote against her wishes and interests The subject was mentioned in the Convention and some members wished to deal with it while the throne was still vacant The cry for reform had ever since been becoming more and more importunate The people heavily pressed by taxes were naturally disposed to regard those who lived on the taxes with little favour The war it was generally acknowledged was just and necessary and war could not be carried on without large expenditure But the larger the expenditure which was required for the defence of the nation the more important it was that nothing should be squandered The immense gains of official men moved envy and indignation Here a gentleman was paid to do nothing There many gentlemen were paid to do what would be better done by one The coach the liveries the lace cravat and diamond buckles of the placeman were naturally seen with an evil eye by those who rose up early and lay down late in order to furnish him with the means of indulging in splendour and luxury Such abuses it was the especial business of a House of Commons to correct What then had the existing House of Commons done in the way of correction Absolutely nothing In sixteen ninety indeed while the Civil List was settling some sharp speeches had been made In sixteen ninety one when the Ways and Means were under consideration a resolution had been passed so absurdly framed that it had proved utterly abortive The nuisance continued and would continue while it was a source of profit to those whose duty was to abate it Who could expect faithful and vigilant stewardship from stewards who had a direct interest in encouraging the waste which they were employed to check The House swarmed with placemen of all kinds Lords of the Treasury Lords of the Admiralty Commissioners of Customs Commissioners of Excise Commissioners of Prizes Tellers Auditors Receivers Paymasters Officers of the Mint Officers of the household Colonels of regiments Captains of men of war Governors of forts We send up to Westminster it was said one of our neighbours an independent gentleman in the full confidence that his feelings and interests are in perfect accordance with ours We look to him to relieve us from every burden except those burdens without which the public service cannot be carried on and which therefore galling as they are we patiently and resolutely bear But before he has been a session in Parliament we learn that he is a Clerk of the Green Cloth or a Yeoman of the Removing Wardrobe with a comfortable salary Nay we sometimes learn that he has obtained one of those places in the Exchequer of which the emoluments rise and fall with the taxes which we pay It would be strange indeed if our interests were safe in the keeping of a man whose gains consist in a percentage on our losses The evil would be greatly diminished if we had frequent opportunities of considering whether the powers of our agent ought to be renewed or revoked But as the law stands it is not impossible that he may hold those powers twenty or thirty years While he lives and while either the King or the Queen lives it is not likely that we shall ever again exercise our elective franchise unless there should be a dispute between the Court and the Parliament The more profuse and obsequious a Parliament is the less likely it is to give offence to the Court The worse our representatives therefore the longer we are likely to be cursed with them The outcry was loud Odious nicknames were given to the Parliament Sometimes it was the Officers Parliament sometimes it was the Standing Parliament and was pronounced to be a greater nuisance than even a standing army Two specifics for the distempers of the State were strongly recommended and divided the public favour One was a law excluding placemen from the House of Commons The other was a law limiting the duration of Parliaments to three years In general the Tory reformers preferred a Place Bill and the Whig reformers a Triennial Bill but not a few zealous men of both parties were for trying both remedies Before Christmas a Place Bill was laid on the table of the Commons That bill has been vehemently praised by writers who never saw it and who merely guessed at what it contained But no person who takes the trouble to study the original parchment which embrowned with the dust of a hundred and sixty years reposes among the archives of the House of Lords will find much matter for eulogy About the manner in which such a bill should have been framed there will in our time be little difference of opinion among enlightened Englishmen They will agree in thinking that it would be most pernicious to open the House of Commons to all placemen and not less pernicious to close that House against all placemen To draw with precision the line between those who ought to be admitted and those who ought to be excluded would be a task requiring much time thought and knowledge of details But the general principles which ought to guide us are obvious The multitude of subordinate functionaries ought to be excluded A few functionaries who are at the head or near the head of the great departments of the administration ought to be admitted The subordinate functionaries ought to be excluded because their admission would at once lower the character of Parliament and destroy the efficiency of every public office They are now excluded and the consequence is that the State possesses a valuable body of servants who remain unchanged while cabinet after cabinet is formed and dissolved who instruct every successive minister in his duties and with whom it is the most sacred point of honour to give true information sincere advise and strenuous assistance to their superior for the time being To the experience the ability and the fidelity of this class of men is to be attributed the ease and safety with which the direction of affairs has been many times within our own memory transferred from Tories to Whigs and from Whigs to Tories But no such class would have existed if persons who received salaries from the Crown had been suffered to sit without restriction in the House of Commons Those commissionerships assistant secretaryships chief clerkships which are now held for life by persons who stand aloof from the strife of parties would have been bestowed on members of Parliament who were serviceable to the government as voluble speakers or steady voters As often as the ministry was changed all this crowd of retainers would have been ejected from office and would have been succeeded by another set of members of Parliament who would probably have been ejected in their turn before they had half learned their business Servility and corruption in the legislature ignorance and incapacity in all the departments of the executive administration would have been the inevitable effects of such a system Still more noxious if possible would be the effects of a system under which all the servants of the Crown without exception should be excluded from the House of Commons Aristotle has in that treatise on government which is perhaps the most judicious and instructive of all his writings left us a warning against a class of laws artfully framed to delude the vulgar democratic in seeming but oligarchic in effect three hundred seventy four Had he had an opportunity of studying the history of the English constitution he might easily have enlarged his list of such laws That men who are in the service and pay of the Crown ought not to sit in an assembly specially charged with the duty of guarding the rights and interests of the community against all aggression on the part of the Crown is a plausible and a popular doctrine Yet it is certain that if those who five generations ago held that doctrine had been able to mould the constitution according to their wishes the effect would have been the depression of that branch of the legislature which springs from the people and is accountable to the people and the ascendency of the monarchical and aristocratical elements of our polity The government would have been entirely in patrician hands The House of Lords constantly drawing to itself the first abilities in the realm would have become the most august of senates while the House of Commons would have sunk almost to the rank of a vestry From time to time undoubtedly men of commanding genius and of aspiring temper would have made their appearance among the representatives of the counties and boroughs But every such man would have considered the elective chamber merely as a lobby through which he must pass to the hereditary chamber The first object of his ambition would have been that coronet without which he could not be powerful in the state As soon as he had shown that he could be a formidable enemy and a valuable friend to the government he would have made haste to quit what would then have been in every sense the Lower House for what would then have been in every sense the Upper The conflict between Walpole and Pulteney the conflict between Pitt and Fox would have been transferred from the popular to the aristocratic part of the legislature On every great question foreign domestic or colonial the debates of the nobles would have been impatiently expected and eagerly devoured The report of the proceedings of an assembly containing no person empowered to speak in the name of the government no person who had ever been in high political trust would have been thrown aside with contempt Even the control of the purse of the nation must have passed not perhaps in form but in substance to that body in which would have been found every man who was qualified to bring forward a budget or explain an estimate The country would have been governed by Peers and the chief business of the Commons would have been to wrangle about bills for the inclosing of moors and the lighting of towns These considerations were altogether overlooked in sixteen ninety two Nobody thought of drawing a line between the few functionaries who ought to be allowed to sit in the House of Commons and the crowd of functionaries who ought to be shut out The only line which the legislators of that day took pains to draw was between themselves and their successors Their own interest they guarded with a care of which it seems strange that they should not have been ashamed Every one of them was allowed to keep the places which he had got and to get as many more places as he could before the next dissolution of Parliament an event which might not happen for many years But a member who should be chosen after the first of February sixteen ninety three was not to be permitted to accept any place whatever three hundred seventy five In the House of Commons the bill passed through all its stages rapidly and without a single division But in the Lords the contest was sharp and obstinate Several amendments were proposed in committee but all were rejected The motion that the bill should pass was supported by Mulgrave in a lively and poignant speech which has been preserved and which proves that his reputation for eloquence was not unmerited The Lords who took the other side did not it should seem venture to deny that there was an evil which required a remedy but they maintained that the proposed remedy would only aggravate the evil The patriotic representatives of the people had devised a reform which might perhaps benefit the next generation but they had carefully reserved to themselves the privilege of plundering the present generation If this bill passed it was clear that while the existing Parliament lasted the number of placemen in the House of Commons would be little if at all diminished and if this bill passed it was highly probable that the existing Parliament would last till both King William and Queen Mary were dead For as under this bill Their Majesties would be able to exercise a much greater influence over the existing Parliament than over any future Parliament they would naturally wish to put off a dissolution as long as possible The complaint of the electors of England was that now in sixteen ninety two they were unfairly represented It was not redress but mockery to tell them that their children should be fairly represented in seventeen ten or seventeen twenty The relief ought to be immediate and the way to give immediate relief was to limit the duration of Parliaments and to begin with that Parliament which in the opinion of the country had already held power too long The forces were so evenly balanced that a very slight accident might have turned the scale When the question was put that the bill do pass eighty two peers were present Of these forty two were for the bill and forty against it Proxies were then called There were only two proxies for the bill there were seven against it but of the seven three were questioned and were with difficulty admitted The result was that the bill was lost by three votes The majority appears to have been composed of moderate Whigs and moderate Tories Twenty of the minority protested and among them were the most violent and intolerant members of both parties such as Warrington who had narrowly escaped the block for conspiring against James and Aylesbury who afterwards narrowly escaped the block for conspiring against William Marlborough who since his imprisonment had gone all lengths in opposition to the government not only put his own name to the protest but made the Prince of Denmark sign what it was altogether beyond the faculties of His Royal Highness to comprehend three hundred seventy six It is a remarkable circumstance that neither Caermarthen the first in power as well as in abilities of the Tory ministers nor Shrewsbury the most distinguished of those Whigs who were then on bad terms with the Court was present on this important occasion Their absence was in all probability the effect of design for both of them were in the House no long time before and no long time after the division A few days later Shrewsbury laid on the table of the Lord a bill for limiting the duration of Parliaments By this bill it was provided that the Parliament then sitting should cease to exist on the first of January sixteen ninety four and that no future Parliament should last longer than three years Among the Lords there seems to have been almost perfect unanimity on this subject William in vain endeavoured to induce those peers in whom he placed the greatest confidence to support his prerogative Some of them thought the proposed change salutary others hoped to quiet the public mind by a liberal concession and others had held such language when they were opposing the Place Bill that they could not without gross inconsistency oppose the Triennial Bill The whole House too bore a grudge to the other House and had a pleasure in putting the other House in a most disagreeable dilemma Burnet Pembroke nay even Caermarthen who was very little in the habit of siding with the people against the throne supported Shrewsbury My Lord said the King to Caermarthen with bitter displeasure you will live to repent the part which you are taking in this matter three hundred seventy seven The warning was disregarded and the bill having passed the Lords smoothly and rapidly was carried with great solemnity by two judges to the Commons Of what took place in the Commons we have but very meagre accounts but from those accounts it is clear that the Whigs as a body supported the bill and that the opposition came chiefly from Tories Old Titus who had been a politician in the days of the Commonwealth entertained the House with a speech in the style which had been fashionable in those days Parliaments he said resembled the manna which God bestowed on the chosen people They were excellent while they were fresh but if kept too long they became noisome and foul worms were engendered by the corruption of that which had been sweeter than honey Littleton and other leading Whigs spoke on the same side Seymour Finch and Tredenham all stanch Tories were vehement against the bill and even Sir John Lowther on this point dissented from his friend and patron Caermarthen Several Tory orators appealed to a feeling which was strong in the House and which had since the Revolution prevented many laws from passing Whatever they said comes from the Peers is to be received with suspicion and the present bill is of such a nature that even if it were in itself good it ought to be at once rejected merely because it has been brought down from them If their Lordships were to send us the most judicious of all money bills should we not kick it to the door Yet to send us a money bill would hardly be a grosser affront than to send us such a bill as this They have taken an initiative which by every rule of parliamentary courtesy ought to have been left to us They have sate in judgment on us convicted us condemned us to dissolution and fixed the first of January for the execution Are we to submit patiently to so degrading a sentence a sentence too passed by men who have not so conducted themselves as to have acquired any right to censure others Have they ever made any sacrifice of their own interest of their own dignity to the general welfare Have not excellent bills been lost because we would not consent to insert in them clauses conferring new privileges on the nobility And now that their Lordships are bent on obtaining popularity do they propose to purchase it by relinquishing even the smallest of their own oppressive privileges No they offer to their country that which will cost them nothing but which will cost us and will cost the Crown dear In such circumstances it is our duty to repel the insult which has been offered to us and by doing so to vindicate the lawful prerogative of the King Such topics as these were doubtless well qualified to inflame the passions of the House of Commons The near prospect of a dissolution could not be very agreeable to a member whose election was likely to be contested He must go through all the miseries of a canvass must shake hands with crowds of freeholders or freemen must ask after their wives and children must hire conveyances for outvoters must open alehouses must provide mountains of beef must set rivers of ale running and might perhaps after all the drudgery and all the expense after being lampooned hustled pelted find himself at the bottom of the poll see his antagonists chaired and sink half ruined into obscurity All this evil he was now invited to bring on himself and invited by men whose own seats in the legislature were permanent who gave up neither dignity nor quiet neither power nor money but gained the praise of patriotism by forcing him to abdicate a high station to undergo harassing labour and anxiety to mortgage his cornfields and to hew down his woods There was naturally much irritation more probably than is indicated by the divisions For the constituent bodies were generally delighted with the bill and many members who disliked it were afraid to oppose it The House yielded to the pressure of public opinion but not without a pang and a struggle The discussions in the committee seem to have been acrimonious Such sharp words passed between Seymour and one of the Whig members that it was necessary to put the Speaker in the chair and the mace on the table for the purpose of restoring order One amendment was made The respite which the Lords had granted to the existing Parliament was extended from the first of January to Lady Day in order that there might be full time for another session The third reading was carried by two hundred votes to a hundred and sixty one The Lords agreed to the bill as amended and nothing was wanting but the royal assent Whether that assent would or would not be given was a question which remained in suspense till the last day of the session three hundred seventy eight One strange inconsistency in the conduct of the reformers of that generation deserves notice It never occurred to any one of those who were zealous for the Triennial Bill that every argument which could be urged in favour of that bill was an argument against the rules which had been framed in old times for the purpose of keeping parliamentary deliberations and divisions strictly secret It is quite natural that a government which withholds political privileges from the commonalty should withhold also political information But nothing can be more irrational than to give power and not to give the knowledge without which there is the greatest risk that power will be abused What could be more absurd than to call constituent bodies frequently together that they might decide whether their representative had done his duty by them and yet strictly to interdict them from learning on trustworthy authority what he had said or how he had voted The absurdity however appears to have passed altogether unchallenged It is highly probable that among the two hundred members of the House of Commons who voted for the third reading of the Triennial Bill there was not one who would have hesitated about sending to Newgate any person who had dared to publish a report of the debate on that bill or a list of the Ayes and the Noes The truth is that the secrecy of parliamentary debates a secrecy which would now be thought a grievance more intolerable than the Shipmoney or the Star Chamber was then inseparably associated even in the most honest and intelligent minds with constitutional freedom A few old men still living could remember times when a gentleman who was known at Whitehall to have let fall a sharp word against a court favourite would have been brought before the Privy Council and sent to the Tower Those times were gone never to return There was no longer any danger that the King would oppress the members of the legislature and there was much danger that the members of the legislature might oppress the people Nevertheless the words Privilege of Parliament those words which the stern senators of the preceding generation had murmured when a tyrant filled their chamber with his guards those words which a hundred thousand Londoners had shouted in his ears when he ventured for the last time within the walls of their city still retained a magical influence over all who loved liberty It was long before even the most enlightened men became sensible that the precautions which had been originally devised for the purpose of protecting patriots against the displeasure of the Court now served only to protect sycophants against the displeasure of the nation It is also to be observed that few of those who showed at this time the greatest desire to increase the political power of the people were as yet prepared to emancipate the press from the control of the government The Licensing Act which had passed as a matter of course in sixteen eighty five expired in sixteen ninety three and was renewed not however without an opposition which though feeble when compared with the magnitude of the object in dispute proved that the public mind was beginning dimly to perceive how closely civil freedom and freedom of conscience are connected with freedom of discussion On the history of the Licensing Act no preceding writer has thought it worth while to expend any care or labour Yet surely the events which led to the establishment of the liberty of the press in England and in all the countries peopled by the English race may be thought to have as much interest for the present generation as any of those battles and sieges of which the most minute details have been carefully recorded During the first three years of William s reign scarcely a voice seems to have been raised against the restrictions which the law imposed on literature Those restrictions were in perfect harmony with the theory of government held by the Tories and were not in practice galling to the Whigs Roger Lestrange who had been licenser under the last two Kings of the House of Stuart and who had shown as little tenderness to Exclusionists and Presbyterians in that character as in his other character of Observator was turned out of office at the Revolution and was succeeded by a Scotch gentleman who on account of his passion for rare books and his habit of attending all sales of libraries was known in the shops and coffeehouses near Saint Paul s by the name of Catalogue Fraser Fraser was a zealous Whig By Whig authors and publishers he was extolled as a most impartial and humane man But the conduct which obtained their applause drew on him the abuse of the Tories and was not altogether pleasing to his official superior Nottingham three hundred seventy nine No serious difference however seems to have arisen till the year sixteen ninety two In that year an honest old clergyman named Walker who had in the time of the Commonwealth been Gauden s curate wrote a book which convinced all sensible and dispassionate readers that Gauden and not Charles the First was the author of the Icon Basilike This book Fraser suffered to be printed If he had authorised the publication of a work in which the Gospel of Saint John or the Epistle to the Romans had been represented as spurious the indignation of the High Church party could hardly have been greater The question was not literary but religious Doubt was impiety In truth the Icon was to many fervent Royalists a supplementary revelation One of them indeed had gone so far as to propose that lessons taken out of the inestimable little volume should be read in the churches three hundred eighty Fraser found it necessary to resign his place and Nottingham appointed a gentleman of good blood and scanty fortune named Edmund Bohun This change of men produced an immediate and total change of system for Bohun was as strong a Tory as a conscientious man who had taken the oaths could possibly be He had been conspicuous as a persecutor of nonconformists and a champion of the doctrine of passive obedience He had edited Filmer s absurd treatise on the origin of government and had written an answer to the paper which Algernon Sidney had delivered to the Sheriffs on Tower Hill Nor did Bohun admit that in swearing allegiance to William and Mary he had done any thing inconsistent with his old creed For he had succeeded in convincing himself that they reigned by right of conquest and that it was the duty of an Englishman to serve them as faithfully as Daniel had served Darius or as Nehemiah had served Artaxerxes This doctrine whatever peace it might bring to his own conscience found little favour with any party The Whigs loathed it as servile the Jacobites loathed it as revolutionary Great numbers of Tories had doubtless submitted to William on the ground that he was rightfully or wrongfully King in possession but very few of them were disposed to allow that his possession had originated in conquest Indeed the plea which had satisfied the weak and narrow mind of Bohun was a mere fiction and had it been a truth would have been a truth not to be uttered by Englishmen without agonies of shame and mortification three hundred eighty one He however clung to his favourite whimsy with a tenacity which the general disapprobation only made more intense His old friends the stedfast adherents of indefeasible hereditary right grew cold and reserved He asked Sancroft s blessing and got only a sharp word and a black look He asked Ken s blessing and Ken though not much in the habit of transgressing the rules of Christian charity and courtesy murmured something about a little scribbler Thus cast out by one faction Bohun was not received by any other He formed indeed a class apart for he was at once a zealous Filmerite and a zealous Williamite He held that pure monarchy not limited by any law or contract was the form of government which had been divinely ordained But he held that William was now the absolute monarch who might annul the Great Charter abolish trial by jury or impose taxes by royal proclamation without forfeiting the right to be implicitly obeyed by Christian men As to the rest Bohun was a man of some learning mean understanding and unpopular manners He had no sooner entered on his functions than all Paternoster Row and Little Britain were in a ferment The Whigs had under Fraser s administration enjoyed almost as entire a liberty as if there had been no censorship But they were now as severely treated as in the days of Lestrange A History of the Bloody Assizes was about to be published and was expected to have as great a run as the Pilgrim s Progress But the new licenser refused his Imprimatur The book he said represented rebels and schismatics as heroes and martyrs and he would not sanction it for its weight in gold A charge delivered by Lord Warrington to the grand jury of Cheshire was not permitted to appear because His Lordship had spoken contemptuously of divine right and passive obedience Julian Johnson found that if he wished to promulgate his notions of government he must again have recourse as in the evil times of King James to a secret press three hundred eighty two Such restraint as this coming after several years of unbounded freedom naturally produced violent exasperation Some Whigs began to think that the censorship itself was a grievance all Whigs agreed in pronouncing the new censor unfit for his post and were prepared to join in an effort to get rid of him Of the transactions which terminated in Bohun s dismission and which produced the first parliamentary struggle for the liberty of unlicensed printing we have accounts written by Bohun himself and by others but there are strong reasons for believing that in none of those accounts is the whole truth to be found It may perhaps not be impossible even at this distance of time to put together dispersed fragments of evidence in such a manner as to produce an authentic narrative which would have astonished the unfortunate licenser himself There was then about town a man of good family of some reading and of some small literary talent named Charles Blount three hundred eighty three In politics he belonged to the extreme section of the Whig party In the days of the Exclusion Bill he had been one of Shaftesbury s brisk boys and had under the signature of Junius Brutus magnified the virtues and public services of Titus Oates and exhorted the Protestants to take signal vengeance on the Papists for the fire of London and for the murder of Godfrey three hundred eighty four As to the theological questions which were in issue between Protestants and Papists Blount was perfectly impartial He was an infidel and the head of a small school of infidels who were troubled with a morbid desire to make converts He translated from the Latin translation part of the Life of Apollonius of Tyana and appended to it notes of which the flippant profaneness called forth the severe censure of an unbeliever of a very different order the illustrious Bayle three hundred eighty five Blount also attacked Christianity in several original treatises or rather in several treatises purporting to be original for he was the most audacious of literary thieves and transcribed without acknowledgment whole pages from authors who had preceded him His delight was to worry the priests by asking them how light existed before the sun was made how Paradise could be bounded by Pison Gihon Hiddekel and Euphrates how serpents moved before they were condemned to crawl and where Eve found thread to stitch her figleaves To his speculations on these subjects he gave the lofty name of the Oracles of Reason and indeed whatever he said or wrote was considered as oracular by his disciples Of those disciples the most noted was a bad writer named Gildon who lived to pester another generation with doggrel and slander and whose memory is still preserved not by his own voluminous works but by two or three lines in which his stupidity and venality have been contemptuously mentioned by Pope three hundred eighty six Little as either the intellectual or the moral character of Blount may seem to deserve respect it is in a great measure to him that we must attribute the emancipation of the English press Between him and the licensers there was a feud of long standing Before the Revolution one of his heterodox treatises had been grievously mutilated by Lestrange and at last suppressed by orders from Lestrange s superior the Bishop of London three hundred eighty seven Bohun was a scarcely less severe critic than Lestrange Blount therefore began to make war on the censorship and the censor The hostilities were commenced by a tract which came forth without any license and which is entitled A Just Vindication of Learning and of the Liberty of the Press by Philopatris three hundred eighty eight Whoever reads this piece and is not aware that Blount was one of the most unscrupulous plagiaries that ever lived will be surprised to find mingled with the poor thoughts and poor words of a thirdrate pamphleteer passages so elevated in sentiment and style that they would be worthy of the greatest name in letters The truth is that the just Vindication consists chiefly of garbled extracts from the Areopagitica of Milton That noble discourse had been neglected by the generation to which it was addressed had sunk into oblivion and was at the mercy of every pilferer The literary workmanship of Blount resembled the architectural workmanship of those barbarians who used the Coliseum and the Theatre of Pompey as quarries who built hovels out of Ionian friezes and propped cowhouses on pillars of lazulite Blount concluded as Milton had done by recommending that any book might be printed without a license provided that the name of the author or publisher were registered three hundred eighty nine The Just Vindication was well received The blow was speedily followed up There still remained in the Areopagitica many fine passages which Blount had not used in his first pamphlet Out of these passages he constructed a second pamphlet entitled Reasons for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing three hundred ninety To these Reasons he appended a postscript entitled A Just and True Character of Edmund Bohun This character was written with extreme bitterness Passages were quoted from the licenser s writings to prove that he held the doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance He was accused of using his power systematically for the purpose of favouring the enemies and silencing the friends of the Sovereigns whose bread he ate and it was asserted that he was the friend and the pupil of his predecessor Sir Roger Blount s Character of Bohun could not be publicly sold but it was widely circulated While it was passing from hand to hand and while the Whigs were every where exclaiming against the new censor as a second Lestrange he was requested to authorise the publication of an anonymous work entitled King William and Queen Mary Conquerors three hundred ninety one He readily and indeed eagerly complied For in truth there was between the doctrines which he had long professed and the doctrines which were propounded in this treatise a coincidence so exact that many suspected him of being the author nor was this suspicion weakened by a passage to which a compliment was paid to his political writings But the real author was that very Blount who was at that very time labouring to inflame the public both against the Licensing Act and the licenser Blount s motives may easily be divined His own opinions were diametrically opposed to those which on this occasion he put forward in the most offensive manner It is therefore impossible to doubt that his object was to ensnare and to ruin Bohun It was a base and wicked scheme But it cannot be denied that the trap was laid and baited with much skill The republican succeeded in personating a high Tory The atheist succeeded in personating a high Churchman The pamphlet concluded with a devout prayer that the God of light and love would open the understanding and govern the will of Englishmen so that they might see the things which belonged to their peace The censor was in raptures In every page he found his own thoughts expressed more plainly than he had ever expressed them Never before in his opinion had the true claim of their Majesties to obedience been so clearly stated Every Jacobite who read this admirable tract must inevitably be converted The nonjurors would flock to take the oaths The nation so long divided would at length be united From these pleasing dreams Bohun was awakened by learning a few hours after the appearance of the discourse which had charmed him that the titlepage had set all London in a flame and that the odious words King William and Queen Mary Conquerors had moved the indignation of multitudes who had never read further Only four days after the publication he heard that the House of Commons had taken the matter up that the book had been called by some members a rascally book and that as the author was unknown the Serjeant at Arms was in search of the licenser three hundred ninety two Bohun s mind had never been strong and he was entirely unnerved and bewildered by the fury and suddenness of the storm which had burst upon him He went to the House Most of the members whom he met in the passages and lobbies frowned on him When he was put to the bar and after three profound obeisances ventured to lift his head and look round him he could read his doom in the angry and contemptuous looks which were cast on him from every side He hesitated blundered contradicted himself called the Speaker My Lord and by his confused way of speaking raised a tempest of rude laughter which confused him still more As soon as he had withdrawn it was unanimously resolved that the obnoxious treatise should be burned in Palace Yard by the common hangman It was also resolved without a division that the King should be requested to remove Bohun from the office of licenser The poor man ready to faint with grief and fear was conducted by the officers of the House to a place of confinement three hundred ninety three But scarcely was he in his prison when a large body of members clamorously demanded a more important victim Burnet had shortly after he became Bishop of Salisbury addressed to the clergy of his diocese a Pastoral Letter exhorting them to take the oaths In one paragraph of this letter he had held language bearing some resemblance to that of the pamphlet which had just been sentenced to the flames There were indeed distinctions which a judicious and impartial tribunal would not have failed to notice But the tribunal before which Burnet was arraigned was neither judicious nor impartial His faults had made him many enemies and his virtues many more The discontented Whigs complained that he leaned towards the Court the High Churchmen that he leaned towards the Dissenters nor can it be supposed that a man of so much boldness and so little tact a man so indiscreetly frank and so restlessly active had passed through life without crossing the schemes and wounding the feelings of some whose opinions agreed with his He was regarded with peculiar malevolence by Howe Howe had never even while he was in office been in the habit of restraining his bitter and petulant tongue and he had recently been turned out of office in a way which had made him ungovernably ferocious The history of his dismission is not accurately known but it was certainly accompanied by some circumstances which had cruelly galled his temper If rumour could be trusted he had fancied that Mary was in love with him and had availed himself of an opportunity which offered itself while he was in attendance on her as Vice Chamberlain to make some advances which had justly moved her indignation Soon after he was discarded he was prosecuted for having in a fit of passion beaten one of his servants savagely within the verge of the palace He had pleaded guilty and had been pardoned but from this time he showed on every occasion the most rancorous personal hatred of his royal mistress of her husband and of all who were favoured by either It was known that the Queen frequently consulted Burnet and Howe was possessed with the belief that her severity was to be imputed to Burnet s influence three hundred ninety four Now was the time to be revenged In a long and elaborate speech the spiteful Whig for such he still affected to be represented Burnet as a Tory of the worst class There should be a law he said making it penal for the clergy to introduce politics into their discourses Formerly they sought to enslave us by crying up the divine and indefeasible right of the hereditary prince Now they try to arrive at the same result by telling us that we are a conquered people It was moved that the Bishop should be impeached To this motion there was an unanswerable objection which the Speaker pointed out The Pastoral Letter had been written in sixteen eighty nine and was therefore covered by the Act of Grace which had been passed in sixteen ninety Yet a member was not ashamed to say No matter impeach him and force him to plead the Act Few however were disposed to take a course so unworthy of a House of Commons Some wag cried out Burn it burn it and this bad pun ran along the benches and was received with shouts of laughter It was moved that the Pastoral Letter should be burned by the common hangman A long and vehement debate followed For Burnet was a man warmly loved as well as warmly hated The great majority of the Whigs stood firmly by him and his goodnature and generosity had made him friends even among the Tories The contest lasted two days Montague and Finch men of widely different opinions appear to have been foremost among the Bishop s champions An attempt to get rid of the subject by moving the previous question failed At length the main question was put and the Pastoral Letter was condemned to the flames by a small majority in a full house The Ayes were a hundred and sixty two the Noes a hundred and fifty five three hundred ninety five The general opinion at least of the capital seems to have been that Burnet was cruelly treated three hundred ninety six He was not naturally a man of fine feelings and the life which he had led had not tended to make them finer He had been during many years a mark for theological and political animosity Grave doctors had anathematized him ribald poets had lampooned him princes and ministers had laid snares for his life he had been long a wanderer and an exile in constant peril of being kidnapped struck in the boots hanged and quartered Yet none of these things had ever seemed to move him His selfconceit had been proof against ridicule and his dauntless temper against danger But on this occasion his fortitude seems to have failed him To be stigmatized by the popular branch of the legislature as a teacher of doctrines so servile that they disgusted even Tories to be joined in one sentence of condemnation with the editor of Filmer was too much How deeply Burnet was wounded appeared many years later when after his death his History of his Life and Times was given to the world In that work he is ordinarily garrulous even to minuteness about all that concerns himself and sometimes relates with amusing ingenuousness his own mistakes and the censures which those mistakes brought upon him But about the ignominious judgment passed by the House of Commons on his Pastoral Letter he has preserved a most significant silence three hundred ninety seven The plot which ruined Bohun though it did no honour to those who contrived it produced important and salutary effects Before the conduct of the unlucky licenser had been brought under the consideration of Parliament the Commons had resolved without any division and as far as appears without any discussion that the Act which subjected literature to a censorship should be continued But the question had now assumed a new aspect and the continuation of the Act was no longer regarded as a matter of course A feeling in favour of the liberty of the press a feeling not yet it is true of wide extent or formidable intensity began to show itself The existing system it was said was prejudicial both to commerce and to learning Could it be expected that any capitalist would advance the funds necessary for a great literary undertaking or that any scholar would expend years of toil and research on such an undertaking while it was possible that at the last moment the caprice the malice the folly of one man might frustrate the whole design And was it certain that the law which so grievously restricted both the freedom of trade and the freedom of thought had really added to the security of the State Had not recent experience proved that the licenser might himself be an enemy of their Majesties or worse still an absurd and perverse friend that he might suppress a book of which it would be for their interest that every house in the country should have a copy and that he might readily give his sanction to a libel which tended to make them hateful to their people and which deserved to be torn and burned by the hand of Ketch Had the government gained much by establishing a literary police which prevented Englishmen from having the History of the Bloody Circuit and allowed them by way of compensation to read tracts which represented King William and Queen Mary as conquerors In that age persons who were not specially interested in a public bill very seldom petitioned Parliament against it or for it The only petitions therefore which were at this conjuncture presented to the two Houses against the censorship came from booksellers bookbinders and printers three hundred ninety eight But the opinion which these classes expressed was certainly not confined to them The law which was about to expire had lasted eight years It was renewed for only two years It appears from an entry in the journals of the Commons which unfortunately is defective that a division took place on an amendment about the nature of which we are left entirely in the dark The votes were ninety nine to eighty In the Lords it was proposed according to the suggestion offered fifty years before by Milton and stolen from him by Blount to exempt from the authority of the licenser every book which bore the name of an author or publisher This amendment was rejected and the bill passed but not without a protest signed by eleven peers who declared that they could not think it for the public interest to subject all learning and true information to the arbitrary will and pleasure of a mercenary and perhaps ignorant licenser Among those who protested were Halifax Shrewsbury and Mulgrave three noblemen belonging to different political parties but all distinguished by their literary attainments It is to be lamented that the signatures of Tillotson and Burnet who were both present on that day should be wanting Dorset was absent three hundred ninety nine Blount by whose exertions and machinations the opposition to the censorship had been raised did not live to see that opposition successful Though not a very young man he was possessed by an insane passion for the sister of his deceased wife Having long laboured in vain to convince the object of his love that she might lawfully marry him he at last whether from weariness of life or in the hope of touching her heart inflicted on himself a wound of which after languishing long he died He has often been mentioned as a blasphemer and selfmurderer But the important service which by means doubtless most immoral and dishonourable he rendered to his country has passed almost unnoticed four hundred Late in this busy and eventful session the attention of the Houses was called to the state of Ireland The government of that kingdom had during the six months which followed the surrender of Limerick been in an unsettled state It was not till the Irish troops who adhered to Sarsfield had sailed for France and till the Irish troops who had made their election to remain at home had been disbanded that William at length put forth a proclamation solemnly announcing the termination of the civil war From the hostility of the aboriginal inhabitants destitute as they now were of chiefs of arms and of organization nothing was to be apprehended beyond occasional robberies and murders But the war cry of the Irishry had scarcely died away when the first faint murmurs of the Englishry began to be heard Coningsby was during some months at the head of the administration He soon made himself in the highest degree odious to the dominant caste He was an unprincipled man he was insatiable of riches and he was in a situation in which riches were easily to be obtained by an unprincipled man Immense sums of money immense quantities of military stores had been sent over from England Immense confiscations were taking place in Ireland The rapacious governor had daily opportunities of embezzling and extorting and of those opportunities he availed himself without scruple or shame This however was not in the estimation of the colonists his greatest offence They might have pardoned his covetousness but they could not pardon the clemency which he showed to their vanquished and enslaved enemies His clemency indeed amounted merely to this that he loved money more than he hated Papists and that he was not unwilling to sell for a high price a scanty measure of justice to some of the oppressed class Unhappily to the ruling minority sore from recent conflict and drunk with recent victory the subjugated majority was as a drove of cattle or rather as a pack of wolves Man acknowledges in the inferior animals no rights inconsistent with his own convenience and as man deals with the inferior animals the Cromwellian thought himself at liberty to deal with the Roman Catholic Coningsby therefore drew on himself a greater storm of obloquy by his few good acts than by his many bad acts The clamour against him was so violent that he was removed and Sidney went over with the full power and dignity of Lord Lieutenant to hold a Parliament at Dublin four hundred one But the easy temper and graceful manners of Sidney failed to produce a conciliatory effect He does not indeed appear to have been greedy of unlawful gain But he did not restrain with a sufficiently firm hand the crowd of subordinate functionaries whom Coningsby s example and protection had encouraged to plunder the public and to sell their good offices to suitors Nor was the new Viceroy of a temper to bear hard on the feeble remains of the native aristocracy He therefore speedily became an object of suspicion and aversion to the Anglosaxon settlers His first act was to send out the writs for a general election The Roman Catholics had been excluded from every municipal corporation but no law had yet deprived them of the county franchise It is probable however that not a single Roman Catholic freeholder ventured to approach the hustings The members chosen were with few exceptions men animated by the spirit of Enniskillen and Londonderry a spirit eminently heroic in times of distress and peril but too often cruel and imperious in the season of prosperity and power They detested the civil treaty of Limerick and were indignant when they learned that the Lord Lieutenant fully expected from them a parliamentary ratification of that odious contract a contract which gave a licence to the idolatry of the mass and which prevented good Protestants from ruining their Popish neighbours by bringing civil actions for injuries done during the war four hundred two On the fifth of October sixteen ninety two the Parliament met at Dublin in Chichester House It was very differently composed from the assembly which had borne the same title in sixteen eighty nine Scarcely one peer not one member of the House of Commons who had sate at the King s Inns was to be seen To the crowd of O s and Macs descendants of the old princes of the island had succeeded men whose names indicated a Saxon origin A single O an apostate from the faith of his fathers and three Macs evidently emigrants from Scotland and probably Presbyterians had seats in the assembly The Parliament thus composed had then less than the powers of the Assembly of Jamaica or of the Assembly of Virginia Not merely was the Legislature which sate at Dublin subject to the absolute control of the Legislature which sate at Westminster but a law passed in the fifteenth century during the administration of the Lord Deputy Poynings and called by his name had provided that no bill which had not been considered and approved by the Privy Council of England should be brought into either House in Ireland and that every bill so considered and approved should be either passed without amendment or rejected four hundred three The session opened with a solemn recognition of the paramount authority of the mother country The Commons ordered their clerk to read to them the English Act which required them to take the Oath of Supremacy and to subscribe the Declaration against Transubstantiation Having heard the Act read they immediately proceeded to obey it Addresses were then voted which expressed the warmest gratitude and attachment to the King Two members who had been untrue to the Protestant and English interest during the troubles were expelled Supplies liberal when compared with the resources of a country devastated by years of predatory war were voted with eagerness But the bill for confirming the Act of Settlement was thought to be too favourable to the native gentry and as it could not be amended was with little ceremony rejected A committee of the whole House resolved that the unjustifiable indulgence with which the Irish had been treated since the battle of the Boyne was one of the chief causes of the misery of the kingdom A Committee of Grievances sate daily till eleven in the evening and the proceedings of this inquest greatly alarmed the Castle Many instances of gross venality and knavery on the part of men high in office were brought to light and many instances also of what was then thought a criminal lenity towards the subject nation This Papist had been allowed to enlist in the army that Papist had been allowed to keep a gun a third had too good a horse a fourth had been protected against Protestants who wished to bring actions against him for wrongs committed during the years of confusion The Lord Lieutenant having obtained nearly as much money as he could expect determined to put an end to these unpleasant inquiries He knew however that if he quarrelled with the Parliament for treating either peculators or Papists with severity he should have little support in England He therefore looked out for a pretext and was fortunate enough to find one The Commons had passed a vote which might with some plausibility be represented as inconsistent with the Poynings statute Any thing which looked like a violation of that great fundamental law was likely to excite strong disapprobation on the other side of Saint George s Channel The Viceroy saw his advantage and availed himself of it He went to the chamber of the Lords at Chichester House sent for the Commons reprimanded them in strong language charged them with undutifully and ungratefully encroaching on the rights of the mother country and put an end to the session four hundred four Those whom he had lectured withdrew full of resentment The imputation which he had thrown on them was unjust They had a strong feeling of love and reverence for the land from which they sprang and looked with confidence for redress to the supreme Parliament Several of them went to London for the purpose of vindicating themselves and of accusing the Lord Lieutenant They were favoured with a long and attentive audience both by the Lords and by the Commons and were requested to put the substance of what had been said into writing The humble language of the petitioners and their protestations that they had never intended to violate the Poynings statute or to dispute the paramount authority of England effaced the impression which Sidney s accusations had made Both Houses addressed the King on the state of Ireland They censured no delinquent by name but they expressed an opinion that there had been gross maladministration that the public had been plundered and that Roman Catholics had been treated with unjustifiable tenderness William in reply promised that what was amiss should be corrected His friend Sidney was soon recalled and consoled for the loss of the viceregal dignity with the lucrative place of Master of the Ordnance The government of Ireland was for a time entrusted to Lords justices among whom Sir Henry Capel a zealous Whig very little disposed to show indulgence to Papists had the foremost place The prorogation drew nigh and still the fate of the Triennial Bill was uncertain Some of the ablest ministers thought the bill a good one and even had they thought it a bad one they would probably have tried to dissuade their master from rejecting it It was impossible however to remove from his mind the impression that a concession on this point would seriously impair his authority Not relying on the judgment of his ordinary advisers he sent Portland to ask the opinion of Sir William Temple Temple had made a retreat for himself at a place called Moor Park in the neighbourhood of Farnham The country round his dwelling was almost a wilderness His amusement during some years had been to create in the waste what those Dutch burgomasters among whom he had passed some of the best years of his life would have considered as a paradise His hermitage had been occasionally honoured by the presence of the King who had from a boy known and esteemed the author of the Triple Alliance and who was well pleased to find among the heath and furze of the wilds of Surrey a spot which seemed to be part of Holland a straight canal a terrace rows of clipped trees and rectangular beds of flowers and potherbs Portland now repaired to this secluded abode and consulted the oracle Temple was decidedly of opinion that the bill ought to pass He was apprehensive that the reasons which led him to form this opinion might not be fully and correctly reported to the King by Portland who was indeed as brave a soldier and as trusty a friend as ever lived whose natural abilities were not inconsiderable and who in some departments of business had great experience but who was very imperfectly acquainted with the history and constitution of England As the state of Sir William s health made it impossible for him to go himself to Kensington he determined to send his secretary thither The secretary was a poor scholar of four or five and twenty under whose plain garb and ungainly deportment were concealed some of the choicest gifts that have ever been bestowed on any of the children of men rare powers of observation brilliant wit grotesque invention humour of the most austere flavour yet exquisitely delicious eloquence singularly pure manly and perspicuous This young man was named Jonathan Swift He was born in Ireland but would have thought himself insulted if he had been called an Irishman He was of unmixed English blood and through life regarded the aboriginal population of the island in which he first drew breath as an alien and a servile caste He had in the late reign kept terms at the University of Dublin but had been distinguished there only by his irregularities and had with difficulty obtained his degree At the time of the Revolution he had with many thousands of his fellow colonists taken refuge in the mother country from the violence of Tyrconnel and had thought himself fortunate in being able to obtain shelter at Moor Park four hundred five For that shelter however he had to pay a heavy price He was thought to be sufficiently remunerated for his services with twenty pounds a year and his board He dined at the second table Sometimes indeed when better company was not to be had he was honoured by being invited to play at cards with his patron and on such occasions Sir William was so generous as to give his antagonist a little silver to begin with four hundred six The humble student would not have dared to raise his eyes to a lady of family but when he had become a clergyman he began after the fashion of the clergymen of that generation to make love to a pretty waitingmaid who was the chief ornament of the servants hall and whose name is inseparably associated with his in a sad and mysterious history Swift many years later confessed some part of what he felt when he found himself on his way to Court His spirit had been bowed down and might seem to have been broken by calamities and humiliations The language which he was in the habit of holding to his patron as far as we can judge from the specimens which still remain was that of a lacquey or rather of a beggar four hundred seven A sharp word or a cold look of the master sufficed to make the servant miserable during several days four hundred eight But this tameness was merely the tameness with which a tiger caught caged and starved submits to the keeper who brings him food The humble menial was at heart the haughtiest the most aspiring the most vindictive the most despotic of men And now at length a great a boundless prospect was opening before him To William he was already slightly known At Moor Park the King had sometimes when his host was confined by gout to an easy chair been attended by the secretary about the grounds His Majesty had condescended to teach his companion the Dutch way of cutting and eating asparagus and had graciously asked whether mister Swift would like to have a captain s commission in a cavalry regiment But now for the first time the young man was to stand in the royal presence as a counsellor He was admitted into the closet delivered a letter from Temple and explained and enforced the arguments which that letter contained concisely but doubtless with clearness and ability There was he said no reason to think that short Parliaments would be more disposed than long Parliaments to encroach on the just prerogatives of the Crown In fact the Parliament which had in the preceding generation waged war against a king led him captive sent him to the prison to the bar to the scaffold was known in our annals as emphatically the Long Parliament Never would such disasters have befallen the monarchy but for the fatal law which secured that assembly from dissolution four hundred nine There was it must be owned a flaw in this reasoning which a man less shrewd than William might easily detect That one restriction of the royal prerogative had been mischievous did not prove that another restriction would be salutary It by no means followed because one sovereign had been ruined by being unable to get rid of a hostile Parliament that another sovereign might not be ruined by being forced to part with a friendly Parliament To the great mortification of the ambassador his arguments failed to shake the King s resolution On the fourteenth of March the Commons were summoned to the Upper House the title of the Triennial Bill was read and it was announced after the ancient form that the King and Queen would take the matter into their consideration The Parliament was then prorogued Soon after the prorogation William set out for the Continent It was necessary that before his departure he should make some important changes He was resolved not to discard Nottingham on whose integrity a virtue rare among English statesmen he placed a well founded reliance Yet if Nottingham remained Secretary of State it was impossible to employ Russell at sea Russell though much mortified was induced to accept a lucrative post in the household and two naval officers of great note in their profession Killegrew and Delaval were placed at the Board of Admiralty and entrusted with the command of the Channel Fleet four hundred ten These arrangements caused much murmuring among the Whigs for Killegrew and Delaval were certainly Tories and were by many suspected of being Jacobites But other promotions which took place at the same time proved that the King wished to bear himself evenly between the hostile factions Nottingham had during a year been the sole Secretary of State He was now joined with a colleague in whose society he must have felt himself very ill at ease John Trenchard Trenchard belonged to the extreme section of the Whig party He was a Taunton man animated by that spirit which had during two generations peculiarly distinguished Taunton He had in the days of Popeburnings and of Protestant flails been one of the renowned Green Riband Club he had been an active member of several stormy Parliaments he had brought in the first Exclusion Bill he had been deeply concerned in the plots formed by the chiefs of the opposition he had fled to the Continent he had been long an exile and he had been excepted by name from the general pardon of sixteen eighty six Though his life had been passed in turmoil his temper was naturally calm but he was closely connected with a set of men whose passions were far fiercer than his own He had married the sister of Hugh Speke one of the falsest and most malignant of the libellers who brought disgrace on the cause of constitutional freedom Aaron Smith the solicitor of the Treasury a man in whom the fanatic and the pettifogger were strangely united possessed too much influence over the new Secretary with whom he had ten years before discussed plans of rebellion at the Rose Why Trenchard was selected in preference to many men of higher rank and greater ability for a post of the first dignity and importance it is difficult to say It seems however that though he bore the title and drew the salary of Secretary of State he was not trusted with any of the graver secrets of State and that he was little more than a superintendent of police charged to look after the printers of unlicensed books the pastors of nonjuring congregations and the haunters of treason taverns four hundred eleven Another Whig of far higher character was called at the same time to a far higher place in the administration The Great Seal had now been four years in commission Since Maynard s retirement the constitution of the Court of Chancery had commanded little respect Trevor who was the First Commissioner wanted neither parts nor learning but his integrity was with good reason suspected and the duties which as Speaker of the House of Commons he had to perform during four or five months in the busiest part of every year made it impossible for him to be an efficient judge in equity Every suitor complained that he had to wait a most unreasonable time for a judgment and that when at length a judgment had been pronounced it was very likely to be reversed on appeal Meanwhile there was no efficient minister of justice no great functionary to whom it especially belonged to advise the King touching the appointment of judges of Counsel for the Crown of Justices of the Peace four hundred twelve It was known that William was sensible of the inconvenience of this state of things and during several months there had been flying rumours that a Lord Keeper or a Lord Chancellor would soon be appointed four hundred thirteen The name most frequently mentioned was that of Nottingham But the same reasons which had prevented him from accepting the Great Seal in sixteen eighty nine had since that year rather gained than lost strength William at length fixed his choice on Somers Somers was only in his forty second year and five years had not elapsed since on the great day of the trial of the Bishops his powers had first been made known to the world From that time his fame had been steadily and rapidly rising Neither in forensic nor in parliamentary eloquence had he any superior The consistency of his public conduct had gained for him the entire confidence of the Whigs and the urbanity of his manners had conciliated the Tories It was not without great reluctance that he consented to quit an assembly over which he exercised an immense influence for an assembly where it would be necessary for him to sit in silence He had been but a short time in great practice His savings were small Not having the means of supporting a hereditary title he must if he accepted the high dignity which was offered to him preside during some years in the Upper House without taking part in the debates The opinion of others however was that he would be more useful as head of the law than as head of the Whig party in the Commons He was sent for to Kensington and called into the Council Chamber Caermarthen spoke in the name of the King Sir John he said it is necessary for the public service that you should take this charge upon you and I have it in command from His Majesty to say that he can admit of no excuse Somers submitted The seal was delivered to him with a patent which entitled him to a pension of two thousand a year from the day on which he should quit his office and he was immediately sworn in a Privy Councillor and Lord Keeper four hundred fourteen The Gazette which announced these changes in the administration announced also the King s departure He set out for Holland on the twenty fourth of March He left orders that the Estates of Scotland should after a recess of more than two years and a half be again called together Hamilton who had lived many months in retirement had since the fall of Melville been reconciled to the Court and now consented to quit his retreat and to occupy Holyrood House as Lord High Commissioner It was necessary that one of the Secretaries of State for Scotland should be in attendance on the King The Master of Stair had therefore gone to the Continent His colleague Johnstone was chief manager for the Crown at Edinburgh and was charged to correspond regularly with Carstairs who never quitted William four hundred fifteen It might naturally have been expected that the session would be turbulent The Parliament was that very Parliament which had in sixteen eighty nine passed by overwhelming majorities all the most violent resolutions which Montgomery and his club could frame which had refused supplies which had proscribed the ministers of the Crown which had closed the Courts of justice which had seemed bent on turning Scotland into an oligarchical republic In sixteen ninety the Estates had been in a better temper Yet even in sixteen ninety they had when the ecclesiastical polity of the realm was under consideration paid little deference to what was well known to be the royal wish They had abolished patronage they had sanctioned the rabbling of the episcopal clergy they had refused to pass a Toleration Act It seemed likely that they would still be found unmanageable when questions touching religion came before them and such questions it was unfortunately necessary to bring forward William had during the recess attempted to persuade the General Assembly of the Church to receive into communion such of the old curates as should subscribe the Confession of Faith and should submit to the government of Synods But the attempt had failed and the Assembly had consequently been dissolved by the Lord Commissioner Unhappily the Act which established the Presbyterian polity had not defined the extent of the power which was to be exercised by the Sovereign over the Spiritual Courts No sooner therefore had the dissolution been announced than the Moderator requested permission to speak He was told that he was now merely a private person As a private person he requested a hearing and protested in the name of his brethren against the royal mandate The right he said of the office bearers of the Church to meet and deliberate touching her interests was derived from her Divine Head and was not dependent on the pleasure of the temporal magistrate His brethren stood up and by an approving murmur signified their concurrence in what their President had said Before they retired they fixed a day for their next meeting four hundred sixteen It was indeed a very distant day and when it came neither minister nor elder attended for even the boldest members shrank from a complete rupture with the civil power But though there was not open war between the Church and the Government they were estranged from each other jealous of each other and afraid of each other No progress had been made towards a reconciliation when the Estates met and which side the Estates would take might well be doubted But the proceedings of this strange Parliament in almost every one of its sessions falsified all the predictions of politicians It had once been the most unmanageable of senates It was now the most obsequious Yet the old men had again met in the old hall There were all the most noisy agitators of the club with the exception of Montgomery who was dying of want and of a broken heart in a garret far from his native land There was the canting Ross and the perfidious Annandale There was Sir Patrick Hume lately created a peer and henceforth to be called Lord Polwarth but still as eloquent as when his interminable declamations and dissertations ruined the expedition of Argyle But the whole spirit of the assembly had undergone a change The members listened with profound respect to the royal letter and returned an answer in reverential and affectionate language An extraordinary aid of a hundred and fourteen thousand pounds sterling was granted to the Crown Severe laws were enacted against the Jacobites The legislation on ecclesiastical matters was as Erastian as William himself could have desired An Act was passed requiring all ministers of the Established Church to swear fealty to their Majesties and directing the General Assembly to receive into communion those Episcopalian ministers not yet deprived who should declare that they conformed to the Presbyterian doctrine and discipline four hundred seventeen Nay the Estates carried adulation so far as to make it their humble request to the King that he would be pleased to confer a Scotch peerage on his favourite Portland This was indeed their chief petition They did not ask for redress of a single grievance They contented themselves with hinting in general terms that there were abuses which required correction and with referring the King for fuller information to his own Ministers the Lord High Commissioner and the Secretary of State four hundred eighteen There was one subject on which it may seem strange that even the most servile of Scottish Parliaments should have kept silence More than a year had elapsed since the massacre of Glencoe and it might have been expected that the whole assembly peers commissioners of shires commissioners of burghs would with one voice have demanded a strict investigation into that great crime It is certain however that no motion for investigation was made The state of the Gaelic clans was indeed taken into consideration A law was passed for the more effectual suppressing of depredations and outrages beyond the Highland line and in that law was inserted a special proviso reserving to Mac Callum More his hereditary jurisdiction But it does not appear either from the public records of the proceedings of the Estates or from those private letters in which Johnstone regularly gave Carstairs an account of what had passed that any speaker made any allusion to the fate of Mac Ian and his kinsmen four hundred nineteen The only explanation of this extraordinary silence seems to be that the public men who were assembled in the capital of Scotland knew little and cared little about the fate of a thieving tribe of Celts The injured clan bowed down by fear of the allpowerful Campbells and little accustomed to resort to the constituted authorities of the kingdom for protection or redress presented no petition to the Estates The story of the butchery had been told at coffeehouses but had been told in different ways Very recently one or two books in which the facts were but too truly related had come forth from the secret presses of London But those books were not publicly exposed to sale They bore the name of no responsible author The Jacobite writers were as a class savagely malignant and utterly regardless of truth Since the Macdonalds did not complain a prudent man might naturally be unwilling to incur the displeasure of the King of the ministers and of the most powerful family in Scotland by bringing forward an accusation grounded on nothing but reports wandering from mouth to mouth or pamphlets which no licenser had approved to which no author had put his name and which no bookseller ventured to place in his shop window But whether this be or be not the true solution it is certain that the Estates separated quietly after a session of two months during which as far as can now be discovered the name of Glencoe was not once uttered in the Parliament House CHAPTER XX State of the Court of Saint

Saint Germains James after seeing the fleet which was to have convoyed him back to his kingdom burned down to the water edge had returned in no good humour to his abode near Paris Misfortune generally made him devout after his own fashion and he now starved himself and flogged himself till his spiritual guides were forced to interfere four hundred twenty It is difficult to conceive a duller place than Saint Germains was when he held his Court there and yet there was scarcely in all Europe a residence more enviably situated than that which the generous Lewis had assigned to his suppliants The woods were magnificent the air clear and salubrious the prospects extensive and cheerful No charm of rural life was wanting and the towers of the most superb city of the Continent were visible in the distance The royal apartments were richly adorned with tapestry and marquetry vases of silver and mirrors in gilded frames A pension of more than forty thousand pounds sterling was annually paid to James from the French Treasury He had a guard of honour composed of some of the finest soldiers in Europe If he wished to amuse himself with field sports he had at his command an establishment far more sumptuous than that which had belonged to him when he was at the head of a great kingdom an army of huntsmen and fowlers a vast arsenal of guns spears buglehorns and tents miles of network staghounds foxhounds harriers packs for the boar and packs for the wolf gerfalcons for the heron and haggards for the wild duck His presence chamber and his antechamber were in outward show as splendid as when he was at Whitehall He was still surrounded by blue ribands and white staves But over the mansion and the domain brooded a constant gloom the effect partly of bitter regrets and of deferred hopes but chiefly of the abject superstition which had taken complete possession of his own mind and which was affected by almost all those who aspired to his favour His palace wore the aspect of a monastery There were three places of worship within the spacious pile Thirty or forty ecclesiastics were lodged in the building and their apartments were eyed with envy by noblemen and gentlemen who had followed the fortunes of their Sovereign and who thought it hard that when there was so much room under his roof they should be forced to sleep in the garrets of the neighbouring town Among the murmurers was the brilliant Anthony Hamilton He has left us a sketch of the life of Saint Germains a slight sketch indeed but not unworthy of the artist to whom we owe the most highly finished and vividly coloured picture of the English Court in the days when the English Court was gayest He complains that existence was one round of religious exercises that in order to live in peace it was necessary to pass half the day in devotion or in the outward show of devotion that if he tried to dissipate his melancholy by breathing the fresh air of that noble terrace which looks down on the valley of the Seine he was driven away by the clamour of a Jesuit who had got hold of some unfortunate Protestant royalists from England and was proving to them that no heretic could go to heaven In general Hamilton said men suffering under a common calamity have a strong fellow feeling and are disposed to render good offices to each other But it was not so at Saint Germains There all was discord jealousy bitterness of spirit Malignity was concealed under the show of friendship and of piety All the saints of the royal household were praying for each other and backbiting each other from morning to night Here and there in the throng of hypocrites might be remarked a man too highspirited to dissemble But such a man however advantageously he might have made himself known elsewhere was certain to be treated with disdain by the inmates of that sullen abode four hundred twenty one Such was the Court of James as described by a Roman Catholic Yet however disagreeable that Court may have been to a Roman Catholic it was infinitely more disagreeable to a Protestant For the Protestant had to endure in addition to all the dulness of which the Roman Catholic complained a crowd of vexations from which the Roman Catholic was free In every competition between a Protestant and a Roman Catholic the Roman Catholic was preferred In every quarrel between a Protestant and a Roman Catholic the Roman Catholic was supposed to be in the right While the ambitious Protestant looked in vain for promotion while the dissipated Protestant looked in vain for amusement the serious Protestant looked in vain for spiritual instruction and consolation James might no doubt easily have obtained permission for those members of the Church of England who had sacrificed every thing in his cause to meet privately in some modest oratory and to receive the eucharistic bread and wine from the hands of one of their own clergy but he did not wish his residence to be defiled by such impious rites Doctor Dennis Granville who had quitted the richest deanery the richest archdeaconry and one of the richest livings in England rather than take the oaths gave mortal offence by asking leave to read prayers to the exiles of his own communion His request was refused and he was so grossly insulted by his master s chaplains and their retainers that he was forced to quit Saint Germains Lest some other Anglican doctor should be equally importunate James wrote to inform his agents in England that he wished no Protestant divine to come out to him four hundred twenty two Indeed the nonjuring clergy were at least as much sneered at and as much railed at in his palace as in his nephew s If any man had a claim to be mentioned with respect at Saint Germains it was surely Sancroft Yet it was reported that the bigots who were assembled there never spoke of him but with aversion and disgust The sacrifice of the first place in the Church of the first place in the peerage of the mansion at Lambeth and the mansion at Croydon of immense patronage and of a revenue of more than five thousand a year was thought but a poor atonement for the great crime of having modestly remonstrated against the unconstitutional Declaration of Indulgence Sancroft was pronounced to be just such a traitor and just such a penitent as Judas Iscariot The old hypocrite had it was said while affecting reverence and love for his master given the fatal signal to his master s enemies When the mischief had been done and could not be repaired the conscience of the sinner had begun to torture him He had like his prototype blamed himself and bemoaned himself He had like his prototype flung down his wealth at the feet of those whose instrument he had been The best thing that he could now do was to make the parallel complete by hanging himself four hundred twenty three James seems to have thought that the strongest proof of kindness which he could give to heretics who had resigned wealth country family for his sake was to suffer them to be beset on their dying beds by his priests If some sick man helpless in body and in mind and deafened by the din of bad logic and bad rhetoric suffered a wafer to be thrust into his mouth a great work of grace was triumphantly announced to the Court and the neophyte was buried with all the pomp of religion But if a royalist of the highest rank and most stainless character died professing firm attachment to the Church of England a hole was dug in the fields and at dead of night he was flung into it and covered up like a mass of carrion Such were the obsequies of the Earl of Dunfermline who had served the House of Stuart with the hazard of his life and to the utter ruin of his fortunes who had fought at Killiecrankie and who had after the victory lifted from the earth the still breathing remains of Dundee While living he had been treated with contumely The Scottish officers who had long served under him had in vain entreated that when they were formed into a company he might still be their commander His religion had been thought a fatal disqualification A worthless adventurer whose only recommendation was that he was a Papist was preferred Dunfermline continued during a short time to make his appearance in the circle which surrounded the Prince whom he had served too well but it was to no purpose The bigots who ruled the Court refused to the ruined and expatriated Protestant Lord the means of subsistence he died of a broken heart and they refused him even a grave four hundred twenty four The insults daily offered at Saint Germains to the Protestant religion produced a great effect in England The Whigs triumphantly asked whether it were not clear that the old tyrant was utterly incorrigible and many even of the nonjurors observed his proceedings with shame disgust and alarm four hundred twenty five The Jacobite party had from the first been divided into two sections which three or four years after the Revolution began to be known as the Compounders and the Noncompounders The Compounders were those who wished for a restoration but for a restoration accompanied by a general amnesty and by guarantees for the security of the civil and ecclesiastical constitution of the realm The Noncompounders thought it downright Whiggery downright rebellion to take advantage of His Majesty s unfortunate situation for the purpose of imposing on him any condition The plain duty of his subjects was to bring him back What traitors he would punish and what traitors he would spare what laws he would observe and with what laws he would dispense were questions to be decided by himself alone If he decided them wrongly he must answer for his fault to heaven and not to his people The great body of the English Jacobites were more or less Compounders The pure Noncompounders were chiefly to be found among the Roman Catholics who very naturally were not solicitous to obtain any security for a religion which they thought heretical or for a polity from the benefits of which they were excluded There were also some Protestant nonjurors such as Kettlewell and Hickes who resolutely followed the theory of Filmer to all the extreme consequences to which it led But though Kettlewell tried to convince his countrymen that monarchical government had been ordained by God not as a means of making them happy here but as a cross which it was their duty to take up and bear in the hope of being recompensed for their sufferings hereafter and though Hickes assured them that there was not a single Compounder in the whole Theban legion very few churchmen were inclined to run the risk of the gallows merely for the purpose of reestablishing the High Commission and the Dispensing Power The Compounders formed the main strength of the Jacobite party in England but the Noncompounders had hitherto had undivided sway at Saint Germains No Protestant no moderate Roman Catholic no man who dared to hint that any law could bind the royal prerogative could hope for the smallest mark of favour from the banished King The priests and the apostate Melfort the avowed enemy of the Protestant religion and of civil liberty of Parliaments of trial by jury and of the Habeas Corpus Act were in exclusive possession of the royal ear Herbert was called Chancellor walked before the other officers of state wore a black robe embroidered with gold and carried a seal but he was a member of the Church of England and therefore he was not suffered to sit at the Council Board four hundred twenty six The truth is that the faults of James s head and heart were incurable In his view there could be between him and his subjects no reciprocity of obligation Their duty was to risk property liberty life in order to replace him on the throne and then to bear patiently whatever he chose to inflict upon them They could no more pretend to merit before him than before God When they had done all they were still unprofitable servants The highest praise due to the royalist who shed his blood on the field of battle or on the scaffold for hereditary monarchy was simply that he was not a traitor After all the severe discipline which the deposed King had undergone he was still as much bent on plundering and abasing the Church of England as on the day when he told the kneeling fellows of Magdalene to get out of his sight or on the day when he sent the Bishops to the Tower He was in the habit of declaring that he would rather die without seeing England again than stoop to capitulate with those whom he ought to command four hundred twenty seven In the Declaration of April sixteen ninety two the whole man appears without disguise full of his own imaginary rights unable to understand how any body but himself can have any rights dull obstinate and cruel Another paper which he drew up about the same time shows if possible still more clearly how little he had profited by a sharp experience In that paper he set forth the plan according to which he intended to govern when he should be restored He laid it down as a rule that one Commissioner of the Treasury one of the two Secretaries of State the Secretary at War the majority of the Great Officers of the Household the majority of the Lords of the Bedchamber the majority of the officers of the army should always be Roman Catholics four hundred twenty eight It was to no purpose that the most eminent Compounders sent from London letter after letter filled with judicious counsel and earnest supplication It was to no purpose that they demonstrated in the plainest manner the impossibility of establishing Popish ascendancy in a country where at least forty nine fiftieths of the population and much more than forty nine fiftieths of the wealth and the intelligence were Protestant It was to no purpose that they informed their master that the Declaration of April sixteen ninety two had been read with exultation by his enemies and with deep affliction by his friends that it had been printed and circulated by the usurpers that it had done more than all the libels of the Whigs to inflame the nation against him and that it had furnished those naval officers who had promised him support with a plausible pretext for breaking faith with him and for destroying the fleet which was to have convoyed him back to his kingdom He continued to be deaf to the remonstrances of his best friends in England till those remonstrances began to be echoed at Versailles All the information which Lewis and his ministers were able to obtain touching the state of our island satisfied them that James would never be restored unless he could bring himself to make large concessions to his subjects It was therefore intimated to him kindly and courteously but seriously that he would do well to change his counsels and his counsellors France could not continue the war for the purpose of forcing a Sovereign on an unwilling nation She was crushed by public burdens Her trade and industry languished Her harvest and her vintage had failed The peasantry were starving The faint murmurs of the provincial Estates began to be heard There was a limit to the amount of the sacrifices which the most absolute prince could demand from those whom he ruled However desirous the Most Christian King might be to uphold the cause of hereditary monarchy and of pure religion all over the world his first duty was to his own kingdom and unless a counterrevolution speedily took place in England his duty to his own kingdom might impose on him the painful necessity of treating with the Prince of Orange It would therefore be wise in James to do without delay whatever he could honourably and conscientiously do to win back the hearts of his people Thus pressed James unwillingly yielded He consented to give a share in the management of his affairs to one of the most distinguished of the Compounders Charles Earl of Middleton Middleton s family and his peerage were Scotch But he was closely connected with some of the noblest houses of England he had resided long in England he had been appointed by Charles the Second one of the English Secretaries of State and had been entrusted by James with the lead of the English House of Commons His abilities and acquirements were considerable his temper was easy and generous his manners were popular and his conduct had generally been consistent and honourable He had when Popery was in the ascendant resolutely refused to purchase the royal favour by apostasy Roman Catholic ecclesiastics had been sent to convert him and the town had been much amused by the dexterity with which the layman baffled the divines A priest undertook to demonstrate the doctrine of transubstantiation and made the approaches in the usual form Your Lordship believes in the Trinity Who told you so said Middleton Not believe in the Trinity cried the priest in amazement Nay said Middleton prove your religion to be true if you can but do not catechize me about mine As it was plain that the Secretary was not a disputant whom it was easy to take at an advantage the controversy ended almost as soon as it began four hundred twenty nine When fortune changed Middleton adhered to the cause of hereditary monarchy with a stedfastness which was the more respectable because he would have had no difficulty in making his peace with the new government His sentiments were so well known that when the kingdom was agitated by apprehensions of an invasion and an insurrection he was arrested and sent to the Tower but no evidence on which he could be convicted of treason was discovered and when the dangerous crisis was past he was set at liberty It should seem indeed that during the three years which followed the Revolution he was by no means an active plotter He saw that a Restoration could be effected only with the general assent of the nation and that the nation would never assent to a Restoration without securities against Popery and arbitrary power He therefore conceived that while his banished master obstinately refused to give such securities it would be worse than idle to conspire against the existing government Such was the man whom James in consequence of strong representations from Versailles now invited to join him in France The great body of Compounders learned with delight that they were at length to be represented in the Council at Saint Germains by one of their favourite leaders Some noblemen and gentlemen who though they had not approved of the deposition of James had been so much disgusted by his perverse and absurd conduct that they had long avoided all connection with him now began to hope that he had seen his error They had refused to have any thing to do with Melfort but they communicated freely with Middleton The new minister conferred also with the four traitors whose infamy has been made preeminently conspicuous by their station their abilities and their great public services with Godolphin the great object of whose life was to be in favour with both the rival Kings at once and to keep through all revolutions and counterrevolutions his head his estate and a place at the Board of Treasury with Shrewsbury who having once in a fatal moment entangled himself in criminal and dishonourable engagements had not had the resolution to break through them with Marlborough who continued to profess the deepest repentance for the past and the best intentions for the future and with Russell who declared that he was still what he had been before the day of La Hogue and renewed his promise to do what Monk had done on condition that a general pardon should be granted to all political offenders and that the royal power should be placed under strong constitutional restraints Before Middleton left England he had collected the sense of all the leading Compounders They were of opinion that there was one expedient which would reconcile contending factions at home and lead to the speedy pacification of Europe This expedient was that James should resign the Crown in favour of the Prince of Wales and that the Prince of Wales should be bred a Protestant If as was but too probable His Majesty should refuse to listen to this suggestion he must at least consent to put forth a Declaration which might do away the unfavourable impression made by his Declaration of the preceding spring A paper such as it was thought expedient that he should publish was carefully drawn up and after much discussion approved Early in the year sixteen ninety three Middleton having been put in full possession of the views of the principal English Jacobites stole across the Channel and made his appearance at the Court of James There was at that Court no want of slanderers and sneerers whose malignity was only the more dangerous because it wore a meek and sanctimonious air Middleton found on his arrival that numerous lies fabricated by the priests who feared and hated him were already in circulation Some Noncompounders too had written from London that he was at heart a Presbyterian and a republican He was however very graciously received and was appointed Secretary of State conjointly with Melfort four hundred thirty It very soon appeared that James was fully resolved never to resign the Crown or to suffer the Prince of Wales to be bred a heretic and it long seemed doubtful whether any arguments or entreaties would induce him to sign the Declaration which his friends in England had prepared It was indeed a document very different from any that had yet appeared under his Great Seal He was made to promise that he would grant a free pardon to all his subjects who should not oppose him after he should land in the island that as soon as he was restored he would call a Parliament that he would confirm all such laws passed during the usurpation as the Houses should tender to him for confirmation that he would waive his right to the chimney money that he would protect and defend the Established Church in the enjoyment of all her possessions and privileges that he would not again violate the Test Act that he would leave it to the legislature to define the extent of his dispensing power and that he would maintain the Act of Settlement in Ireland He struggled long and hard He pleaded his conscience Could a son of the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church bind himself to protect and defend heresy and to enforce a law which excluded true believers from office Some of the ecclesiastics who swarmed in his household told him that he could not without sin give any such pledge as his undutiful subjects demanded On this point the opinion of Middleton who was a Protestant could be of no weight But Middleton found an ally in one whom he regarded as a rival and an enemy Melfort scared by the universal hatred of which he knew himself to be the object and afraid that he should be held accountable both in England and in France for his master s wrongheadedness submitted the case to several eminent Doctors of the Sorbonne These learned casuists pronounced the Declaration unobjectionable in a religious point of view The great Bossuet Bishop of Meaux who was regarded by the Gallican Church as a father scarcely inferior in authority to Cyprian or Augustin showed by powerful arguments both theological and political that the scruple which tormented James was precisely of that sort against which a much wiser King had given a caution in the words Be not righteous overmuch four hundred thirty one The authority of the French divines was supported by the authority of the French government The language held at Versailles was so strong that James began to be alarmed What if Lewis should take serious offence should think his hospitality ungratefully requited should conclude a peace with the usurpers and should request his unfortunate guests to seek another asylum It was necessary to submit On the seventeenth of April sixteen ninety three the Declaration was signed and sealed The concluding sentence was a prayer We come to vindicate our own right and to establish the liberties of our people and may God give us success in the prosecution of the one as we sincerely intend the confirmation of the other four hundred thirty two The prayer was heard The success of James was strictly proportioned to his sincerity What his sincerity was we know on the best evidence Scarcely had he called on heaven to witness the truth of his professions when he directed Melfort to send a copy of the Declaration to Rome with such explanations as might satisfy the Pope Melfort s letter ends thus After all the object of this Declaration is only to get us back to England We shall fight the battle of the Catholics with much greater advantage at Whitehall than at Saint Germains four hundred thirty three Meanwhile the document from which so much was expected had been despatched to London There it was printed at a secret press in the house of a Quaker for there was among the Quakers a party small in number but zealous and active which had imbibed the politics of William Penn four hundred thirty four To circulate such a work was a service of some danger but agents were found Several persons were taken up while distributing copies in the streets of the city A hundred packets were stopped in one day at the Post Office on their way to the fleet But after a short time the government wisely gave up the endeavour to suppress what could not be suppressed and published the Declaration at full length accompanied by a severe commentary four hundred thirty five The commentary however was hardly needed The Declaration altogether failed to produce the effect which Middleton had anticipated The truth is that his advice had not been asked till it mattered not what advice he gave If James had put forth such a manifesto in January sixteen eighty nine the throne would probably not have been declared vacant If he had put forth such a manifesto when he was on the coast of Normandy at the head of an army he would have conciliated a large part of the nation and he might possibly have been joined by a large part of the fleet But both in sixteen eighty nine and in sixteen ninety two he had held the language of an implacable tyrant and it was now too late to affect tenderness of heart and reverence for the constitution of the realm The contrast between the new Declaration and the preceding Declaration excited not without reason general suspicion and contempt What confidence could be placed in the word of a Prince so unstable of a Prince who veered from extreme to extreme In sixteen ninety two nothing would satisfy him but the heads and quarters of hundreds of poor ploughmen and boatmen who had several years before taken some rustic liberties with him at which his grandfather Henry the Fourth would have had a hearty laugh In sixteen ninety three the foulest and most ungrateful treasons were to be covered with oblivion Caermarthen expressed the general sentiment I do not he said understand all this Last April I was to be hanged This April I am to have a free pardon I cannot imagine what I have done during the past year to deserve such goodness The general opinion was that a snare was hidden under this unwonted clemency this unwonted respect for law The Declaration it was said was excellent and so was the Coronation oath Every body knew how King James had observed his Coronation oath and every body might guess how he would observe his Declaration While grave men reasoned thus the Whig jesters were not sparing of their pasquinades Some of the Noncompounders meantime uttered indignant murmurs The King was in bad hands in the hands of men who hated monarchy His mercy was cruelty of the worst sort The general pardon which he had granted to his enemies was in truth a general proscription of his friends Hitherto the judges appointed by the usurper had been under a restraint imperfect indeed yet not absolutely nugatory They had known that a day of reckoning might come and had therefore in general dealt tenderly with the persecuted adherents of the rightful King That restraint His Majesty had now taken away He had told Holt and Treby that till he should land in England they might hang royalists without the smallest fear of being called to account four hundred thirty six But by no class of people was the Declaration read with so much disgust and indignation as by the native aristocracy of Ireland This then was the reward of their loyalty This was the faith of kings When England had cast James out when Scotland had rejected him the Irish had still been true to him and he had in return solemnly given his sanction to a law which restored to them an immense domain of which they had been despoiled Nothing that had happened since that time had diminished their claim to his favour They had defended his cause to the last they had fought for him long after he had deserted them many of them when unable to contend longer against superior force had followed him into banishment and now it appeared that he was desirous to make peace with his deadliest enemies at the expense of his most faithful friends There was much discontent in the Irish regiments which were dispersed through the Netherlands and along the frontiers of Germany and Italy Even the Whigs allowed that for once the O s and Macs were in the right and asked triumphantly whether a prince who had broken his word to his devoted servants could be expected to keep it to his foes four hundred thirty seven While the Declaration was the subject of general conversation in England military operations recommenced on the Continent The preparations of France had been such as amazed even those who estimated most highly her resources and the abilities of her rulers Both her agriculture and her commerce were suffering The vineyards of Burgundy the interminable cornfields of the Beauce had failed to yield their increase the looms of Lyons were silent and the merchant ships were rotting in the harbour of Marseilles Yet the monarchy presented to its numerous enemies a front more haughty and more menacing than ever Lewis had determined not to make any advance towards a reconciliation with the new government of England till the whole strength of his realm had been put forth in one more effort A mighty effort in truth it was but too exhausting to be repeated He made an immense display of force at once on the Pyrenees and on the Alps on the Rhine and on the Meuse in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean That nothing might be wanting which could excite the martial ardour of a nation eminently highspirited he instituted a few days before he left his palace for the camp a new military order of knighthood and placed it under the protection of his own sainted ancestor and patron The new cross of Saint Lewis shone on the breasts of the gentlemen who had been conspicuous in the trenches before Mons and Namur and on the fields of Fleurus and Steinkirk and the sight raised a generous emulation among those who had still to win an honourable fame in arms four hundred thirty eight In the week in which this celebrated order began to exist Middleton visited Versailles A letter in which he gave his friends in England an account of his visit has come down to us four hundred thirty nine He was presented to Lewis was most kindly received and was overpowered by gratitude and admiration Of all the wonders of the Court so Middleton wrote its master was the greatest The splendour of the great King s personal merit threw even the splendour of his fortunes into the shade The language which His Most Christian Majesty held about English politics was on the whole highly satisfactory Yet in one thing this accomplished prince and his able and experienced ministers were strangely mistaken They were all possessed with the absurd notion that the Prince of Orange was a great man No pains had been spared to undeceive them but they were under an incurable delusion They saw through a magnifying glass of such power that the leech appeared to them a leviathan It ought to have occurred to Middleton that possibly the delusion might be in his own vision and not in theirs Lewis and the counsellors who surrounded him were far indeed from loving William But they did not hate him with that mad hatred which raged in the breasts of his English enemies Middleton was one of the wisest and most moderate of the Jacobites Yet even Middleton s judgment was so much darkened by malice that on this subject he talked nonsense unworthy of his capacity He like the rest of his party could see in the usurper nothing but what was odious and contemptible the heart of a fiend the understanding and manners of a stupid brutal Dutch boor who generally observed a sulky silence and when forced to speak gave short testy answers in bad English The French statesmen on the other hand judged of William s faculties from an intimate knowledge of the way in which he had during twenty years conducted affairs of the greatest moment and of the greatest difficulty He had ever since sixteen seventy three been playing against themselves a most complicated game of mixed chance and skill for an immense stake they were proud and with reason of their own dexterity at that game yet they were conscious that in him they had found more than their match At the commencement of the long contest every advantage had been on their side They had at their absolute command all the resources of the greatest kingdom in Europe and he was merely the servant of a commonwealth of which the whole territory was inferior in extent to Normandy or Guienne A succession of generals and diplomatists of eminent ability had been opposed to him A powerful faction in his native country had pertinaciously crossed his designs He had undergone defeats in the field and defeats in the senate but his wisdom and firmness had turned defeats into victories Notwithstanding all that could be done to keep him down his influence and fame had been almost constantly rising and spreading The most important and arduous enterprise in the history of modern Europe had been planned and conducted to a prosperous termination by him alone The most extensive coalition that the world had seen for ages had been formed by him and would be instantly dissolved if his superintending care were withdrawn He had gained two kingdoms by statecraft and a third by conquest and he was still maintaining himself in the possession of all three in spite of both foreign and domestic foes That these things had been effected by a poor creature a man of the most ordinary capacity was an assertion which might easily find credence among the nonjuring parsons who congregated at Sam s Coffee house but which moved the laughter of the veteran politicians of Versailles While Middleton was in vain trying to convince the French that William was a greatly overrated man William who did full justice to Middleton s merit felt much uneasiness at learning that the Court of Saint Germains had called in the help of so able a counsellor four hundred forty But this was only one of a thousand causes of anxiety which during that spring pressed on the King s mind He was preparing for the opening of the campaign imploring his allies to be early in the field rousing the sluggish haggling with the greedy making up quarrels adjusting points of precedence He had to prevail on the Cabinet of Vienna to send timely succours into Piedmont He had to keep a vigilant eye on those Northern potentates who were trying to form a third party in Europe He had to act as tutor to the Elector of Bavaria in the Netherlands He had to provide for the defence of Liege a matter which the authorities of Liege coolly declared to be not at all their business but the business of England and Holland He had to prevent the House of Brunswick Wolfenbuttel from going to blows with the House of Brunswick Lunenburg he had to accommodate a dispute between the Prince of Baden and the Elector of Saxony each of whom wished to be at the head of an army on the Rhine and he had to manage the Landgrave of Hesse who omitted to furnish his own contingent and yet wanted to command the contingents furnished by other princes four hundred forty one And now the time for action had arrived On the eighteenth of May Lewis left Versailles early in June he was under the walls of Namur The Princesses who had accompanied him held their court within the fortress He took under his immediate command the army of Boufflers which was encamped at Gembloux Little more than a mile off lay the army of Luxemburg The force collected in that neighbourhood under the French lilies did not amount to less than a hundred and twenty thousand men Lewis had flattered himself that he should be able to repeat in sixteen ninety three the stratagem by which Mons had been taken in sixteen ninety one and Namur in sixteen ninety two and he had determined that either Liege or Brussels should be his prey But William had this year been able to assemble in good time a force inferior indeed to that which was opposed to him but still formidable With this force he took his post near Louvain on the road between the two threatened cities and watched every movement of the enemy Lewis was disappointed He found that it would not be possible for him to gratify his vanity so safely and so easily as in the two preceding years to sit down before a great town to enter the gates in triumph and to receive the keys without exposing himself to any risk greater than that of a staghunt at Fontainebleau Before he could lay siege either to Liege or to Brussels he must fight and win a battle The chances were indeed greatly in his favour for his army was more numerous better officered and better disciplined than that of the allies Luxemburg strongly advised him to march against William The aristocracy of France anticipated with intrepid gaiety a bloody but a glorious day followed by a large distribution of the crosses of the new order William himself was perfectly aware of his danger and prepared to meet it with calm but mournful fortitude four hundred forty two Just at this conjuncture Lewis announced his intention to return instantly to Versailles and to send the Dauphin and Boufflers with part of the army which was assembled near Namur to join Marshal Lorges who commanded in the Palatinate Luxemburg was thunderstruck He expostulated boldly and earnestly Never he said was such an opportunity thrown away If His Majesty would march against the Prince of Orange victory was almost certain Could any advantage which it was possible to obtain on the Rhine be set against the advantage of a victory gained in the heart of Brabant over the principal army and the principal captain of the coalition The Marshal reasoned he implored he went on his knees but in vain and he quitted the royal presence in the deepest dejection Lewis left the camp a week after he had joined it and never afterwards made war in person The astonishment was great throughout his army All the awe which he inspired could not prevent his old generals from grumbling and looking sullen his young nobles from venting their spleen sometimes in curses and sometimes in sarcasms and even his common soldiers from holding irreverent language round their watchfires His enemies rejoiced with vindictive and insulting joy Was it not strange they asked that this great prince should have gone in state to the theatre of war and then in a week have gone in the same state back again Was it necessary that all that vast retinue princesses dames of honour and tirewomen equerries and gentlemen of the bedchamber cooks confectioners and musicians long trains of waggons droves of led horses and sumpter mules piles of plate bales of tapestry should travel four hundred miles merely in order that the Most Christian King might look at his soldiers and then return The ignominious truth was too evident to be concealed He had gone to the Netherlands in the hope that he might again be able to snatch some military glory without any hazard to his person and had hastened back rather than expose himself to the chances of a pitched field four hundred forty three This was not the first time that His Most Christian Majesty had shown the same kind of prudence Seventeen years before he had been opposed under the wails of Bouchain to the same antagonist William with the ardour of a very young commander had most imprudently offered battle The opinion of the ablest generals was that if Lewis had seized the opportunity the war might have been ended in a day The French army had eagerly asked to be led to the onset The King had called his lieutenants round him and had collected their opinions Some courtly officers to whom a hint of his wishes had been dexterously conveyed had blushing and stammering with shame voted against fighting It was to no purpose that bold and honest men who prized his honour more than his life had proved to him that on all principles of the military art he ought to accept the challenge rashly given by the enemy His Majesty had gravely expressed his sorrow that he could not consistently with his public duty obey the impetuous movement of his blood had turned his rein and had galloped back to his quarters four hundred forty four Was it not frightful to think what rivers of the best blood of France of Spain of Germany and of England had flowed and were destined still to flow for the gratification of a man who wanted the vulgar courage which was found in the meanest of the hundreds of thousands whom he had sacrificed to his vainglorious ambition Though the French army in the Netherlands had been weakened by the departure of the forces commanded by the Dauphin and Boufflers and though the allied army was daily strengthened by the arrival of fresh troops Luxemburg still had a superiority of force and that superiority he increased by an adroit stratagem He marched towards Liege and made as if he were about to form the siege of that city William was uneasy and the more uneasy because he knew that there was a French party among the inhabitants He quitted his position near Louvain advanced to Nether Hespen and encamped there with the river Gette in his rear On his march he learned that Huy had opened its gates to the French The news increased his anxiety about Liege and determined him to send thither a force sufficient to overawe malecontents within the city and to repel any attack from without four hundred forty five This was exactly what Luxemburg had expected and desired His feint had served its purpose He turned his back on the fortress which had hitherto seemed to be his object and hastened towards the Gette William who had detached more than twenty thousand men and who had but fifty thousand left in his camp was alarmed by learning from his scouts on the eighteenth of July that the French General with near eighty thousand was close at hand It was still in the King s power by a hasty retreat to put the narrow but deep waters of the Gette which had lately been swollen by rains between his army and the enemy But the site which he occupied was strong and it could easily be made still stronger He set all his troops to work Ditches were dug mounds thrown up palisades fixed in the earth In a few hours the ground wore a new aspect and the King trusted that he should be able to repel the attack even of a force greatly outnumbering his own Nor was it without much appearance of reason that he felt this confidence When the morning of the nineteenth of July broke the bravest men of Lewis s army looked gravely and anxiously on the fortress which had suddenly sprung up to arrest their progress The allies were protected by a breastwork Here and there along the entrenchments were formed little redoubts and half moons A hundred pieces of cannon were disposed along the ramparts On the left flank the village of Romsdorff rose close to the little stream of Landen from which the English have named the disastrous day On the right was the village of Neerwinden Both villages were after the fashion of the Low Countries surrounded by moats and fences and within these enclosures the little plots of ground occupied by different families were separated by mud walls five feet in height and a foot in thickness All these barricades William had repaired and strengthened Saint Simon who after the battle surveyed the ground could hardly he tells us believe that defences so extensive and so formidable could have been created with such rapidity Luxemburg however was determined to try whether even this position could be maintained against the superior numbers and the impetuous valour of his soldiers Soon after sunrise the roar of cannon began to be heard William s batteries did much execution before the French artillery could be so placed as to return the fire It was eight o clock before the close fighting began The village of Neerwinden was regarded by both commanders as the point on which every thing depended There an attack was made by the French left wing commanded by Montchevreuil a veteran officer of high reputation and by Berwick who though young was fast rising to a high place among the captains of his time Berwick led the onset and forced his way into the village but was soon driven out again with a terrible carnage His followers fled or perished he while trying to rally them and cursing them for not doing their duty better was surrounded by foes He concealed his white cockade and hoped to be able by the help of his native tongue to pass himself off as an officer of the English army But his face was recognised by one of his mother s brothers George Churchill who held on that day the command of a brigade A hurried embrace was exchanged between the kinsmen and the uncle conducted the nephew to William who as long as every thing seemed to be going well remained in the rear The meeting of the King and the captive united by such close domestic ties and divided by such inexpiable injuries was a strange sight Both behaved as became them William uncovered and addressed to his prisoner a few words of courteous greeting Berwick s only reply was a solemn bow The King put on his hat the Duke put on his hat and the cousins parted for ever By this time the French who had been driven in confusion out of Neerwinden had been reinforced by a division under the command of the Duke of Bourbon and came gallantly back to the attack William well aware of the importance of this post gave orders that troops should move thither from other parts of his line This second conflict was long and bloody The assailants again forced an entrance into the village They were again driven out with immense slaughter and showed little inclination to return to the charge Meanwhile the battle had been raging all along the entrenchments of the allied army Again and again Luxemburg brought up his troops within pistolshot of the breastwork but he could bring them no nearer Again and again they recoiled from the heavy fire which was poured on their front and on their flanks It seemed that all was over Luxemburg retired to a spot which was out of gunshot and summoned a few of his chief officers to a consultation They talked together during some time and their animated gestures were observed with deep interest by all who were within sight At length Luxemburg formed his decision A last attempt must be made to carry Neerwinden and the invincible household troops the conquerors of Steinkirk must lead the way The household troops came on in a manner worthy of their long and terrible renown A third time Neerwinden was taken A third time William tried to retake it At the head of some English regiments he charged the guards of Lewis with such fury that for the first time in the memory of the oldest warrior that far famed band gave way four hundred forty six It was only by the strenuous exertions of Luxemburg of the Duke of Chartres and of the Duke of Bourbon that the broken ranks were rallied But by this time the centre and left of the allied army had been so much thinned for the purpose of supporting the conflict at Neerwinden that the entrenchments could no longer be defended on other points A little after four in the afternoon the whole line gave way All was havoc and confusion Solmes had received a mortal wound and fell still alive into the hands of the enemy The English soldiers to whom his name was hateful accused him of having in his sufferings shown pusillanimity unworthy of a soldier The Duke of Ormond was struck down in the press and in another moment he would have been a corpse had not a rich diamond on his finger caught the eye of one of the French guards who justly thought that the owner of such a jewel would be a valuable prisoner The Duke s life was saved and he was speedily exchanged for Berwick Ruvigny animated by the true refugee hatred of the country which had cast him out was taken fighting in the thickest of the battle Those into whose hands he had fallen knew him well and knew that if they carried him to their camp his head would pay for that treason to which persecution had driven him With admirable generosity they pretended not to recognise him and suffered him to make his escape in the tumult It was only on such occasions as this that the whole greatness of William s character appeared Amidst the rout and uproar while arms and standards were flung away while multitudes of fugitives were choking up the bridges and fords of the Gette or perishing in its waters the King having directed Talmash to superintend the retreat put himself at the head of a few brave regiments and by desperate efforts arrested the progress of the enemy His risk was greater than that which others ran For he could not be persuaded either to encumber his feeble frame with a cuirass or to hide the ensigns of the garter He thought his star a good rallying point for his own troops and only smiled when he was told that it was a good mark for the enemy Many fell on his right hand and on his left Two led horses which in the field always closely followed his person were struck dead by cannon shots One musket ball passed through the curls of his wig another through his coat a third bruised his side and tore his blue riband to tatters Many years later greyhaired old pensioners who crept about the arcades and alleys of Chelsea Hospital used to relate how he charged at the head of Galway s horse how he dismounted four times to put heart into the infantry how he rallied one corps which seemed to be shrinking That is not the way to fight gentlemen You must stand close up to them Thus gentlemen thus You might have seen him an eyewitness wrote only four days after the battle with his sword in his hand throwing himself upon the enemy It is certain that one time among the rest he was seen at the head of two English regiments and that he fought seven with these two in sight of the whole army driving them before him above a quarter of an hour Thanks be to God that preserved him The enemy pressed on him so close that it was with difficulty that he at length made his way over the Gette A small body of brave men who shared his peril to the last could hardly keep off the pursuers as he crossed the bridge four hundred forty seven Never perhaps was the change which the progress of civilisation has produced in the art of war more strikingly illustrated than on that day Ajax beating down the Trojan leader with a rock which two ordinary men could scarcely lift Horatius defending the bridge against an army Richard the Lionhearted spurring along the whole Saracen line without finding an enemy to stand his assault Robert Bruce crushing with one blow the helmet and head of Sir Henry Bohun in sight of the whole array of England and Scotland such are the heroes of a dark age In such an age bodily vigour is the most indispensable qualification of a warrior At Landen two poor sickly beings who in a rude state of society would have been regarded as too puny to bear any part in combats were the souls of two great armies In some heathen countries they would have been exposed while infants In Christendom they would six hundred years earlier have been sent to some quiet cloister But their lot had fallen on a time when men had discovered that the strength of the muscles is far inferior in value to the strength of the mind It is probable that among the hundred and twenty thousand soldiers who were marshalled round Neerwinden under all the standards of Western Europe the two feeblest in body were the hunchbacked dwarf who urged forward the fiery onset of France and the asthmatic skeleton who covered the slow retreat of England The French were victorious but they had bought their victory dear More than ten thousand of the best troops of Lewis had fallen Neerwinden was a spectacle at which the oldest soldiers stood aghast The streets were piled breast high with corpses Among the slain were some great lords and some renowned warriors Montchevreuil was there and the mutilated trunk of the Duke of Uzes first in order of precedence among the whole aristocracy of France Thence too Sarsfield was borne desperately wounded to a pallet from which he never rose again The Court of Saint Germains had conferred on him the empty title of Earl of Lucan but history knows him by the name which is still dear to the most unfortunate of nations The region renowned in history as the battle field during many ages of the most warlike nations of Europe has seen only two more terrible days the day of Malplaquet and the day of Waterloo During many months the ground was strewn with skulls and bones of men and horses and with fragments of hats and shoes saddles and holsters The next summer the soil fertilised by twenty thousand corpses broke forth into millions of poppies The traveller who on the road from Saint Tron to Tirlemont saw that vast sheet of rich scarlet spreading from Landen to Neerwinden could hardly help fancying that the figurative prediction of the Hebrew prophet was literally accomplished that the earth was disclosing her blood and refusing to cover the slain four hundred forty eight There was no pursuit though the sun was still high in the heaven when William crossed the Gette The conquerors were so much exhausted by marching and fighting that they could scarcely move and the horses were in even worse condition than the men Their general thought it necessary to allow some time for rest and refreshment The French nobles unloaded their sumpter horses supped gaily and pledged one another in champagne amidst the heaps of dead and when night fell whole brigades gladly lay down to sleep in their ranks on the field of battle The inactivity of Luxemburg did not escape censure None could deny that he had in the action shown great skill and energy But some complained that he wanted patience and perseverance Others whispered that he had no wish to bring to an end a war which made him necessary to a Court where he had never in time of peace found favour or even justice four hundred forty nine Lewis who on this occasion was perhaps not altogether free from some emotions of jealousy contrived it was reported to mingle with the praise which he bestowed on his lieutenant blame which though delicately expressed was perfectly intelligible In the battle he said the Duke of Luxemburg behaved like Conde and since the battle the Prince of Orange has behaved like Turenne In truth the ability and vigour with which William repaired his terrible defeat might well excite admiration In one respect said the Admiral Coligni I may claim superiority over Alexander over Scipio over Caesar They won great battles it is true I have lost four great battles and yet I show to the enemy a more formidable front than ever The blood of Coligni ran in the veins of William and with the blood had descended the unconquerable spirit which could derive from failure as much glory as happier commanders owed to success The defeat of Landen was indeed a heavy blow The King had a few days of cruel anxiety If Luxemburg pushed on all was lost Louvain must fall and Mechlin Nieuport and Ostend The Batavian frontier would be in danger The cry for peace throughout Holland might be such as neither States General nor Stadtholder would be able to resist four hundred fifty But there was delay and a very short delay was enough for William From the field of battle he made his way through the multitude of fugitives to the neighbourhood of Louvain and there began to collect his scattered forces His character is not lowered by the anxiety which at that moment the most disastrous of his life he felt for the two persons who were dearest to him As soon as he was safe he wrote to assure his wife of his safety four hundred fifty one In the confusion of the flight he had lost sight of Portland who was then in very feeble health and had therefore run more than the ordinary risks of war A short note which the King sent to his friend a few hours later is still extant four hundred fifty two Though I hope to see you this evening I cannot help writing to tell you how rejoiced I am that you got off so well God grant that your health may soon be quite restored These are great trials which he has been pleased to send me in quick succession I must try to submit to his pleasure without murmuring and to deserve his anger less His forces rallied fast Large bodies of troops which he had perhaps imprudently detached from his army while he supposed that Liege was the object of the enemy rejoined him by forced marches Three weeks after his defeat he held a review a few miles from Brussels The number of men under arms was greater than on the morning of the bloody day of Landen their appearance was soldierlike and their spirit seemed unbroken William now wrote to Heinsius that the worst was over The crisis he said has been a terrible one Thank God that it has ended thus He did not however think it prudent to try at that time the event of another pitched field He therefore suffered the French to besiege and take Charleroy and this was the only advantage which they derived from the most sanguinary battle fought in Europe during the seventeenth century The melancholy tidings of the defeat of Landen found England agitated by tidings not less melancholy from a different quarter During many months the trade with the Mediterranean Sea had been almost entirely interrupted by the war There was no chance that a merchantman from London or from Amsterdam would if unprotected reach the Pillars of Hercules without being boarded by a French privateer and the protection of armed vessels was not easily to be obtained During the year sixteen ninety one great fleets richly laden for Spanish Italian and Turkish markets had been gathering in the Thames and the Texel In February sixteen ninety three near four hundred ships were ready to start The value of the cargoes was estimated at several millions sterling Those galleons which had long been the wonder and envy of the world had never conveyed so precious a freight from the West Indies to Seville The English government undertook in concert with the Dutch government to escort the vessels which were laden with this great mass of wealth The French government was bent on intercepting them The plan of the allies was that seventy ships of the line and about thirty frigates and brigantines should assemble in the Channel under the command of Killegrew and Delaval the two new Lords of the English Admiralty and should convoy the Smyrna fleet as it was popularly called beyond the limits within which any danger could be apprehended from the Brest squadron The greater part of the armament might then return to guard the Channel while Rooke with twenty sail might accompany the trading vessels and might protect them against the squadron which lay at Toulon The plan of the French government was that the Brest squadron under Tourville and the Toulon squadron under Estrees should meet in the neighbourhood of the Straits of Gibraltar and should there lie in wait for the booty Which plan was the better conceived may be doubted Which was the better executed is a question which admits of no doubt The whole French navy whether in the Atlantic or in the Mediterranean was moved by one will The navy of England and the navy of the United Provinces were subject to different authorities and both in England and in the United Provinces the power was divided and subdivided to such an extent that no single person was pressed by a heavy responsibility The spring came The merchants loudly complained that they had already lost more by delay than they could hope to gain by the most successful voyage and still the ships of war were not half manned or half provisioned The Amsterdam squadron did not arrive on our coast till late in April the Zealand squadron not till the middle of May four hundred fifty three It was June before the immense fleet near five hundred sail lost sight of the cliffs of England Tourville was already on the sea and was steering southward But Killegrew and Delaval were so negligent or so unfortunate that they had no intelligence of his movements They at first took it for granted that he was still lying in the port of Brest Then they heard a rumour that some shipping had been seen to the northward and they supposed that he was taking advantage of their absence to threaten the coast of Devonshire It never seems to have occurred to them as possible that he might have effected a junction with the Toulon squadron and might be impatiently waiting for his prey in the neighbourhood of Gibraltar They therefore on the sixth of June having convoyed the Smyrna fleet about two hundred miles beyond Ushant announced their intention to part company with Rooke Rooke expostulated but to no purpose It was necessary for him to submit and to proceed with his twenty men of war to the Mediterranean while his superiors with the rest of the armament returned to the Channel It was by this time known in England that Tourville had stolen out of Brest and was hastening to join Estrees The return of Killegrew and Delaval therefore excited great alarm A swift sailing vessel was instantly despatched to warn Rooke of his danger but the warning never reached him He ran before a fair wind to Cape Saint Vincent and there he learned that some French ships were lying in the neighbouring Bay of Lagos The first information which he received led him to believe that they were few in number and so dexterously did they conceal their strength that till they were within half an hour s sail he had no suspicion that he was opposed to the whole maritime strength of a great kingdom To contend against fourfold odds would have been madness It was much that he was able to save his squadron from titter destruction He exerted all his skill Two or three Dutch men of war which were in the rear courageously sacrificed themselves to save the fleet With the rest of the armament and with about sixty merchant ships Rooke got safe to Madeira and thence to Cork But more than three hundred of the vessels which he had convoyed were scattered over the ocean Some escaped to Ireland some to Corunna some to Lisbon some to Cadiz some were captured and more destroyed A few which had taken shelter under the rock of Gibraltar and were pursued thither by the enemy were sunk when it was found that they could not be defended Others perished in the same manner under the batteries of Malaga The gain to the French seems not to have been great but the loss to England and Holland was immense four hundred fifty four Never within the memory of man had there been in the City a day of more gloom and agitation than that on which the news of the encounter in the Bay of Lagos arrived Many merchants an eyewitness said went away from the Royal Exchange as pale as if they had received sentence of death A deputation from the merchants who had been sufferers by this great disaster went up to the Queen with an address representing their grievances They were admitted to the Council Chamber where she was seated at the head of the Board She directed Somers to reply to them in her name and he addressed to them a speech well calculated to soothe their irritation Her Majesty he said felt for them from her heart and she had already appointed a Committee of the Privy Council to inquire into the cause of the late misfortune and to consider of the best means of preventing similar misfortunes in time to come four hundred fifty five This answer gave so much satisfaction that the Lord Mayor soon came to the palace to thank the Queen for her goodness to assure her that through all vicissitudes London would be true to her and her consort and to inform her that severely as the late calamity had been felt by many great commercial houses the Common Council had unanimously resolved to advance whatever might be necessary for the support of the government four hundred fifty six The ill humour which the public calamities naturally produced was inflamed by every factious artifice Never had the Jacobite pamphleteers been so savagely scurrilous as during this unfortunate summer The police was consequently more active than ever in seeking for the dens from which so much treason proceeded With great difficulty and after long search the most important of all the unlicensed presses was discovered This press belonged to a Jacobite named William Anderton whose intrepidity and fanaticism marked him out as fit to be employed on services from which prudent men and scrupulous men shrink During two years he had been watched by the agents of the government but where he exercised his craft was an impenetrable mystery At length he was tracked to a house near Saint James s Street where he was known by a feigned name and where he passed for a working jeweller A messenger of the press went thither with several assistants and found Anderton s wife and mother posted as sentinels at the door The women knew the messenger rushed on him tore his hair and cried out Thieves and Murder The alarm was thus given to Anderton He concealed the instruments of his calling came forth with an assured air and bade defiance to the messenger the Censor the Secretary and Little Hooknose himself After a struggle he was secured His room was searched and at first sight no evidence of his guilt appeared But behind the bed was soon found a door which opened into a dark closet The closet contained a press types and heaps of newly printed papers One of these papers entitled Remarks on the Present Confederacy and the Late Revolution is perhaps the most frantic of all the Jacobite libels In this tract the Prince of Orange is gravely accused of having ordered fifty of his wounded English soldiers to be burned alive The governing principle of his whole conduct it is said is not vainglory or ambition or avarice but a deadly hatred of Englishmen and a desire to make them miserable The nation is vehemently adjured on peril of incurring the severest judgments to rise up and free itself from this plague this curse this tyrant whose depravity makes it difficult to believe that he can have been procreated by a human pair Many copies were also found of another paper somewhat less ferocious but perhaps more dangerous entitled A French Conquest neither desirable nor practicable In this tract also the people are exhorted to rise in insurrection They are assured that a great part of the army is with them The forces of the Prince of Orange will melt away he will be glad to make his escape and a charitable hope is sneeringly expressed that it may not be necessary to do him any harm beyond sending him back to Loo where he may live surrounded by luxuries for which the English have paid dear The government provoked and alarmed by the virulence of the Jacobite pamphleteers determined to make Anderton an example He was indicted for high treason and brought to the bar of the Old Bailey Treby now Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Powell who had honourably distinguished himself on the day of the trial of the bishops were on the Bench It is unfortunate that no detailed report of the evidence has come down to us and that we are forced to content ourselves with such fragments of information as can be collected from the contradictory narratives of writers evidently partial intemperate and dishonest The indictment however is extant and the overt acts which it imputes to the prisoner undoubtedly amount to high treason four hundred fifty seven To exhort the subjects of the realm to rise up and depose the King by force and to add to that exhortation the expression evidently ironical of a hope that it may not be necessary to inflict on him any evil worse than banishment is surely an offence which the least courtly lawyer will admit to be within the scope of the statute of Edward the Third On this point indeed there seems to have been no dispute either at the trial or subsequently The prisoner denied that he had printed the libels On this point it seems reasonable that since the evidence has not come down to us we should give credit to the judges and the jury who heard what the witnesses had to say One argument with which Anderton had been furnished by his advisers and which in the Jacobite pasquinades of that time is represented as unanswerable was that as the art of printing had been unknown in the reign of Edward the Third printing could not be an overt act of treason under a statute of that reign The judges treated this argument very lightly and they were surely justified in so treating it For it is an argument which would lead to the conclusion that it could not be an overt act of treason to behead a King with a guillotine or to shoot him with a Minie rifle It was also urged in Anderton s favour and this was undoubtedly an argument well entitled to consideration that a distinction ought to be made between the author of a treasonable paper and the man who merely printed it The former could not pretend that he had not understood the meaning of the words which he had himself selected But to the latter those words might convey no idea whatever The metaphors the allusions the sarcasms might be far beyond his comprehension and while his hands were busy among the types his thoughts might be wandering to things altogether unconnected with the manuscript which was before him It is undoubtedly true that it may be no crime to print what it would be a great crime to write But this is evidently a matter concerning which no general rule can be laid down Whether Anderton had as a mere mechanic contributed to spread a work the tendency of which he did not suspect or had knowingly lent his help to raise a rebellion was a question for the jury and the jury might reasonably infer from his change of his name from the secret manner in which he worked from the strict watch kept by his wife and mother and from the fury with which even in the grasp of the messengers he railed at the government that he was not the unconscious tool but the intelligent and zealous accomplice of traitors The twelve after passing a considerable time in deliberation informed the Court that one of them entertained doubts Those doubts were removed by the arguments of Treby and Powell and a verdict of Guilty was found The fate of the prisoner remained during sometime in suspense The Ministers hoped that he might be induced to save his own neck at the expense of the necks of the pamphleteers who had employed him But his natural courage was kept up by spiritual stimulants which the nonjuring divines well understood how to administer He suffered death with fortitude and continued to revile the government to the last The Jacobites clamoured loudly against the cruelty of the judges who had tried him and of the Queen who had left him for execution and not very consistently represented him at once as a poor ignorant artisan who was not aware of the nature and tendency of the act for which he suffered and as a martyr who had heroically laid down his life for the banished King and the persecuted Church four hundred fifty eight The Ministers were much mistaken if they flattered themselves that the fate of Anderton would deter others from imitating his example His execution produced several pamphlets scarcely less virulent than those for which he had suffered Collier in what he called Remarks on the London Gazette exulted with cruel joy over the carnage of Landen and the vast destruction of English property on the coast of Spain four hundred fifty nine Other writers did their best to raise riots among the labouring people For the doctrine of the Jacobites was that disorder in whatever place or in whatever way it might begin was likely to end in a Restoration A phrase which without a commentary may seem to be mere nonsense but which was really full of meaning was often in their mouths at this time and was indeed a password by which the members of the party recognised each other Box it about it will come to my father The hidden sense of this gibberish was Throw the country into confusion it will be necessary at last to have recourse to King James four hundred sixty Trade was not prosperous and many industrious men were out of work Accordingly songs addressed to the distressed classes were composed by the malecontent street poets Numerous copies of a ballad exhorting the weavers to rise against the government were discovered in the house of that Quaker who had printed James s Declaration four hundred sixty one Every art was used for the purpose of exciting discontent in a much more formidable body of men the sailors and unhappily the vices of the naval administration furnished the enemies of the State with but too good a choice of inflammatory topics Some seamen deserted some mutinied then came executions and then came more ballads and broadsides representing those executions as barbarous murders Reports that the government had determined to defraud its defenders of their hard earned pay were circulated with so much effect that a great crowd of women from Wapping and Rotherhithe besieged Whitehall clamouring for what was due to their husbands Mary had the good sense and good nature to order four of those importunate petitioners to be admitted into the room where she was holding a Council She heard their complaints and herself assured them that the rumour which had alarmed them was unfounded four hundred sixty two By this time Saint Bartholomew s day drew near and the great annual fair the delight of idle apprentices and the horror of Puritanical Aldermen was opened in Smithfield with the usual display of dwarfs giants and dancing dogs the man that ate fire and the elephant that loaded and fired a musket But of all the shows none proved so attractive as a dramatic performance which in conception though doubtless not in execution seems to have borne much resemblance to those immortal masterpieces of humour in which Aristophanes held up Cleon and Lamachus to derision Two strollers personated Killegrew and Delaval The Admirals were represented as flying with their whole fleet before a few French privateers and taking shelter under the grins of the Tower The office of Chorus was performed by a Jackpudding who expressed very freely his opinion of the naval administration Immense crowds flocked to see this strange farce The applauses were loud the receipts were great and the mountebanks who had at first ventured to attack only the unlucky and unpopular Board of Admiralty now emboldened by impunity and success and probably prompted and rewarded by persons of much higher station than their own began to cast reflections on other departments of the government This attempt to revive the license of the Attic Stage was soon brought to a close by the appearance of a strong body of constables who carried off the actors to prison four hundred sixty three Meanwhile the streets of London were every night strewn with seditious handbills At all the taverns the zealots of hereditary right were limping about with glasses of wine and punch at their lips This fashion had just come in and the uninitiated wondered much that so great a number of jolly gentlemen should have suddenly become lame But those who were in the secret knew that the word Limp was a consecrated word that every one of the four letters which composed it was the initial of an august name and that the loyal subject who limped while he drank was taking off his bumper to Lewis James Mary and the Prince four hundred sixty four It was not only in the capital that the Jacobites at this time made a great display of their wit They mustered strong at Bath where the Lord President Caermarthen was trying to recruit his feeble health Every evening they met as they phrased it to serenade the Marquess In other words they assembled under the sick man s window and there sang doggrel lampoons on him four hundred sixty five It is remarkable that the Lord President at the very time at which he was insulted as a Williamite at Bath was considered as a stanch Jacobite at Saint Germains How he came to be so considered is a most perplexing question Some writers are of opinion that he like Shrewsbury Russell Godolphin and Marlborough entered into engagements with one king while eating the bread of the other But this opinion does not rest on sufficient proofs About the treasons of Shrewsbury of Russell of Godolphin and of Marlborough we have a great mass of evidence derived from various sources and extending over several years But all the information which we possess about Caermarthen s dealings with James is contained in a single short paper written by Melfort on the sixteenth of October sixteen ninety three From that paper it is quite clear that some intelligence had reached the banished King and his Ministers which led them to regard Caermarthen as a friend But there is no proof that they ever so regarded him either before that day or after that day four hundred sixty six On the whole the most probable explanation of this mystery seems to be that Caermarthen had been sounded by some Jacobite emissary much less artful than himself and had for the purpose of getting at the bottom of the new scheme of policy devised by Middleton pretended to be well disposed to the cause of the banished King that an exaggerated account of what had passed had been sent to Saint Germains and that there had been much rejoicing there at a conversion which soon proved to have been feigned It seems strange that such a conversion should even for a moment have been thought sincere It was plainly Caermarthen s interest to stand by the sovereigns in possession He was their chief minister He could not hope to be the chief minister of James It can indeed hardly be supposed that the political conduct of a cunning old man insatiably ambitious and covetous was much influenced by personal partiality But if there were any person to whom Caermarthen was partial that person was undoubtedly Mary That he had seriously engaged in a plot to depose her at the risk of his head if he failed and with the certainty of losing immense power and wealth if he succeeded was a story too absurd for any credulity but the credulity of exiles Caermarthen had indeed at that moment peculiarly strong reasons for being satisfied with the place which he held in the counsels of William and Mary There is but too strong reason to believe that he was then accumulating unlawful gain with a rapidity unexampled even in his experience The contest between the two East India Companies was during the autumn of sixteen ninety three fiercer than ever The House of Commons finding the Old Company obstinately averse to all compromise had a little before the close of the late session requested the King to give the three years warning prescribed by the Charter Child and his fellows now began to be seriously alarmed They expected every day to receive the dreaded notice Nay they were not sure that their exclusive privilege might not be taken away without any notice at all for they found that they had by inadvertently omitting to pay the tax lately imposed on their stock at the precise time fixed by law forfeited their Charter and though it would in ordinary circumstances have been thought cruel in the government to take advantage of such a slip the public was not inclined to allow the Old Company any thing more than the strict letter of the bond Every thing was lost if the Charter were not renewed before the meeting of Parliament There can be little doubt that the proceedings of the corporation were still really directed by Child But he had it should seem perceived that his unpopularity had injuriously affected the interests which were under his care and therefore did not obtrude himself on the public notice His place was ostensibly filled by his near kinsman Sir Thomas Cook one of the greatest merchants of London and Member of Parliament for the borough of Colchester The Directors placed at Cook s absolute disposal all the immense wealth which lay in their treasury and in a short time near a hundred thousand pounds were expended in corruption on a gigantic scale In what proportions this enormous sum was distributed among the great men at Whitehall and how much of it was embezzled by intermediate agents is still a mystery We know with certainty however that thousands went to Seymour and thousands to Caermarthen The effect of these bribes was that the Attorney General received orders to draw up a charter regranting the old privileges to the old Company No minister however could after what had passed in Parliament venture to advise the Crown to renew the monopoly without conditions The Directors were sensible that they had no choice and reluctantly consented to accept the new Charter on terms substantially the same with those which the House of Commons had sanctioned It is probable that two years earlier such a compromise would have quieted the feud which distracted the City But a long conflict in which satire and calumny had not been spared had heated the minds of men The cry of Dowgate against Leadenhall Street was louder than ever Caveats were entered petitions were signed and in those petitions a doctrine which had hitherto been studiously kept in the background was boldly affirmed While it was doubtful on which side the royal prerogative would be used that prerogative had not been questioned But as soon as it appeared that the Old Company was likely to obtain a regrant of the monopoly under the Great Seal the New Company began to assert with vehemence that no monopoly could be created except by Act of Parliament The Privy Council over which Caermarthen presided after hearing the matter fully argued by counsel on both sides decided in favour of the Old Company and ordered the Charter to be sealed four hundred sixty seven The autumn was by this time far advanced and the armies in the Netherlands had gone into quarters for the winter On the last day of October William landed in England The Parliament was about to meet and he had every reason to expect a session even more stormy than the last The people were discontented and not without cause The year had been every where disastrous to the allies not only on the sea and in the Low Countries but also in Servia in Spain in Italy and in Germany The Turks had compelled the generals of the Empire to raise the siege of Belgrade A newly created Marshal of France the Duke of Noailles had invaded Catalonia and taken the fortress of Rosas Another newly created Marshal the skilful and valiant Catinat had descended from the Alps on Piedmont and had at Marsiglia gained a complete victory over the forces of the Duke of Savoy This battle is memorable as the first of a long series of battles in which the Irish troops retrieved the honour lost by misfortunes and misconduct in domestic war Some of the exiles of Limerick showed on that day under the standard of France a valour which distinguished them among many thousands of brave men It is remarkable that on the same day a battalion of the persecuted and expatriated Huguenots stood firm amidst the general disorder round the standard of Savoy and fell fighting desperately to the last The Duke of Lorges had marched into the Palatinate already twice devastated and had found that Turenne and Duras had left him something to destroy Heidelberg just beginning to rise again from its ruins was again sacked the peaceable citizens butchered their wives and daughters foully outraged The very choirs of the churches were stained with blood the pyxes and crucifixes were torn from the altars the tombs of the ancient Electors were broken open the corpses stripped of their cerecloths and ornaments were dragged about the streets The skull of the father of the Duchess of Orleans was beaten to fragments by the soldiers of a prince among the ladies of whose splendid Court she held the foremost place And yet a discerning eye might have perceived that unfortunate as the confederates seemed to have been the advantage had really been on their side The contest was quite as much a financial as a military contest The French King had some months before said that the last piece of gold would carry the day and he now began painfully to feel the truth of the saying England was undoubtedly hard pressed by public burdens but still she stood up erect France meanwhile was fast sinking Her recent efforts had been too much for her strength and had left her spent and unnerved Never had her rulers shown more ingenuity in devising taxes or more severity in exacting them but by no ingenuity by no severity was it possible to raise the sums necessary for another such campaign as that of sixteen ninety three In England the harvest had been abundant In France the corn and the wine had again failed The people as usual railed at the government The government with shameful ignorance or more shameful dishonesty tried to direct the public indignation against the dealers in grain Decrees appeared which seemed to have been elaborately framed for the purpose of turning dearth into famine The nation was assured that there was no reason for uneasiness that there was more than a sufficient supply of food and that the scarcity had been produced by the villanous arts of misers who locked up their stores in the hope of making enormous gains Commissioners were appointed to inspect the granaries and were empowered to send to market all the corn that was not necessary for the consumption of the proprietors Such interference of course increased the suffering which it was meant to relieve But in the midst of the general distress there was an artificial plenty in one favoured spot The most arbitrary prince must always stand in some awe of an immense mass of human beings collected in the neighbourhood of his own palace Apprehensions similar to those which had induced the Caesars to extort from Africa and Egypt the means of pampering the rabble of Rome induced Lewis to aggravate the misery of twenty provinces for the purpose of keeping one huge city in good humour He ordered bread to be distributed in all the parishes of the capital at less than half the market price The English Jacobites were stupid enough to extol the wisdom and humanity of this arrangement The harvest they said had been good in England and bad in France and yet the loaf was cheaper at Paris than in London and the explanation was simple The French had a sovereign whose heart was French and who watched over his people with the solicitude of a father while the English were cursed with a Dutch tyrant who sent their corn to Holland The truth was that a week of such fatherly government as that of Lewis would have raised all England in arms from Northumberland to Cornwall That there might be abundance at Paris the people of Normandy and Anjou were stuffing themselves with nettles That there might be tranquillity at Paris the peasantry were fighting with the bargemen and the troops all along the Loire and the Seine Multitudes fled from those rural districts where bread cost five sous a pound to the happy place where bread was to be had for two sous a pound It was necessary to drive the famished crowds back by force from the barriers and to denounce the most terrible punishments against all who should not go home and starve quietly four hundred sixty eight Lewis was sensible that the strength of France had been overstrained by the exertions of the last campaign Even if her harvest and her vintage had been abundant she would not have been able to do in sixteen ninety four what she had done in sixteen ninety three and it was utterly impossible that in a season of extreme distress she should again send into the field armies superior in number on every point to the armies of the coalition New conquests were not to be expected It would be much if the harassed and exhausted land beset on all sides by enemies should be able to sustain a defensive war without any disaster So able a politician as the French King could not but feel that it would be for his advantage to treat with the allies while they were still awed by the remembrance of the gigantic efforts which his kingdom had just made and before the collapse which had followed those efforts should become visible He had long been communicating through various channels with some members of the confederacy and trying to induce them to separate themselves from the rest But he had as yet made no overture tending to a general pacification For he knew that there could be no general pacification unless he was prepared to abandon the cause of James and to acknowledge the Prince and Princess of Orange as King and Queen of England This was in truth the point on which every thing turned What should be done with those great fortresses which Lewis had unjustly seized and annexed to his empire in time of peace Luxemburg which overawed the Moselle and Strasburg which domineered over the Upper Rhine what should be done with the places which he had recently won in open war Philipsburg Mons and Namur Huy and Charleroy what barrier should be given to the States General on what terms Lorraine should be restored to its hereditary Dukes these were assuredly not unimportant questions But the all important question was whether England was to be as she had been under James a dependency of France or as she was under William and Mary a power of the first rank If Lewis really wished for peace he must bring himself to recognise the Sovereigns whom he had so often designated as usurpers Could he bring himself to recognise them His superstition his pride his regard for the unhappy exiles who were pining at Saint Germains his personal dislike of the indefatigable and unconquerable adversary who had been constantly crossing his path during twenty years were on one side his interests and those of his people were on the other He must have been sensible that it was not in his power to subjugate the English that he must at last leave them to choose their government for themselves and that what he must do at last it would be best to do soon Yet he could not at once make up his mind to what was so disagreeable to him He however opened a negotiation with the States General through the intervention of Sweden and Denmark and sent a confidential emissary to confer in secret at Brussels with Dykvelt who possessed the entire confidence of William There was much discussion about matters of secondary importance but the great question remained unsettled The French agent used in private conversation expressions plainly implying that the government which he represented was prepared to recognise William and Mary but no formal assurance could be obtained from him Just at the same time the King of Denmark informed the allies that he was endeavouring to prevail on France not to insist on the restoration of James as an indispensable condition of peace but did not say that his endeavours had as yet been successful Meanwhile Avaux who was now Ambassador at Stockholm informed the King of Sweden that as the dignity of all crowned heads had been outraged in the person of James the Most Christian King felt assured that not only neutral powers but even the Emperor would try to find some expedient which might remove so grave a cause of quarrel The expedient at which Avaux hinted doubtless was that James should waive his rights and that the Prince of Wales should be sent to England bred a Protestant adopted by William and Mary and declared their heir To such an arrangement William would probably have had no personal objection But we may be assured that he never would have consented to make it a condition of peace with France Who should reign in England was a question to be decided by England alone four hundred sixty nine It might well be suspected that a negotiation conducted in this manner was merely meant to divide the confederates William understood the whole importance of the conjuncture He had not it may be the eye of a great captain for all the turns of a battle But he had in the highest perfection the eye of a great statesman for all the turns of a war That France had at length made overtures to him was a sufficient proof that she felt herself spent and sinking That those overtures were made with extreme reluctance and hesitation proved that she had not yet come to a temper in which it was possible to have peace with her on fair terms He saw that the enemy was beginning to give ground and that this was the time to assume the offensive to push forward to bring up every reserve But whether the opportunity should be seized or lost it did not belong to him to decide The King of France might levy troops and exact taxes without any limit save that which the laws of nature impose on despotism But the King of England could do nothing without the support of the House of Commons and the House of Commons though it had hitherto supported him zealously and liberally was not a body on which he could rely It had indeed got into a state which perplexed and alarmed all the most sagacious politicians of that age There was something appalling in the union of such boundless power and such boundless caprice The fate of the whole civilised world depended on the votes of the representatives of the English people and there was no public man who could venture to say with confidence what those representatives might not be induced to vote within twenty four hours four hundred seventy William painfully felt that it was scarcely possible for a prince dependent on an assembly so violent at one time so languid at another to effect any thing great Indeed though no sovereign did so much to secure and to extend the power of the House of Commons no sovereign loved the House of Commons less Nor is this strange for he saw that House at the very worst He saw it when it had just acquired the power and had not yet acquired the gravity of a senate In his letters to Heinsius he perpetually complains of the endless talking the factious squabbling the inconstancy the dilatoriness of the body which his situation made it necessary for him to treat with deference His complaints were by no means unfounded but he had not discovered either the cause or the cure of the evil The truth was that the change which the Revolution had made in the situation of the House of Commons had made another change necessary and that other change had not yet taken place There was parliamentary government but there was no Ministry and without a Ministry the working of a parliamentary government such as ours must always be unsteady and unsafe It is essential to our liberties that the House of Commons should exercise a control over all the departments of the executive administration And yet it is evident that a crowd of five or six hundred people even if they were intellectually much above the average of the members of the best Parliament even if every one of them were a Burleigh or a Sully would be unfit for executive functions It has been truly said that every large collection of human beings however well educated has a strong tendency to become a mob and a country of which the Supreme Executive Council is a mob is surely in a perilous situation Happily a way has been found out in which the House of Commons can exercise a paramount influence over the executive government without assuming functions such as can never be well discharged by a body so numerous and so variously composed An institution which did not exist in the times of the Plantagenets of the Tudors or of the Stuarts an institution not known to the law an institution not mentioned in any statute an institution of which such writers as De Lolme and Blackstone take no notice began to exist a few years after the Revolution grew rapidly into importance became firmly established and is now almost as essential a part of our polity as the Parliament itself This institution is the Ministry The Ministry is in fact a committee of leading members of the two Houses It is nominated by the Crown but it consists exclusively of statesmen whose opinions on the pressing questions of the time agree in the main with the opinions of the majority of the House of Commons Among the members of this committee are distributed the great departments of the administration Each Minister conducts the ordinary business of his own office without reference to his colleagues But the most important business of every office and especially such business as is likely to be the subject of discussion in Parliament is brought under the consideration of the whole Ministry In Parliament the Ministers are bound to act as one man on all questions relating to the executive government If one of them dissents from the rest on a question too important to admit of compromise it is his duty to retire While the Ministers retain the confidence of the parliamentary majority that majority supports them against opposition and rejects every motion which reflects on them or is likely to embarrass them If they forfeit that confidence if the parliamentary majority is dissatisfied with the way in which patronage is distributed with the way in which the prerogative of mercy is used with the conduct of foreign affairs with the conduct of a war the remedy is simple It is not necessary that the Commons should take on themselves the business of administration that they should request the Crown to make this man a bishop and that man a judge to pardon one criminal and to execute another to negotiate a treaty on a particular basis or to send an expedition to a particular place They have merely to declare that they have ceased to trust the Ministry and to ask for a Ministry which they can trust It is by means of Ministries thus constituted and thus changed that the English government has long been conducted in general conformity with the deliberate sense of the House of Commons and yet has been wonderfully free from the vices which are characteristic of governments administered by large tumultuous and divided assemblies A few distinguished persons agreeing in their general opinions are the confidential advisers at once of the Sovereign and of the Estates of the Realm In the closet they speak with the authority of men who stand high in the estimation of the representatives of the people In Parliament they speak with the authority of men versed in great affairs and acquainted with all the secrets of the State Thus the Cabinet has something of the popular character of a representative body and the representative body has something of the gravity of a cabinet Sometimes the state of parties is such that no set of men who can be brought together possesses the full confidence and steady support of a majority of the House of Commons When this is the case there must be a weak Ministry and there will probably be a rapid succession of weak Ministries At such times the House of Commons never fails to get into a state which no person friendly to representative government can contemplate without uneasiness into a state which may enable us to form some faint notion of the state of that House during the earlier years of the reign of William The notion is indeed but faint for the weakest Ministry has great power as a regulator of parliamentary proceedings and in the earlier years of the reign of William there was no Ministry at all No writer has yet attempted to trace the progress of this institution an institution indispensable to the harmonious working of our other institutions The first Ministry was the work partly of mere chance and partly of wisdom not however of that highest wisdom which is conversant with great principles of political philosophy but of that lower wisdom which meets daily exigencies by daily expedients Neither William nor the most enlightened of his advisers fully understood the nature and importance of that noiseless revolution for it was no less which began about the close of sixteen ninety three and was completed about the close of sixteen ninety six But every body could perceive that at the close of sixteen ninety three the chief offices in the government were distributed not unequally between the two great parties that the men who held those offices were perpetually caballing against each other haranguing against each other moving votes of censure on each other exhibiting articles of impeachment against each other and that the temper of the House of Commons was wild ungovernable and uncertain Everybody could perceive that at the close of sixteen ninety six all the principal servants of the Crown were Whigs closely bound together by public and private ties and prompt to defend one another against every attack and that the majority of the House of Commons was arrayed in good order under those leaders and had learned to move like one man at the word of command The history of the period of transition and of the steps by which the change was effected is in a high degree curious and interesting The statesman who had the chief share in forming the first English Ministry had once been but too well known but had long hidden himself from the public gaze and had but recently emerged from the obscurity in which it had been expected that he would pass the remains of an ignominious and disastrous life During that period of general terror and confusion which followed the flight of James Sunderland had disappeared It was high time for of all the agents of the fallen government he was with the single exception of Jeffreys the most odious to the nation Few knew that Sunderland s voice had in secret been given against the spoliation of Magdalene College and the prosecution of the Bishops but all knew that he had signed numerous instruments dispensing with statutes that he had sate in the High Commission that he had turned or pretended to turn Papist that he had a few days after his apostasy appeared in Westminster Hall as a witness against the oppressed fathers of the Church He had indeed atoned for many crimes by one crime baser than all the rest As soon as he had reason to believe that the day of deliverance and retribution was at hand he had by a most dexterous and seasonable treason earned his pardon During the three months which preceded the arrival of the Dutch armament in Torbay he had rendered to the cause of liberty and of the Protestant religion services of which it is difficult to overrate either the wickedness or the utility To him chiefly it was owing that at the most critical moment in our history a French army was not menacing the Batavian frontier and a French fleet hovering about the English coast William could not without staining his own honour refuse to protect one whom he had not scrupled to employ Yet it was no easy task even for William to save that guilty head from the first outbreak of public fury For even those extreme politicians of both sides who agreed in nothing else agreed in calling for vengeance on the renegade The Whigs hated him as the vilest of the slaves by whom the late government had been served and the Jacobites as the vilest of the traitors by whom it had been overthrown Had he remained in England he would probably have died by the hand of the executioner if indeed the executioner had not been anticipated by the populace But in Holland a political refugee favoured by the Stadtholder might hope to live unmolested To Holland Sunderland fled disguised it is said as a woman and his wife accompanied him At Rotterdam a town devoted to the House of Orange he thought himself secure But the magistrates were not in all the secrets of the Prince and were assured by some busy Englishmen that His Highness would be delighted to hear of the arrest of the Popish dog the Judas whose appearance on Tower Hill was impatiently expected by all London Sunderland was thrown into prison and remained there till an order for his release arrived from Whitehall He then proceeded to Amsterdam and there changed his religion again His second apostasy edified his wife as much as his first apostasy had edified his master The Countess wrote to assure her pious friends in England that her poor dear lord s heart had at last been really touched by divine grace and that in spite of all her afflictions she was comforted by seeing him so true a convert We may however without any violation of Christian charity suspect that he was still the same false callous Sunderland who a few months before had made Bonrepaux shudder by denying the existence of a God and had at the same time won the heart of James by pretending to believe in transubstantiation In a short time the banished man put forth an apology for his conduct This apology when examined will be found to amount merely to a confession that he had committed one series of crimes in order to gain James s favour and another series in order to avoid being involved in James s ruin The writer concluded by announcing his intention to pass all the rest of his life in penitence and prayer He soon retired from Amsterdam to Utrecht and at Utrecht made himself conspicuous by his regular and devout attendance on the ministrations of Huguenot preachers If his letters and those of his wife were to be trusted he had done for ever with ambition He longed indeed to be permitted to return from exile not that he might again enjoy and dispense the favours of the Crown not that his antechambers might again be filled by the daily swarm of suitors but that he might see again the turf the trees and the family pictures of his country seat His only wish was to be suffered to end his troubled life at Althorpe and he would be content to forfeit his head if ever he went beyond the palings of his park four hundred seventy one While the House of Commons which had been elected during the vacancy of the throne was busily engaged in the work of proscription he could not venture to show himself in England But when that assembly had ceased to exist he thought himself safe He returned a few days after the Act of Grace had been laid on the table of the Lords From the benefit of that Act he was by name excluded but he well knew that he had now nothing to fear He went privately to Kensington was admitted into the closet had an audience which lasted two hours and then retired to his country house four hundred seventy two During many months be led a secluded life and had no residence in London Once in the spring of sixteen ninety two to the great astonishment of the public he showed his face in the circle at Court and was graciously received four hundred seventy three He seems to have been afraid that he might on his reappearance in Parliament receive some marked affront He therefore very prudently stole down to Westminster in the dead time of the year on a day to which the Houses stood adjourned by the royal command and on which they met merely for the purpose of adjourning again Sunderland had just time to present himself to take the oaths to sign the declaration against transubstantiation and to resume his seat None of the few peers who were present had an opportunity of making any remark four hundred seventy four It was not till the year sixteen ninety two that he began to attend regularly He was silent but silent he had always been in large assemblies even when he was at the zenith of power His talents were not those of a public speaker The art in which he surpassed all men was the art of whispering His tact his quick eye for the foibles of individuals his caressing manners his power of insinuation and above all his apparent frankness made him irresistible in private conversation By means of these qualities he had governed James and now aspired to govern William To govern William indeed was not easy But Sunderland succeeded in obtaining such a measure of favour and influence as excited much surprise and some indignation In truth scarcely any mind was strong enough to resist the witchery of his talk and of his manners Every man is prone to believe in the gratitude and attachment even of the most worthless persons on whom he has conferred great benefits It can therefore hardly be thought strange that the most skilful of all flatterers should have been heard with favour when he with every outward sign of strong emotion implored permission to dedicate all his faculties to the service of the generous protector to whom he owed property liberty life It is not necessary however to suppose that the King was deceived He may have thought with good reason that though little confidence could be placed in Sunderland s professions much confidence might be placed in Sunderland s situation and the truth is that Sunderland proved on the whole a more faithful servant than a much less depraved man might have been He did indeed make in profound secresy some timid overtures towards a reconciliation with James But it may be confidently affirmed that even had those overtures been graciously received and they appear to have been received very ungraciously the twice turned renegade would never have rendered any real service to the Jacobite cause He well knew that he had done that which at Saint Germains must be regarded as inexpiable It was not merely that he had been treacherous and ungrateful Marlborough had been as treacherous and ungrateful and Marlborough had been pardoned But Marlborough had not been guilty of the impious hypocrisy of counterfeiting the signs of conversion Marlborough had not pretended to be convinced by the arguments of the Jesuits to be touched by divine grace to pine for union with the only true Church Marlborough had not when Popery was in the ascendant crossed himself shrived himself done penance taken the communion in one kind and as soon as a turn of fortune came apostatized back again and proclaimed to all the world that when he knelt at the confessional and received the host he was merely laughing at the King and the priests The crime of Sunderland was one which could never be forgiven by James and a crime which could never be forgiven by James was in some sense a recommendation to William The Court nay the Council was full of men who might hope to prosper if the banished King were restored But Sunderland had left himself no retreat He had broken down all the bridges behind him He had been so false to one side that he must of necessity be true to the other That he was in the main true to the government which now protected him there is no reason to doubt and being true he could not but be useful He was in some respects eminently qualified to be at that time an adviser of the Crown He had exactly the talents and the knowledge which William wanted The two together would have made up a consummate statesman The master was capable of forming and executing large designs but was negligent of those small arts in which the servant excelled The master saw farther off than other men but what was near no man saw so clearly as the servant The master though profoundly versed in the politics of the great community of nations never thoroughly understood the politics of his own kingdom The servant was perfectly well informed as to the temper and the organization of the English factions and as to the strong and weak parts of the character of every Englishman of note Early in sixteen ninety three it was rumoured that Sunderland was consulted on all important questions relating to the internal administration of the realm and the rumour became stronger when it was known that he had come up to London in the autumn before the meeting of Parliament and that he had taken a large mansion near Whitehall The coffeehouse politicians were confident that he was about to hold some high office As yet however he had the wisdom to be content with the reality of power and to leave the show to others four hundred seventy five His opinion was that as long as the King tried to balance the two great parties against each other and to divide his favour equally between them both would think themselves ill used and neither would lend to the government that hearty and steady support which was now greatly needed His Majesty must make up his mind to give a marked preference to one or the other and there were three weighty reasons for giving the preference to the Whigs In the first place the Whigs were on principle attached to the reigning dynasty In their view the Revolution had been not merely necessary not merely justifiable but happy and glorious It had been the triumph of their political theory When they swore allegiance to William they swore without scruple or reservation and they were so far from having any doubt about his title that they thought it the best of all titles The Tories on the other hand very generally disapproved of that vote of the Convention which had placed him on the throne Some of them were at heart Jacobites and had taken the oath of allegiance to him only that they might be able to injure him Others though they thought it their duty to obey him as King in fact denied that he was King by right and if they were loyal to him were loyal without enthusiasm There could therefore be little doubt on which of the two parties it would be safer for him to rely In the second place as to the particular matter on which his heart was at present set the Whigs were as a body prepared to support him strenuously and the Tories were as a body inclined to thwart him The minds of men were at this time much occupied by the question in what way the war ought to be carried on To that question the two parties returned very different answers An opinion had during many months been growing among the Tories that the policy of England ought to be strictly insular that she ought to leave the defence of Flanders and the Rhine to the States General the House of Austria and the Princes of the Empire that she ought to carry on hostilities with vigour by sea but to keep up only such an army as might with the help of the militia be sufficient to repel an invasion It was plain that if this system were adopted there might be an immediate reduction of the taxes which pressed most heavily on the nation But the Whigs maintained that this relief would be dearly purchased Many thousands of brave English soldiers were now in Flanders Yet the allies had not been able to prevent the French from taking Mons in sixteen ninety one Namur in sixteen ninety two Charleroy in sixteen ninety three If the English troops were withdrawn it was certain that Ostend Ghent Liege Brussels would fall The German Princes would hasten to make peace each for himself The Spanish Netherlands would probably be annexed to the French monarchy The United Provinces would be again in as great peril as in sixteen seventy two and would accept whatever terms Lewis might be pleased to dictate In a few months he would be at liberty to put forth his whole strength against our island Then would come a struggle for life and death It might well be hoped that we should be able to defend our soil even against such a general and such an army as had won the battle of Landen But the fight must be long and hard How many fertile counties would be turned into deserts how many flourishing towns would be laid in ashes before the invaders were destroyed or driven out One triumphant campaign in Kent and Middlesex would do more to impoverish the nation than ten disastrous campaigns in Brabant It is remarkable that this dispute between the two great factions was during seventy years regularly revived as often as our country was at war with France That England ought never to attempt great military operations on the Continent continued to be a fundamental article of the creed of the Tories till the French Revolution produced a complete change in their feelings four hundred seventy six As the chief object of William was to open the campaign of sixteen ninety four in Flanders with an immense display of force it was sufficiently clear to whom he must look for assistance In the third place the Whigs were the stronger party in Parliament The general election of sixteen ninety indeed had not been favourable to them They had been for a time a minority but they had ever since been constantly gaining ground they were now in number a full half of the Lower House and their effective strength was more than proportioned to their number for in energy alertness and discipline they were decidedly superior to their opponents Their organization was not indeed so perfect as it afterwards became but they had already begun to look for guidance to a small knot of distinguished men which was long afterwards widely known by the name of the junto There is perhaps no parallel in history ancient or modern to the authority exercised by this council during twenty troubled years over the Whig body The men who acquired that authority in the days of William and Mary continued to possess it without interruption in office and out of office till George the First was on the throne One of these men was Russell Of his shameful dealings with the Court of Saint Germains we possess proofs which leave no room for doubt But no such proofs were laid before the world till he had been many years dead If rumours of his guilt got abroad they were vague and improbable they rested on no evidence they could be traced to no trustworthy author and they might well be regarded by his contemporaries as Jacobite calumnies What was quite certain was that he sprang from an illustrious house which had done and suffered great things for liberty and for the Protestant religion that he had signed the invitation of the thirtieth of June that he had landed with the Deliverer at Torbay that he had in Parliament on all occasions spoken and voted as a zealous Whig that he had won a great victory that he had saved his country from an invasion and that since he had left the Admiralty every thing had gone wrong We cannot therefore wonder that his influence over his party should have been considerable But the greatest man among the members of the junto and in some respects the greatest man of that age was the Lord Keeper Somers He was equally eminent as a jurist and as a politician as an orator and as a writer His speeches have perished but his State papers remain and are models of terse luminous and dignified eloquence He had left a great reputation in the House of Commons where he had during four years been always heard with delight and the Whig members still looked up to him as their leader and still held their meetings under his roof In the great place to which he had recently been promoted he had so borne himself that after a very few months even faction and envy had ceased to murmur at his elevation In truth he united all the qualities of a great judge an intellect comprehensive quick and acute diligence integrity patience suavity In council the calm wisdom which he possessed in a measure rarely found among men of parts so quick and of opinions so decided as his acquired for him the authority of an oracle The superiority of his powers appeared not less clearly in private circles The charm of his conversation was heightened by the frankness with which he poured out his thoughts four hundred seventy seven His good temper and his good breeding never failed His gesture his look his tones were expressive of benevolence His humanity was the more remarkable because he had received from nature a body such as is generally found united with a peevish and irritable mind His life was one long malady his nerves were weak his complexion was livid his face was prematurely wrinkled Yet his enemies could not pretend that he had ever once during a long and troubled public life been goaded even by sudden provocation into vehemence inconsistent with the mild dignity of his character All that was left to them was to assert that his disposition was very far from being so gentle as the world believed that he was really prone to the angry passions and that sometimes while his voice was soft and his words kind and courteous his delicate frame was almost convulsed by suppressed emotion It will perhaps be thought that this reproach is the highest of all eulogies The most accomplished men of those times have told us that there was scarcely any subject on which Somers was not competent to instruct and to delight He had never travelled and in that age an Englishman who had not travelled was generally thought incompetent to give an opinion on works of art But connoisseurs familiar with the masterpieces of the Vatican and of the Florentine gallery allowed that the taste of Somers in painting and sculpture was exquisite Philology was one of his favourite pursuits He had traversed the whole vast range of polite literature ancient and modern He was at once a munificent and severely judicious patron of genius and learning Locke owed opulence to Somers By Somers Addison was drawn forth from a cell in a college In distant countries the name of Somers was mentioned with respect and gratitude by great scholars and poets who had never seen his face He was the benefactor of Leclerc He was the friend of Filicaja Neither political nor religious differences prevented him from extending his powerful protection to merit Hickes the fiercest and most intolerant of all the nonjurors obtained by the influence of Somers permission to study Teutonic antiquities in freedom and safety Vertue a strict Roman Catholic was raised by the discriminating and liberal patronage of Somers from poverty and obscurity to the first rank among the engravers of the age The generosity with which Somers treated his opponents was the more honourable to him because he was no waverer in politics From the beginning to the end of his public life he was a steady Whig His voice was indeed always raised when his party was dominant in the State against violent and vindictive counsels but he never forsook his friends even when their perverse neglect of his advice had brought them to the verge of ruin His powers of mind and his acquirements were not denied even by his detractors The most acrimonious Tories were forced to admit with an ungracious snarl which increased the value of their praise that he had all the intellectual qualities of a great man and that in him alone among his contemporaries brilliant eloquence and wit were to be found associated with the quiet and steady prudence which ensures success in life It is a remarkable fact that in the foulest of all the many libels that were published against him he was slandered under the name of Cicero As his abilities could not be questioned he was charged with irreligion and immorality That he was heterodox all the country vicars and foxhunting squires firmly believed but as to the nature and extent of his heterodoxy there were many different opinions He seems to have been a Low Churchman of the school of Tillotson whom he always loved and honoured and he was like Tillotson called by bigots a Presbyterian an Arian a Socinian a Deist and an Atheist The private life of this great statesman and magistrate was malignantly scrutinised and tales were told about his libertinism which went on growing till they became too absurd for the credulity even of party spirit At last long after he had been condemned to flannel and chicken broth a wretched courtesan who had probably never seen him except in the stage box at the theatre when she was following her vocation below in a mask published a lampoon in which she described him as the master of a haram more costly than the Great Turk s There is however reason to believe that there was a small nucleus of truth round which this great mass of fiction gathered and that the wisdom and selfcommand which Somers never wanted in the senate on the judgment seat at the council board or in the society of wits scholars and philosophers were not always proof against female attractions four hundred seventy eight Another director of the Whig party was Charles Montague He was often when he had risen to power honours and riches called an upstart by those who envied his success That they should have called him so may seem strange for few of the statesmen of his time could show such a pedigree as his He sprang from a family as old as the Conquest he was in the succession to an earldom and was by the paternal side cousin of three earls But he was the younger son of a younger brother and that phrase had ever since the time of Shakspeare and Raleigh and perhaps before their time been proverbially used to designate a person so poor as to be broken to the most abject servitude or ready for the most desperate adventure Charles Montague was early destined for the Church was entered on the foundation of Westminster and after distinguishing himself there by skill in Latin versification was sent up to Trinity College Cambridge At Cambridge the philosophy of Des Cartes was still dominant in the schools But a few select spirits had separated from the crowd and formed a fit audience round a far greater teacher four hundred seventy nine Conspicuous among the youths of high promise who were proud to sit at the feet of Newton was the quick and versatile Montague Under such guidance the young student made considerable proficiency in the severe sciences but poetry was his favourite pursuit and when the University invited her sons to celebrate royal marriages and funerals he was generally allowed to have surpassed his competitors His fame travelled to London he was thought a clever lad by the wits who met at Will s and the lively parody which he wrote in concert with his friend and fellow student Prior on Dryden s Hind and Panther was received with great applause At this time all Montague s wishes pointed towards the Church At a later period when he was a peer with twelve thousand a year when his villa on the Thames was regarded as the most delightful of all suburban retreats when he was said to revel in Tokay from the Imperial cellar and in soups made out of birds nests brought from the Indian Ocean and costing three guineas a piece his enemies were fond of reminding him that there had been a time when he had eked out by his wits an income of barely fifty pounds when he had been happy with a trencher of mutton chops and a flagon of ale from the College buttery and when a tithe pig was the rarest luxury for which he had dared to hope The Revolution came and changed his whole scheme of life He obtained by the influence of Dorset who took a peculiar pleasure in befriending young men of promise a seat in the House of Commons Still during a few months the needy scholar hesitated between politics and divinity But it soon became clear that in the new order of things parliamentary ability must fetch a higher price than any other kind of ability and he felt that in parliamentary ability he had no superior He was in the very situation for which he was peculiarly fitted by nature and during some years his life was a series of triumphs Of him as of several of his contemporaries especially of Mulgrave and of Sprat it may be said that his fame has suffered from the folly of those editors who down to our own time have persisted in reprinting his rhymes among the works of the British poets There is not a year in which hundreds of verses as good as any that he ever wrote are not sent in for the Newdigate prize at Oxford and for the Chancellor s medal at Cambridge His mind had indeed great quickness and vigour but not that kind of quickness and vigour which produces great dramas or odes and it is most unjust to him that his loan of Honour and his Epistle on the Battle of the Boyne should be placed side by side with Comus and Alexander s Feast Other eminent statesmen and orators Walpole Pulteney Chatham Fox wrote poetry not better than his But fortunately for them their metrical compositions were never thought worthy to be admitted into any collection of our national classics It has long been usual to represent the imagination under the figure of a wing and to call the successful exertions of the imagination flights One poet is the eagle another is the swan a third modestly compares himself to the bee But none of these types would have suited Montague His genius may be compared to that pinion which though it is too weak to lift the ostrich into the air enables her while she remains on the earth to outrun hound horse and dromedary If the man who possesses this kind of genius attempts to ascend the heaven of invention his awkward and unsuccessful efforts expose him to derision But if he will be content to stay in the terrestrial region of business he will find that the faculties which would not enable him to soar into a higher sphere will enable him to distance all his competitors in the lower As a poet Montague could never have risen above the crowd But in the House of Commons now fast becoming supreme in the State and extending its control over one executive department after another the young adventurer soon obtained a place very different from the place which he occupies among men of letters At thirty he would gladly have given all his chances in life for a comfortable vicarage and a chaplain s scarf At thirty seven he was First Lord of the Treasury Chancellor of the Exchequer and a Regent of the kingdom and this elevation he owed not at all to favour but solely to the unquestionable superiority of his talents for administration and debate The extraordinary ability with which at the beginning of the year sixteen ninety two he managed the conference on the Bill for regulating Trials in cases of Treason placed him at once in the first rank of parliamentary orators On that occasion he was opposed to a crowd of veteran senators renowned for their eloquence Halifax Rochester Nottingham Mulgrave and proved himself a match for them all He was speedily seated at the Board of Treasury and there the clearheaded and experienced Godolphin soon found that his young colleague was his master When Somers had quitted the House of Commons Montague had no rival there Sir Thomas Littleton once distinguished as the ablest debater and man of business among the Whig members was content to serve under his junior To this day we may discern in many parts of our financial and commercial system the marks of the vigorous intellect and daring spirit of Montague His bitterest enemies were unable to deny that some of the expedients which he had proposed had proved highly beneficial to the nation But it was said that these expedients were not devised by himself He was represented in a hundred pamphlets as the daw in borrowed plumes He had taken it was affirmed the hint of every one of his great plans from the writings or the conversation of some ingenious speculator This reproach was in truth no reproach We can scarcely expect to find in the same human being the talents which are necessary for the making of new discoveries in political science and the talents which obtain the assent of divided and tumultuous assemblies to great practical reforms To be at once an Adam Smith and a Pitt is scarcely possible It is surely praise enough for a busy politician that he knows how to use the theories of others that he discerns among the schemes of innumerable projectors the precise scheme which is wanted and which is practicable that he shapes it to suit pressing circumstances and popular humours that he proposes it just when it is most likely to be favourably received that he triumphantly defends it against all objectors and that he carries it into execution with prudence and energy and to this praise no English statesman has a fairer claim than Montague It is a remarkable proof of his selfknowledge that from the moment at which he began to distinguish himself in public life he ceased to be a versifier It does not appear that after he became a Lord of the Treasury he ever wrote a couplet with the exception of a few well turned lines inscribed on a set of toasting glasses which were sacred to the most renowned Whig beauties of his time He wisely determined to derive from the poetry of others a glory which he never would have derived from his own As a patron of genius and learning he ranks with his two illustrious friends Dorset and Somers His munificence fully equalled theirs and though he was inferior to them in delicacy of taste he succeeded in associating his name inseparably with some names which will last as long as our language Yet it must be acknowledged that Montague with admirable parts and with many claims on the gratitude of his country had great faults and unhappily faults not of the noblest kind His head was not strong enough to bear without giddiness the speed of his ascent and the height of his position He became offensively arrogant and vain He was too often cold to his old friends and ostentatious in displaying his new riches Above all he was insatiably greedy of praise and liked it best when it was of the coarsest and rankest quality But in sixteen ninety three these faults were less offensive than they became a few years later With Russell Somers and Montague was closely connected during a quarter of a century a fourth Whig who in character bore little resemblance to any of them This was Thomas Wharton eldest son of Philip Lord Wharton Thomas Wharton has been repeatedly mentioned in the course of this narrative But it is now time to describe him more fully He was in his forty seventh year but was still a young man in constitution in appearance and in manners Those who hated him most heartily and no man was hated more heartily admitted that his natural parts were excellent and that he was equally qualified for debate and for action The history of his mind deserves notice for it was the history of many thousands of minds His rank and abilities made him so conspicuous that in him we are able to trace distinctly the origin and progress of a moral taint which was epidemic among his contemporaries He was born in the days of the Covenant and was the heir of a covenanted house His father was renowned as a distributor of Calvinistic tracts and a patron of Calvinistic divines The boy s first years were past amidst Geneva bands heads of lank hair upturned eyes nasal psalmody and sermons three hours long Plays and poems hunting and dancing were proscribed by the austere discipline of his saintly family The fruits of this education became visible when from the sullen mansion of Puritan parents the hotblooded quickwitted young patrician emerged into the gay and voluptuous London of the Restoration The most dissolute cavaliers stood aghast at the dissoluteness of the emancipated precisian He early acquired and retained to the last the reputation of being the greatest rake in England Of wine indeed he never became the slave and he used it chiefly for the purpose of making himself the master of his associates But to the end of his long life the wives and daughters of his nearest friends were not safe from his licentious plots The ribaldry of his conversation moved astonishment even in that age To the religion of his country he offered in the mere wantonness of impiety insults too foul to be described His mendacity and his effrontery passed into proverbs Of all the liars of his time he was the most deliberate the most inventive and the most circumstantial What shame meant he did not seem to understand No reproaches even when pointed and barbed with the sharpest wit appeared to give him pain Great satirists animated by a deadly personal aversion exhausted all their strength in attacks upon him They assailed him with keen invective they assailed him with still keener irony but they found that neither invective nor irony could move him to any thing but an unforced smile and a goodhumoured curse and they at length threw down the lash acknowledging that it was impossible to make him feel That with such vices he should have played a great part in life should have carried numerous elections against the most formidable opposition by his personal popularity should have had a large following in Parliament should have risen to the highest offices of the State seems extraordinary But he lived in times when faction was almost a madness and he possessed in an eminent degree the qualities of the leader of a faction There was a single tie which he respected The falsest of mankind in all relations but one he was the truest of Whigs The religious tenets of his family he had early renounced with contempt but to the politics of his family he stedfastly adhered through all the temptations and dangers of half a century In small things and in great his devotion to his party constantly appeared He had the finest stud in England and his delight was to win plates from Tories Sometimes when in a distant county it was fully expected that the horse of a High Church squire would be first on the course down came on the very eve of the race Wharton s Careless who had ceased to run at Newmarket merely for want of competitors or Wharton s Gelding for whom Lewis the Fourteenth had in vain offered a thousand pistoles A man whose mere sport was of this description was not likely to be easily beaten in any serious contest Such a master of the whole art of electioneering England had never seen Buckinghamshire was his own especial province and there he ruled without a rival But he extended his care over the Whig interest in Yorkshire Cumberland Westmoreland Wiltshire Sometimes twenty sometimes thirty members of Parliament were named by him As a canvasser he was irresistible He never forgot a face that he had once seen Nay in the towns in which he wished to establish an interest he remembered not only the voters but their families His opponents were confounded by the strength of his memory and the affability of his deportment and owned that it was impossible to contend against a great man who called the shoemaker by his Christian name who was sure that the butcher s daughter must be growing a fine girl and who was anxious to know whether the blacksmith s youngest boy was breeched By such arts as these he made himself so popular that his journeys to the Buckinghamshire Quarter Sessions resembled royal progresses The bells of every parish through which he passed were rung and flowers were strewed along the road It was commonly believed that in the course of his life he expended on his parliamentary interest not less than eighty thousand pounds a sum which when compared with the value of estates must be considered as equivalent to more than three hundred thousand pounds in our time But the chief service which Wharton rendered to the Whig party was that of bringing in recruits from the young aristocracy He was quite as dexterous a canvasser among the embroidered coats at the Saint James s Coffeehouse as among the leathern aprons at Wycombe and Aylesbury He had his eye on every boy of quality who came of age and it was not easy for such a boy to resist the arts of a noble eloquent and wealthy flatterer who united juvenile vivacity to profound art and long experience of the gay world It mattered not what the novice preferred gallantry or field sports the dicebox or the bottle Wharton soon found out the master passion offered sympathy advice and assistance and while seeming to be only the minister of his disciple s pleasures made sure of his disciple s vote The party to whose interests Wharton with such spirit and constancy devoted his time his fortune his talents his very vices judged him as was natural far too leniently He was widely known by the very undeserved appellation of Honest Tom Some pious men Burnet for example and Addison averted their eyes from the scandal which he gave and spoke of him not indeed with esteem yet with goodwill A most ingenious and accomplished Whig the third Earl of Shaftesbury author of the Characteristics described Wharton as the most mysterious of human beings as a strange compound of best and worst of private depravity and public virtue and owned himself unable to understand how a man utterly without principle in every thing but politics should in politics be as true as steel But that which in the judgment of one faction more than half redeemed all Wharton s faults seemed to the other faction to aggravate them all The opinion which the Tories entertained of him is expressed in a single line written after his death by the ablest man of that party He was the most universal villain that ever I knew four hundred eighty Wharton s political adversaries thirsted for his blood and repeatedly tried to shed it Had he not been a man of imperturbable temper dauntless courage and consummate skill in fence his life would have been a short one But neither anger nor danger ever deprived him of his presence of mind he was an incomparable swordsman and he had a peculiar way of disarming opponents which moved the envy of all the duellists of his time His friends said that he had never given a challenge that he had never refused one that he had never taken a life and yet that he had never fought without having his antagonist s life at his mercy four hundred eighty one The four men who have been described resembled each other so little that it may be thought strange that they should ever have been able to act in concert They did however act in the closest concert during many years They more than once rose and more than once fell together But their union lasted till it was dissolved by death Little as some of them may have deserved esteem none of them can be accused of having been false to his brethren of the Junto While the great body of the Whigs was under these able chiefs arraying itself in order resembling that of a regular army the Tories were in a state of an ill drilled and ill officered militia They were numerous and they were zealous but they can hardly be said to have had at this time any chief in the House of Commons The name of Seymour had once been great among them and had not quite lost its influence But since he had been at the Board of Treasury he had disgusted them by vehemently defending all that he had himself when out of place vehemently attacked They had once looked up to the Speaker Trevor but his greediness impudence and venality were now so notorious that all respectable gentlemen of all shades of opinion were ashamed to see him in the chair Of the old Tory members Sir Christopher Musgrave alone had much weight Indeed the real leaders of the party were two or three men bred in principles diametrically opposed to Toryism men who had carried Whiggism to the verge of republicanism and who had been considered not merely as Low Churchmen but as more than half Presbyterians Of these men the most eminent were two great Herefordshire squires Robert Harley and Paul Foley The space which Robert Harley fills in the history of three reigns his elevation his fall the influence which at a great crisis he exercised on the politics of all Europe the close intimacy in which he lived with some of the greatest wits and poets of his time and the frequent recurrence of his name in the works of Swift Pope Arbuthnot and Prior must always make him an object of interest Yet the man himself was of all men the least interesting There is indeed a whimsical contrast between the very ordinary qualities of his mind and the very extraordinary vicissitudes of his fortune He was the heir of a Puritan family His father Sir Edward Harley had been conspicuous among the patriots of the Long parliament had commanded a regiment under Essex had after the Restoration been an active opponent of the Court had supported the Exclusion Bill had harboured dissenting preachers had frequented meetinghouses and had made himself so obnoxious to the ruling powers that at the time of the Western Insurrection he had been placed under arrest and his house had been searched for arms When the Dutch army was marching from Torbay towards London he and his eldest son Robert declared for the Prince of Orange and a free Parliament raised a large body of horse took possession of Worcester and evinced their zeal against Popery by publicly breaking to pieces in the High Street of that city a piece of sculpture which to rigid precisians seemed idolatrous Soon after the Convention became a Parliament Robert Harley was sent up to Westminster as member for a Cornish borough His conduct was such as might have been expected from his birth and education He was a Whig and indeed an intolerant and vindictive Whig Nothing would satisfy him but a general proscription of the Tories His name appears in the list of those members who voted for the Sacheverell clause and at the general election which took place in the spring of sixteen ninety the party which he had persecuted made great exertions to keep him out of the House of Commons A cry was raised that the Harleys were mortal enemies of the Church and this cry produced so much effect that it was with difficulty that any of them could obtain a seat Such was the commencement of the public life of a man whose name a quarter of a century later was inseparably coupled with the High Church in the acclamations of Jacobite mobs four hundred eighty two Soon however it began to be observed that in every division Harley was in the company of those gentlemen who held his political opinions in abhorrence nor was this strange for he affected the character of a Whig of the old pattern and before the Revolution it had always been supposed that a Whig was a person who watched with jealousy every exertion of the prerogative who was slow to loose the strings of the public purse and who was extreme to mark the faults of the ministers of the Crown Such a Whig Harley still professed to be He did not admit that the recent change of dynasty had made any change in the duties of a representative of the people The new government ought to be observed as suspiciously checked as severely and supplied as sparingly as the old one Acting on these principles he necessarily found himself acting with men whose principles were diametrically opposed to his He liked to thwart the King they liked to thwart the usurper the consequence was that whenever there was an opportunity of thwarting William the Roundhead stayed in the House or went into the lobby in company with the whole crowd of Cavaliers Soon Harley acquired the authority of a leader among those with whom notwithstanding wide differences of opinion he ordinarily voted His influence in Parliament was indeed altogether out of proportion to his abilities His intellect was both small and slow He was unable to take a large view of any subject He never acquired the art of expressing himself in public with fluency and perspicuity To the end of his life he remained a tedious hesitating and confused speaker four hundred eighty three He had none of the external graces of an orator His countenance was heavy his figure mean and somewhat deformed and his gestures uncouth Yet he was heard with respect For such as his mind was it had been assiduously cultivated His youth had been studious and to the last he continued to love books and the society of men of genius and learning Indeed he aspired to the character of a wit and a poet and occasionally employed hours which should have been very differently spent in composing verses more execrable than the bellman s four hundred eighty four His time however was not always so absurdly wasted He had that sort of industry and that sort of exactness which would have made him a respectable antiquary or King at Arms His taste led him to plod among old records and in that age it was only by plodding among old records that any man could obtain an accurate and extensive knowledge of the law of Parliament Having few rivals in this laborious and unattractive pursuit he soon began to be regarded as an oracle on questions of form and privilege His moral character added not a little to his influence He had indeed great vices but they were not of a scandalous kind He was not to be corrupted by money His private life was regular No illicit amour was imputed to him even by satirists Gambling he held in aversion and it was said that he never passed White s then the favourite haunt of noble sharpers and dupes without an exclamation of anger His practice of flustering himself daily with claret was hardly considered as a fault by his contemporaries His knowledge his gravity and his independent position gained for him the ear of the House and even his bad speaking was in some sense an advantage to him For people are very loth to admit that the same man can unite very different kinds of excellence It is soothing to envy to believe that what is splendid cannot be solid that what is clear cannot be profound Very slowly was the public brought to acknowledge that Mansfield was a great jurist and that Burke was a great master of political science Montague was a brilliant rhetorician and therefore though he had ten times Harley s capacity for the driest parts of business was represented by detractors as a superficial prating pretender But from the absence of show in Harley s discourses many people inferred that there must be much substance and he was pronounced to be a deep read deep thinking gentleman not a fine talker but fitter to direct affairs of state than all the fine talkers in the world This character he long supported with that cunning which is frequently found in company with ambitious and unquiet mediocrity He constantly had even with his best friends an air of mystery and reserve which seemed to indicate that he knew some momentous secret and that his mind was labouring with some vast design In this way he got and long kept a high reputation for wisdom It was not till that reputation had made him an Earl a Knight of the Garter Lord High Treasurer of England and master of the fate of Europe that his admirers began to find out that he was really a dull puzzleheaded man four hundred eighty five Soon after the general election of sixteen ninety Harley generally voting with the Tories began to turn Tory The change was so gradual as to be almost imperceptible but was not the less real He early began to hold the Tory doctrine that England ought to confine herself to a maritime war He early felt the true Tory antipathy to Dutchmen and to moneyed men The antipathy to Dissenters which was necessary to the completeness of the character came much later At length the transformation was complete and the old haunter of conventicles became an intolerant High Churchman Yet to the last the traces of his early breeding would now and then show themselves and while he acted after the fashion of Laud he sometimes wrote in the style of Praise God Barebones four hundred eighty six Of Paul Foley we know comparatively little His history up to a certain point greatly resembles that of Harley but he appears to have been superior to Harley both in parts and in elevation of character He was the son of Thomas Foley a new man but a man of great merit who having begun life with nothing had created a noble estate by ironworks and who was renowned for his spotless integrity and his munificent charity The Foleys were like their neighbours the Harleys Whigs and Puritans Thomas Foley lived on terms of close intimacy with Baxter in whose writings he is mentioned with warm eulogy The opinions and the attachments of Paul Foley were at first those of his family But be like Harley became merely from the vehemence of his Whiggism an ally of the Tories and might perhaps like Harley have been completely metamorphosed into a Tory if the process of transmutation had not been interrupted by death Foley s abilities were highly respectable and had been improved by education He was so wealthy that it was unnecessary for him to follow the law as a profession but he had studied it carefully as a science His morals were without stain and the greatest fault which could be imputed to him was that he paraded his independence and disinterestedness too ostentatiously and was so much afraid of being thought to fawn that he was always growling Another convert ought to be mentioned Howe lately the most virulent of the Whigs had been by the loss of his place turned into one of the most virulent of the Tories The deserter brought to the party which he had joined no weight of character no capacity or semblance of capacity for great affairs but much parliamentary ability of a low kind much spite and much impudence No speaker of that time seems to have had in such large measure both the power and the inclination to give pain The assistance of these men was most welcome to the Tory party but it was impossible that they could as yet exercise over that party the entire authority of leaders For they still called themselves Whigs and generally vindicated their Tory votes by arguments grounded on Whig principles four hundred eighty seven From this view of the state of parties in the House of Commons it seems clear that Sunderland had good reason for recommending that the administration should be entrusted to the Whigs The King however hesitated long before he could bring himself to quit that neutral position which he had long occupied between the contending parties If one of those parties was disposed to question his title the other was on principle hostile to his prerogative He still remembered with bitterness the unreasonable and vindictive conduct of the Convention Parliament at the close of sixteen eighty nine and the beginning of sixteen ninety and he shrank from the thought of being entirely in the hands of the men who had obstructed the Bill of Indemnity who had voted for the Sacheverell clause who had tried to prevent him from taking the command of his army in Ireland and who had called him an ungrateful tyrant merely because he would not be their slave and their hangman He had once by a bold and unexpected effort freed himself from their yoke and he was not inclined to put it on his neck again He personally disliked Wharton and Russell He thought highly of the capacity of Caermarthen of the integrity of Nottingham of the diligence and financial skill of Godolphin It was only by slow degrees that the arguments of Sunderland backed by the force of circumstances overcame all objections On the seventh of November sixteen ninety three the Parliament met and the conflict of parties instantly began William from the throne pressed on the Houses the necessity of making a great exertion to arrest the progress of France on the Continent During the last campaign he said she had on every point had a superiority of force and it had therefore been found impossible to cope with her His allies had promised to increase their armies and he trusted that the Commons would enable him to do the same four hundred eighty eight The Commons at their next sitting took the King s speech into consideration The miscarriage of the Smyrna fleet was the chief subject of discussion The cry for inquiry was universal but it was evident that the two parties raised that cry for very different reasons Montague spoke the sense of the Whigs He declared that the disasters of the summer could not in his opinion be explained by the ignorance and imbecility of those who had charge of the naval administration There must have been treason It was impossible to believe that Lewis when he sent his Brest squadron to the Straits of Gibraltar and left the whole coast of his kingdom from Dunkirk to Bayonne unprotected had trusted merely to chance He must have been well assured that his fleet would meet with a vast booty under a feeble convoy As there had been treachery in some quarters there had been incapacity in others The State was ill served And then the orator pronounced a warm panegyric on his friend Somers Would that all men in power would follow the example of my Lord Keeper If all patronage were bestowed as judiciously and disinterestedly as his we should not see the public offices filled with men who draw salaries and perform no duties It was moved and carried unanimously that the Commons would support their Majesties and would forthwith proceed to investigate the cause of the disaster in the Bay of Lagos four hundred eighty nine The Lords of the Admiralty were directed to produce a great mass of documentary evidence The King sent down copies of the examinations taken before the Committee of Council which Mary had appointed to inquire into the grievances of the Turkey merchants The Turkey merchants themselves were called in and interrogated Rooke though too ill to stand or speak was brought in a chair to the bar and there delivered in a narrative of his proceedings The Whigs soon thought that sufficient ground had been laid for a vote condemning the naval administration and moved a resolution attributing the miscarriage of the Smyrna fleet to notorious and treacherous mismanagement That there had been mismanagement could not be disputed but that there had been foul play had certainly not been proved The Tories proposed that the word treacherous should be omitted A division took place and the Whigs carried their point by a hundred and forty votes to a hundred and three Wharton was a teller for the majority four hundred ninety It was now decided that there had been treason but not who was the traitor Several keen debates followed The Whigs tried to throw the blame on Killegrew and Delaval who were Tories the Tories did their best to make out that the fault lay with the Victualling Department which was under the direction of Whigs But the House of Commons has always been much more ready to pass votes of censure drawn in general terms than to brand individuals by name A resolution clearing the Victualling Office was proposed by Montague and carried after a debate of two days by a hundred and eighty eight votes to a hundred and fifty two four hundred ninety one But when the victorious party brought forward a motion inculpating the admirals the Tories came up in great numbers from the country and after a debate which lasted from nine in the morning till near eleven at night succeeded in saving their friends The Noes were a hundred and seventy and the Ayes only a hundred and sixty one Another attack was made a few days later with no better success The Noes were a hundred and eighty five the Ayes only a hundred and seventy five The indefatigable and implacable Wharton was on both occasions tellers for the minority four hundred ninety two In spite of this check the advantage was decidedly with the Whigs The Tories who were at the head of the naval administration had indeed escaped impeachment but the escape had been so narrow that it was impossible for the King to employ them any longer The advice of Sunderland prevailed A new Commission of Admiralty was prepared and Russell was named First Lord He had already been appointed to the command of the Channel fleet His elevation made it necessary that Nottingham should retire For though it was not then unusual to see men who were personally and politically hostile to each other holding high offices at the same time the relation between the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State who had charge of what would now be called the War Department was of so peculiar a nature that the public service could not be well conducted without cordial cooperation between them and between Nottingham and Russell such cooperation was not to be expected I thank you William said to Nottingham for your services I have nothing to complain of in your conduct It is only from necessity that I part with you Nottingham retired with dignity Though a very honest man he went out of office much richer than he had come in five years before What were then considered as the legitimate emoluments of his place were great he had sold Kensington House to the Crown for a large sum and he had probably after the fashion of that time obtained for himself some lucrative grants He laid out all his gains in purchasing land He heard he said that his enemies meant to accuse him of having acquired wealth by illicit means He was perfectly ready to abide the issue of an inquiry He would not as some ministers had done place his fortune beyond the reach of the justice of his country He would have no secret hoard He would invest nothing in foreign funds His property should all be such as could be readily discovered and seized four hundred ninety three During some weeks the seals which Nottingham had delivered up remained in the royal closet To dispose of them proved no easy matter They were offered to Shrewsbury who of all the Whig leaders stood highest in the King s favour but Shrewsbury excused himself and in order to avoid further importunity retired into the country There he soon received a pressing letter from Elizabeth Villiers This lady had when a girl inspired William with a passion which had caused much scandal and much unhappiness in the little Court of the Hague Her influence over him she owed not to her personal charms for it tasked all the art of Kneller to make her look tolerably on canvass not to those talents which peculiarly belong to her sex for she did not excel in playful talk and her letters are remarkably deficient in feminine ease and grace but to powers of mind which qualified her to partake the cares and guide the counsels of statesmen To the end of her life great politicians sought her advice Even Swift the shrewdest and most cynical of her contemporaries pronounced her the wisest of women and more than once sate fascinated by her conversation from two in the afternoon till near midnight four hundred ninety four By degrees the virtues and charms of Mary conquered the first place in her husband s affection But he still in difficult conjunctures frequently applied to Elizabeth Villiers for advice and assistance She now implored Shrewsbury to reconsider his determination and not to throw away the opportunity of uniting the Whig party for ever Wharton and Russell wrote to the same effect In reply came flimsy and unmeaning excuses I am not qualified for a court life I am unequal to a place which requires much exertion I do not quite agree with any party in the State in short I am unfit for the world I want to travel I want to see Spain These were mere pretences Had Shrewsbury spoken the whole truth he would have said that he had in an evil hour been false to the cause of that Revolution in which he had borne so great a part that he had entered into engagements of which he repented but from which he knew not how to extricate himself and that while he remained under those engagements he was unwilling to enter into the service of the existing government Marlborough Godolphin and Russell indeed had no scruple about corresponding with one King while holding office under the other But Shrewsbury had what was wanting to Marlborough Godolphin and Russell a conscience a conscience which indeed too often failed to restrain him from doing wrong but which never failed to punish him four hundred ninety five In consequence of his refusal to accept the Seals the ministerial arrangements which the King had planned were not carried into entire effect till the end of the session Meanwhile the proceedings of the two Houses had been highly interesting and important Soon after the Parliament met the attention of the Commons was again called to the state of the trade with India and the charter which had just been granted to the Old Company was laid before them They would probably have been disposed to sanction the new arrangement which in truth differed little from that which they had themselves suggested not many months before if the Directors had acted with prudence But the Directors from the day on which they had obtained their charter had persecuted the interlopers without mercy and had quite forgotten that it was one thing to persecute interlopers in the Eastern Seas and another to persecute them in the port of London Hitherto the war of the monopolists against the private trade had been generally carried on at the distance of fifteen thousand miles from England If harsh things were done the English did not see them done and did not hear of them till long after they had been done nor was it by any means easy to ascertain at Westminster who had been right and who had been wrong in a dispute which had arisen three or four years before at Moorshedabad or Canton With incredible rashness the Directors determined at the very moment when the fate of their company was in the balance to give the people of this country a near view of the most odious features of the monopoly Some wealthy merchants of London had equipped a fine ship named the Redbridge Her crew was numerous her cargo of immense value Her papers had been made out for Alicant but there was some reason to suspect that she was really bound for the countries lying beyond the Cape of Good Hope She was stopped by the Admiralty in obedience to an order which the Company obtained from the Privy Council doubtless by the help of the Lord President Every day that she lay in the Thames caused a heavy expense to the owners The indignation in the City was great and general The Company maintained that from the legality of the monopoly the legality of the detention necessarily followed The public turned the argument round and being firmly convinced that the detention was illegal drew the inference that the monopoly must be illegal too The dispute was at the height when the Parliament met Petitions on both sides were speedily laid on the table of the Commons and it was resolved that these petitions should be taken into consideration by a Committee of the whole House The first question on which the conflicting parties tried their strength was the choice of a chairman The enemies of the Old Company proposed Papillon once the closest ally and subsequently the keenest opponent of Child and carried their point by a hundred and thirty eight votes to a hundred and six The Committee proceeded to inquire by what authority the Redbridge had been stopped One of her owners Gilbert Heathcote a rich merchant and a stanch Whig appeared at the bar as a witness He was asked whether he would venture to deny that the ship had really been fitted out for the Indian trade It is no sin that I know of he answered to trade with India and I shall trade with India till I am restrained by Act of Parliament Papillon reported that in the opinion of the Committee the detention of the Redbridge was illegal The question was then put that the House would agree with the Committee The friends of the Old Company ventured on a second division and were defeated by a hundred and seventy one votes to a hundred and twenty five four hundred ninety six The blow was quickly followed up A few days later it was moved that all subjects of England had equal right to trade to the East Indies unless prohibited by Act of Parliament and the supporters of the Old Company sensible that they were in a minority suffered the motion to pass without a division four hundred ninety seven This memorable vote settled the most important of the constitutional questions which had been left unsettled by the Bill of Rights It has ever since been held to be the sound doctrine that no power but that of the whole legislature can give to any person or to any society an exclusive privilege of trading to any part of the world The opinion of the great majority of the House of Commons was that the Indian trade could be advantageously carried on only by means of a joint stock and a monopoly It might therefore have been expected that the resolution which destroyed the monopoly of the Old Company would have been immediately followed by a law granting a monopoly to the New Company No such law however was passed The Old Company though not strong enough to defend its own privileges was able with the help of its Tory friends to prevent the rival association from obtaining similar privileges The consequence was that during some years there was nominally a free trade with India In fact the trade still lay under severe restrictions The private adventurer found indeed no difficulty in sailing from England but his situation was as perilous as ever when he had turned the Cape of Good Hope Whatever respect might be paid to a vote of the House of Commons by public functionaries in London such a vote was at Bombay or Calcutta much less regarded than a private letter from Child and Child still continued to fight the battle with unbroken spirit He sent out to the factories of the Company orders that no indulgence should be shown to the intruders For the House of Commons and for its resolutions he expressed the bitterest contempt Be guided by my instructions he wrote and not by the nonsense of a few ignorant country gentlemen who have hardly wit enough to manage their own private affairs and who know nothing at all about questions of trade It appears that his directions were obeyed Every where in the East during this period of anarchy servant of the Company and the independent merchant waged war on each other accused each other of piracy and tried by every artifice to exasperate the Mogul government against each other four hundred ninety eight The three great constitutional questions of the preceding year were in this year again brought under the consideration of Parliament In the first week of the session a Bill for the Regulation of Trials in cases of High Treason a Triennial Bill and a Place Bill were laid on the table of the House of Commons None of these bills became a law The first passed the Commons but was unfavourably received by the Peers William took so much interest in the question that he came down to the House of Lords not in his crown and robes but in the ordinary dress of a gentleman and sate through the whole debate on the second reading Caermarthen spoke of the dangers to which the State was at that time exposed and entreated his brethren not to give at such a moment impunity to traitors He was powerfully supported by two eminent orators who had during some years been on the uncourtly side of every question but who in this session showed a disposition to strengthen the hands of the government Halifax and Mulgrave Marlborough Rochester and Nottingham spoke for the bill but the general feeling was so clearly against them that they did not venture to divide It is probable however that the reasons urged by Caermarthen were not the reasons which chiefly swayed his hearers The Peers were fully determined that the bill should not pass without a clause altering the constitution of the Court of the Lord High Steward they knew that the Lower House was as fully determined not to pass such a clause and they thought it better that what must happen at last should happen speedily and without a quarrel four hundred ninety nine The fate of the Triennial Bill confounded all the calculations of the best informed politicians of that time and may therefore well seem extraordinary to us During the recess that bill had been described in numerous pamphlets written for the most part by persons zealous for the Revolution and for popular principles of government as the one thing needful as the universal cure for the distempers of the State On the first second and third readings in the House of Commons no division took place The Whigs were enthusiastic The Tories seemed to be acquiescent It was understood that the King though he had used his Veto for the purpose of giving the Houses an opportunity of reconsidering the subject had no intention of offering a pertinacious opposition to their wishes But Seymour with a cunning which long experience had matured after deferring the conflict to the last moment snatched the victory from his adversaries when they were most secure When the Speaker held up the bill in his hands and put the question whether it should pass the Noes were a hundred and forty six the Ayes only a hundred and thirty six five hundred Some eager Whigs flattered themselves that their defeat was the effect of a surprise and might be retrieved Within three days therefore Monmouth the most ardent and restless man in the whole party brought into the Upper House a bill substantially the same with that which had so strangely miscarried in the Lower The Peers passed this bill very expeditiously and sent it down to the Commons But in the Commons it found no favour Many members who professed to wish that the duration of parliaments should be limited resented the interference of the hereditary branch of the legislature in a matter which peculiarly concerned the elective branch The subject they said is one which especially belongs to us we have considered it we have come to a decision and it is scarcely parliamentary it is certainly most indelicate in their Lordships to call upon us to reverse that decision The question now is not whether the duration of parliaments ought to be limited but whether we ought to submit our judgment to the authority of the Peers and to rescind at their bidding what we did only a fortnight ago The animosity with which the patrician order was regarded was inflamed by the arts and the eloquence of Seymour The bill contained a definition of the words to hold a Parliament This definition was scrutinised with extreme jealousy and was thought by many with very little reason to have been framed for the purpose of extending the privileges already invidiously great of the nobility It appears from the scanty and obscure fragments of the debates which have come down to us that bitter reflections were thrown on the general conduct both political and judicial of the Peers Old Titus though zealous for triennial parliaments owned that he was not surprised at the ill humour which many gentlemen showed It is true he said that we ought to be dissolved but it is rather hard I must own that the Lords are to prescribe the time of our dissolution The Apostle Paul wished to be dissolved but I doubt if his friends had set him a day he would not have taken it kindly of them The bill was rejected by a hundred and ninety seven votes to a hundred and twenty seven five hundred one The Place Bill differing very little from the Place Bill which had been brought in twelve months before passed easily through the Commons Most of the Tories supported it warmly and the Whigs did not venture to oppose it It went up to the Lords and soon came back completely changed As it had been originally drawn it provided that no member of the House of Commons elected after the first of January sixteen ninety four should accept any place of profit under the Crown on pain of forfeiting his seat and of being incapable of sitting again in the same Parliament The Lords had added the words unless he be afterwards again chosen to serve in the same Parliament These words few as they were sufficed to deprive the bill of nine tenths of its efficacy both for good and for evil It was most desirable that the crowd of subordinate public functionaries should be kept out of the House of Commons It was most undesirable that the heads of the great executive departments should be kept out of that House The bill as altered left that House open both to those who ought and to those who ought not to have been admitted It very properly let in the Secretaries of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer but it let in with them Commissioners of Wine Licenses and Commissioners of the Navy Receivers Surveyors Storekeepers Clerks of the Acts and Clerks of the Cheque Clerks of the Green Cloth and Clerks of the Great Wardrobe So little did the Commons understand what they were about that after framing a law in one view most mischievous and in another view most beneficial they were perfectly willing that it should be transformed into a law quite harmless and almost useless They agreed to the amendment and nothing was now wanting but the royal sanction That sanction certainly ought not to have been withheld and probably would not have been withheld if William had known how unimportant the bill now was But he understood the question as little as the Commons themselves He knew that they imagined that they had devised a most stringent limitation of the royal power and he was determined not to submit without a struggle to any such limitation He was encouraged by the success with which he had hitherto resisted the attempts of the two Houses to encroach on his prerogative He had refused to pass the bill which quartered the judges on his hereditary revenue and the Parliament had silently acquiesced in the justice of the refusal He had refused to pass the Triennial Bill and the Commons had since by rejecting two Triennial Bills acknowledged that he had done well He ought however to have considered that on both these occasions the announcement of his refusal was immediately followed by the announcement that the Parliament was prorogued On both these occasions therefore the members had half a year to think and to grow cool before the next sitting The case was now very different The principal business of the session was hardly begun estimates were still under consideration bills of supply were still depending and if the Houses should take a fit of ill humour the consequences might be serious indeed He resolved however to run the risk Whether he had any adviser is not known His determination seems to have taken both the leading Whigs and the leading Tories by surprise When the Clerk had proclaimed that the King and Queen would consider of the bill touching free and impartial proceedings in Parliament the Commons retired from the bar of the Lords in a resentful and ungovernable mood As soon as the Speaker was again in his chair there was a long and tempestuous debate All other business was postponed All committees were adjourned It was resolved that the House would early the next morning take into consideration the state of the nation When the morning came the excitement did not appear to have abated The mace was sent into Westminster Hall and into the Court of Requests All members who could be found were brought into the House That none might be able to steal away unnoticed the back door was locked and the key laid on the table All strangers were ordered to retire With these solemn preparations began a sitting which reminded a few old men of some of the first sittings of the Kong Parliament High words were uttered by the enemies of the government Its friends afraid of being accused of abandoning the cause of the Commons of England for the sake of royal favour hardly ventured to raise their voices Montague alone seems to have defended the King Lowther though high in office and a member of the cabinet owned that there were evil influences at work and expressed a wish to see the Sovereign surrounded by counsellors in whom the representatives of the people could confide Harley Foley and Howe carried every thing before them A resolution affirming that those who had advised the Crown on this occasion were public enemies was carried with only two or three Noes Harley after reminding his hearers that they had their negative voice as the King had his and that if His Majesty refused then redress they could refuse him money moved that they should go up to the Throne not as usual with a Humble Address but with a Representation Some members proposed to substitute the more respectful word Address but they were overruled and a committee was appointed to draw up the Representation Another night passed and when the House met again it appeared that the storm had greatly subsided The malignant joy and the wild hopes which the Jacobites had during the last forty eight hours expressed with their usual imprudence had incensed and alarmed the Whigs and the moderate Tories Many members too were frightened by hearing that William was fully determined not to yield without an appeal to the nation Such an appeal might have been successful for a dissolution on any ground whatever would at that moment have been a highly popular exercise of the prerogative The constituent bodies it was well known were generally zealous for the Triennial Bill and cared comparatively little about the Place Bill Many Tory members therefore who had recently voted against the Triennial Bill were by no means desirous to run the risks of a general election When the Representation which Harley and his friends had prepared was read it was thought offensively strong After being recommitted shortened and softened it was presented by the whole House William s answer was kind and gentle but he conceded nothing He assured the Commons that he remembered with gratitude the support which he had on many occasions received from them that he should always consider their advice as most valuable and that he should look on counsellors who might attempt to raise dissension between him and his Parliament as his enemies but he uttered not a word which could be construed into an acknowledgment that he had used his Veto ill or into a promise that he would not use it again The Commons on the morrow took his speech into consideration Harley and his allies complained that the King s answer was no answer at all threatened to tack the Place Bill to a money bill and proposed to make a second representation pressing His Majesty to explain himself more distinctly But by this time there was a strong reflux of feeling in the assembly The Whigs had not only recovered from their dismay but were in high spirits and eager for conflict Wharton Russell and Littleton maintained that the House ought to be satisfied with what the King had said Do you wish said Littleton to make sport for your enemies There is no want of them They besiege our very doors We read as we come through the lobby in the face and gestures of every nonjuror whom we pass delight at the momentary coolness which has arisen between us and the King That should be enough for us We may be sure that we are voting rightly when we give a vote which tends to confound the hopes of traitors The House divided Harley was a teller on one side Wharton on the other Only eighty eight voted with Harley two hundred and twenty nine with Wharton The Whigs were so much elated by their victory that some of them wished to move a vote of thanks to William for his gracious answer but they were restrained by wiser men We have lost time enough already in these unhappy debates said a leader of the party Let us get to Ways and Means as fast as we can The best form which our thanks can take is that of a money bill Thus ended more happily than William had a right to expect one of the most dangerous contests in which he ever engaged with his Parliament At the Dutch Embassy the rising and going down of this tempest had been watched with intense interest and the opinion there seems to have been that the King had on the whole lost neither power nor popularity by his conduct five hundred two Another question which excited scarcely less angry feeling in Parliament and in the country was about the same time under consideration On the sixth of December a Whig member of the House of Commons obtained leave to bring in a bill for the Naturalisation of Foreign Protestants Plausible arguments in favour of such a bill were not wanting Great numbers of people eminently industrious and intelligent firmly attached to our faith and deadly enemies of our deadly enemies were at that time without a country Among the Huguenots who had fled from the tyranny of the French King were many persons of great fame in war in letters in arts and in sciences and even the humblest refugees were intellectually and morally above the average of the common people of any kingdom in Europe With French Protestants who had been driven into exile by the edicts of Lewis were now mingled German Protestants who had been driven into exile by his arms Vienna Berlin Basle Hamburg Amsterdam London swarmed with honest laborious men who had once been thriving burghers of Heidelberg or Mannheim or who had cultivated vineyards along the banks of the Neckar and the Rhine A statesman might well think that it would be at once generous and politic to invite to the English shores and to incorporate with the English people emigrants so unfortunate and so respectable Their ingenuity and their diligence could not fail to enrich any land which should afford them an asylum nor could it be doubted that they would manfully defend the country of their adoption against him whose cruelty had driven them from the country of their birth The first two readings passed without a division But on the motion that the bill should be committed there was a debate in which the right of free speech was most liberally used by the opponents of the government It was idle they said to talk about the poor Huguenots or the poor Palatines The bill was evidently meant for the benefit not of French Protestants or German Protestants but of Dutchmen who would be Protestants Papists or Pagans for a guilder a head and who would no doubt be as ready to sign the Declaration against Transubstantiation in England as to trample on the Cross in Japan They would come over in multitudes They would swarm in every public office They would collect the customs and gauge the beer barrels Our Navigation Laws would be virtually repealed Every merchant ship that cleared out from the Thames or the Severn would be manned by Zealanders and Hollanders and Frieslanders To our own sailors would be left the hard and perilous service of the royal navy For Hans after filling the pockets of his huge trunk hose with our money by assuming the character of a native would as soon as a pressgang appeared lay claim to the privileges of an alien The intruders would soon rule every corporation They would elbow our own Aldermen off the Royal Exchange They would buy the hereditary woods and halls of our country gentlemen Already one of the most noisome of the plagues of Egypt was among us Frogs had made their appearance even in the royal chambers Nobody could go to Saint James s without being disgusted by hearing the reptiles of the Batavian marshes croaking all round him and if this bill should pass the whole country would be as much infested by the loathsome brood as the palace already was The orator who indulged himself most freely in this sort of rhetoric was Sir John Knight member for Bristol a coarseminded and spiteful Jacobite who if he had been an honest man would have been a nonjuror Two years before when Mayor of Bristol he had acquired a discreditable notoriety by treating with gross disrespect a commission sealed with the great seal of the Sovereigns to whom he had repeatedly sworn allegiance and by setting on the rabble of his city to hoot and pelt the Judges five hundred three He now concluded a savage invective by desiring that the Serjeant at Arms would open the doors in order that the odious roll of parchment which was nothing less than a surrender of the birthright of the English people might be treated with proper contumely Let us first he said kick the bill out of the House and then let us kick the foreigners out of the kingdom On a division the motion for committing the bill was carried by a hundred and sixty three votes to a hundred and twenty eight five hundred four But the minority was zealous and pertinacious and the majority speedily began to waver Knight s speech retouched and made more offensive soon appeared in print without a license Tens of thousands of copies were circulated by the post or dropped in the streets and such was the strength of national prejudice that too many persons read this ribaldry with assent and admiration But when a copy was produced in the House there was such an outbreak of indignation and disgust as cowed even the impudent and savage nature of the orator Finding himself in imminent danger of being expelled and sent to prison he apologized and disclaimed all knowledge of the paper which purported to be a report of what he had said He escaped with impunity but his speech was voted false scandalous and seditious and was burned by the hangman in Palace Yard The bill which had caused all this ferment was prudently suffered to drop five hundred five Meanwhile the Commons were busied with financial questions of grave importance The estimates for the year sixteen ninety four were enormous The King proposed to add to the regular army already the greatest regular army that England had ever supported four regiments of dragoons eight of horse and twenty five of infantry The whole number of men officers included would thus be increased to about ninety four thousand five hundred six Cromwell while holding down three reluctant kingdoms and making vigorous war on Spain in Europe and America had never had two thirds of the military force which William now thought necessary The great body of the Tories headed by three Whig chiefs Harley Foley and Howe opposed any augmentation The great body of the Whigs headed by Montague and Wharton would have granted all that was asked After many long discussions and probably many close divisions in the Committee of Supply the King obtained the greater part of what he demanded The House allowed him four new regiments of dragoons six of horse and fifteen of infantry The whole number of troops voted for the year amounted to eighty three thousand the charge to more than two millions and a half including about two hundred thousand pounds for the ordnance five hundred seven The naval estimates passed much more rapidly for Whigs and Tories agreed in thinking that the maritime ascendency of England ought to be maintained at any cost Five hundred thousand pounds were voted for paying the arrears due to seamen and two millions for the expenses of the year sixteen ninety four five hundred eight The Commons then proceeded to consider the Ways and Means The land tax was renewed at four shillings in the pound and by this simple but powerful machinery about two millions were raised with certainty and despatch five hundred nine A poll tax was imposed five hundred ten Stamp duties had long been among the fiscal resources of Holland and France and had existed here during part of the reign of Charles the Second but had been suffered to expire They were now revived and they have ever since formed an important part of the revenue of the State five hundred eleven The hackney coaches of the capital were taxed and were placed under the government of commissioners in spite of the resistance of the wives of the coachmen who assembled round Westminster Hall and mobbed the members five hundred twelve But notwithstanding all these expedients there was still a large deficiency and it was again necessary to borrow A new duty on salt and some other imposts of less importance were set apart to form a fund for a loan On the security of this fund a million was to be raised by a lottery but a lottery which had scarcely any thing but the name in common with the lotteries of a later period The sum to be contributed was divided into a hundred thousand shares of ten pounds each The interest on each share was to be twenty shillings annually or in other words ten per cent during sixteen years But ten per cent for sixteen years was not a bait which was likely to attract lenders An additional lure was therefore held out to capitalists On one fortieth of the shares much higher interest was to be paid than on the other thirty nine fortieths Which of the shares should be prizes was to be determined by lot The arrangements for the drawing of the tickets were made by an adventurer of the name of Neale who after squandering away two fortunes had been glad to become groom porter at the palace His duties were to call the odds when the Court played at hazard to provide cards and dice and to decide any dispute which might arise on the bowling green or at the gaming table He was eminently skilled in the business of this not very exalted post and had made such sums by raffles that he was able to engage in very costly speculations and was then covering the ground round the Seven Dials with buildings He was probably the best adviser that could have been consulted about the details of a lottery Yet there were not wanting persons who thought it hardly decent in the Treasury to call in the aid of a gambler by profession five hundred thirteen By the lottery loan as it was called one million was obtained But another million was wanted to bring the estimated revenue for the year sixteen ninety four up to a level with the estimated expenditure The ingenious and enterprising Montague had a plan ready a plan to which except under the pressure of extreme pecuniary difficulties he might not easily have induced the Commons to assent but which to his large and vigorous mind appeared to have advantages both commercial and political more important than the immediate relief to the finances He succeeded not only in supplying the wants of the State for twelve months but in creating a great institution which after the lapse of more than a century and a half continues to flourish and which he lived to see the stronghold through all vicissitudes of the Whig party and the bulwark in dangerous times of the Protestant succession In the reign of William old men were still living who could remember the days when there was not a single banking house in the city of London So late as the time of the Restoration every trader had his own strong box in his own house and when an acceptance was presented to him told down the crowns and Caroluses on his own counter But the increase of wealth had produced its natural effect the subdivision of labour Before the end of the reign of Charles the Second a new mode of paying and receiving money had come into fashion among the merchants of the capital A class of agents arose whose office was to keep the cash of the commercial houses This new branch of business naturally fell into the hands of the goldsmiths who were accustomed to traffic largely in the precious metals and who had vaults in which great masses of bullion could lie secure from fire and from robbers It was at the shops of the goldsmiths of Lombard Street that all the payments in coin were made Other traders gave and received nothing but paper This great change did not take place without much opposition and clamour Oldfashioned merchants complained bitterly that a class of men who thirty years before had confined themselves to their proper functions and had made a fair profit by embossing silver bowls and chargers by setting jewels for fine ladies and by selling pistoles and dollars to gentlemen setting out for the Continent had become the treasurers and were fast becoming the masters of the whole City These usurers it was said played at hazard with what had been earned by the industry and hoarded by the thrift of other men If the dice turned up well the knave who kept the cash became an alderman if they turned up ill the dupe who furnished the cash became a bankrupt On the other side the conveniences of the modern practice were set forth in animated language The new system it was said saved both labour and money Two clerks seated in one counting house did what under the old system must have been done by twenty clerks in twenty different establishments A goldsmith s note might be transferred ten times in a morning and thus a hundred guineas locked in his safe close to the Exchange did what would formerly have required a thousand guineas dispersed through many tills some on Ludgate Hill some in Austin Friars and some in Tower Street five hundred fourteen Gradually even those who had been loudest in murmuring against the innovation gave way and conformed to the prevailing usage The last person who held out strange to say was Sir Dudley North When in sixteen eighty after residing many years abroad he returned to London nothing astonished or displeased him more than the practice of making payments by drawing bills on bankers He found that he could not go on Change without being followed round the piazza by goldsmiths who with low bows begged to have the honour of serving him He lost his temper when his friends asked where he kept his cash Where should I keep it he asked but in my own house With difficulty he was induced to put his money into the hands of one of the Lombard Street men as they were called Unhappily the Lombard Street man broke and some of his customers suffered severely Dudley North lost only fifty pounds but this loss confirmed him in his dislike of the whole mystery of banking It was in vain however that he exhorted his fellow citizens to return to the good old practice and not to expose themselves to utter ruin in order to spare themselves a little trouble He stood alone against the whole community The advantages of the modern system were felt every hour of every day in every part of London and people were no more disposed to relinquish those advantages for fear of calamities which occurred at long intervals than to refrain from building houses for fear of fires or from building ships for fear of hurricanes It is a curious circumstance that a man who as a theorist was distinguished from all the merchants of his time by the largeness of his views and by his superiority to vulgar prejudices should in practice have been distinguished from all the merchants of his time by the obstinacy with which he adhered to an ancient mode of doing business long after the dullest and most ignorant plodders had abandoned that mode for one better suited to a great commercial society five hundred fifteen No sooner had banking become a separate and important trade than men began to discuss with earnestness the question whether it would be expedient to erect a national bank The general opinion seems to have been decidedly in favour of a national bank nor can we wonder at this for few were then aware that trade is in general carried on to much more advantage by individuals than by great societies and banking really is one of those few trades which can be carried on to as much advantage by a great society as by an individual Two public banks had long been renowned throughout Europe the Bank of Saint George at Genoa and the Bank of Amsterdam The immense wealth which was in the keeping of those establishments the confidence which they inspired the prosperity which they had created their stability tried by panics by wars by revolutions and found proof against all were favourite topics The bank of Saint George had nearly completed its third century It had begun to receive deposits and to make loans before Columbus had crossed the Atlantic before Gama had turned the Cape when a Christian Emperor was reigning at Constantinople when a Mahomedan Sultan was reigning at Granada when Florence was a Republic when Holland obeyed a hereditary Prince All these things had been changed New continents and new oceans had been discovered The Turk was at Constantinople the Castilian was at Granada Florence had its hereditary Prince Holland was a Republic but the Bank of Saint George was still receiving deposits and making loans The Bank of Amsterdam was little more than eighty years old but its solvency had stood severe tests Even in the terrible crisis of sixteen seventy two when the whole Delta of the Rhine was overrun by the French armies when the white flags were seen from the top of the Stadthouse there was one place where amidst the general consternation and confusion tranquillity and order were still to be found and that place was the Bank Why should not the Bank of London be as great and as durable as the Banks of Genoa and of Amsterdam Before the end of the reign of Charles the Second several plans were proposed examined attacked and defended Some pamphleteers maintained that a national bank ought to be under the direction of the King Others thought that the management ought to be entrusted to the Lord Mayor Aldermen and Common Council of the capital five hundred sixteen After the Revolution the subject was discussed with an animation before unknown For under the influence of liberty the breed of political projectors multiplied exceedingly A crowd of plans some of which resemble the fancies of a child or the dreams of a man in a fever were pressed on the government Preeminently conspicuous among the political mountebanks whose busy faces were seen every day in the lobby of the House of Commons were John Briscoe and Hugh Chamberlayne two projectors worthy to have been members of that Academy which Gulliver found at Lagado These men affirmed that the one cure for every distemper of the State was a Land Bank A Land Bank would work for England miracles such as had never been wrought for Israel miracles exceeding the heaps of quails and the daily shower of manna There would be no taxes and yet the Exchequer would be full to overflowing There would be no poor rates for there would be no poor The income of every landowner would be doubled The profits of every merchant would be increased In short the island would to use Briscoe s words be the paradise of the world The only losers would be the moneyed men those worst enemies of the nation who had done more injury to the gentry and yeomanry than an invading army from France would have had the heart to do five hundred seventeen These blessed effects the Land Bank was to produce simply by issuing enormous quantities of notes on landed security The doctrine of the projectors was that every person who had real property ought to have besides that property paper money to the full value of that property Thus if his estate was worth two thousand pounds he ought to have his estate and two thousand pounds in paper money five hundred eighteen Both Briscoe and Chamberlayne treated with the greatest contempt the notion that there could be an overissue of paper as long as there was for every ten pound note a piece of land in the country worth ten pounds Nobody they said would accuse a goldsmith of overissuing as long as his vaults contained guineas and crowns to the full value of all the notes which bore his signature Indeed no goldsmith had in his vaults guineas and crowns to the full value of all his paper And was not a square mile of rich land in Taunton Dean at least as well entitled to be called wealth as a bag of gold or silver The projectors could not deny that many people had a prejudice in favour of the precious metals and that therefore if the Land Bank were bound to cash its notes it would very soon stop payment This difficulty they got over by proposing that the notes should be inconvertible and that every body should be forced to take them The speculations of Chamberlayne on the subject of the currency may possibly find admirers even in our own time But to his other errors he added an error which began and ended with him He was fool enough to take it for granted in all his reasonings that the value of an estate varied directly as the duration He maintained that if the annual income derived from a manor were a thousand pounds a grant of that manor for twenty years must be worth twenty thousand pounds and a grant for a hundred years worth a hundred thousand pounds If therefore the lord of such a manor would pledge it for a hundred years to the Land Bank the Land Bank might on that security instantly issue notes for a hundred thousand pounds On this subject Chamberlayne was proof to ridicule to argument even to arithmetical demonstration He was reminded that the fee simple of land would not sell for more than twenty years purchase To say therefore that a term of a hundred years was worth five times as much as a term of twenty years was to say that a term of a hundred years was worth five times the fee simple in other words that a hundred was five times infinity Those who reasoned thus were refuted by being told that they were usurers and it should seem that a large number of country gentlemen thought the refutation complete five hundred nineteen In December sixteen ninety three Chamberlayne laid his plan in all its naked absurdity before the Commons and petitioned to be heard He confidently undertook to raise eight thousand pounds on every freehold estate of a hundred and fifty pounds a year which should be brought as he expressed it into his Land Bank and this without dispossessing the freeholder five hundred twenty All the squires in the House must have known that the fee simple of such an estate would hardly fetch three thousand pounds in the market That less than the fee simple of such an estate could by any device be made to produce eight thousand pounds would it might have been thought have seemed incredible to the most illiterate foxhunter that could be found on the benches Distress however and animosity had made the landed gentlemen credulous They insisted on referring Chamberlayne s plan to a committee and the committee reported that the plan was practicable and would tend to the benefit of the nation five hundred twenty one But by this time the united force of demonstration and derision had begun to produce an effect even on the most ignorant rustics in the House The report lay unnoticed on the table and the country was saved from a calamity compared with which the defeat of Landen and the loss of the Smyrna fleet would have been blessings All the projectors of this busy time however were not so absurd as Chamberlayne One among them William Paterson was an ingenious though not always a judicious speculator Of his early life little is known except that he was a native of Scotland and that he had been in the West Indies In what character he had visited the West Indies was a matter about which his contemporaries differed His friends said that he had been a missionary his enemies that he had been a buccaneer He seems to have been gifted by nature with fertile invention an ardent temperament and great powers of persuasion and to have acquired somewhere in the course of his vagrant life a perfect knowledge of accounts This man submitted to the government in sixteen ninety one a plan of a national bank and his plan was favourably received both by statesmen and by merchants But years passed away and nothing was done till in the spring of sixteen ninety four it became absolutely necessary to find some new mode of defraying the charges of the war Then at length the scheme devised by the poor and obscure Scottish adventurer was taken up in earnest by Montague With Montague was closely allied Michael Godfrey the brother of that Sir Edmondsbury Godfrey whose sad and mysterious death had fifteen years before produced a terrible outbreak of popular feeling Michael was one of the ablest most upright and most opulent of the merchant princes of London He was as might have been expected from his near connection with the martyr of the Protestant faith a zealous Whig Some of his writings are still extant and prove him to have had a strong and clear mind By these two distinguished men Paterson s scheme was fathered Montague undertook to manage the House of Commons Godfrey to manage the City An approving vote was obtained from the Committee of Ways and Means and a bill the title of which gave occasion to many sarcasms was laid on the table It was indeed not easy to guess that a bill which purported only to impose a new duty on tonnage for the benefit of such persons as should advance money towards carrying on the war was really a bill creating the greatest commercial institution that the world had ever seen The plan was that twelve hundred thousand pounds should be borrowed by the government on what was then considered as the moderate interest of eight per cent In order to induce capitalists to advance the money promptly on terms so favourable to the public the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England The corporation was to have no exclusive privilege and was to be restricted from trading in any thing but bills of exchange bullion and forfeited pledges As soon as the plan became generally known a paper war broke out as furious as that between the swearers and the nonswearers or as that between the Old East India Company and the New East India Company The projectors who had failed to gain the ear of the government fell like madmen on their more fortunate brother All the goldsmiths and pawnbrokers set up a howl of rage Some discontented Tories predicted ruin to the monarchy It was remarkable they said that Banks and Kings had never existed together Banks were republican institutions There were flourishing banks at Venice at Genoa at Amsterdam and at Hamburg But who had ever heard of a Bank of France or a Bank of Spain five hundred twenty two Some discontented Whigs on the other hand predicted ruin to our liberties Here they said is an instrument of tyranny more formidable than the High Commission than the Star Chamber than even the fifty thousand soldiers of Oliver The whole wealth of the nation will be in the hands of the Tonnage Bank such was the nickname then in use and the Tonnage Bank will be in the hands of the Sovereign The power of the purse the one great security for all the rights of Englishmen will be transferred from the House of Commons to the Governor and Directors of the new Company This last consideration was really of some weight and was allowed to be so by the authors of the bill A clause was therefore most properly inserted which inhibited the Bank from advancing money to the Crown without authority from Parliament Every infraction of this salutary rule was to be punished by forfeiture of three times the sum advanced and it was provided that the King should not have power to remit any part of the penalty The plan thus amended received the sanction of the Commons more easily than might have been expected from the violence of the adverse clamour In truth the Parliament was under duress Money must be had and could in no other way be had so easily What took place when the House had resolved itself into a committee cannot be discovered but while the Speaker was in the chair no division took place The bill however was not safe when it had reached the Upper House Some Lords suspected that the plan of a national bank had been devised for the purpose of exalting the moneyed interest at the expense of the landed interest Others thought that this plan whether good or bad ought not to have been submitted to them in such a form Whether it would be safe to call into existence a body which might one day rule the whole commercial world and how such a body should be constituted were questions which ought not to be decided by one branch of the Legislature The Peers ought to be at perfect liberty to examine all the details of the proposed scheme to suggest amendments to ask for conferences It was therefore most unfair that the law establishing the Bank should be sent up as part of a law granting supplies to the Crown The Jacobites entertained some hope that the session would end with a quarrel between the Houses that the Tonnage Bill would be lost and that William would enter on the campaign without money It was already May according to the New Style The London season was over and many noble families had left Covent Garden and Soho Square for their woods and hayfields But summonses were sent out There was a violent rush back to town The benches which had lately been deserted were crowded The sittings began at an hour unusually early and were prolonged to an hour unusually late On the day on which the bill was committed the contest lasted without intermission from nine in the morning till six in the evening Godolphin was in the chair Nottingham and Rochester proposed to strike out all the clauses which related to the Bank Something was said about the danger of setting up a gigantic corporation which might soon give law to the King and the three Estates of the Realm But the Peers seemed to be most moved by the appeal which was made to them as landlords The whole scheme it was asserted was intended to enrich usurers at the expense of the nobility and gentry Persons who had laid by money would rather put it into the Bank than lend it on mortgage at moderate interest Caermarthen said little or nothing in defence of what was in truth the work of his rivals and enemies He owned that there were grave objections to the mode in which the Commons had provided for the public service of the year But would their Lordships amend a money bill Would they engage in a contest of which the end must be that they must either yield or incur the grave responsibility of leaving the Channel without a fleet during the summer This argument prevailed and on a division the amendment was rejected by forty three votes to thirty one A few hours later the bill received the royal assent and the Parliament was prorogued five hundred twenty three In the City the success of Montague s plan was complete It was then at least as difficult to raise a million at eight per cent as it would now be to raise thirty millions at four per cent It had been supposed that contributions would drop in very slowly and a considerable time had therefore been allowed by the Act This indulgence was not needed So popular was the new investment that on the day on which the books were opened three hundred thousand pounds were subscribed three hundred thousand more were subscribed during the next forty eight hours and in ten days to the delight of all the friends of the government it was announced that the list was full The whole sum which the Corporation was bound to lend to the State was paid into the Exchequer before the first instalment was due five hundred twenty four Somers gladly put the Great Seal to a charter framed in conformity with the terms prescribed by Parliament and the Bank of England commenced its operations in the house of the Company of Grocers There during many years directors secretaries and clerks might be seen labouring in different parts of one spacious hall The persons employed by the bank were originally only fifty four They are now nine hundred The sum paid yearly in salaries amounted at first to only four thousand three hundred and fifty pounds It now exceeds two hundred and ten thousand pounds We may therefore fairly infer that the incomes of commercial clerks are on an average about three times as large in the reign of Victoria as they were in the reign of William the Third five hundred twenty five It soon appeared that Montague had by skilfully availing himself of the financial difficulties of the country rendered an inestimable service to his party During several generations the Bank of England was emphatically a Whig body It was Whig not accidentally but necessarily It must have instantly stopped payment if it had ceased to receive the interest on the sum which it had advanced to the government and of that interest James would not have paid one farthing Seventeen years after the passing of the Tonnage Bill Addison in one of his most ingenious and graceful little allegories described the situation of the great Company through which the immense wealth of London was constantly circulating He saw Public Credit on her throne in Grocers Hall the Great Charter over her head the Act of Settlement full in her view Her touch turned every thing to gold Behind her seat bags filled with coin were piled up to the ceiling On her right and on her left the floor was hidden by pyramids of guineas On a sudden the door flies open The Pretender rushes in a sponge in one hand in the other a sword which he shakes at the Act of Settlement The beautiful Queen sinks down fainting The spell by which she has turned all things around her into treasure is broken The money bags shrink like pricked bladders The piles of gold pieces are turned into bundles of rags or faggots of wooden tallies five hundred twenty six The truth which this parable was meant to convey was constantly present to the minds of the rulers of the Bank So closely was their interest bound up with the interest of the government that the greater the public danger the more ready were they to come to the rescue In old times when the Treasury was empty when the taxes came in slowly and when the pay of the soldiers and sailors was in arrear it had been necessary for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to go hat in hand up and down Cheapside and Cornhill attended by the Lord Mayor and by the Aldermen and to make up a sum by borrowing a hundred pounds from this hosier and two hundred pounds from that ironmonger five hundred twenty seven Those times were over The government instead of laboriously scooping up supplies from numerous petty sources could now draw whatever it required from an immense reservoir which all those petty sources kept constantly replenished It is hardly too much to say that during many years the weight of the Bank which was constantly in the scale of the Whigs almost counterbalanced the weight of the Church which was as constantly in the scale of the Tories A few minutes after the bill which established the Bank of England had received the royal assent the Parliament was prorogued by the King with a speech in which he warmly thanked the Commons for their liberality Montague was immediately rewarded for his services with the place of Chancellor of the Exchequer five hundred twenty eight Shrewsbury had a few weeks before consented to accept the seals He had held out resolutely from November to March While he was trying to find excuses which might satisfy his political friends Sir James Montgomery visited him Montgomery was now the most miserable of human beings Having borne a great part in a great Revolution having been charged with the august office of presenting the Crown of Scotland to the Sovereigns whom the Estates had chosen having domineered without a rival during several months in the Parliament at Edinburgh having seen before him in near prospect the seals of Secretary the coronet of an Earl ample wealth supreme power he had on a sudden sunk into obscurity and abject penury His fine parts still remained and he was therefore used by the Jacobites but though used he was despised distrusted and starved He passed his life in wandering from England to France and from France back to England without finding a resting place in either country Sometimes he waited in the antechamber at Saint Germains where the priests scowled at him as a Calvinist and where even the Protestant Jacobites cautioned one another in whispers against the old Republican Sometimes he lay hid in the garrets of London imagining that every footstep which he heard on the stairs was that of a bailiff with a writ or that of a King s messenger with a warrant He now obtained access to Shrewsbury and ventured to talk as a Jacobite to a brother Jacobite Shrewsbury who was not at all inclined to put his estate and his neck in the power of a man whom he knew to be both rash and perfidious returned very guarded answers Through some channel which is not known to us William obtained full intelligence of what had passed on this occasion He sent for Shrewsbury and again spoke earnestly about the secretaryship Shrewsbury again excused himself His health he said was bad That said William is not your only reason No Sir said Shrewsbury it is not And he began to speak of public grievances and alluded to the fate of the Triennial Bill which he had himself introduced But William cut him short There is another reason behind When did you see Montgomery last Shrewsbury was thunderstruck The King proceeded to repeat some things which Montgomery had said By this time Shrewsbury had recovered from his dismay and had recollected that in the conversation which had been so accurately reported to the government he had fortunately uttered no treason though he had heard much Sir said he since Your Majesty has been so correctly informed you must be aware that I gave no encouragement to that man s attempts to seduce me from my allegiance William did not deny this but intimated that such secret dealings with noted Jacobites raised suspicions which Shrewsbury could remove only by accepting the seals That he said will put me quite at ease I know that you are a man of honour and that if you undertake to serve me you will serve me faithfully So pressed Shrewsbury complied to the great joy of his whole party and was immediately rewarded for his compliance with a dukedom and a garter five hundred twenty nine Thus a Whig ministry was gradually forming There were now two Whig Secretaries of State a Whig Keeper of the Great Seal a Whig First Lord of the Admiralty a Whig Chancellor of the Exchequer The Lord Privy Seal Pembroke might also be called a Whig for his mind was one which readily took the impress of any stronger mind with which it was brought into contact Seymour having been long enough a Commissioner of the Treasury to lose much of his influence with the Tory country gentlemen who had once listened to him as to an oracle was dismissed and his place was filled by John Smith a zealous and able Whig who had taken an active part in the debates of the late session five hundred thirty The only Tories who still held great offices in the executive government were the Lord President Caermarthen who though he began to feel that power was slipping from his grasp still clutched it desperately and the first Lord of the Treasury Godolphin who meddled little out of his own department and performed the duties of that department with skill and assiduity William however still tried to divide his favours between the two parties Though the Whigs were fast drawing to themselves the substance of power the Tories obtained their share of honorary distinctions Mulgrave who had during the late session exerted his great parliamentary talents in favour of the King s policy was created Marquess of Normanby and named a Cabinet Councillor but was never consulted He obtained at the same time a pension of three thousand pounds a year Caermarthen whom the late changes had deeply mortified was in some degree consoled by a signal mark of royal approbation He became Duke of Leeds It had taken him little more than twenty years to climb from the station of a Yorkshire country gentleman to the highest rank in the peerage Two great Whig Earls were at the same time created Dukes Bedford and Devonshire It ought to be mentioned that Bedford had repeatedly refused the dignity which he now somewhat reluctantly accepted He declared that he preferred his Earldom to a Dukedom and gave a very sensible reason for the preference An Earl who had a numerous family might send one son to the Temple and another to a counting house in the city But the sons of a Duke were all lords and a lord could not make his bread either at the bar or on Change The old man s objections however were overcome and the two great houses of Russell and Cavendish which had long been closely connected by friendship and by marriage by common opinions common sufferings and common triumphs received on the same day the greatest honour which it is in the power of the Crown to confer five hundred thirty one The Gazette which announced these creations announced also that the King had set out for the Continent He had before his departure consulted with his ministers about the means of counteracting a plan of naval operations which had been formed by the French government Hitherto the maritime war had been carried on chiefly in the Channel and the Atlantic But Lewis had now determined to concentrate his maritime forces in the Mediterranean He hoped that with their help the army of Marshal Noailles would be able to take Barcelona to subdue the whole of Catalonia and to compel Spain to sue for peace Accordingly Tourville s squadron consisting of fifty three men of war set sail from Brest on the twenty fifth of April and passed the Straits of Gibraltar on the fourth of May William in order to cross the designs of the enemy determined to send Russell to the Mediterranean with the greater part of the combined fleet of England and Holland A squadron was to remain in the British seas under the command of the Earl of Berkeley Talmash was to embark on board of this squadron with a large body of troops and was to attack Brest which would it was supposed in the absence of Tourville and his fifty three vessels be an easy conquest That preparations were making at Portsmouth for an expedition in which the land forces were to bear a part could not be kept a secret There was much speculation at the Rose and at Garraway s touching the destination of the armament Some talked of Rhe some of Oleron some of Rochelle some of Rochefort Many till the fleet actually began to move westward believed that it was bound for Dunkirk Many guessed that Brest would be the point of attack but they only guessed this for the secret was much better kept than most of the secrets of that age five hundred thirty two Russell till he was ready to weigh anchor persisted in assuring his Jacobite friends that he knew nothing His discretion was proof even against all the arts of Marlborough Marlborough however had other sources of intelligence To those sources he applied himself and he at length succeeded in discovering the whole plan of the government He instantly wrote to James He had he said but that moment ascertained that twelve regiments of infantry and two regiments of marines were about to embark under the command of Talmash for the purpose of destroying the harbour of Brest and the shipping which lay there This he added would be a great advantage to England But no consideration can or ever shall hinder me from letting you know what I think may be for your service He then proceeded to caution James against Russell I endeavoured to learn this some time ago from him but he always denied it to me though I am very sure that he knew the design for more than six weeks This gives me a bad sign of this man s intentions The intelligence sent by Marlborough to James was communicated by James to the French government That government took its measures with characteristic promptitude Promptitude was indeed necessary for when Marlborough s letter was written the preparations at Portsmouth were all but complete and if the wind had been favourable to the English the objects of the expedition might have been attained without a struggle But adverse gales detained our fleet in the Channel during another month Meanwhile a large body of troops was collected at Brest Vauban was charged with the duty of putting the defences in order and under his skilful direction batteries were planted which commanded every spot where it seemed likely that an invader would attempt to land Eight large rafts each carrying many mortars were moored in the harbour and some days before the English arrived all was ready for their reception On the sixth of June the whole allied fleet was on the Atlantic about fifteen leagues west of Cape Finisterre There Russell and Berkeley parted company Russell proceeded towards the Mediterranean Berkeley s squadron with the troops on board steered for the coast of Brittany and anchored just without Camaret Bay close to the mouth of the harbour of Brest Talmash proposed to land in Camaret Bay It was therefore desirable to ascertain with accuracy the state of the coast The eldest son of the Duke of Leeds now called Marquess of Caermarthen undertook to enter the basin and to obtain the necessary information The passion of this brave and eccentric young man for maritime adventure was unconquerable He had solicited and obtained the rank of Rear Admiral and had accompanied the expedition in his own yacht the Peregrine renowned as the masterpiece of shipbuilding and more than once already mentioned in this history Cutts who had distinguished himself by his intrepidity in the Irish war and had been rewarded with an Irish peerage offered to accompany Caermarthen Lord Mohun who desirous it may be hoped to efface by honourable exploits the stain which a shameful and disastrous brawl had left on his name was serving with the troops as a volunteer insisted on being of the party The Peregrine went into the bay with its gallant crew and came out safe but not without having run great risks Caermarthen reported that the defences of which however he had seen only a small part were formidable But Berkeley and Talmash suspected that he overrated the danger They were not aware that their design had long been known at Versailles that an army had been collected to oppose them and that the greatest engineer in the world had been employed to fortify the coast against them They therefore did not doubt that their troops might easily be put on shore under the protection of a fire from the ships On the following morning Caermarthen was ordered to enter the bay with eight vessels and to batter the French works Talmash was to follow with about a hundred boats full of soldiers It soon appeared that the enterprise was even more perilous than it had on the preceding day appeared to be Batteries which had then escaped notice opened on the ships a fire so murderous that several decks were soon cleared Great bodies of foot and horse were discernible and by their uniforms they appeared to be regular troops The young Rear Admiral sent an officer in all haste to warn Talmash But Talmash was so completely possessed by the notion that the French were not prepared to repel an attack that he disregarded all cautions and would not even trust his own eyes He felt sure that the force which he saw assembled on the shore was a mere rabble of peasants who had been brought together in haste from the surrounding country Confident that these mock soldiers would run like sheep before real soldiers he ordered his men to pull for the beach He was soon undeceived A terrible fire mowed down his troops faster than they could get on shore He had himself scarcely sprung on dry ground when he received a wound in the thigh from a cannon ball and was carried back to his skiff His men reembarked in confusion Ships and boats made haste to get out of the bay but did not succeed till four hundred seamen and seven hundred soldiers had fallen During many days the waves continued to throw up pierced and shattered corpses on the beach of Brittany The battery from which Talmash received his wound is called to this day the Englishman s Death The unhappy general was laid on his couch and a council of war was held in his cabin He was for going straight into the harbour of Brest and bombarding the town But this suggestion which indicated but too clearly that his judgment had been affected by the irritation of a wounded body and a wounded mind was wisely rejected by the naval officers The armament returned to Portsmouth There Talmash died exclaiming with his last breath that he had been lured into a snare by treachery The public grief and indignation were loudly expressed The nation remembered the services of the unfortunate general forgave his rashness pitied his sufferings and execrated the unknown traitors whose machinations had been fatal to him There were many conjectures and many rumours Some sturdy Englishmen misled by national prejudice swore that none of our plans would ever be kept a secret from the enemy while French refugees were in high military command Some zealous Whigs misled by party sprit muttered that the Court of Saint Germains would never want good intelligence while a single Tory remained in the Cabinet Council The real criminal was not named nor till the archives of the House of Stuart were explored was it known to the world that Talmash had perished by the basest of all the hundred villanies of Marlborough five hundred thirty three Yet never had Marlborough been less a Jacobite than at the moment when he rendered this wicked and shameful service to the Jacobite cause It may be confidently affirmed that to serve the banished family was not his object and that to ingratiate himself with the banished family was only his secondary object His primary object was to force himself into the service of the existing government and to regain possession of those important and lucrative places from which he had been dismissed more than two years before He knew that the country and the Parliament would not patiently bear to see the English army commanded by foreign generals Two Englishmen only had shown themselves fit for high military posts himself and Talmash If Talmash were defeated and disgraced William would scarcely have a choice In fact as soon as it was known that the expedition had failed and that Talmash was no more the general cry was that the King ought to receive into his favour the accomplished Captain who had done such good service at Walcourt at Cork and at Kinsale Nor can we blame the multitude for raising this cry For every body knew that Marlborough was an eminently brave skilful and successful officer but very few persons knew that he had while commanding William s troops while sitting in William s council while waiting in William s bedchamber formed a most artful and dangerous plot for the subversion of William s throne and still fewer suspected the real author of the recent calamity of the slaughter in the Bay of Camaret of the melancholy fate of Talmash The effect therefore of the foulest of all treasons was to raise the traitor in public estimation Nor was he wanting to himself at this conjuncture While the Royal Exchange was in consternation at this disaster of which he was the cause while many families were clothing themselves in mourning for the brave men of whom he was the murderer he repaired to Whitehall and there doubtless with all that grace that nobleness that suavity under which lay hidden from all common observers a seared conscience and a remorseless heart he professed himself the most devoted the most loyal of all the subjects of William and Mary and expressed a hope that he might in this emergency be permitted to offer his sword to their Majesties Shrewsbury was very desirous that the offer should be accepted but a short and dry answer from William who was then in the Netherlands put an end for the present to all negotiation About Talmash the King expressed himself with generous tenderness The poor fellow s fate he wrote has affected me much I do not indeed think that he managed well but it was his ardent desire to distinguish himself that impelled him to attempt impossibilities five hundred thirty four The armament which had returned to Portsmouth soon sailed again for the coast of France but achieved only exploits worse than inglorious An attempt was made to blow up the pier at Dunkirk Some towns inhabited by quiet tradesmen and fishermen were bombarded In Dieppe scarcely a house was left standing a third part of Havre was laid in ashes and shells were thrown into Calais which destroyed thirty private dwellings The French and the Jacobites loudly exclaimed against the cowardice and barbarity of making war on an unwarlike population The English government vindicated itself by reminding the world of the sufferings of the thrice wasted Palatinate and as against Lewis and the flatterers of Lewis the vindication was complete But whether it were consistent with humanity and with sound policy to visit the crimes which an absolute Prince and a ferocious soldiery had committed in the Palatinate on shopkeepers and labourers on women and children who did not know that the Palatinate existed may perhaps be doubted Meanwhile Russell s fleet was rendering good service to the common cause Adverse winds had impeded his progress through the Straits so long that he did not reach Carthagena till the middle of July By that time the progress of the French arms had spread terror even to the Escurial Noailles had on the banks of the Tar routed an army commanded by the Viceroy of Catalonia and on the day on which this victory was won the Brest squadron had joined the Toulon squadron in the Bay of Rosas Palamos attacked at once by land and sea was taken by storm Gerona capitulated after a faint show of resistance Ostalric surrendered at the first summons Barcelona would in all probability have fallen had not the French Admirals learned that the conquerors of La Hogue was approaching They instantly quitted the coast of Catalonia and never thought themselves safe till they had taken shelter under the batteries of Toulon The Spanish government expressed warm gratitude for this seasonable assistance and presented to the English Admiral a jewel which was popularly said to be worth near twenty thousand pounds sterling There was no difficulty in finding such a jewel among the hoards of gorgeous trinkets which had been left by Charles the Fifth and Philip the Second to a degenerate race But in all that constitutes the true wealth of states Spain was poor indeed Her treasury was empty her arsenals were unfurnished her ships were so rotten that they seemed likely to fly asunder at the discharge of their own guns Her ragged and starving soldiers often mingled with the crowd of beggars at the doors of convents and battled there for a mess of pottage and a crust of bread Russell underwent those trials which no English commander whose hard fate it has been to cooperate with Spaniards has escaped The Viceroy of Catalonia promised much did nothing and expected every thing He declared that three hundred and fifty thousand rations were ready to be served out to the fleet at Carthagena It turned out that there were not in all the stores of that port provisions sufficient to victual a single frigate for a single week Yet His Excellency thought himself entitled to complain because England had not sent an army as well as a fleet and because the heretic Admiral did not choose to expose the fleet to utter destruction by attacking the French under the guns of Toulon Russell implored the Spanish authorities to look well to their dockyards and to try to have by the next spring a small squadron which might at least be able to float but he could not prevail on them to careen a single ship He could with difficulty obtain on hard conditions permission to send a few of his sick men to marine hospitals on shore Yet in spite of all the trouble given him by the imbecility and ingratitude of a government which has generally caused more annoyance to its allies than to its enemies he acquitted himself well It is but just to him to say that from the time at which he became First Lord of the Admiralty there was a decided improvement in the naval administration Though he lay with his fleet many months near an inhospitable shore and at a great distance from England there were no complaints about the quality or the quantity of provisions The crews had better food and drink than they had ever had before comforts which Spain did not afford were supplied from home and yet the charge was not greater than when in Torrington s time the sailor was poisoned with mouldy biscuit and nauseous beer As almost the whole maritime force of France was in the Mediterranean and as it seemed likely that an attempt would be made on Barcelona in the following year Russell received orders to winter at Cadiz In October he sailed to that port and there he employed himself in refitting his ships with an activity unintelligible to the Spanish functionaries who calmly suffered the miserable remains of what had once been the greatest navy in the world to rot under their eyes five hundred thirty five Along the eastern frontier of France the war during this year seemed to languish In Piedmont and on the Rhine the most important events of the campaign were petty skirmishes and predatory incursions Lewis remained at Versailles and sent his son the Dauphin to represent him in the Netherlands but the Dauphin was placed under the tutelage of Luxemburg and proved a most submissive pupil During several months the hostile armies observed each other The allies made one bold push with the intention of carrying the war into the French territory but Luxemburg by a forced march which excited the admiration of persons versed in the military art frustrated the design William on the other hand succeeded in taking Huy then a fortress of the third rank No battle was fought no important town was besieged but the confederates were satisfied with their campaign Of the four previous years every one had been marked by some great disaster In sixteen ninety Waldeck had been defeated at Fleurus In sixteen ninety one Mons had fallen In sixteen ninety two Namur had been taken in sight of the allied army and this calamity had been speedily followed by the defeat of Steinkirk In sixteen ninety three the battle of Landen had been lost and Charleroy had submitted to the conqueror At length in sixteen ninety four the tide had begun to turn The French arms had made no progress What had been gained by the allies was indeed not much but the smallest gain was welcome to those whom a long run of evil fortune had discouraged In England the general opinion was that notwithstanding the disaster in Camaret Bay the war was on the whole proceeding satisfactorily both by land and by sea But some parts of the internal administration excited during this autumn much discontent Since Trenchard had been appointed Secretary of State the Jacobite agitators had found their situation much more unpleasant than before Sidney had been too indulgent and too fond of pleasure to give them much trouble Nottingham was a diligent and honest minister but he was as high a Tory as a faithful subject of William and Mary could be he loved and esteemed many of the nonjurors and though he might force himself to be severe when nothing but severity could save the State he was not extreme to mark the transgressions of his old friends nor did he encourage talebearers to come to Whitehall with reports of conspiracies But Trenchard was both an active public servant and an earnest Whig Even if he had himself been inclined to lenity he would have been urged to severity by those who surrounded him He had constantly at his side Hugh Speke and Aaron Smith men to whom a hunt after a Jacobite was the most exciting of all sports The cry of the malecontents was that Nottingham had kept his bloodhounds in the leash but that Trenchard had let them slip Every honest gentleman who loved the Church and hated the Dutch went in danger of his life There was a constant bustle at the Secretary s Office a constant stream of informers coming in and of messengers with warrants going out It was said too that the warrants were often irregularly drawn that they did not specify the person that they did not specify the crime and yet that under the authority of such instruments as these houses were entered desks and cabinets searched valuable papers carried away and men of good birth and breeding flung into gaol among felons five hundred thirty six The minister and his agents answered that Westminster Hall was open that if any man had been illegally imprisoned he had only to bring his action that juries were quite sufficiently disposed to listen to any person who pretended to have been oppressed by cruel and griping men in power and that as none of the prisoners whose wrongs were so pathetically described had ventured to resort to this obvious and easy mode of obtaining redress it might fairly be inferred that nothing had been done which could not be justified The clamour of the malecontents however made a considerable impression on the public mind and at length a transaction in which Trenchard was more unlucky than culpable brought on him and on the government with which he was connected much temporary obloquy Among the informers who haunted his office was an Irish vagabond who had borne more than one name and had professed more than one religion He now called himself Taaffe He had been a priest of the Roman Catholic Church and secretary to Adda the Papal Nuncio but had since the Revolution turned Protestant had taken a wife and had distinguished himself by his activity in discovering the concealed property of those Jesuits and Benedictines who during the late reign had been quartered in London The ministers despised him but they trusted him They thought that he had by his apostasy and by the part which he had borne in the spoliation of the religious orders cut himself off from all retreat and that having nothing but a halter to expect from King James he must be true to King William five hundred thirty seven This man fell in with a Jacobite agent named Lunt who had since the Revolution been repeatedly employed among the discontented gentry of Cheshire and Lancashire and who had been privy to those plans of insurrection which had been disconcerted by the battle of the Boyne in sixteen ninety and by the battle of La Hogue in sixteen ninety two Lunt had once been arrested on suspicion of treason but had been discharged for want of legal proof of his guilt He was a mere hireling and was without much difficulty induced by Taaffe to turn approver The pair went to Trenchard Lunt told his story mentioned the names of some Cheshire and Lancashire squires to whom he had as he affirmed carried commissions from Saint Germains and of others who had to his knowledge formed secret hoards of arms and ammunition His simple oath would not have been sufficient to support a charge of high treason but he produced another witness whose evidence seemed to make the case complete The narrative was plausible and coherent and indeed though it may have been embellished by fictions there can be little doubt that it was in substance true five hundred thirty eight Messengers and search warrants were sent down to Lancashire Aaron Smith himself went thither and Taaffe went with him The alarm had been given by some of the numerous traitors who ate the bread of William Some of the accused persons had fled and others had buried their sabres and muskets and burned their papers Nevertheless discoveries were made which confirmed Lunt s depositions Behind the wainscot of the old mansion of one Roman Catholic family was discovered a commission signed by James Another house of which the master had absconded was strictly searched in spite of the solemn asseverations of his wife and his servants that no arms were concealed there While the lady with her hand on her heart was protesting on her honour that her husband was falsely accused the messengers observed that the back of the chimney did not seem to be firmly fixed It was removed and a heap of blades such as were used by horse soldiers tumbled out In one of the garrets were found carefully bricked up thirty saddles for troopers as many breastplates and sixty cavalry swords Trenchard and Aaron Smith thought the case complete and it was determined that those culprits who had been apprehended should be tried by a special commission five hundred thirty nine Taaffe now confidently expected to be recompensed for his services but he found a cold reception at the Treasury He had gone down to Lancashire chiefly in order that he might under the protection of a search warrant pilfer trinkets and broad pieces from secret drawers His sleight of hand however had not altogether escaped the observation of his companions They discovered that he had made free with the communion plate of the Popish families whose private hoards he had assisted in ransacking When therefore he applied for reward he was dismissed not merely with a refusal but with a stern reprimand He went away mad with greediness and spite There was yet one way in which he might obtain both money and revenge and that way he took He made overtures to the friends of the prisoners He and he alone could undo what he had done could save the accused from the gallows could cover the accusers with infamy could drive from office the Secretary and the Solicitor who were the dread of all the friends of King James Loathsome as Taaffe was to the Jacobites his offer was not to be slighted He received a sum in hand he was assured that a comfortable annuity for life should be settled on him when the business was done and he was sent down into the country and kept in strict seclusion against the day of trial five hundred forty Meanwhile unlicensed pamphlets in which the Lancashire plot was classed with Oates s plot with Dangerfield s plot with Fuller s plot with Young s plot with Whitney s plot were circulated all over the kingdom and especially in the county which was to furnish the jury Of these pamphlets the longest the ablest and the bitterest entitled a Letter to Secretary Trenchard was commonly ascribed to Ferguson It is not improbable that Ferguson may have furnished some of the materials and may have conveyed the manuscript to the press But many passages are written with an art and a vigour which assuredly did not belong to him Those who judge by internal evidence may perhaps think that in some parts of this remarkable tract they can discern the last gleam of the malignant genius of Montgomery A few weeks after the appearance of the Letter he sank unhonoured and unlamented into the grave five hundred forty one There were then no printed newspapers except the London Gazette But since the Revolution the newsletter had become a more important political engine than it had previously been The newsletters of one writer named Dyer were widely circulated in manuscript He affected to be a Tory and a High Churchman and was consequently regarded by the foxhunting lords of manors all over the kingdom as an oracle He had already been twice in prison but his gains had more than compensated for his sufferings and he still persisted in seasoning his intelligence to suit the taste of the country gentlemen He now turned the Lancashire plot into ridicule declared that the guns which had been found were old fowling pieces that the saddles were meant only for hunting and that the swords were rusty reliques of Edge Hill and Marston Moor five hundred forty two The effect produced by all this invective and sarcasm on the public mind seems to have been great Even at the Dutch Embassy where assuredly there was no leaning towards Jacobitism there was a strong impression that it would be unwise to bring the prisoners to trial In Lancashire and Cheshire the prevailing sentiments were pity for the accused and hatred of the prosecutors The government however persevered In October four Judges went down to Manchester At present the population of that town is made up of persons born in every part of the British Isles and consequently has no especial sympathy with the landowners the farmers and the agricultural labourers of the neighbouring districts But in the seventeenth century the Manchester man was a Lancashire man His politics were those of his county For the old Cavalier families of his county he felt a great respect and he was furious when he thought that some of the best blood of his county was about to be shed by a knot of Roundhead pettifoggers from London Multitudes of people from the neighbouring villages filled the streets of the town and saw with grief and indignation the array of drawn swords and loaded carbines which surrounded the culprits Aaron Smith s arrangements do not seem to have been skilful The chief counsel for the Crown was Sir William Williams who though now well stricken in years and possessed of a great estate still continued to practise One fault had thrown a dark shade over the latter part of his life The recollection of that day on which he had stood up in Westminster Hall amidst laughter and hooting to defend the dispensing power and to attack the right of petition had ever since the Revolution kept him back from honour He was an angry and disappointed man and was by no means disposed to incur unpopularity in the cause of a government to which he owed nothing and from which he hoped nothing Of the trial no detailed report has come down to us but we have both a Whig narrative and a Jacobite narrative five hundred forty three It seems that the prisoners who were first arraigned did not sever in their challenges and were consequently tried together Williams examined or rather crossexamined his own witnesses with a severity which confused them The crowd which filled the court laughed and clamoured Lunt in particular became completely bewildered mistook one person for another and did not recover himself till the judges took him out of the hands of the counsel for the Crown For some of the prisoners an alibi was set up Evidence was also produced to show what was undoubtedly quite true that Lunt was a man of abandoned character The result however seemed doubtful till to the dismay of the prosecutors Taaffe entered the box He swore with unblushing forehead that the whole story of the plot was a circumstantial lie devised by himself and Lunt Williams threw down his brief and in truth a more honest advocate might well have done the same The prisoners who were at the bar were instantly acquitted those who had not yet been tried were set at liberty the witnesses for the prosecution were pelted out of Manchester the Clerk of the Crown narrowly escaped with life and the judges took their departure amidst hisses and execrations A few days after the close of the trials at Manchester William returned to England On the twelfth of November only forty eight hours after his arrival at Kensington the Houses met He congratulated them on the improved aspect of affairs Both by land and by sea the events of the year which was about to close had been on the whole favourable to the allies the French armies had made no progress the French fleets had not ventured to show themselves nevertheless a safe and honourable peace could be obtained only by a vigorous prosecution of the war and the war could not be vigorously prosecuted without large supplies William then reminded the Commons that the Act by which they had settled the tonnage and poundage on the Crown for four years was about to expire and expressed his hope that it would be renewed After the King had spoken the Commons for some reason which no writer has explained adjourned for a week Before they met again an event took place which caused great sorrow at the palace and through all the ranks of the Low Church party Tillotson was taken suddenly ill while attending public worship in the chapel of Whitehall Prompt remedies might perhaps have saved him but he would not interrupt the prayers and before the service was over his malady was beyond the reach of medicine He was almost speechless but his friends long remembered with pleasure a few broken ejaculations which showed that he enjoyed peace of mind to the last He was buried in the church of Saint Lawrence Jewry near Guildhall It was there that he had won his immense oratorical reputation He had preached there during the thirty years which preceded his elevation to the throne of Canterbury His eloquence had attracted to the heart of the City crowds of the learned and polite from the Inns of Court and from the lordly mansions of Saint James s and Soho A considerable part of his congregation had generally consisted of young clergymen who came to learn the art of preaching at the feet of him who was universally considered as the first of preachers To this church his remains were now carried through a mourning population The hearse was followed by an endless train of splendid equipages from Lambeth through Southwark and over London Bridge Burnet preached the funeral sermon His kind and honest heart was overcome by so many tender recollections that in the midst of his discourse he paused and burst into tears while a loud moan of sorrow rose from the whole auditory The Queen could not speak of her favourite instructor without weeping Even William was visibly moved I have lost he said the best friend that I ever had and the best man that I ever knew The only Englishman who is mentioned with tenderness in any part of the great mass of letters which the King wrote to Heinsius is Tillotson The Archbishop had left a widow To her William granted a pension of four hundred a year which he afterwards increased to six hundred His anxiety that she should receive her income regularly and without stoppages was honourable to him Every quarterday he ordered the money without any deduction to be brought to himself and immediately sent it to her Tillotson had bequeathed to her no property except a great number of manuscript sermons Such was his fame among his contemporaries that those sermons were purchased by the booksellers for the almost incredible sum of two thousand five hundred guineas equivalent in the wretched state in which the silver coin then was to at least three thousand six hundred pounds Such a price had never before been given in England for any copyright About the same time Dryden whose reputation was then in the zenith received thirteen hundred pounds for his translation of all the works of Virgil and was thought to have been splendidly remunerated five hundred forty four It was not easy to fill satisfactorily the high place which Tillotson had left vacant Mary gave her voice for Stillingfleet and pressed his claims as earnestly as she ever ventured to press any thing In abilities and attainments he had few superiors among the clergy But though he would probably have been considered as a Low Churchman by Jane and South he was too high a Churchman for William and Tenison was appointed The new primate was not eminently distinguished by eloquence or learning but he was honest prudent laborious and benevolent he had been a good rector of a large parish and a good bishop of a large diocese detraction had not yet been busy with his name and it might well be thought that a man of plain sense moderation and integrity was more likely than a man of brilliant genius and lofty spirit to succeed in the arduous task of quieting a discontented and distracted Church Meanwhile the Commons had entered upon business They cheerfully voted about two million four hundred thousand pounds for the army and as much for the navy The land tax for the year was again fixed at four shillings in the pound the Tonnage Act was renewed for a term of five years and a fund was established on which the government was authorised to borrow two millions and a half Some time was spent by both Houses in discussing the Manchester trials If the malecontents had been wise they would have been satisfied with the advantage which they had already gained Their friends had been set free The prosecutors had with difficulty escaped from the hands of an enraged multitude The character of the government had been seriously damaged The ministers were accused in prose and in verse sometimes in earnest and sometimes in jest of having hired a gang of ruffians to swear away the lives of honest gentlemen Even moderate politicians who gave no credit to these foul imputations owned that Trenchard ought to have remembered the villanies of Fuller and Young and to have been on his guard against such wretches as Taaffe and Lunt The unfortunate Secretary s health and spirits had given way It was said that he was dying and it was certain that he would not long continue to hold the seals The Tories had won a great victory but in their eagerness to improve it they turned it into a defeat Early in the session Howe complained with his usual vehemence and asperity of the indignities to which innocent and honourable men highly descended and highly esteemed had been subjected by Aaron Smith and the wretches who were in his pay The leading Whigs with great judgment demanded an inquiry Then the Tories began to flinch They well knew that an inquiry could not strengthen their case and might weaken it The issue they said had been tried a jury had pronounced the verdict was definitive and it would be monstrous to give the false witnesses who had been stoned out of Manchester an opportunity of repeating their lesson To this argument the answer was obvious The verdict was definitive as respected the defendants but not as respected the prosecutors The prosecutors were now in their turn defendants and were entitled to all the privileges of defendants It did not follow because the Lancashire gentlemen had been found and very properly found not guilty of treason that the Secretary of State or the Solicitor of the Treasury had been guilty of unfairness or even of rashness The House by one hundred and nineteen votes to one hundred and two resolved that Aaron Smith and the witnesses on both sides should be ordered to attend Several days were passed in examination and crossexamination and sometimes the sittings extended far into the night It soon became clear that the prosecution had not been lightly instituted and that some of the persons who had been acquitted had been concerned in treasonable schemes The Tories would now have been content with a drawn battle but the Whigs were not disposed to forego their advantage It was moved that there had been a sufficient ground for the proceedings before the Special Commission and this motion was carried without a division The opposition proposed to add some words implying that the witnesses for the Crown had forsworn themselves but these words were rejected by one hundred and thirty six votes to one hundred and nine and it was resolved by one hundred and thirty three votes to ninety seven that there had been a dangerous conspiracy The Lords had meanwhile been deliberating on the same subject and had come to the same conclusion They sent Taaffe to prison for prevarication and they passed resolutions acquitting both the government and the judges of all blame The public however continued to think that the gentlemen who had been tried at Manchester had been unjustifiably persecuted till a Jacobite plot of singular atrocity brought home to the plotters by decisive evidence produced a violent revulsion of feeling five hundred forty five Meanwhile three bills which had been repeatedly discussed in preceding years and two of which had been carried in vain to the foot of the throne had been again brought in the Place Bill the Bill for the Regulation of Trials in cases of Treason and the Triennial Bill The Place Bill did not reach the Lords It was thrice read in the Lower House but was not passed At the very last moment it was rejected by a hundred and seventy five votes to a hundred and forty two Howe and Barley were the tellers for the minority five hundred forty six The Bill for the Regulation of Trials in cases of Treason went up again to the Peers Their Lordships again added to it the clause which had formerly been fatal to it The Commons again refused to grant any new privilege to the hereditary aristocracy Conferences were again held reasons were again exchanged both Houses were again obstinate and the bill was again lost five hundred forty seven The Triennial Bill was more fortunate It was brought in on the first day of the session and went easily and rapidly through both Houses The only question about which there was any serious contention was how long the existing Parliament should be suffered to continue After several sharp debates November in the year sixteen ninety six was fixed as the extreme term The Tonnage Bill and the Triennial Bill proceeded almost side by side Both were on the twenty second of December ready for the royal assent William came in state on that day to Westminster The attendance of members of both Houses was large When the Clerk of the Crown read the words A Bill for the frequent Calling and Meeting of Parliaments the anxiety was great When the Clerk of the Parliament made answer Le roy et la royne le veulent a loud and long hum of delight and exultation rose from the benches and the bar five hundred forty eight William had resolved many months before not to refuse his assent a second time to so popular a law five hundred forty nine There was some however who thought that he would not have made so great a concession if he had on that day been quite himself It was plain indeed that he was strangely agitated and unnerved It had been announced that he would dine in public at Whitehall But he disappointed the curiosity of the multitude which on such occasions flocked to the Court and hurried back to Kensington five hundred fifty He had but too good reason to be uneasy His wife had during two or three days been poorly and on the preceding evening grave symptoms had appeared Sir Thomas Millington who was physician in ordinary to the King thought that she had the measles But Radcliffe who with coarse manners and little book learning had raised himself to the first practice in London chiefly by his rare skill in diagnostics uttered the more alarming words small pox That disease over which science has since achieved a succession of glorious and beneficient victories was then the most terrible of all the ministers of death The havoc of the plague had been far more rapid but the plague had visited our shores only once or twice within living memory and the small pox was always present filling the churchyards with corpses tormenting with constant fears all whom it had not yet stricken leaving on those whose lives it spared the hideous traces of its power turning the babe into a changeling at which the mother shuddered and making the eyes and cheeks of the betrothed maiden objects of horror to the lover Towards the end of the year sixteen ninety four this pestilence was more than usually severe At length the infection spread to the palace and reached the young and blooming Queen She received the intimation of her danger with true greatness of soul She gave orders that every lady of her bedchamber every maid of honour nay every menial servant who had not had the small pox should instantly leave Kensington House She locked herself up during a short time in her closet burned some papers arranged others and then calmly awaited her fate During two or three days there were many alternations of hope and fear The physicians contradicted each other and themselves in a way which sufficiently indicates the state of medical science in that age The disease was measles it was scarlet fever it was spotted fever it was erysipelas At one moment some symptoms which in truth showed that the case was almost hopeless were hailed as indications of returning health At length all doubt was over Radcliffe s opinion proved to be right It was plain that the Queen was sinking under small pox of the most malignant type All this time William remained night and day near her bedside The little couch on which he slept when he was in camp was spread for him in the antechamber but he scarcely lay down on it The sight of his misery the Dutch Envoy wrote was enough to melt the hardest heart Nothing seemed to be left of the man whose serene fortitude had been the wonder of old soldiers on the disastrous day of Landen and of old sailors on that fearful night among the sheets of ice and banks of sand on the coast of Goree The very domestics saw the tears running unchecked down that face of which the stern composure had seldom been disturbed by any triumph or by any defeat Several of the prelates were in attendance The King drew Burnet aside and gave way to an agony of grief There is no hope he cried I was the happiest man on earth and I am the most miserable She had no fault none you knew her well but you could not know nobody but myself could know her goodness Tenison undertook to tell her that she was dying He was afraid that such a communication abruptly made might agitate her violently and began with much management But she soon caught his meaning and with that gentle womanly courage which so often puts our bravery to shame submitted herself to the will of God She called for a small cabinet in which her most important papers were locked up gave orders that as soon as she was no more it should be delivered to the King and then dismissed worldly cares from her mind She received the Eucharist and repeated her part of the office with unimpaired memory and intelligence though in a feeble voice She observed that Tenison had been long standing at her bedside and with that sweet courtesy which was habitual to her faltered out her commands that he would sit down and repeated them till he obeyed After she had received the sacrament she sank rapidly and uttered only a few broken words Twice she tried to take a last farewell of him whom she had loved so truly and entirely but she was unable to speak He had a succession of fits so alarming that his Privy Councillors who were assembled in a neighbouring room were apprehensive for his reason and his life The Duke of Leeds at the request of his colleagues ventured to assume the friendly guardianship of which minds deranged by sorrow stand in need A few minutes before the Queen expired William was removed almost insensible from the sick room Mary died in peace with Anne Before the physicians had pronounced the case hopeless the Princess who was then in very delicate health had sent a kind message and Mary had returned a kind answer The Princess had then proposed to come herself but William had in very gracious terms declined the offer The excitement of an interview he said would be too much for both sisters If a favourable turn took place Her Royal Highness should be most welcome to Kensington A few hours later all was over five hundred fifty one The public sorrow was great and general For Mary s blameless life her large charities and her winning manners had conquered the hearts of her people When the Commons next met they sate for a time in profound silence At length it was moved and resolved that an Address of Condolence should be presented to the King and then the House broke up without proceeding to other business The Dutch envoy informed the States General that many of the members had handkerchiefs at their eyes The number of sad faces in the street struck every observer The mourning was more general than even the mourning for Charles the Second had been On the Sunday which followed the Queen s death her virtues were celebrated in almost every parish church of the Capital and in almost every great meeting of nonconformists five hundred fifty two The most estimable Jacobites respected the sorrow of William and the memory of Mary But to the fiercer zealots of the party neither the house of mourning nor the grave was sacred At Bristol the adherents of Sir John Knight rang the bells as if for a victory five hundred fifty three It has often been repeated and is not at all improbable that a nonjuring divine in the midst of the general lamentation preached on the text Go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a King s daughter It is certain that some of the ejected priests pursued her to the grave with invectives Her death they said was evidently a judgment for her crime God had from the top of Sinai in thunder and lightning promised length of days to children who should honour their parents and in this promise was plainly implied a menace What father had ever been worse treated by his daughters than James by Mary and Anne Mary was gone cut off in the prime of life in the glow of beauty in the height of prosperity and Anne would do well to profit by the warning Wagstaffe went further and dwelt much on certain wonderful coincidences of time James had been driven from his palace and country in Christmas week Mary had died in Christmas week There could be no doubt that if the secrets of Providence were disclosed to us we should find that the turns of the daughter s complaint in December sixteen ninety four bore an exact analogy to the turns of the father s fortune in December sixteen eighty eight It was at midnight that the father ran away from Rochester it was at midnight that the daughter expired Such was the profundity and such the ingenuity of a writer whom the Jacobite schismatics justly regarded as one of their ablest chiefs five hundred fifty four The Whigs soon had an opportunity of retaliating They triumphantly related that a scrivener in the Borough a stanch friend of hereditary right while exulting in the judgment which had overtaken the Queen had himself fallen down dead in a fit five hundred fifty five The funeral was long remembered as the saddest and most august that Westminster had ever seen While the Queen s remains lay in state at Whitehall the neighbouring streets were filled every day from sunrise to sunset by crowds which made all traffic impossible The two Houses with their maces followed the hearse the Lords robed in scarlet and ermine the Commons in long black mantles No preceding Sovereign had ever been attended to the grave by a Parliament for till then the Parliament had always expired with the Sovereign A paper had indeed been circulated in which the logic of a small sharp pettifogger was employed to prove that writs issued in the joint names of William and Mary ceased to be of force as soon as William reigned alone But this paltry cavil had completely failed It had not even been mentioned in the Lower House and had been mentioned in the Upper only to be contemptuously overruled The whole Magistracy of the City swelled the procession The banners of England and France Scotland and Ireland were carried by great nobles before the corpse The pall was borne by the chiefs of the illustrious houses of Howard Seymour Grey and Stanley On the gorgeous coffin of purple and gold were laid the crown and sceptre of the realm The day was well suited to such a ceremony The sky was dark and troubled and a few ghastly flakes of snow fell on the black plumes of the funeral car Within the Abbey nave choir and transept were in a blaze with innumerable waxlights The body was deposited under a magnificent canopy in the centre of the church while the Primate preached The earlier part of his discourse was deformed by pedantic divisions and subdivisions but towards the close he told what he had himself seen and heard with a simplicity and earnestness more affecting than the most skilful rhetoric Through the whole ceremony the distant booming of cannon was heard every minute from the batteries of the Tower The gentle Queen sleeps among her illustrious kindred in the southern aisle of the Chapel of Henry the Seventh five hundred fifty six The affection with which her husband cherished her memory was soon attested by a monument the most superb that was ever erected to any sovereign No scheme had been so much her own none had been so near her heart as that of converting the palace at Greenwich into a retreat for seamen It had occurred to her when she had found it difficult to provide good shelter and good attendance for the thousands of brave men who had come back to England wounded after the battle of La Hogue While she lived scarcely any step was taken towards the accomplishing of her favourite design But it should seem that as soon as her husband had lost her he began to reproach himself for having neglected her wishes No time was lost A plan was furnished by Wren and soon an edifice surpassing that asylum which the magnificent Lewis had provided for his soldiers rose on the margin of the Thames Whoever reads the inscription which runs round the frieze of the hall will observe that William claims no part of the merit of the design and that the praise is ascribed to Mary alone Had the King s life been prolonged till the works were completed a statue of her who was the real foundress of the institution would have had a conspicuous place in that court which presents two lofty domes and two graceful colonnades to the multitudes who are perpetually passing up and down the imperial river But that part of the plan was never carried into effect and few of those who now gaze on the noblest of European hospitals are aware that it is a memorial of the virtues of the good Queen Mary of the love and sorrow of William and of the great victory of La Hogue CHAPTER XXI Effect of Mary s Death on the Continent Death of Luxemburg

Elections Act establishing a Land Bank ON the Continent the news of Mary s death excited various emotions The Huguenots in every part of Europe to which they had wandered bewailed the Elect Lady who had retrenched from her own royal state in order to furnish bread and shelter to the persecuted people of God five hundred fifty seven In the United Provinces where she was well known and had always been popular she was tenderly lamented Matthew Prior whose parts and accomplishments had obtained for him the patronage of the magnificent Dorset and who was now attached to the Embassy at the Hague wrote that the coldest and most passionless of nations was touched The very marble he said wept five hundred fifty eight The lamentations of Cambridge and Oxford were echoed by Leyden and Utrecht The States General put on mourning The bells of all the steeples of Holland tolled dolefully day after day five hundred fifty nine James meanwhile strictly prohibited all mourning at Saint Germains and prevailed on Lewis to issue a similar prohibition at Versailles Some of the most illustrious nobles of France and among them the Dukes of Bouillon and of Duras were related to the House of Nassau and had always when death visited that House punctiliously observed the decent ceremonial of sorrow They were now forbidden to wear black and they submitted but it was beyond the power of the great King to prevent his highbred and sharpwitted courtiers from whispering to each other that there was something pitiful in this revenge taken by the living on the dead by a parent on a child five hundred sixty The hopes of James and of his companions in exile were now higher than they had been since the day of La Hogue Indeed the general opinion of politicians both here and on the Continent was that William would find it impossible to sustain himself much longer on the throne He would not it was said have sustained himself so long but for the help of his wife Her affability had conciliated many who had been repelled by his freezing looks and short answers Her English tones sentiments and tastes had charmed many who were disgusted by his Dutch accent and Dutch habits Though she did not belong to the High Church party she loved that ritual to which she had been accustomed from infancy and complied willingly and reverently with some ceremonies which he considered not indeed as sinful but as childish and in which he could hardly bring himself to take part While the war lasted it would be necessary that he should pass nearly half the year out of England Hitherto she had when he was absent supplied his place and had supplied it well Who was to supply it now In what vicegerent could he place equal confidence To what vicegerent would the nation look up with equal respect All the statesmen of Europe therefore agreed in thinking that his position difficult and dangerous at best had been made far more difficult and more dangerous by the death of the Queen But all the statesmen of Europe were deceived and strange to say his reign was decidedly more prosperous and more tranquil after the decease of Mary than during her life A few hours after he had lost the most tender and beloved of all his friends he was delivered from the most formidable of all his enemies Death had been busy at Paris as well as in London While Tenison was praying by the bed of Mary Bourdaloue was administering the last unction to Luxemburg The great French general had never been a favourite at the French Court but when it was known that his feeble frame exhausted by war and pleasure was sinking under a dangerous disease the value of his services was for the first time fully appreciated the royal physicians were sent to prescribe for him the sisters of Saint Cyr were ordered to pray for him but prayers and prescriptions were vain How glad the Prince of Orange will be said Lewis when the news of our loss reaches him He was mistaken That news found William unable to think of any loss but his own five hundred sixty one During the month which followed the death of Mary the King was incapable of exertion Even to the addresses of the two Houses of Parliament he replied only by a few inarticulate sounds The answers which appear in the journals were not uttered by him but were delivered in writing Such business as could not be deferred was transacted by the intervention of Portland who was himself oppressed with sorrow During some weeks the important and confidential correspondence between the King and Heinsius was suspended At length William forced himself to resume that correspondence but his first letter was the letter of a heartbroken man Even his martial ardour had been tamed by misery I tell you in confidence he wrote that I feel myself to be no longer fit for military command Yet I will try to do my duty and I hope that God will strengthen me So despondingly did he look forward to the most brilliant and successful of his many campaigns five hundred sixty two There was no interruption of parliamentary business While the Abbey was hanging with black for the funeral of the Queen the Commons came to a vote which at the time attracted little attention which produced no excitement which has been left unnoticed by voluminous annalists and of which the history can be but imperfectly traced in the archives of Parliament but which has done more for liberty and for civilisation than the Great Charter or the Bill of Rights Early in the session a select committee had been appointed to ascertain what temporary statutes were about to expire and to consider which of those statutes it might be expedient to continue The report was made and all the recommendations contained in that report were adopted with one exception Among the laws which the committee advised the House to renew was the law which subjected the press to a censorship The question was put that the House do agree with the committee in the resolution that the Act entitled an Act for preventing Abuses in printing seditious treasonable and unlicensed Pamphlets and for regulating of Printing and Printing Presses be continued The Speaker pronounced that the Noes had it and the Ayes did not think fit to divide A bill for continuing all the other temporary Acts which in the opinion of the Committee could not properly be suffered to expire was brought in passed and sent to the Lords In a short time this bill came back with an important amendment The Lords had inserted in the list of Acts to be continued the Act which placed the press under the control of licensers The Commons resolved not to agree to the amendment demanded a conference and appointed a committee of managers The leading manager was Edward Clarke a stanch Whig who represented Taunton the stronghold during fifty troubled years of civil and religious freedom Clarke delivered to the Lords in the Painted Chamber a paper containing the reasons which had determined the Lower House not to renew the Licensing Act This paper completely vindicates the resolution to which the Commons had come But it proves at the same time that they knew not what they were doing what a revolution they were making what a power they were calling into existence They pointed out concisely clearly forcibly and sometimes with a grave irony which is not unbecoming the absurdities and iniquities of the statute which was about to expire But all their objections will be found to relate to matters of detail On the great question of principle on the question whether the liberty of unlicensed printing be on the whole a blessing or a curse to society not a word is said The Licensing Act is condemned not as a thing essentially evil but on account of the petty grievances the exactions the jobs the commercial restrictions the domiciliary visits which were incidental to it It is pronounced mischievous because it enables the Company of Stationers to extort money from publishers because it empowers the agents of the government to search houses under the authority of general warrants because it confines the foreign book trade to the port of London because it detains valuable packages of books at the Custom House till the pages are mildewed The Commons complain that the amount of the fee which the licenser may demand is not fixed They complain that it is made penal in an officer of the Customs to open a box of books from abroad except in the presence of one of the censors of the press How it is very sensibly asked is the officer to know that there are books in the box till he has opened it Such were the arguments which did what Milton s Areopagitica had failed to do The Lords yielded without a contest They probably expected that some less objectionable bill for the regulation of the press would soon be sent up to them and in fact such a bill was brought into the House of Commons read twice and referred to a select committee But the session closed before the committee had reported and English literature was emancipated and emancipated for ever from the control of the government five hundred sixty three This great event passed almost unnoticed Evelyn and Luttrell did not think it worth mentioning in their diaries The Dutch minister did not think it worth mentioning in his despatches No allusion to it is to be found in the Monthly Mercuries The public attention was occupied by other and far more exciting subjects One of those subjects was the death of the most accomplished the most enlightened and in spite of great faults the most estimable of the statesmen who were formed in the corrupt and licentious Whitehall of the Restoration About a month after the splendid obsequies of Mary a funeral procession of almost ostentatious simplicity passed round the shrine of Edward the Confessor to the Chapel of Henry the Seventh There at the distance of a few feet from her coffin lies the coffin of George Savile Marquess of Halifax Halifax and Nottingham had long been friends and Lord Eland now Halifax s only son had been affianced to the Lady Mary Finch Nottingham s daughter The day of the nuptials was fixed a joyous company assembled at Burley on the Hill the mansion of the bride s father which from one of the noblest terraces in the island looks down on magnificent woods of beech and oak on the rich valley of Catmos and on the spire of Oakham The father of the bridegroom was detained to London by indisposition which was not supposed to be dangerous On a sudden his malady took an alarming form He was told that he had but a few hours to live He received the intimation with tranquil fortitude It was proposed to send off an express to summon his son to town But Halifax good natured to the last would not disturb the felicity of the wedding day He gave strict orders that his interment should be private prepared himself for the great change by devotions which astonished those who had called him an atheist and died with the serenity of a philosopher and of a Christian while his friends and kindred not suspecting his danger were tasting the sack posset and drawing the curtain five hundred sixty four His legitimate male posterity and his titles soon became extinct No small portion however of his wit and eloquence descended to his daughter s son Philip Stanhope fourth Earl of Chesterfield But it is perhaps not generally known that some adventurers who without advantages of fortune or position made themselves conspicuous by the mere force of ability inherited the blood of Halifax He left a natural son Henry Carey whose dramas once drew crowded audiences to the theatres and some of whose gay and spirited verses still live in the memory of hundreds of thousands From Henry Carey descended that Edmund Kean who in our time transformed himself so marvellously into Shylock Iago and Othello More than one historian has been charged with partiality to Halifax The truth is that the memory of Halifax is entitled in an especial manner to the protection of history For what distinguishes him from all other English statesmen is this that through a long public life and through frequent and violent revolutions of public feeling he almost invariably took that view of the great questions of his time which history has finally adopted He was called inconstant because the relative position in which he stood to the contending factions was perpetually varying As well might the pole star be called inconstant because it is sometimes to the east and sometimes to the west of the pointers To have defended the ancient and legal constitution of the realm against a seditious populace at one conjuncture and against a tyrannical government at another to have been the foremost defender of order in the turbulent Parliament of sixteen eighty and the foremost defender of liberty in the servile Parliament of sixteen eighty five to have been just and merciful to Roman Catholics in the days of the Popish plot and to Exclusionists in the days of the Rye House Plot to have done all in his power to save both the head of Stafford and the head of Russell this was a course which contemporaries heated by passion and deluded by names and badges might not unnaturally call fickle but which deserves a very different name from the late justice of posterity There is one and only one deep stain on the memory of this eminent man It is melancholy to think that he who had acted so great a part in the Convention could have afterwards stooped to hold communication with Saint Germains The fact cannot be disputed yet for him there are excuses which cannot be pleaded for others who were guilty of the same crime He did not like Marlborough Russell Godolphin and Shrewsbury betray a master by whom he was trusted and with whose benefits he was loaded It was by the ingratitude and malice of the Whigs that he was driven to take shelter for a moment among the Jacobites It may be added that he soon repented of the error into which he had been hurried by passion that though never reconciled to the Court he distinguished himself by his zeal for the vigorous prosecution of the war and that his last work was a tract in which he exhorted his countrymen to remember that the public burdens heavy as they might seem were light when compared with the yoke of France and of Rome five hundred sixty five About a fortnight after the death of Halifax a fate far more cruel than death befell his old rival and enemy the Lord President That able ambitious and daring statesman was again hurled down from power In his first fall terrible as it was there had been something of dignity and he had by availing himself with rare skill of an extraordinary crisis in public affairs risen once more to the most elevated position among English subjects The second ruin was indeed less violent than the first but it was ignominious and irretrievable The peculation and venality by which the official men of that age were in the habit of enriching themselves had excited in the public mind a feeling such as could not but vent itself sooner or later in some formidable explosion But the gains were immediate the day of retribution was uncertain and the plunderers of the public were as greedy and as audacious as ever when the vengeance long threatened and long delayed suddenly overtook the proudest and most powerful among them The first mutterings of the coming storm did not at all indicate the direction which it would take or the fury with which it would burst An infantry regiment which was quartered at Royston had levied contributions on the people of that town and of the neighbourhood The sum exacted was not large In France or Brabant the moderation of the demand would have been thought wonderful But to English shopkeepers and farmers military extortion was happily quite new and quite insupportable A petition was sent up to the Commons The Commons summoned the accusers and the accused to the bar It soon appeared that a grave offence had been committed but that the offenders were not altogether without excuse The public money which had been issued from the Exchequer for their pay and subsistence had been fraudulently detained by their colonel and by his agent It was not strange that men who had arms and who had not necessaries should trouble themselves little about the Petition of Right and the Declaration of Right But it was monstrous that while the citizen was heavily taxed for the purpose of paying to the soldier the largest military stipend known in Europe the soldier should be driven by absolute want to plunder the citizen This was strongly set forth in a representation which the Commons laid before William William who had been long struggling against abuses which grievously impaired the efficiency of his army was glad to have his hands thus strengthened He promised ample redress cashiered the offending colonel gave strict orders that the troops should receive their due regularly and established a military board for the purpose of detecting and punishing such malpractices as had taken place at Royston five hundred sixty six But the whole administration was in such a state that it was hardly possible to track one offender without discovering ten others In the course of the inquiry into the conduct of the troops at Royston it was discovered that a bribe of two hundred guineas had been received by Henry Guy member of Parliament for Heydon and Secretary of the Treasury Guy was instantly sent to the Tower not without much exultation on the part of the Whigs for he was one of those tools who had passed together with the buildings and furniture of the public offices from James to William he affected the character of a High Churchman and he was known to be closely connected with some of the heads of the Tory party and especially with Trevor five hundred sixty seven Another name which was afterwards but too widely celebrated first became known to the public at this time James Craggs had begun life as a barber He had then been a footman of the Duchess of Cleveland His abilities eminently vigorous though not improved by education had raised him in the world and he was now entering on a career which was destined to end after a quarter of a century of prosperity in unutterable misery and despair He had become an army clothier He was examined as to his dealings with the colonels of regiments and as he obstinately refused to produce his books he was sent to keep Guy company in the Tower five hundred sixty eight A few hours after Craggs had been thrown into prison a committee which had been appointed to inquire into the truth of a petition signed by some of the hackney coachmen of London laid on the table of the House a report which excited universal disgust and indignation It appeared that these poor hardworking men had been cruelly wronged by the board under the authority of which an Act of the preceding session had placed them They had been pillaged and insulted not only by the commissioners but by one commissioner s lacquey and by another commissioner s harlot The Commons addressed the King and the King turned the delinquents out of their places five hundred sixty nine But by this time delinquents far higher in power and rank were beginning to be uneasy At every new detection the excitement both within and without the walls of Parliament became more intense The frightful prevalence of bribery corruption and extortion was every where the subject of conversation A contemporary pamphleteer compares the state of the political world at this conjuncture to the state of a city in which the plague has just been discovered and in which the terrible words Lord have mercy on us are already seen on some doors five hundred seventy Whispers which at another time would have speedily died away and been forgotten now swelled first into murmurs and then into clamours A rumour rose and spread that the funds of the two wealthiest corporations in the kingdom the City of London and the East India Company had been largely employed for the purpose of corrupting great men and the names of Trevor Seymour and Leeds were mentioned The mention of these names produced a stir in the Whig ranks Trevor Seymour and Leeds were all three Tories and had in different ways greater influence than perhaps any other three Tories in the kingdom If they could all be driven at once from public life with blasted characters the Whigs would be completely predominant both in the Parliament and in the Cabinet Wharton was not the man to let such an opportunity escape him At White s no doubt among those lads of quality who were his pupils in politics and in debauchery he would have laughed heartily at the fury with which the nation had on a sudden begun to persecute men for doing what every body had always done and was always trying to do But if people would be fools it was the business of a politician to make use of their folly The cant of political purity was not so familiar to the lips of Wharton as blasphemy and ribaldry but his abilities were so versatile and his impudence so consummate that he ventured to appear before the world as an austere patriot mourning over the venality and perfidy of a degenerate age While he animated by that fierce party spirit which in honest men would be thought a vice but which in him was almost a virtue was eagerly stirring up his friends to demand an inquiry into the truth of the evil reports which were in circulation the subject was suddenly and strangely forced forward It chanced that while a bill of little interest was under discussion in the Commons the postman arrived with numerous letters directed to members and the distribution took place at the bar with a buzz of conversation which drowned the voices of the orators Seymour whose imperious temper always prompted him to dictate and to chide lectured the talkers on the scandalous irregularity of their conduct and called on the Speaker to reprimand them An angry discussion followed and one of the offenders was provoked into making an allusion to the stories which were current about both Seymour and the Speaker It is undoubtedly improper to talk while a bill is under discussion but it is much worse to take money for getting a bill passed If we are extreme to mark a slight breach of form how severely ought we to deal with that corruption which is eating away the very substance of our institutions That was enough the spark had fallen the train was ready the explosion was immediate and terrible After a tumultuous debate in which the cry of the Tower was repeatedly heard Wharton managed to carry his point Before the House rose a committee was appointed to examine the books of the City of London and of the East India Company five hundred seventy one Foley was placed in the chair of the committee Within a week he reported that the Speaker Sir John Trevor had in the preceding session received from the City a thousand guineas for expediting a local bill This discovery gave great satisfaction to the Whigs who had always hated Trevor and was not unpleasing to many of the Tories During six busy sessions his sordid rapacity had made him an object of general aversion The legitimate emoluments of his post amounted to about four thousand a year but it was believed that he had made at least ten thousand a year five hundred seventy two His profligacy and insolence united had been too much even for the angelic temper of Tillotson It was said that the gentle Archbishop had been heard to mutter something about a knave as the Speaker passed by him five hundred seventy three Yet great as were the offences of this bad man his punishment was fully proportioned to them As soon as the report of the committee had been read it was moved that he had been guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour He had to stand up and to put the question There was a loud cry of Aye He called on the Noes and scarcely a voice was heard He was forced to declare that the Ayes had it A man of spirit would have given up the ghost with remorse and shame and the unutterable ignominy of that moment left its mark even on the callous heart and brazen forehead of Trevor Had he returned to the House on the following day he would have had to put the question on a motion for his own expulsion He therefore pleaded illness and shut himself up in his bedroom Wharton soon brought down a royal message authorising the Commons to elect another Speaker The Whig chiefs wished to place Littleton in the chair but they were unable to accomplish their object Foley was chosen presented and approved Though he had of late generally voted with the Tories he still called himself a Whig and was not unacceptable to many of the Whigs He had both the abilities and the knowledge which were necessary to enable him to preside over the debates with dignity but what in the peculiar circumstances in which the House then found itself placed was not unnaturally considered as his principal recommendation was that implacable hatred of jobbery and corruption which he somewhat ostentatiously professed and doubtless sincerely felt On the day after he entered on his functions his predecessor was expelled five hundred seventy four The indiscretion of Trevor had been equal to his baseness and his guilt had been apparent on the first inspection of the accounts of the City The accounts of the East India Company were more obscure The committee reported that they had sate in Leadenhall Street had examined documents had interrogated directors and clerks but had been unable to arrive at the bottom of the mystery of iniquity Some most suspicious entries had been discovered under the head of special service The expenditure on this account had in the year sixteen ninety three exceeded eighty thousand pounds It was proved that as to the outlay of this money the directors had placed implicit confidence in the governor Sir Thomas Cook He had merely told them in general terms that he had been at a charge of twenty three thousand of twenty five thousand of thirty thousand pounds in the matter of the Charter and the Court had without calling on him for any detailed explanation thanked him for his care and ordered warrants for these great sums to be instantly made out It appeared that a few mutinous directors had murmured at this immense outlay and had called for a detailed statement But the only answer which they had been able to extract from Cook was that there were some great persons whom it was necessary to gratify The committee also reported that they had lighted on an agreement by which the Company had covenanted to furnish a person named Colston with two hundred tons of saltpetre At the first glance this transaction seemed merchantlike and fair But it was soon discovered that Colston was merely an agent for Seymour Suspicion was excited The complicated terms of the bargain were severely examined and were found to be framed in such a manner that in every possible event Seymour must be a gainer and the Company a loser to the extent of ten or twelve thousand pounds The opinion of all who understood the matter was that the compact was merely a disguise intended to cover a bribe But the disguise was so skilfully managed that the country gentlemen were perplexed and that the lawyers doubted whether there were such evidence of corruption as would be held sufficient by a court of justice Seymour escaped without even a vote of censure and still continued to take a leading part in the debates of the Commons five hundred seventy five But the authority which he had long exercised in the House and in the western counties of England though not destroyed was visibly diminished and to the end of his life his traffic in saltpetre was a favourite theme of Whig pamphleteers and poets five hundred seventy six The escape of Seymour only inflamed the ardour of Wharton and of Wharton s confederates They were determined to discover what had been done with the eighty or ninety thousand pounds of secret service money which had been entrusted to Cook by the East India Company Cook who was member for Colchester was questioned in his place he refused to answer he was sent to the Tower and a bill was brought in providing that if before a certain day he should not acknowledge the whole truth he should be incapable of ever holding any office should refund to the Company the whole of the immense sum which had been confided to him and should pay a fine of twenty thousand pounds to the Crown Rich as he was these penalties would have reduced him to penury The Commons were in such a temper that they passed the bill without a single division five hundred seventy seven Seymour indeed though his saltpetre contract was the talk of the whole town came forward with unabashed forehead to plead for his accomplice but his effrontery only injured the cause which he defended five hundred seventy eight In the Upper House the bill was condemned in the strongest terms by the Duke of Leeds Pressing his hand on his heart he declared on his faith on his honour that he had no personal interest in the question and that he was actuated by no motive but a pure love of justice His eloquence was powerfully seconded by the tears and lamentations of Cook who from the bar implored the Peers not to subject him to a species of torture unknown to the mild laws of England Instead of this cruel bill he said pass a bill of indemnity and I will tell you all The Lords thought his request not altogether unreasonable After some communication with the Commons it was determined that a joint committee of the two Houses should be appointed to inquire into the manner in which the secret service money of the East India Company had been expended and an Act was rapidly passed providing that if Cook would make to this committee a true and full discovery he should be indemnified for the crimes which he might confess and that till he made such a discovery he should remain in the Tower To this arrangement Leeds gave in public all the opposition that he could with decency give In private those who were conscious of guilt employed numerous artifices for the purpose of averting inquiry It was whispered that things might come out which every good Englishman would wish to hide and that the greater part of the enormous sums which had passed through Cook s hands had been paid to Portland for His Majesty s use But the Parliament and the nation were determined to know the truth whoever might suffer by the disclosure five hundred seventy nine As soon as the Bill of Indemnity had received the royal assent the joint committee consisting of twelve lords and twenty four members of the House of Commons met in the Exchequer Chamber Wharton was placed in the chair and in a few hours great discoveries were made The King and Portland came out of the inquiry with unblemished honour Not only had not the King taken any part of the secret service money dispensed by Cook but he had not during some years received even the ordinary present which the Company had in former reigns laid annually at the foot of the throne It appeared that not less than fifty thousand pounds had been offered to Portland and rejected The money lay during a whole year ready to be paid to him if he should change his mind He at length told those who pressed this immense bribe on him that if they persisted in insulting him by such an offer they would make him an enemy of their Company Many people wondered at the probity which he showed on this occasion for he was generally thought interested and grasping The truth seems to be that he loved money but that he was a man of strict integrity and honour He took without scruple whatever he thought that he could honestly take but was incapable of stooping to an act of baseness Indeed he resented as affronts the compliments which were paid him on this occasion five hundred eighty The integrity of Nottingham could excite no surprise Ten thousand pounds had been offered to him and had been refused The number of cases in which bribery was fully made out was small A large part of the sum which Cook had drawn from the Company s treasury had probably been embezzled by the brokers whom he had employed in the work of corruption and what had become of the rest it was not easy to learn from the reluctant witnesses who were brought before the committee One glimpse of light however was caught it was followed and it led to a discovery of the highest moment A large sum was traced from Cook to an agent named Firebrace and from Firebrace to another agent named Bates who was well known to be closely connected with the High Church party and especially with Leeds Bates was summoned but absconded messengers were sent in pursuit of him he was caught brought into the Exchequer Chamber and sworn The story which he told showed that he was distracted between the fear of losing his ears and the fear of injuring his patron He owned that he had undertaken to bribe Leeds had been for that purpose furnished with five thousand five hundred guineas had offered those guineas to His Grace and had by His Grace s permission left them at His Grace s house in the care of a Swiss named Robart who was His Grace s confidential man of business It should seem that these facts admitted of only one interpretation Bates however swore that the Duke had refused to accept a farthing Why then it was asked was the gold left by his consent at his house and in the hands of his servant Because answered Bates I am bad at telling coin I therefore begged His Grace to let me leave the pieces in order that Robart might count them for me and His Grace was so good as to give leave It was evident that if this strange story had been true the guineas would in a few hours have been taken away But Bates was forced to confess that they had remained half a year where he had left them The money had indeed at last and this was one of the most suspicious circumstances in the case been paid back by Robart on the very morning on which the committee first met in the Exchequer Chamber Who could believe that if the transaction had been free from all taint of corruption the guineas would have been detained as long as Cook was able to remain silent and would have been refunded on the very first day on which he was under the necessity of speaking out five hundred eighty one A few hours after the examination of Bates Wharton reported to the Commons what had passed in the Exchequer Chamber The indignation was general and vehement You now understand said Wharton why obstructions have been thrown in our way at every step why we have had to wring out truth drop by drop why His Majesty s name has been artfully used to prevent us from going into an inquiry which has brought nothing to light but what is to His Majesty s honour Can we think it strange that our difficulties should have been great when we consider the power the dexterity the experience of him who was secretly thwarting us It is time for us to prove signally to the world that it is impossible for any criminal to double so cunningly that we cannot track him or to climb so high that we cannot reach him Never was there a more flagitious instance of corruption Never was there an offender who had less claim to indulgence The obligations which the Duke of Leeds has to his country are of no common kind One great debt we generously cancelled but the manner in which our generosity has been requited forces us to remember that he was long ago impeached for receiving money from France How can we be safe while a man proved to be venal has access to the royal ear Our best laid enterprises have been defeated Our inmost counsels have been betrayed And what wonder is it Can we doubt that together with this home trade in charters a profitable foreign trade in secrets is carried on Can we doubt that he who sells us to one another will for a good price sell us all to the common enemy Wharton concluded by moving that Leeds should be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours five hundred eighty two Leeds had many friends and dependents in the House of Commons but they could say little Wharton s motion was carried without a division and he was ordered to go to the bar of the Lords and there in the name of the Commons of England to impeach the Duke But before this order could be obeyed it was announced that His Grace was at the door and requested an audience While Wharton had been making his report to the Commons Leeds had been haranguing the Lords He denied with the most solemn asseverations that he had taken any money for himself But he acknowledged and indeed almost boasted that he had abetted Bates in getting money from the Company and seemed to think that this was a service which any man in power might be reasonably expected to render to a friend Too many persons indeed in that age made a most absurd and pernicious distinction between a minister who used his influence to obtain presents for himself and a minister who used his influence to obtain presents for his dependents The former was corrupt the latter was merely goodnatured Leeds proceeded to tell with great complacency a story about himself which would in our days drive a public man not only out of office but out of the society of gentlemen When I was Treasurer in King Charles s time my Lords the excise was to be farmed There were several bidders Harry Savile for whom I had a great value informed me that they had asked for his interest with me and begged me to tell them that he had done his best for them What said I tell them all so when only one can have the farm No matter said Harry tell them all so and the one who gets the farm will think that he owes it to me The gentlemen came I said to every one of them separately Sir you are much obliged to mister Savile Sir mister Savile has been much your friend In the end Harry got a handsome present and I wished him good luck with it I was his shadow then I am mister Bates s shadow now The Duke had hardly related this anecdote so strikingly illustrative of the state of political morality in that generation when it was whispered to him that a motion to impeach him had been made in the House of Commons He hastened thither but before he arrived the question had been put and carried Nevertheless he pressed for admittance and he was admitted A chair according to ancient usage was placed for him within the bar and he was informed that the House was ready to hear him He spoke but with less tact and judgment than usual He magnified his own public services But for him he said there would have been no House of Commons to impeach him a boast so extravagant that it naturally made his hearers unwilling to allow him the praise which his conduct at the time of the Revolution really deserved As to the charge against him he said little more than that he was innocent that there had long been a malicious design to ruin him that he would not go into particulars that the facts which had been proved would bear two constructions and that of the two constructions the most favourable ought in candour to be adopted He withdrew after praying the House to reconsider the vote which had just been passed or if that could not be to let him have speedy justice His friends felt that his speech was no defence and did not attempt to rescind the resolution which had been carried just before he was heard Wharton with a large following went up to the Lords and informed them that the Commons had resolved to impeach the Duke A committee of managers was appointed to draw up the articles and to prepare the evidence five hundred eighty three The articles were speedily drawn but to the chain of evidence one link appeared to be wanting That link Robart if he had been severely examined and confronted with other witnesses would in all probability have been forced to supply He was summoned to the bar of the Commons A messenger went with the summons to the house of the Duke of Leeds and was there informed that the Swiss was not within that he had been three days absent and that where he was the porter could not tell The Lords immediately presented an address to the King requesting him to give orders that the ports might be stopped and the fugitive arrested But Robart was already in Holland on his way to his native mountains The flight of this man made it impossible for the Commons to proceed They vehemently accused Leeds of having sent away the witness who alone could furnish legal proof of that which was already established by moral proof Leeds now at ease as to the event of the impeachment gave himself the airs of an injured man My Lords he said the conduct of the Commons is without precedent They impeach me of a high crime they promise to prove it then they find that they have not the means of proving it and they revile me for not supplying them with the means Surely they ought not to have brought a charge like this without well considering whether they had or had not evidence sufficient to support it If Robart s testimony be as they now say indispensable why did they not send for him and hear his story before they made up their minds They may thank their own intemperance their own precipitancy for his disappearance He is a foreigner he is timid he hears that a transaction in which he has been concerned has been pronounced by the House of Commons to be highly criminal that his master is impeached that his friend Bates is in prison that his own turn is coming He naturally takes fright he escapes to his own country and from what I know of him I will venture to predict that it will be long before he trusts himself again within reach of the Speaker s warrant But what is that to me Am I to lie all my life under the stigma of an accusation like this merely because the violence of my accusers has scared their own witness out of England I demand an immediate trial I move your Lordships to resolve that unless the Commons shall proceed before the end of the session the impeachment shall be dismissed A few friendly voices cried out Well moved But the Peers were generally unwilling to take a step which would have been in the highest degree offensive to the Lower House and to the great body of those whom that House represented The Duke s motion fell to the ground and a few hours later the Parliament was prorogued five hundred eighty four The impeachment was never revived The evidence which would warrant a formal verdict of guilty was not forthcoming and a formal verdict of guilty would hardly have answered Wharton s purpose better than the informal verdict of guilty which the whole nation had already pronounced The work was done The Whigs were dominant Leeds was no longer chief minister was indeed no longer a minister at all William from respect probably for the memory of the beloved wife whom he had lately lost and to whom Leeds had shown peculiar attachment avoided every thing that could look like harshness The fallen statesman was suffered to retain during a considerable time the title of Lord President and to walk on public occasions between the Great Seal and the Privy Seal But he was told that he would do well not to show himself at Council the business and the patronage even of the department of which he was the nominal head passed into other hands and the place which he ostensibly filled was considered in political circles as really vacant five hundred eighty five He hastened into the country and hid himself there during some months from the public eye When the Parliament met again however he emerged from his retreat Though he was well stricken in years and cruelly tortured by disease his ambition was still as ardent as ever With indefatigable energy he began a third time to climb as he flattered himself towards that dizzy pinnacle which he had twice reached and from which he had twice fallen He took a prominent part in debate but though his eloquence and knowledge always secured to him the attention of his hearers he was never again even when the Tory party was in power admitted to the smallest share in the direction of affairs There was one great humiliation which he could not be spared William was about to take the command of the army in the Netherlands and it was necessary that before he sailed he should determine by whom the government should be administered during his absence Hitherto Mary had acted as his vicegerent when he was out of England but she was gone He therefore delegated his authority to seven Lords Justices Tenison Archbishop of Canterbury Somers Keeper of the Great Seal Pembroke Keeper of the Privy Seal Devonshire Lord Steward Dorset Lord Chamberlain Shrewsbury Secretary of State and Godolphin First Commissioner of the Treasury It is easy to judge from this list of names which way the balance of power was now leaning Godolphin alone of the seven was a Tory The Lord President still second in rank and a few days before first in power of the great lay dignitaries of the realm was passed over and the omission was universally regarded as an official announcement of his disgrace five hundred eighty six There were some who wondered that the Princess of Denmark was not appointed Regent The reconciliation which had been begun while Mary was dying had since her death been in external show at least completed This was one of those occasions on which Sunderland was peculiarly qualified to be useful He was admirably fitted to manage a personal negotiation to soften resentment to soothe wounded pride to select among all the objects of human desire the very bait which was most likely to allure the mind with which he was dealing On this occasion his task was not difficult He had two excellent assistants Marlborough in the household of Anne and Somers in the cabinet of William Marlborough was now as desirous to support the government as he had once been to subvert it The death of Mary had produced a complete change in all his schemes There was one event to which he looked forward with the most intense longing the accession of the Princess to the English throne It was certain that on the day on which she began to reign he would be in her Court all that Buckingham had been in the Court of James the First Marlborough too must have been conscious of powers of a very different order from those which Buckingham had possessed of a genius for politics not inferior to that of Richelieu of a genius for war not inferior to that of Turenne Perhaps the disgraced General in obscurity and inaction anticipated the day when his power to help and hurt in Europe would be equal to that of her mightiest princes when he would be servilely flattered and courted by Caesar on one side and by Lewis the Great on the other and when every year would add another hundred thousand pounds to the largest fortune that had ever been accumulated by any English subject All this might be if missus Morley were Queen But that mister Freeman should ever see missus Morley Queen had till lately been not very probable Mary s life was a much better life than his and quite as good a life as her sister s That William would have issue seemed unlikely But it was generally expected that he would soon die His widow might marry again and might leave children who would succeed her In these circumstances Marlborough might well think that he had very little interest in maintaining that settlement of the Crown which had been made by the Convention Nothing was so likely to serve his purpose as confusion civil war another revolution another abdication another vacancy of the throne Perhaps the nation incensed against William yet not reconciled to James and distracted between hatred of foreigners and hatred of Jesuits might prefer both to the Dutch King and to the Popish King one who was at once a native of our country and a member of our Church That this was the real explanation of Marlborough s dark and complicated plots was as we have seen firmly believed by some of the most zealous Jacobites and is in the highest degree probable It is certain that during several years he had spared no efforts to inflame the army and the nation against the government But all was now changed Mary was gone By the Bill of Rights the Crown was entailed on Anne after the death of William The death of William could not be far distant Indeed all the physicians who attended him wondered that he was still alive and when the risks of war were added to the risks of disease the probability seemed to be that in a few months he would be in his grave Marlborough saw that it would now be madness to throw every thing into disorder and to put every thing to hazard He had done his best to shake the throne while it seemed unlikely that Anne would ever mount it except by violent means But he did his best to fix it firmly as soon as it became highly probably that she would soon be called to fill it in the regular course of nature and of law The Princess was easily induced by the Churchills to write to the King a submissive and affectionate letter of condolence The King who was never much inclined to engage in a commerce of insincere compliments and who was still in the first agonies of his grief showed little disposition to meet her advances But Somers who felt that every thing was at stake went to Kensington and made his way into the royal closet William was sitting there so deeply sunk in melancholy that he did not seem to perceive that any person had entered the room The Lord Keeper after a respectful pause broke silence and doubtless with all that cautious delicacy which was characteristic of him and which eminently qualified him to touch the sore places of the mind without hurting them implored His Majesty to be reconciled to the Princess Do what you will said William I can think of no business Thus authorised the mediators speedily concluded a treaty five hundred eighty seven Anne came to Kensington and was graciously received she was lodged in Saint James s Palace a guard of honour was again placed at her door and the Gazettes again after a long interval announced that foreign ministers had had the honour of being presented to her five hundred eighty eight The Churchills were again permitted to dwell under the royal roof But William did not at first include them in the peace which he had made with their mistress Marlborough remained excluded from military and political employment and it was not without much difficulty that he was admitted into the circle at Kensington and permitted to kiss the royal hand five hundred eighty nine The feeling with which he was regarded by the King explains why Anne was not appointed Regent The Regency of Anne would have been the Regency of Marlborough and it is not strange that a man whom it was not thought safe to entrust with any office in the State or the army should not have been entrusted with the whole government of the kingdom Had Marlborough been of a proud and vindictive nature he might have been provoked into raising another quarrel in the royal family and into forming new cabals in the army But all his passions except ambition and avarice were under strict regulation He was destitute alike of the sentiment of gratitude and of the sentiment of revenge He had conspired against the government while it was loading him with favours He now supported it though it requited his support with contumely He perfectly understood his own interest he had perfect command of his temper he endured decorously the hardships of his present situation and contented himself by looking forward to a reversion which would amply repay him for a few years of patience He did not indeed cease to correspond with the Court of Saint Germains but the correspondence gradually became more and more slack and seems on his part to have been made up of vague professions and trifling excuses The event which had changed all Marlborough s views had filled the minds of fiercer and more pertinacious politicians with wild hopes and atrocious projects During the two years and a half which followed the execution of Grandval no serious design had been formed against the life of William Some hotheaded malecontents had indeed laid schemes for kidnapping or murdering him but those schemes were not while his wife lived countenanced by her father James did not feel and to do him justice was not such a hypocrite as to pretend to feel any scruple about removing his enemies by those means which he had justly thought base and wicked when employed by his enemies against himself If any such scruple had arisen in his mind there was no want under his roof of casuists willing and competent to soothe his conscience with sophisms such as had corrupted the far nobler natures of Anthony Babington and Everard Digby To question the lawfulness of assassination in cases where assassination might promote the interests of the Church was to question the authority of the most illustrious Jesuits of Bellarmine and Suarez of Molina and Mariana nay it was to rebel against the Chair of Saint Peter One Pope had walked in procession at the head of his cardinals had proclaimed a jubilee had ordered the guns of Saint Angelo to be fired in honour of the perfidious butchery in which Coligni had perished Another Pope had in a solemn allocution hymned the murder of Henry the Third of France in rapturous language borrowed from the ode of the prophet Habakkuk and had extolled the murderer above Phinehas and Judith five hundred ninety William was regarded at Saint Germains as a monster compared with whom Coligni and Henry the Third were saints Nevertheless James during some years refused to sanction any attempt on his nephew s person The reasons which he assigned for his refusal have come down to us as he wrote them with his own hand He did not affect to think that assassination was a sin which ought to be held in horror by a Christian or a villany unworthy of a gentleman he merely said that the difficulties were great and that he would not push his friends on extreme danger when it would not be in his power to second them effectually five hundred ninety one In truth while Mary lived it might well be doubted whether the murder of her husband would really be a service to the Jacobite cause By his death the government would lose indeed the strength derived from his eminent personal qualities but would at the same time be relieved from the load of his personal unpopularity His whole power would at once devolve on his widow and the nation would probably rally round her with enthusiasm If her political abilities were not equal to his she had not his repulsive manners his foreign pronunciation his partiality for every thing Dutch and for every thing Calvinistic Many who had thought her culpably wanting in filial piety would be of opinion that now at least she was absolved from all duty to a father stained with the blood of her husband The whole machinery of the administration would continue to work without that interruption which ordinarily followed a demise of the Crown There would be no dissolution of the Parliament no suspension of the customs and excise commissions would retain their force and all that James would have gained by the fall of his enemy would have been a barren revenge The death of the Queen changed every thing If a dagger or a bullet should now reach the heart of William it was probable that there would instantly be general anarchy The Parliament and the Privy Council would cease to exist The authority of ministers and judges would expire with him from whom it was derived It might seem not improbable that at such a moment a restoration might be effected without a blow Scarcely therefore had Mary been laid in the grave when restless and unprincipled men began to plot in earnest against the life of William Foremost among these men in parts in courage and in energy was Robert Charnock He had been liberally educated and had in the late reign been a fellow of Magdalene College Oxford Alone in that great society he had betrayed the common cause had consented to be the tool of the High Commission had publicly apostatized from the Church of England and while his college was a Popish seminary had held the office of Vice President The Revolution came and altered at once the whole course of his life Driven from the quiet cloister and the old grove of oaks on the bank of the Cherwell he sought haunts of a very different kind During several years he led the perilous and agitated life of a conspirator passed and repassed on secret errands between England and France changed his lodgings in London often and was known at different coffeehouses by different names His services had been requited with a captain s commission signed by the banished King With Charnock was closely connected George Porter an adventurer who called himself a Roman Catholic and a Royalist but who was in truth destitute of all religious and of all political principle Porter s friends could not deny that he was a rake and a coxcomb that he drank that he swore that he told extravagant lies about his amours and that he had been convicted of manslaughter for a stab given in a brawl at the playhouse His enemies affirmed that he was addicted to nauseous and horrible kinds of debauchery and that he procured the means of indulging his infamous tastes by cheating and marauding that he was one of a gang of clippers that he sometimes got on horseback late in the evening and stole out in disguise and that when he returned from these mysterious excursions his appearance justified the suspicion that he had been doing business on Hounslow Heath or Finchley Common five hundred ninety two Cardell Goodman popularly called Scum Goodman a knave more abandoned if possible than Porter was in the plot Goodman had been on the stage had been kept like some much greater men by the Duchess of Cleveland had been taken into her house had been loaded by her with gifts and had requited her by bribing an Italian quack to poison two of her children As the poison had not been administered Goodman could be prosecuted only for a misdemeanour He was tried convicted and sentenced to a ruinous fine He had since distinguished himself as one of the first forgers of bank notes five hundred ninety three Sir William Parkyns a wealthy knight bred to the law who had been conspicuous among the Tories in the days of the Exclusion Bill was one of the most important members of the confederacy He bore a much fairer character than most of his accomplices but in one respect he was more culpable than any of them For he had in order to retain a lucrative office which he held in the Court of Chancery sworn allegiance to the Prince against whose life he now conspired The design was imparted to Sir John Fenwick celebrated on account of the cowardly insult which he had offered to the deceased Queen Fenwick if his own assertion is to be trusted was willing to join in an insurrection but recoiled from the thought of assassination and showed so much of what was in his mind as sufficed to make him an object of suspicion to his less scrupulous associates He kept their secret however as strictly as if he had wished them success It should seem that at first a natural feeling restrained the conspirators from calling their design by the proper name Even in their private consultations they did not as yet talk of killing the Prince of Orange They would try to seize him and to carry him alive into France If there were any resistance they might be forced to use their swords and pistols and nobody could be answerable for what a thrust or a shot might do In the spring of sixteen ninety five the scheme of assassination thus thinly veiled was communicated to James and his sanction was earnestly requested But week followed week and no answer arrived from him He doubtless remained silent in the hope that his adherents would after a short delay venture to act on their own responsibility and that he might thus have the advantage without the scandal of their crime They seem indeed to have so understood him He had not they said authorised the attempt but he had not prohibited it and apprised as he was of their plan the absence of prohibition was a sufficient warrant They therefore determined to strike but before they could make the necessary arrangements William set out for Flanders and the plot against his life was necessarily suspended till his return It was on the twelfth of May that the King left Kensington for Gravesend where he proposed to embark for the Continent Three days before his departure the Parliament of Scotland had after a recess of about two years met again at Edinburgh Hamilton who had in the preceding session sate on the throne and held the sceptre was dead and it was necessary to find a new Lord High Commissioner The person selected was John Hay Marquess of Tweedale Chancellor of the Realm a man grown old in business well informed prudent humane blameless in private life and on the whole as respectable as any Scottish lord who had been long and deeply concerned in the politics of those troubled times His task was not without difficulty It was indeed well known that the Estates were generally inclined to support the government But it was also well known that there was one subject which would require the most dexterous and delicate management The cry of the blood shed more than three years before in Glencoe had at length made itself heard Towards the close of the year sixteen ninety three the reports which had at first been contemptuously derided as factious calumnies began to be generally thought deserving of serious attention Many people little disposed to place confidence in any thing that came forth from the secret presses of the Jacobites owned that for the honour of the government some inquiry ought to be instituted The amiable Mary had been much shocked by what she heard William had at her request empowered the Duke of Hamilton and several other Scotchmen of note to investigate the whole matter But the Duke died his colleagues were slack in the performance of their duty and the King who knew little and cared little about Scotland forgot to urge them five hundred ninety four It now appeared that the government would have done wisely as well as rightly by anticipating the wishes of the country The horrible story repeated by the nonjurors pertinaciously confidently and with so many circumstances as almost enforced belief had at length roused all Scotland The sensibility of a people eminently patriotic was galled by the taunts of southern pamphleteers who asked whether there was on the north of the Tweed no law no justice no humanity no spirit to demand redress even for the foulest wrongs Each of the two extreme parties which were diametrically opposed to each other in general politics was impelled by a peculiar feeling to call for inquiry The Jacobites were delighted by the prospect of being able to make out a case which would bring discredit on the usurper and which might be set off against the many offences imputed by the Whigs to Claverhouse and Mackenzie The zealous Presbyterians were not less delighted at the prospect of being able to ruin the Master of Stair They had never forgotten or forgiven the service which he had rendered to the House of Stuart in the time of the persecution They knew that though he had cordially concurred in the political revolution which had freed them from the hated dynasty he had seen with displeasure that ecclesiastical revolution which was in their view even more important They knew that church government was with him merely an affair of State and that looking at it as an affair of State he preferred the episcopal to the synodical model They could not without uneasiness see so adroit and eloquent an enemy of pure religion constantly attending the royal steps and constantly breathing counsel in the royal ear They were therefore impatient for an investigation which if one half of what was rumoured were true must produce revelations fatal to the power and fame of the minister whom they distrusted Nor could that minister rely on the cordial support of all who held office under the Crown His genius and influence had excited the jealousy of many less successful courtiers and especially of his fellow secretary Johnstone Thus on the eve of the meeting of the Scottish Parliament Glencoe was in the mouths of all Scotchmen of all factions and of all sects William who was just about to start for the Continent learned that on this subject the Estates must have their way and that the best thing that he could do would be to put himself at the head of a movement which it was impossible for him to resist A Commission authorising Tweedale and several other privy councillors to examine fully into the matter about which the public mind was so strongly excited was signed by the King at Kensington was sent down to Edinburgh and was there sealed with the Great Seal of the realm This was accomplished just in time five hundred ninety five The Parliament had scarcely entered on business when a member rose to move for an inquiry into the circumstances of the slaughter of Glencoe Tweedale was able to inform the Estates that His Majesty s goodness had prevented their desires that a Commission of Precognition had a few hours before passed in all the forms and that the lords and gentlemen named in that instrument would hold their first meeting before night five hundred ninety six The Parliament unanimously voted thanks to the King for this instance of his paternal care but some of those who joined in the vote of thanks expressed a very natural apprehension that the second investigation might end as unsatisfactorily as the first investigation had ended The honour of the country they said was at stake and the Commissioners were bound to proceed with such diligence that the result of the inquest might be known before the end of the session Tweedale gave assurances which for a time silenced the murmurers five hundred ninety seven But when three weeks had passed away many members became mutinous and suspicious On the fourteenth of June it was moved that the Commissioners should be ordered to report The motion was not carried but it was renewed day after day In three successive sittings Tweedale was able to restrain the eagerness of the assembly But when he at length announced that the report had been completed and added that it would not be laid before the Estates till it had been submitted to the King there was a violent outcry The public curiosity was intense for the examination had been conducted with closed doors and both Commissioners and clerks had been sworn to secrecy The King was in the Netherlands Weeks must elapse before his pleasure could be taken and the session could not last much longer In a fourth debate there were signs which convinced the Lord High Commissioner that it was expedient to yield and the report was produced five hundred ninety eight It is a paper highly creditable to those who framed it an excellent digest of evidence clear passionless and austerely just No source from which valuable information was likely to be derived had been neglected Glengarry and Keppoch though notoriously disaffected to the government had been permitted to conduct the case on behalf of their unhappy kinsmen Several of the Macdonalds who had escaped from the havoc of that night had been examined and among them the reigning Mac Ian the eldest son of the murdered Chief The correspondence of the Master of Stair with the military men who commanded in the Highlands had been subjected to a strict but not unfair scrutiny The conclusion to which the Commissioners came and in which every intelligent and candid inquirer will concur was that the slaughter of Glencoe was a barbarous murder and that of this barbarous murder the letters of the Master of Stair were the sole warrant and cause That Breadalbane was an accomplice in the crime was not proved but he did not come off quite clear In the course of the investigation it was incidentally discovered that he had while distributing the money of William among the Highland Chiefs professed to them the warmest zeal for the interest of James and advised them to take what they could get from the usurper but to be constantly on the watch for a favourable opportunity of bringing back the rightful King Breadalbane s defence was that he was a greater villain than his accusers imagined and that he had pretended to be a Jacobite only in order to get at the bottom of the Jacobite plans In truth the depths of this man s knavery were unfathomable It was impossible to say which of his treasons were to borrow the Italian classification single treasons and which double treasons On this occasion the Parliament supposed him to have been guilty only of a single treason and sent him to the Castle of Edinburgh The government on full consideration gave credit to his assertion that he had been guilty of a double treason and let him out again five hundred ninety nine The Report of the Commission was taken into immediate consideration by the Estates They resolved without one dissentient voice that the order signed by William did not authorise the slaughter of Glencoe They next resolved but it should seem not unanimously that the slaughter was a murder six hundred They proceeded to pass several votes the sense of which was finally summed up in an address to the King How that part of the address which related to the Master of Stair should be framed was a question about which there was much debate Several of his letters were called for and read and several amendments were put to the vote It should seem that the Jacobites and the extreme Presbyterians were with but too good cause on the side of severity The majority under the skilful management of the Lord High Commissioner acquiesced in words which made it impossible for the guilty minister to retain his office but which did not impute to him such criminality as would have affected his life or his estate They censured him but censured him in terms far too soft They blamed his immoderate zeal against the unfortunate clan and his warm directions about performing the execution by surprise His excess in his letters they pronounced to have been the original cause of the massacre but instead of demanding that he should be brought to trial as a murderer they declared that in consideration of his absence and of his great place they left it to the royal wisdom to deal with him in such a manner as might vindicate the honour of the government The indulgence which was shown to the principal offender was not extended to his subordinates Hamilton who had fled and had been vainly cited by proclamation at the City Cross to appear before the Estates was pronounced not to be clear of the blood of the Glencoe men Glenlyon Captain Drummond Lieutenant Lindsey Ensign Lundie and Serjeant Barbour were still more distinctly designated as murderers and the King was requested to command the Lord Advocate to prosecute them The Parliament of Scotland was undoubtedly on this occasion severe in the wrong place and lenient in the wrong place The cruelty and baseness of Glenlyon and his comrades excite even after the lapse of a hundred and sixty years emotions which make it difficult to reason calmly Yet whoever can bring himself to look at the conduct of these men with judicial impartiality will probably be of opinion that they could not without great detriment to the commonwealth have been treated as assassins They had slain nobody whom they had not been positively directed by their commanding officer to slay That subordination without which an army is the worst of all rabbles would be at an end if every soldier were to be held answerable for the justice of every order in obedience to which he pulls his trigger The case of Glencoe was doubtless an extreme case but it cannot easily be distinguished in principle from cases which in war are of ordinary occurrence Very terrible military executions are sometimes indispensable Humanity itself may require them Who then is to decide whether there be an emergency such as makes severity the truest mercy Who is to determine whether it be or be not necessary to lay a thriving town in ashes to decimate a large body of mutineers to shoot a whole gang of banditti Is the responsibility with the commanding officer or with the rank and file whom he orders to make ready present and fire And if the general rule be that the responsibility is with the commanding officer and not with those who obey him is it possible to find any reason for pronouncing the case of Glencoe an exception to that rule It is remarkable that no member of the Scottish Parliament proposed that any of the private men of Argyle s regiment should be prosecuted for murder Absolute impunity was granted to everybody below the rank of Serjeant Yet on what principle Surely if military obedience was not a valid plea every man who shot a Macdonald on that horrible night was a murderer And if military obedience was a valid plea for the musketeer who acted by order of Serjeant Barbour why not for Barbour who acted by order of Glenlyon And why not for Glenlyon who acted by order of Hamilton It can scarcely be maintained that more deference is due from a private to a noncommissioned officer than from a noncommissioned officer to his captain or from a captain to his colonel It may be said that the orders given to Glenlyon were of so peculiar a nature that if he had been a man of virtue he would have thrown up his commission would have braved the displeasure of colonel general and Secretary of State would have incurred the heaviest penalty which a Court Martial could inflict rather than have performed the part assigned to him and this is perfectly true but the question is not whether he acted like a virtuous man but whether he did that for which he could without infringing a rule essential to the discipline of camps and to the security of nations be hanged as a murderer In this case disobedience was assuredly a moral duty but it does not follow that obedience was a legal crime It seems therefore that the guilt of Glenlyon and his fellows was not within the scope of the penal law The only punishment which could properly be inflicted on them was that which made Cain cry out that it was greater than he could bear to be vagabonds on the face of the earth and to carry wherever they went a mark from which even bad men should turn away sick with horror It was not so with the Master of Stair He had been solemnly pronounced both by the Commission of Precognition and by the Estates of the Realm in full Parliament to be the original author of the massacre That it was not advisable to make examples of his tools was the strongest reason for making an example of him Every argument which can be urged against punishing the soldier who executes the unjust and inhuman orders of his superior is an argument for punishing with the utmost rigour of the law the superior who gives unjust and inhuman orders Where there can be no responsibility below there should be double responsibility above What the Parliament of Scotland ought with one voice to have demanded was not that a poor illiterate serjeant who was hardly more accountable than his own halbert for the bloody work which he had done should be hanged in the Grassmarket but that the real murderer the most politic the most eloquent the most powerful of Scottish statesmen should be brought to a public trial and should if found guilty die the death of a felon Nothing less than such a sacrifice could expiate such a crime Unhappily the Estates by extenuating the guilt of the chief offender and at the same time demanding that his humble agents should be treated with a severity beyond the law made the stain which the massacre had left on the honour of the nation broader and deeper than before Nor is it possible to acquit the King of a great breach of duty It is indeed highly probable that till he received the report of his Commissioners he had been very imperfectly informed as to the circumstances of the slaughter We can hardly suppose that he was much in the habit of reading Jacobite pamphlets and if he did read them he would have found in them such a quantity of absurd and rancorous invective against himself that he would have been very little inclined to credit any imputation which they might throw on his servants He would have seen himself accused in one tract of being a concealed Papist in another of having poisoned Jeffreys in the Tower in a third of having contrived to have Talmash taken off at Brest He would have seen it asserted that in Ireland he once ordered fifty of his wounded English soldiers to be burned alive He would have seen that the unalterable affection which he felt from his boyhood to his death for three or four of the bravest and most trusty friends that ever prince had the happiness to possess was made a ground for imputing to him abominations as foul as those which are buried under the waters of the Dead Sea He might therefore naturally be slow to believe frightful imputations thrown by writers whom he knew to be habitual liars on a statesman whose abilities he valued highly and to whose exertions he had on some great occasions owed much But he could not after he had read the documents transmitted to him from Edinburgh by Tweedale entertain the slightest doubt of the guilt of the Master of Stair To visit that guilt with exemplary punishment was the sacred duty of a Sovereign who had sworn with his hand lifted up towards heaven that he would in his kingdom of Scotland repress in all estates and degrees all oppression and would do justice without acceptance of persons as he hoped for mercy from the Father of all mercies William contented himself with dismissing the Master from office For this great fault a fault amounting to a crime Burnet tried to frame not a defence but an excuse He would have us believe that the King alarmed by finding how many persons had borne a part in the slaughter of Glencoe thought it better to grant a general amnesty than to punish one massacre by another But this representation is the very reverse of the truth Numerous instruments had doubtless been employed in the work of death but they had all received their impulse directly or indirectly from a single mind High above the crowd of offenders towered one offender preeminent in parts knowledge rank and power In return for many victims immolated by treachery only one victim was demanded by justice and it must ever be considered as a blemish on the fame of William that the demand was refused On the seventeenth of July the session of the Parliament of Scotland closed The Estates had liberally voted such a supply as the poor country which they represented could afford They had indeed been put into high good humour by the notion that they had found out a way of speedily making that poor country rich Their attention had been divided between the inquiry into the slaughter of Glencoe and some specious commercial projects of which the nature will be explained and the fate related in a future chapter Meanwhile all Europe was looking anxiously towards the Low Countries The great warrior who had been victorious at Fleurus at Steinkirk and at Landen had not left his equal behind him But France still possessed Marshals well qualified for high command Already Catinat and Boufflers had given proofs of skill of resolution and of zeal for the interests of the state Either of those distinguished officers would have been a successor worthy of Luxemburg and an antagonist worthy of William but their master unfortunately for himself preferred to both the Duke of Villeroy The new general had been Lewis s playmate when they were both children had then become a favourite and had never ceased to be so In those superficial graces for which the French aristocracy was then renowned throughout Europe Villeroy was preeminent among the French aristocracy His stature was tall his countenance handsome his manners nobly and somewhat haughtily polite his dress his furniture his equipages his table magnificent No man told a story with more vivacity no man sate his horse better in a hunting party no man made love with more success no man staked and lost heaps of gold with more agreeable unconcern no man was more intimately acquainted with the adventures the attachments the enmities of the lords and ladies who daily filled the halls of Versailles There were two characters especially which this fine gentleman had studied during many years and of which he knew all the plaits and windings the character of the King and the character of her who was Queen in every thing but name But there ended Villeroy s acquirements He was profoundly ignorant both of books and of business At the Council Board he never opened his mouth without exposing himself For war he had not a single qualification except that personal courage which was common to him with the whole class of which he was a member At every great crisis of his political and of his military life he was alternately drunk with arrogance and sunk in dejection Just before he took a momentous step his selfconfidence was boundless he would listen to no suggestion he would not admit into his mind the thought that failure was possible On the first check he gave up every thing for lost became incapable of directing and ran up and down in helpless despair Lewis however loved him and he to do him justice loved Lewis The kindness of the master was proof against all the disasters which were brought on his kingdom by the rashness and weakness of the servant and the gratitude of the servant was honourably though not judiciously manifested on more than one occasion after the death of the master six hundred one Such was the general to whom the direction of the campaign in the Netherlands was confided The Duke of Maine was sent to learn the art of war under this preceptor Maine the natural son of Lewis by the Duchess of Montespan had been brought up from childhood by Madame de Maintenon and was loved by Lewis with the love of a father by Madame de Maintenon with the not less tender love of a foster mother Grave men were scandalized by the ostentatious manner in which the King while making a high profession of piety exhibited his partiality for this offspring of a double adultery Kindness they said was doubtless due from a parent to a child but decency was also due from a Sovereign to his people In spite of these murmurs the youth had been publicly acknowledged loaded with wealth and dignities created a Duke and Peer placed by an extraordinary act of royal power above Dukes and Peers of older creation married to a Princess of the blood royal and appointed Grand Master of the Artillery of the Realm With abilities and courage he might have played a great part in the world But his intellect was small his nerves were weak and the women and priests who had educated him had effectually assisted nature He was orthodox in belief correct in morals insinuating in address a hypocrite a mischiefmaker and a coward It was expected at Versailles that Flanders would during this year be the chief theatre of war Here therefore a great army was collected Strong lines were formed from the Lys to the Scheld and Villeroy fixed his headquarters near Tournay Boufflers with about twelve thousand men guarded the banks of the Sambre On the other side the British and Dutch troops who were under William s immediate command mustered in the neighbourhood of Ghent The Elector of Bavaria at the head of a great force lay near Brussels A smaller army consisting chiefly of Brandenburghers was encamped not far from Huy Early in June military operations commenced The first movements of William were mere feints intended to prevent the French generals from suspecting his real purpose He had set his heart on retaking Namur The loss of Namur had been the most mortifying of all the disasters of a disastrous war The importance of Namur in a military point of view had always been great and had become greater than ever during the three years which had elapsed since the last siege New works the masterpieces of Vauban had been added to the old defences which had been constructed with the utmost skill of Cohorn So ably had the two illustrious engineers vied with each other and cooperated with nature that the fortress was esteemed the strongest in Europe Over one gate had been placed a vaunting inscription which defied the allies to wrench the prize from the grasp of France William kept his own counsel so well that not a hint of his intention got abroad Some thought that Dunkirk some that Ypres was his object The marches and skirmishes by which he disguised his design were compared by Saint Simon to the moves of a skilful chess player Feuquieres much more deeply versed in military science than Saint Simon informs us that some of these moves were hazardous and that such a game could not have been safely played against Luxemburg and this is probably true but Luxemburg was gone and what Luxemburg had been to William William now was to Villeroy While the King was thus employed the Jacobites at home being unable in his absence to prosecute their design against his person contented themselves with plotting against his government They were somewhat less closely watched than during the preceding year for the event of the trials at Manchester had discouraged Aaron Smith and his agents Trenchard whose vigilance and severity had made him an object of terror and hatred was no more and had been succeeded in what may be called the subordinate Secretaryship of State by Sir William Trumball a learned civilian and an experienced diplomatist of moderate opinions and of temper cautious to timidity six hundred two The malecontents were emboldened by the lenity of the administration William had scarcely sailed for the Continent when they held a great meeting at one of their favourite haunts the Old King s Head in Leadenhall Street Charnock Porter Goodman Parkyns and Fenwick were present The Earl of Aylesbury was there a man whose attachment to the exiled house was notorious but who always denied that he had ever thought of effecting a restoration by immoral means His denial would be entitled to more credit if he had not by taking the oaths to the government against which he was constantly intriguing forfeited the right to be considered as a man of conscience and honour In the assembly was Sir John Friend a nonjuror who had indeed a very slender wit but who had made a very large fortune by brewing and who spent it freely in sedition After dinner for the plans of the Jacobites were generally laid over wine and generally bore some trace of the conviviality in which they had originated it was resolved that the time was come for an insurrection and a French invasion and that a special messenger should carry the sense of the meeting to Saint Germains Charnock was selected He undertook the commission crossed the Channel saw James and had interviews with the ministers of Lewis but could arrange nothing The English malecontents would not stir till ten thousand French troops were in the island and ten thousand French troops could not without great risk be withdrawn from the army which was contending against William in the Low Countries When Charnock returned to report that his embassy had been unsuccessful he found some of his confederates in gaol They had during his absence amused themselves after their fashion by trying to raise a riot in London on the tenth of June the birthday of the unfortunate Prince of Wales They met at a tavern in Drury Lane and when hot with wine sallied forth sword in hand headed by Porter and Goodman beat kettledrums unfurled banners and began to light bonfires But the watch supported by the populace was too strong for the revellers They were put to rout the tavern where they had feasted was sacked by the mob the ringleaders were apprehended tried fined and imprisoned but regained their liberty in time to bear a part in a far more criminal design six hundred three By this time all was ready for the execution of the plan which William had formed That plan had been communicated to the other chiefs of the allied forces and had been warmly approved Vaudemont was left in Flanders with a considerable force to watch Villeroy The King with the rest of his army marched straight on Namur At the same moment the Elector of Bavaria advanced towards the same point on one side and the Brandenburghers on another So well had these movements been concerted and so rapidly were they performed that the skilful and energetic Boufflers had but just time to throw himself into the fortress He was accompanied by seven regiments of dragoons by a strong body of gunners sappers and miners and by an officer named Megrigny who was esteemed the best engineer in the French service with the exception of Vauban A few hours after Boufflers had entered the place the besieging forces closed round it on every side and the lines of circumvallation were rapidly formed The news excited no alarm at the French Court There it was not doubted that William would soon be compelled to abandon his enterprise with grievous loss and ignominy The town was strong the castle was believed to be impregnable the magazines were filled with provisions and ammunition sufficient to last till the time at which the armies of that age were expected to retire into winter quarters the garrison consisted of sixteen thousand of the best troops in the world they were commanded by an excellent general he was assisted by an excellent engineer nor was it doubted that Villeroy would march with his great army to the assistance of Boufflers and that the besiegers would then be in much more danger than the besieged These hopes were kept up by the despatches of Villeroy He proposed he said first to annihilate the army of Vaudemont and then to drive William from Namur Vaudemont might try to avoid an action but he could not escape The Marshal went so far as to promise his master news of a complete victory within twenty four hours Lewis passed a whole day in impatient expectation At last instead of an officer of high rank loaded with English and Dutch standards arrived a courier bringing news that Vaudemont had effected a retreat with scarcely any loss and was safe under the walls of Ghent William extolled the generalship of his lieutenant in the warmest terms My cousin he wrote you have shown yourself a greater master of your art than if you had won a pitched battle six hundred four In the French camp however and at the French Court it was universally held that Vaudemont had been saved less by his own skill than by the misconduct of those to whom he was opposed Some threw the whole blame on Villeroy and Villeroy made no attempt to vindicate himself But it was generally believed that he might at least to a great extent have vindicated himself had he not preferred royal favour to military renown His plan it was said might have succeeded had not the execution been entrusted to the Duke of Maine At the first glimpse of danger the bastard s heart had died within him He had not been able to conceal his poltroonery He had stood trembling stuttering calling for his confessor while the old officers round him with tears in their eyes urged him to advance During a short time the disgrace of the son was concealed from the father But the silence of Villeroy showed that there was a secret the pleasantries of the Dutch gazettes soon elucidated the mystery and Lewis learned if not the whole truth yet enough to make him miserable Never during his long reign had he been so moved During some hours his gloomy irritability kept his servants his courtiers even his priests in terror He so far forgot the grace and dignity for which he was renowned throughout the world that in the sight of all the splendid crowd of gentlemen and ladies who came to see him dine at Marli he broke a cane on the shoulders of a lacquey and pursued the poor man with the handle six hundred five The siege of Namur meanwhile was vigorously pressed by the allies The scientific part of their operations was under the direction of Cohorn who was spurred by emulation to exert his utmost skill He had suffered three years before the mortification of seeing the town as he had fortified it taken by his great master Vauban To retake it now that the fortifications had received Vauban s last improvements would be a noble revenge On the second of July the trenches were opened On the eighth a gallant sally of French dragoons was gallantly beaten back and late on the same evening a strong body of infantry the English footguards leading the way stormed after a bloody conflict the outworks on the Brussels side The King in person directed the attack and his subjects were delighted to learn that when the fight was hottest he laid his hand on the shoulder of the Elector of Bavaria and exclaimed Look look at my brave English Conspicuous in bravery even among those brave English was Cutts In that bulldog courage which flinches from no danger however terrible he was unrivalled There was no difficulty in finding hardy volunteers German Dutch and British to go on a forlorn hope but Cutts was the only man who appeared to consider such an expedition as a party of pleasure He was so much at his ease in the hottest fire of the French batteries that his soldiers gave him the honourable nickname of the Salamander six hundred six On the seventeenth the first counterscarp of the town was attacked The English and Dutch were thrice repulsed with great slaughter and returned thrice to the charge At length in spite of the exertions of the French officers who fought valiantly sword in hand on the glacis the assailants remained in possession of the disputed works While the conflict was raging William who was giving his orders under a shower of bullets saw with surprise and anger among the officers of his staff Michael Godfrey the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England This gentleman had come to the King s headquarters in order to make some arrangements for the speedy and safe remittance of money from England to the army in the Netherlands and was curious to see real war Such curiosity William could not endure mister Godfrey he said you ought not to run these hazards you are not a soldier you can be of no use to us here Sir answered Godfrey I run no more hazard than Your Majesty Not so said William I am where it is my duty to be and I may without presumption commit my life to God s keeping but you While they were talking a cannon ball from the ramparts laid Godfrey dead at the King s feet It was not found however that the fear of being Godfreyed such was during some time the cant phrase sufficed to prevent idle gazers from coming to the trenches six hundred seven Though William forbade his coachmen footmen and cooks to expose themselves he repeatedly saw them skulking near the most dangerous spots and trying to get a peep at the fighting He was sometimes it is said provoked into horsewhipping them out of the range of the French guns and the story whether true or false is very characteristic On the twentieth of July the Bavarians and Brandenburghers under the direction of Cohorn made themselves masters after a hard fight of a line of works which Vauban had cut in the solid rock from the Sambre to the Meuse Three days later the English and Dutch Cutts as usual in the front lodged themselves on the second counterscarp All was ready for a general assault when a white flag was hung out from the ramparts The effective strength of the garrison was now little more than one half of what it had been when the trenches were opened Boufflers apprehended that it would be impossible for eight thousand men to defend the whole circuit of the walls much longer but he felt confident that such a force would be sufficient to keep the stronghold on the summit of the rock Terms of capitulation were speedily adjusted A gate was delivered up to the allies The French were allowed forty eight hours to retire into the castle and were assured that the wounded men whom they left below about fifteen hundred in number should be well treated On the sixth the allies marched in The contest for the possession of the town was over and a second and more terrible contest began for the possession of the citadel six hundred eight Villeroy had in the meantime made some petty conquests Dixmuyde which might have offered some resistance had opened its gates to him not without grave suspicion of treachery on the part of the governor Deynse which was less able to make any defence had followed the example The garrisons of both towns were in violation of a convention which had been made for the exchange of prisoners sent into France The Marshal then advanced towards Brussels in the hope as it should seem that by menacing that beautiful capital he might induce the allies to raise the siege of the castle of Namur During thirty six hours he rained shells and redhot bullets on the city The Electress of Bavaria who was within the walls miscarried from terror Six convents perished Fifteen hundred houses were at once in flames The whole lower town would have been burned to the ground had not the inhabitants stopped the conflagration by blowing up numerous buildings Immense quantities of the finest lace and tapestry were destroyed for the industry and trade which made Brussels famous throughout the world had hitherto been little affected by the war Several of the stately piles which looked down on the market place were laid in ruins The Town Hall itself the noblest of the many noble senate houses reared by the burghers of the Netherlands was in imminent peril All this devastation however produced no effect except much private misery William was not to be intimidated or provoked into relaxing the firm grasp with which he held Namur The fire which his batteries kept up round the castle was such as had never been known in war The French gunners were fairly driven from their pieces by the hail of balls and forced to take refuge in vaulted galleries under the ground Cohorn exultingly betted the Elector of Bavaria four hundred pistoles that the place would fall by the thirty first of August New Style The great engineer lost his wager indeed but lost it only by a few hours six hundred nine Boufflers now began to feel that his only hope was in Villeroy Villeroy had proceeded from Brussels to Enghien he had there collected all the French troops that could be spared from the remotest fortresses of the Netherlands and he now at the head of more than eighty thousand men marched towards Namur Vaudemont meanwhile joined the besiegers William therefore thought himself strong enough to offer battle to Villeroy without intermitting for a moment the operations against Boufflers The Elector of Bavaria was entrusted with the immediate direction of the siege The King of England took up on the west of the town a strong position strongly intrenched and there awaited the French who were advancing from Enghien Every thing seemed to indicate that a great day was at hand Two of the most numerous and best ordered armies that Europe had ever seen were brought face to face On the fifteenth of August the defenders of the castle saw from their watchtowers the mighty host of their countrymen But between that host and the citadel was drawn up in battle order the not less mighty host of William Villeroy by a salute of ninety guns conveyed to Boufflers the promise of a speedy rescue and at night Boufflers by fire signals which were seen far over the vast plain of the Meuse and Sambre urged Villeroy to fulfil that promise without delay In the capitals both of France and England the anxiety was intense Lewis shut himself up in his oratory confessed received the Eucharist and gave orders that the host should be exposed in his chapel His wife ordered all her nuns to their knees six hundred ten London was kept in a state of distraction by a succession of rumours fabricated some by Jacobites and some by stockjobbers Early one morning it was confidently averred that there had been a battle that the allies had been beaten that the King had been killed that the siege had been raised The Exchange as soon as it was opened was filled to overflowing by people who came to learn whether the bad news was true The streets were stopped up all day by groups of talkers and listeners In the afternoon the Gazette which had been impatiently expected and which was eagerly read by thousands calmed the excitement but not completely for it was known that the Jacobites sometimes received by the agency of privateers and smugglers who put to sea in all weathers intelligence earlier than that which came through regular channels to the Secretary of State at Whitehall Before night however the agitation had altogether subsided but it was suddenly revived by a bold imposture A horseman in the uniform of the Guards spurred through the City announcing that the King had been killed He would probably have raised a serious tumult had not some apprentices zealous for the Revolution and the Protestant religion knocked him down and carried him to Newgate The confidential correspondent of the States General informed them that in spite of all the stories which the disaffected party invented and circulated the general persuasion was that the allies would be successful The touchstone of sincerity in England he said was the betting The Jacobites were ready enough to prove that William must be defeated or to assert that he had been defeated but they would not give the odds and could hardly be induced to take any moderate odds The Whigs on the other hand were ready to stake thousands of guineas on the conduct and good fortune of the King six hundred eleven The event justified the confidence of the Whigs and the backwardness of the Jacobites On the sixteenth the seventeenth and the eighteenth of August the army of Villeroy and the army of William confronted each other It was fully expected that the nineteenth would be the decisive day The allies were under arms before dawn At four William mounted and continued till eight at night to ride from post to post disposing his own troops and watching the movements of the enemy The enemy approached his lines in several places near enough to see that it would not be easy to dislodge him but there was no fighting He lay down to rest expecting to be attacked when the sun rose But when the sun rose he found that the French had fallen back some miles He immediately sent to request that the Elector would storm the castle without delay While the preparations were making Portland was sent to summon the garrison for the last time It was plain he said to Boufflers that Villeroy had given up all hope of being able to raise the siege It would therefore be an useless waste of life to prolong the contest Boufflers however thought that another day of slaughter was necessary to the honour of the French arms and Portland returned unsuccessful six hundred twelve Early in the afternoon the assault was made in four places at once by four divisions of the confederate army One point was assigned to the Brandenburghers another to the Dutch a third to the Bavarians and a fourth to the English The English were at first less fortunate than they had hitherto been The truth is that most of the regiments which had seen service had marched with William to encounter Villeroy As soon as the signal was given by the blowing up of two barrels of powder Cutts at the head of a small body of grenadiers marched first out of the trenches with drums beating and colours flying This gallant band was to be supported by four battalions which had never been in action and which though full of spirit wanted the steadiness which so terrible a service required The officers fell fast Every Colonel every Lieutenant Colonel was killed or severely wounded Cutts received a shot in the head which for a time disabled him The raw recruits left almost without direction rushed forward impetuously till they found themselves in disorder and out of breath with a precipice before them under a terrible fire and under a shower scarcely less terrible of fragments of rock and wall They lost heart and rolled back in confusion till Cutts whose wound had by this time been dressed succeeded in rallying them He then led them not to the place from which they had been driven back but to another spot where a fearful battle was raging The Bavarians had made their onset gallantly but unsuccessfully their general had fallen and they were beginning to waver when the arrival of the Salamander and his men changed the fate of the day Two hundred English volunteers bent on retrieving at all hazards the disgrace of the recent repulse were the first to force a way sword in hand through the palisades to storm a battery which had made great havoc among the Bavarians and to turn the guns against the garrison Meanwhile the Brandenburghers excellently disciplined and excellently commanded had performed with no great loss the duty assigned to them The Dutch had been equally successful When the evening closed in the allies had made a lodgment of a mile in extent on the outworks of the castle The advantage had been purchased by the loss of two thousand men six hundred thirteen And now Boufflers thought that he had done all that his duty required On the morrow he asked for a truce of forty eight hours in order that the hundreds of corpses which choked the ditches and which would soon have spread pestilence among both the besiegers and the besieged might be removed and interred His request was granted and before the time expired he intimated that he was disposed to capitulate He would he said deliver up the castle in ten days if he were not relieved sooner He was informed that the allies would not treat with him on such terms and that he must either consent to an immediate surrender or prepare for an immediate assault He yielded and it was agreed that he and his men should be suffered to depart leaving the citadel the artillery and the stores to the conquerors Three peals from all the guns of the confederate army notified to Villeroy the fall of the stronghold which he had vainly attempted to succour He instantly retreated towards Mons leaving William to enjoy undisturbed a triumph which was made more delightful by the recollection of many misfortunes The twenty sixth of August was fixed for an exhibition such as the oldest soldier in Europe had never seen and such as a few weeks before the youngest had scarcely hoped to see From the first battle of Conde to the last battle of Luxemburg the tide of military success had run without any serious interruption in one direction That tide had turned For the first time men said since France had Marshals a Marshal of France was to deliver up a fortress to a victorious enemy The allied forces foot and horse drawn up in two lines formed a magnificent avenue from the breach which had lately been so desperately contested to the bank of the Meuse The Elector of Bavaria the Landgrave of Hesse and many distinguished officers were on horseback in the vicinity of the castle William was near them in his coach The garrison reduced to about five thousand men came forth with drums beating and ensigns flying Boufflers and his staff closed the procession There had been some difficulty about the form of the greeting which was to be exchanged between him and the allied Sovereigns An Elector of Bavaria was hardly entitled to be saluted by the Marshal with the sword A King of England was undoubtedly entitled to such a mark of respect but France did not recognise William as King of England At last Boufflers consented to perform the salute without marking for which of the two princes it was intended He lowered his sword William alone acknowledged the compliment A short conversation followed The Marshal in order to avoid the use of the words Sire and Majesty addressed himself only to the Elector The Elector with every mark of deference reported to William what had been said and William gravely touched his hat The officers of the garrison carried back to their country the news that the upstart who at Paris was designated only as Prince of Orange was treated by the proudest potentates of the Germanic body with a respect as profound as that which Lewis exacted from the gentlemen of his bedchamber six hundred fourteen The ceremonial was now over and Boufflers passed on but he had proceeded but a short way when he was stopped by Dykvelt who accompanied the allied army as deputy from the States General You must return to the town Sir said Dykvelt The King of England has ordered me to inform you that you are his prisoner Boufflers was in transports of rage His officers crowded round him and vowed to die in his defence But resistance was out of the question a strong body of Dutch cavalry came up and the Brigadier who commanded them demanded the Marshal s sword The Marshal uttered indignant exclamations This is an infamous breach of faith Look at the terms of the capitulation What have I done to deserve such an affront Have I not behaved like a man of honour Ought I not to be treated as such But beware what you do gentlemen I serve a master who can and will avenge me I am a soldier Sir answered the Brigadier and my business is to obey orders without troubling myself about consequences Dykvelt calmly and courteously replied to the Marshal s indignant exclamations The King of England has reluctantly followed the example set by your master The soldiers who garrisoned Dixmuyde and Deynse have in defiance of plighted faith been sent prisoners into France The Prince whom they serve would be wanting in his duty to them if he did not retaliate His Majesty might with perfect justice have detained all the French who were in Namur But he will not follow to such a length a precedent which he disapproves He has determined to arrest you and you alone and Sir you must not regard as an affront what is in truth a mark of his very particular esteem How can he pay you a higher compliment than by showing that he considers you as fully equivalent to the five or six thousand men whom your sovereign wrongfully holds in captivity Nay you shall even now be permitted to proceed if you will give me your word of honour to return hither unless the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse are released within a fortnight I do not at all know answered Boufflers why the King my master detains those men and therefore I cannot hold out any hope that he will liberate them You have an army at your back I am alone and you must do your pleasure He gave up his sword returned to Namur and was sent thence to Huy where he passed a few days in luxurious repose was allowed to choose his own walks and rides and was treated with marked respect by those who guarded him In the shortest time in which it was possible to post from the place where he was confined to the French Court and back again he received full powers to promise that the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse should be sent back He was instantly liberated and he set off for Fontainebleau where an honourable reception awaited him He was created a Duke and a Peer That he might be able to support his new dignities a considerable sum of money was bestowed on him and in the presence of the whole aristocracy of France he was welcomed home by Lewis with an affectionate embrace six hundred fifteen In all the countries which were united against France the news of the fall of Namur was received with joy but here the exultation was greatest During several generations our ancestors had achieved nothing considerable by land against foreign enemies We had indeed occasionally furnished to our allies small bands of auxiliaries who had well maintained the honour of the nation But from the day on which the two brave Talbots father and son had perished in the vain attempt to reconquer Guienne till the Revolution there had been on the Continent no campaign in which Englishmen had borne a principal part At length our ancestors had again after an interval of near two centuries and a half begun to dispute with the warriors of France the palm of military prowess The struggle had been hard The genius of Luxemburg and the consummate discipline of the household troops of Lewis had pervailed in two great battles but the event of those battles had been long doubtful the victory had been dearly purchased and the victor had gained little more than the honour of remaining master of the field of slaughter Meanwhile he was himself training his adversaries The recruits who survived his severe tuition speedily became veterans Steinkirk and Landen had formed the volunteers who followed Cutts through the palisades of Namur The judgment of all the great warriors whom all the nations of Western Europe had sent to the confluence of the Sambre and the Meuse was that the English subaltern was inferior to no subaltern and the English private soldier to no private soldier in Christendom The English officers of higher rank were thought hardly worthy to command such an army Cutts indeed had distinguished himself by his intrepidity But those who most admired him acknowledged that he had neither the capacity nor the science necessary to a general The joy of the conquerors was heightened by the recollection of the discomfiture which they had suffered three years before on the same spot and of the insolence with which their enemy had then triumphed over them They now triumphed in their turn The Dutch struck medals The Spaniards sang Te Deums Many poems serious and sportive appeared of which one only has lived Prior burlesqued with admirable spirit and pleasantry the bombastic verses in which Boileau had celebrated the first taking of Namur The two odes printed side by side were read with delight in London and the critics at Will s pronounced that in wit as in arms England had been victorious The fall of Namur was the great military event of this year The Turkish war still kept a large part of the forces of the Emperor employed in indecisive operations on the Danube Nothing deserving to be mentioned took place either in Piedmont or on the Rhine In Catalonia the Spaniards obtained some slight advantages advantages due to their English and Dutch allies who seem to have done all that could be done to help a nation never much disposed to help itself The maritime superiority of England and Holland was now fully established During the whole year Russell was the undisputed master of the Mediterranean passed and repassed between Spain and Italy bombarded Palamos spread terror along the whole shore of Provence and kept the French fleet imprisoned in the harbour of Toulon Meanwhile Berkeley was the undisputed master of the Channel sailed to and fro in sight of the coasts of Artois Picardy Normandy and Brittany threw shells into Saint Maloes Calais and Dunkirk and burned Granville to the ground The navy of Lewis which five years before had been the most formidable in Europe which had ranged the British seas unopposed from the Downs to the Land s End which had anchored in Torbay and had laid Teignmouth in ashes now gave no sign of existence except by pillaging merchantmen which were unprovided with convoy In this lucrative war the French privateers were towards the close of the summer very successful Several vessels laden with sugar from Barbadoes were captured The losses of the unfortunate East India Company already surrounded by difficulties and impoverished by boundless prodigality in corruption were enormous Five large ships returning from the Eastern seas with cargoes of which the value was popularly estimated at a million fell into the hands of the enemy These misfortunes produced some murmuring on the Royal Exchange But on the whole the temper of the capital and of the nation was better than it had been during some years Meanwhile events which no preceding historian has condescended to mention but which were of far greater importance than the achievements of William s army or of Russell s fleet were taking place in London A great experiment was making A great revolution was in progress Newspapers had made their appearance While the Licensing Act was in force there was no newspaper in England except the London Gazette which was edited by a clerk in the office of the Secretary of State and which contained nothing but what the Secretary of State wished the nation to know There were indeed many periodical papers but none of those papers could be called a newspaper Welwood a zealous Whig published a journal called the Observator but his Observator like the Observator which Lestrange had formerly edited contained not the news but merely dissertations on politics A crazy bookseller named John Dunton published the Athenian Mercury but the Athenian Mercury merely discussed questions of natural philosophy of casuistry and of gallantry A fellow of the Royal Society named John Houghton published what he called a Collection for the Improvement of Industry and Trade But his Collection contained little more than the prices of stocks explanations of the modes of doing business in the City puffs of new projects and advertisements of books quack medicines chocolate spa water civet cats surgeons wanting ships valets wanting masters and ladies wanting husbands If ever he printed any political news he transcribed it from the Gazette The Gazette was so partial and so meagre a chronicle of events that though it had no competitors it had but a small circulation Only eight thousand copies were printed much less than one to each parish in the kingdom In truth a person who had studied the history of his own time only in the Gazette would have been ignorant of many events of the highest importance He would for example have known nothing about the Court Martial on Torrington the Lancashire Trials the burning of the Bishop of Salisbury s Pastoral Letter or the impeachment of the Duke of Leeds But the deficiencies of the Gazette were to a certain extent supplied in London by the coffeehouses and in the country by the newsletters On the third of May sixteen ninety five the law which had subjected the press to a censorship expired Within a fortnight a stanch old Whig named Harris who had in the days of the Exclusion Bill attempted to set up a newspaper entitled Intelligence Domestic and Foreign and who had been speedily forced to relinquish that design announced that the Intelligence Domestic and Foreign suppressed fourteen years before by tyranny would again appear Ten days after the first number of the Intelligence Domestic and Foreign was printed the first number of the English Courant Then came the Packet Boat from Holland and Flanders the Pegasus the London Newsletter the London Post the Flying Post the Old Postmaster the Postboy and the Postman The history of the newspapers of England from that time to the present day is a most interesting and instructive part of the history of the country At first they were small and meanlooking Even the Postboy and the Postman which seem to have been the best conducted and the most prosperous were wretchedly printed on scraps of dingy paper such as would not now be thought good enough for street ballads Only two numbers came out in a week and a number contained little more matter than may be found in a single column of a daily paper of our time What is now called a leading article seldom appeared except when there was a scarcity of intelligence when the Dutch mails were detained by the west wind when the Rapparees were quiet in the Bog of Allen when no stage coach had been stopped by highwaymen when no nonjuring congregation had been dispersed by constables when no ambassador had made his entry with a long train of coaches and six when no lord or poet had been buried in the Abbey and when consequently it was difficult to fill up four scanty pages Yet the leading articles though inserted as it should seem only in the absence of more attractive matter are by no means contemptibly written It is a remarkable fact that the infant newspapers were all on the side of King William and the Revolution This fact may be partly explained by the circumstance that the editors were at first on their good behaviour It was by no means clear that their trade was not in itself illegal The printing of newspapers was certainly not prohibited by any statute But towards the close of the reign of Charles the Second the judges had pronounced that it was a misdemeanour at common law to publish political intelligence without the King s license It is true that the judges who laid down this doctrine were removable at the royal pleasure and were eager on all occasions to exalt the royal prerogative How the question if it were again raised would be decided by Holt and Treby was doubtful and the effect of the doubt was to make the ministers of the Crown indulgent and to make the journalists cautious On neither side was there a wish to bring the question of right to issue The government therefore connived at the publication of the newspapers and the conductors of the newspapers carefully abstained from publishing any thing that could provoke or alarm the government It is true that in one of the earliest numbers of one of the new journals a paragraph appeared which seemed intended to convey an insinuation that the Princess Anne did not sincerely rejoice at the fall of Namur But the printer made haste to atone for his fault by the most submissive apologies During a considerable time the unofficial gazettes though much more garrulous and amusing than the official gazette were scarcely less courtly Whoever examines them will find that the King is always mentioned with profound respect About the debates and divisions of the two Houses a reverential silence is preserved There is much invective but it is almost all directed against the Jacobites and the French It seems certain that the government of William gained not a little by the substitution of these printed newspapers composed under constant dread of the Attorney General for the old newsletters which were written with unbounded license six hundred sixteen The pamphleteers were under less restraint than the journalists yet no person who has studied with attention the political controversies of that time can have failed to perceive that the libels on William s person and government were decidedly less coarse and rancorous during the latter half of his reign than during the earlier half And the reason evidently is that the press which had been fettered during the earlier half of his reign was free during the latter half While the censorship existed no tract blaming even in the most temperate and decorous language the conduct of any public department was likely to be printed with the approbation of the licenser To print such a tract without the approbation of the licenser was illegal In general therefore the respectable and moderate opponents of the Court not being able to publish in the manner prescribed by law and not thinking it right or safe to publish in a manner prohibited by law held their peace and left the business of criticizing the administration to two classes of men fanatical nonjurors who sincerely thought that the Prince of Orange was entitled to as little charity or courtesy as the Prince of Darkness and Grub Street hacks coarseminded badhearted and foulmouthed Thus there was scarcely a single man of judgment temper and integrity among the many who were in the habit of writing against the government Indeed the habit of writing against the government had of itself an unfavourable effect on the character For whoever was in the habit of writing against the government was in the habit of breaking the law and the habit of breaking even an unreasonable law tends to make men altogether lawless However absurd a tariff may be a smuggler is but too likely to be a knave and a ruffian How ever oppressive a game law may be the transition is but too easy from a poacher to a murderer And so though little indeed can be said in favour of the statutes which imposed restraints on literature there was much risk that a man who was constantly violating those statutes would not be a man of high honour and rigid uprightness An author who was determined to print and could not obtain the sanction of the licenser must employ the services of needy and desperate outcasts who hunted by the peace officers and forced to assume every week new aliases and new disguises hid their paper and their types in those dens of vice which are the pest and the shame of great capitals Such wretches as these he must bribe to keep his secret and to run the chance of having their backs flayed and their ears clipped in his stead A man stooping to such companions and to such expedients could hardly retain unimpaired the delicacy of his sense of what was right and becoming The emancipation of the press produced a great and salutary change The best and wisest men in the ranks of the opposition now assumed an office which had hitherto been abandoned to the unprincipled or the hotheaded Tracts against the government were written in a style not misbecoming statesmen and gentlemen and even the compositions of the lower and fiercer class of malecontents became somewhat less brutal and less ribald than in the days of the licensers Some weak men had imagined that religion and morality stood in need of the protection of the licenser The event signally proved that they were in error In truth the censorship had scarcely put any restraint on licentiousness or profaneness The Paradise Lost had narrowly escaped mutilation for the Paradise Lost was the work of a man whose politics were hateful to the ruling powers But Etherege s She Would If She Could Wycherley s Country Wife Dryden s Translations from the Fourth Book of Lucretius obtained the Imprimatur without difficulty for Dryden Etherege and Wycherley were courtiers From the day on which the emancipation of our literature was accomplished the purification of our literature began That purification was effected not by the intervention of senates or magistrates but by the opinion of the great body of educated Englishmen before whom good and evil were set and who were left free to make their choice During a hundred and sixty years the liberty of our press has been constantly becoming more and more entire and during those hundred and sixty years the restraint imposed on writers by the general feeling of readers has been constantly becoming more and more strict At length even that class of works in which it was formerly thought that a voluptuous imagination was privileged to disport itself love songs comedies novels have become more decorous than the sermons of the seventeenth century At this day foreigners who dare not print a word reflecting on the government under which they live are at a loss to understand how it happens that the freest press in Europe is the most prudish On the tenth of October the King leaving his army in winter quarters arrived in England and was received with unwonted enthusiasm During his passage through the capital to his palace the bells of every church were ringing and every street was lighted up It was late before he made his way through the shouting crowds to Kensington But late as it was a council was instantly held An important point was to be decided Should the House of Commons be permitted to sit again or should there be an immediate dissolution The King would probably have been willing to keep that House to the end of his reign But this was not in his power The Triennial Act had fixed the twenty fifth of March as the latest day of the existence of the Parliament If therefore there were not a general election in sixteen ninety five there must be a general election in sixteen ninety six and who could say what might be the state of the country in sixteen ninety six There might be an unfortunate campaign There might be indeed there was but too good reason to believe that there would be a terrible commercial crisis In either case it was probable that there would be much ill humour The campaign of sixteen ninety five had been brilliant the nation was in an excellent temper and William wisely determined to seize the fortunate moment Two proclamations were immediately published One of them announced in the ordinary form that His Majesty had determined to dissolve the old Parliament and had ordered writs to be issued for a new Parliament The other proclamation was unprecedented It signified the royal pleasure to be that every regiment quartered in a place where an election was to be held should march out of that place the day before the nomination and should not return till the people had made their choice From this order which was generally considered as indicating a laudable respect for popular rights the garrisons of fortified towns and castles were necessarily excepted But though William carefully abstained from disgusting the constituent bodies by any thing that could look like coercion or intimidation he did not disdain to influence their votes by milder means He resolved to spend the six weeks of the general election in showing himself to the people of many districts which he had never yet visited He hoped to acquire in this way a popularity which might have a considerable effect on the returns He therefore forced himself to behave with a graciousness and affability in which he was too often deficient and the consequence was that he received at every stage of his progress marks of the good will of his subjects Before he set out he paid a visit in form to his sister in law and was much pleased with his reception The Duke of Gloucester only six years old with a little musket on his shoulder came to meet his uncle and presented arms I am learning my drill the child said that I may help you to beat the French The King laughed much and a few days later rewarded the young soldier with the Garter six hundred seventeen On the seventeenth of October William went to Newmarket now a place rather of business than of pleasure but in the autumns of the seventeenth century the gayest and most luxurious spot in the island It was not unusual for the whole Court and Cabinet to go down to the meetings Jewellers and milliners players and fiddlers venal wits and venal beauties followed in crowds The streets were made impassable by coaches and six In the places of public resort peers flirted with maids of honour and officers of the Life Guards all plumes and gold lace jostled professors in trencher caps and black gowns For the neighbouring University of Cambridge always sent her highest functionaries with loyal addresses and selected her ablest theologians to preach before the Sovereign and his splendid retinue In the wild days of the Restoration indeed the most learned and eloquent divine might fail to draw a fashionable audience particularly if Buckingham announced his intention of holding forth for sometimes His Grace would enliven the dulness of a Sunday morning by addressing to the bevy of fine gentlemen and fine ladies a ribald exhortation which he called a sermon But the Court of William was more decent and the Academic dignitaries were treated with marked respect With lords and ladies from Saint James s and Soho and with doctors from Trinity College and King s College were mingled the provincial aristocracy foxhunting squires and their rosycheeked daughters who had come in queerlooking family coaches drawn by carthorses from the remotest parishes of three or four counties to see their Sovereign The heath was fringed by a wild gipsylike camp of vast extent For the hope of being able to feed on the leavings of many sumptuous tables and to pick up some of the guineas and crowns which the spendthrifts of London were throwing about attracted thousands of peasants from a circle of many miles six hundred eighteen William after holding his court a few days at this joyous place and receiving the homage of Cambridgeshire Huntingdonshire and Suffolk proceeded to Althorpe It seems strange that he should in the course of what was really a canvassing tour have honoured with such a mark of favour a man so generally distrusted and hated as Sunderland But the people were determined to be pleased All Northamptonshire crowded to kiss the royal hand in that fine gallery which had been embellished by the pencil of Vandyke and made classical by the muse of Waller and the Earl tried to conciliate his neighbours by feasting them at eight tables all blazing with plate From Althorpe the King proceeded to Stamford The Earl of Exeter whose princely seat was and still is one of the great sights of England had never taken the oaths and had in order to avoid an interview which must have been disagreeable found some pretext for going up to London but had left directions that the illustrious guest should be received with fitting hospitality William was fond of architecture and of gardening and his nobles could not flatter him more than by asking his opinion about the improvement of their country seats At a time when he had many cares pressing on his mind he took a great interest in the building of Castle Howard and a wooden model of that edifice the finest specimen of a vicious style was sent to Kensington for his inspection We cannot therefore wonder that he should have seen Burleigh with delight He was indeed not content with one view but rose early on the following morning for the purpose of examining the building a second time From Stamford he went on to Lincoln where he was greeted by the clergy in full canonicals by the magistrates in scarlet robes and by a multitude of baronets knights and esquires from all parts of the immense plain which lies between the Trent and the German Ocean After attending divine service in the magnificent cathedral he took his departure and journeyed eastward On the frontier of Nottinghamshire the Lord Lieutenant of the county John Holles Duke of Newcastle with a great following met the royal carriages and escorted them to his seat at Welbeck a mansion surrounded by gigantic oaks which scarcely seem older now than on the day when that splendid procession passed under their shade The house in which William was then during a few hours a guest passed long after his death by female descents from the Holleses to the Harleys and from the Harleys to the Bentincks and now contains the originals of those singularly interesting letters which passed between him and his trusty friend and servant Portland At Welbeck the grandees of the north were assembled The Lord Mayor of York came thither with a train of magistrates and the Archbishop of York with a train of divines William hunted several times in that forest the finest in the kingdom which in old times gave shelter to Robin Hood and Little John and which is now portioned out into the princely domains of Welbeck Thoresby Clumber and Worksop Four hundred gentlemen on horseback partook of his sport The Nottinghamshire squires were delighted to hear him say at table after a noble stag chase that he hoped that this was not the last run which he should have with them and that he must hire a hunting box among their delightful woods He then turned southward He was entertained during one day by the Earl of Stamford at Bradgate the place where Lady Jane Grey sate alone reading the last words of Socrates while the deer was flying through the park followed by the whirlwind of hounds and hunters On the morrow the Lord Brook welcomed his Sovereign to Warwick Castle the finest of those fortresses of the middle ages which have been turned into peaceful dwellings Guy s Tower was illuminated A hundred and twenty gallons of punch were drunk to His Majesty s health and a mighty pile of faggots blazed in the middle of the spacious court overhung by ruins green with the ivy of centuries The next morning the King accompanied by a multitude of Warwickshire gentlemen on horseback proceeded towards the borders of Gloucestershire He deviated from his route to dine with Shrewsbury at a secluded mansion in the Wolds and in the evening went on to Burford The whole population of Burford met him and entreated him to accept a small token of their love Burford was then renowned for its saddles One inhabitant of the town in particular was said by the English to be the best saddler in Europe Two of his masterpieces were respectfully offered to William who received them with much grace and ordered them to be especially reserved for his own use six hundred nineteen At Oxford he was received with great pomp complimented in a Latin oration presented with some of the most beautiful productions of the Academic press entertained with music and invited to a sumptuous feast in the Sheldonian theatre He departed in a few hours pleading as an excuse for the shortness of his stay that he had seen the colleges before and that this was a visit not of curiosity but of kindness As it was well known that he did not love the Oxonians and was not loved by them his haste gave occasion to some idle rumours which found credit with the vulgar It was said that he hurried away without tasting the costly banquet which had been provided for him because he had been warned by an anonymous letter that if he ate or drank in the theatre he was a dead man But it is difficult to believe that a Prince who could scarcely be induced by the most earnest entreaties of his friends to take the most common precautions against assassins of whose designs he had trustworthy evidence would have been scared by so silly a hoax and it is quite certain that the stages of his progress had been marked and that he remained at Oxford as long as was compatible with arrangements previously made six hundred twenty He was welcomed back to his capital by a splendid show which had been prepared at great cost during his absence Sidney now Earl of Romney and Master of the Ordnance had determined to astonish London by an exhibition which had never been seen in England on so large a scale The whole skill of the pyrotechnists of his department was employed to produce a display of fireworks which might vie with any that had been seen in the gardens of Versailles or on the great tank at the Hague Saint James s Square was selected as the place for the spectacle All the stately mansions on the northern eastern and western sides were crowded with people of fashion The King appeared at a window of Romney s drawing room The Princess of Denmark her husband and her court occupied a neighbouring house The whole diplomatic body assembled at the dwelling of the minister of the United Provinces A huge pyramid of flame in the centre of the area threw out brilliant cascades which were seen by hundreds of thousands who crowded the neighbouring streets and parks The States General were informed by their correspondent that great as the multitude was the night had passed without the slightest disturbance six hundred twenty one By this time the elections were almost completed In every part of the country it had been manifest that the constituent bodies were generally zealous for the King and for the war The City of London which had returned four Tories in sixteen ninety returned four Whigs in sixteen ninety five Of the proceedings at Westminster an account more than usually circumstantial has come down to us In sixteen ninety the electors disgusted by the Sacheverell Clause had returned two Tories In sixteen ninety five as soon as it was known that a new Parliament was likely to be called a meeting was held at which it was resolved that a deputation should be sent with an invitation to two Commissioners of the Treasury Charles Montague and Sir Stephen Fox Sir Walter Clarges stood on the Tory interest On the day of nomination near five thousand electors paraded the streets on horseback They were divided into three bands and at the head of each band rode one of the candidates It was easy to estimate at a glance the comparative strength of the parties For the cavalcade which followed Clarges was the least numerous of the three and it was well known that the followers of Montague would vote for Fox and the followers of Fox for Montague The business of the day was interrupted by loud clamours The Whigs cried shame on the Jacobite candidate who wished to make the English go to mass eat frogs and wear wooden shoes The Tories hooted the two placemen who were raising great estates out of the plunder of the poor overburdened nation From words the incensed factions proceeded to blows and there was a riot which was with some difficulty quelled The High Bailiff then walked round the three companies of horsemen and pronounced on the view that Montague and Fox were duly elected A poll was demanded The Tories exerted themselves strenuously Neither money nor ink was spared Clarges disbursed two thousand pounds in a few hours a great outlay in times when the average income of a member of Parliament was not estimated at more than eight hundred a year In the course of the night which followed the nomination broadsides filled with invectives against the two courtly upstarts who had raised themselves by knavery from poverty and obscurity to opulence and power were scattered all over the capital The Bishop of London canvassed openly against the government for the interference of peers in elections had not yet been declared by the Commons to be a breach of privilege But all was vain Clarges was at the bottom of the poll without hope of rising He withdrew and Montague was carried on the shoulders of an immense multitude from Westminster Abbey to his office at Whitehall six hundred twenty two The same feeling exhibited itself in many other places The freeholders of Cumberland instructed their representatives to support the King and to vote whatever supplies might be necessary for the purpose of carrying on the war with vigour and this example was followed by several counties and towns six hundred twenty three Russell did not arrive in England till after the writs had gone out But he had only to choose for what place he would sit His popularity was immense for his villanies were secret and his public services were universally known He had won the battle of La Hogue He had commanded two years in the Mediterranean He had there shut up the French fleets in the harbour of Toulon and had stopped and turned back the French armies in Catalonia He had taken many vessels and among them two ships of the line and he had not during his long absence in a remote sea lost a single vessel either by war or by weather He had made the red cross of Saint George an object of terror to all the princes and commonwealths of Italy The effect of his successes was that embassies were on their way from Florence Genoa and Venice with tardy congratulations to William on his accession Russell s merits artfully magnified by the Whigs made such an impression that he was returned to Parliament not only by Portsmouth where his official situation gave him great influence and by Cambridgeshire where his private property was considerable but also by Middlesex This last distinction indeed he owed chiefly to the name which he bore Before his arrival in England it had been generally thought that two Tories would be returned for the metropolitan county Somers and Shrewsbury were of opinion that the only way to avert such a misfortune was to conjure with the name of the most virtuous of all the martyrs of English liberty They entreated Lady Russell to suffer her eldest son a boy of fifteen who was about to commence his studies at Cambridge to be put in nomination He must they said drop for one day his new title of Marquess of Tavistock and call himself Lord Russell There will be no expense There will be no contest Thousands of gentlemen on horseback will escort him to the hustings nobody will dare to stand against him and he will not only come in himself but bring in another Whig The widowed mother in a letter written with all the excellent sense and feeling which distinguished her refused to sacrifice her son to her party His education she said would be interrupted his head would be turned his triumph would be his undoing Just at this conjuncture the Admiral arrived He made his appearance before the freeholders of Middlesex assembled on the top of Hampstead Hill and was returned without opposition six hundred twenty four Meanwhile several noted malecontents received marks of public disapprobation John Knight the most factious and insolent of those Jacobites who had dishonestly sworn fealty to King William in order to qualify themselves to sit in Parliament ceased to represent the great city of Bristol Exeter the capital of the west was violently agitated It had been long supposed that the ability the eloquence the experience the ample fortune the noble descent of Seymour would make it impossible to unseat him But his moral character which had never stood very high had during the last three or four years been constantly sinking He had been virulent in opposition till he had got a place While he had a place he had defended the most unpopular acts of the government As soon as he was out of place he had again been virulent in opposition His saltpetre contract had left a deep stain on his personal honour Two candidates were therefore brought forward against him and a contest the longest and fiercest of that age fixed the attention of the whole kingdom and was watched with interest even by foreign governments The poll was open five weeks The expense on both sides was enormous The freemen of Exeter who while the election lasted fared sumptuously every day were by no means impatient for the termination of their luxurious carnival They ate and drank heartily they turned out every evening with good cudgels to fight for Mother Church or for King William but the votes came in very slowly It was not till the eve of the meeting of Parliament that the return was made Seymour was defeated to his bitter mortification and was forced to take refuge in the small borough of Totness six hundred twenty five It is remarkable that at this election as at the preceding election John Hampden failed to obtain a seat He had since he ceased to be a member of Parliament been brooding over his evil fate and his indelible shame and occasionally venting his spleen in bitter pamphlets against the government When the Whigs had become predominant at the Court and in the House of Commons when Nottingham had retired when Caermarthen had been impeached Hampden it should seem again conceived the hope that he might play a great part in public life But the leaders of his party apparently did not wish for an ally of so acrimonious and turbulent a spirit He found himself still excluded from the House of Commons He led during a few months a miserable life sometimes trying to forget his cares among the wellbred gamblers and frail beauties who filled the drawingroom of the Duchess of Mazarine and sometimes sunk in religious melancholy The thought of suicide often rose in his mind Soon there was a vacancy in the representation of Buckinghamshire the county which had repeatedly sent himself and his progenitors to Parliament and he expected that he should by the help of Wharton whose dominion over the Buckinghamshire Whigs was absolute be returned without difficulty Wharton however gave his interest to another candidate This was a final blow The town was agitated by the news that John Hampden had cut his throat that he had survived his wound a few hours that he had professed deep penitence for his sins had requested the prayers of Burnet and had sent a solemn warning to the Duchess of Mazarine A coroner s jury found a verdict of insanity The wretched man had entered on life with the fairest prospects He bore a name which was more than noble He was heir to an ample estate and to a patrimony much more precious the confidence and attachment of hundreds of thousands of his countrymen His own abilities were considerable and had been carefully cultivated Unhappily ambition and party spirit impelled him to place himself in a situation full of danger To that danger his fortitude proved unequal He stooped to supplications which saved him and dishonoured him From that moment he never knew peace of mind His temper became perverse and his understanding was perverted by his temper He tried to find relief in devotion and in revenge in fashionable dissipation and in political turmoil But the dark shade never passed away from his mind till in the twelfth year of his humiliation his unhappy life was terminated by an unhappy death six hundred twenty six The result of the general election proved that William had chosen a fortunate moment for dissolving The number of new members was about a hundred and sixty and most of these were known to be thoroughly well affected to the government six hundred twenty seven It was of the highest importance that the House of Commons should at that moment be disposed to cooperate cordially with the King For it was absolutely necessary to apply a remedy to an internal evil which had by slow degrees grown to a fearful magnitude The silver coin which was then the standard coin of the realm was in a state at which the boldest and most enlightened statesmen stood aghast six hundred twenty eight Till the reign of Charles the Second our coin had been struck by a process as old as the thirteenth century Edward the First had invited hither skilful artists from Florence which in his time was to London what London in the time of William the Third was to Moscow During many generations the instruments which were then introduced into our mint continued to be employed with little alteration The metal was divided with shears and afterwards shaped and stamped by the hammer In these operations much was left to the hand and eye of the workman It necessarily happened that some pieces contained a little more and some a little less than the just quantity of silver few pieces were exactly round and the rims were not marked It was therefore in the course of years discovered that to clip the coin was one of the easiest and most profitable kinds of fraud In the reign of Elizabeth it had been thought necessary to enact that the clipper should be as the coiner had long been liable to the penalties of high treason six hundred twenty nine The practice of paring down money however was far too lucrative to be so checked and about the time of the Restoration people began to observe that a large proportion of the crowns halfcrowns and shillings which were passing from hand to hand had undergone some slight mutilation That was a time fruitful of experiments and inventions in all the departments of science A great improvement in the mode of shaping and striking the coin was suggested A mill which to a great extent superseded the human hand was set up in the Tower of London This mill was worked by horses and would doubtless be considered by modern engineers as a rude and feeble machine The pieces which it produced however were among the best in Europe It was not easy to counterfeit them and as their shape was exactly circular and their edges were inscribed with a legend clipping was not to be apprehended six hundred thirty The hammered coins and the milled coins were current together They were received without distinction in public and consequently in private payments The financiers of that age seem to have expected that the new money which was excellent would soon displace the old money which was much impaired Yet any man of plain understanding might have known that when the State treats perfect coin and light coin as of equal value the perfect coin will not drive the light coin out of circulation but will itself be driven out A clipped crown on English ground went as far in the payment of a tax or a debt as a milled crown But the milled crown as soon as it had been flung into the crucible or carried across the Channel became much more valuable than the clipped crown It might therefore have been predicted as confidently as any thing can be predicted which depends on the human will that the inferior pieces would remain in the only market in which they could fetch the same price as the superior pieces and that the superior pieces would take some form or fly to some place in which some advantage could be derived from their superiority six hundred thirty one The politicians of that age however generally overlooked these very obvious considerations They marvelled exceedingly that every body should be so perverse as to use light money in preference to good money In other words they marvelled that nobody chose to pay twelve ounces of silver when ten would serve the turn The horse in the Tower still paced his rounds Fresh waggon loads of choice money still came forth from the mill and still they vanished as fast as they appeared Great masses were melted down great masses exported great masses hoarded but scarcely one new piece was to be found in the till of a shop or in the leathern bag which the farmer carried home from the cattle fair In the receipts and payments of the Exchequer the milled money did not exceed ten shillings in a hundred pounds A writer of that age mentions the case of a merchant who in a sum of thirty five pounds received only a single halfcrown in milled silver Meanwhile the shears of the clippers were constantly at work The comers too multiplied and prospered for the worse the current money became the more easily it was imitated During more than thirty years this evil had gone on increasing At first it had been disregarded but it had at length become an insupportable curse to the country It was to no purpose that the rigorous laws against coining and clipping were rigorously executed At every session that was held at the Old Bailey terrible examples were made Hurdles with four five six wretches convicted of counterfeiting or mutilating the money of the realm were dragged month after month up Holborn Hill On one morning seven men were hanged and a woman burned for clipping But all was vain The gains were such as to lawless spirits seemed more than proportioned to the risks Some clippers were said to have made great fortunes One in particular offered six thousand pounds for a pardon His bribe was indeed rejected but the fame of his riches did much to counteract the effect which the spectacle of his death was designed to produce six hundred thirty two Nay the severity of the punishment gave encouragement to the crime For the practice of clipping pernicious as it was did not excite in the common mind a detestation resembling that with which men regard murder arson robbery nay even theft The injury done by the whole body of clippers to the whole society was indeed immense but each particular act of clipping was a trifle To pass a halfcrown after paring a pennyworth of silver from it seemed a minute an almost imperceptible fault Even while the nation was crying out most loudly under the distress which the state of the currency had produced every individual who was capitally punished for contributing to bring the currency into that state had the general sympathy on his side Constables were unwilling to arrest the offenders Justices were unwilling to commit Witnesses were unwilling to tell the whole truth Juries were unwilling to pronounce the word Guilty It was vain to tell the common people that the mutilators of the coin were causing far more misery than all the highwaymen and housebreakers in the island For great as the aggregate of the evil was only an infinitesimal part of that evil was brought home to the individual malefactor There was therefore a general conspiracy to prevent the law from taking its course The convictions numerous as they might seem were few indeed when compared with the offences and the offenders who were convicted looked on themselves as murdered men and were firm in the belief that their sin if sin it were was as venial as that of a schoolboy who goes nutting in the wood of a neighbour All the eloquence of the ordinary could seldom induce them to conform to the wholesome usage of acknowledging in their dying speeches the enormity of their wickedness six hundred thirty three The evil proceeded with constantly accelerating velocity At length in the autumn of sixteen ninety five it could hardly be said that the country possessed for practical purposes any measure of the value of commodities It was a mere chance whether what was called a shilling was really tenpence sixpence or a groat The results of some experiments which were tried at that time deserve to be mentioned The officers of the Exchequer weighed fifty seven thousand two hundred pounds of hammered money which had recently been paid in The weight ought to have been above two hundred and twenty thousand ounces It proved to be under one hundred and fourteen thousand ounces six hundred thirty four Three eminent London goldsmiths were invited to send a hundred pounds each in current silver to be tried by the balance Three hundred pounds ought to have weighed about twelve hundred ounces The actual weight proved to be six hundred and twenty four ounces The same test was applied in various parts of the kingdom It was found that a hundred pounds which should have weighed about four hundred ounces did actually weigh at Bristol two hundred and forty ounces at Cambridge two hundred and three at Exeter one hundred and eighty and at Oxford only one hundred and sixteen six hundred thirty five There were indeed some northern districts into which the clipped money had only begun to find its way An honest Quaker who lived in one of these districts recorded in some notes which are still extant the amazement with which when he travelled southward shopkeepers and innkeepers stared at the broad and heavy halfcrowns with which he paid his way They asked whence he came and where such money was to be found The guinea which he purchased for twenty two shillings at Lancaster bore a different value at every stage of his journey When he reached London it was worth thirty shillings and would indeed have been worth more had not the government fixed that rate as the highest at which gold should be received in the payment of taxes six hundred thirty six The evils produced by this state of the currency were not such as have generally been thought worthy to occupy a prominent place in history Yet it may well be doubted whether all the misery which had been inflicted on the English nation in a quarter of a century by bad Kings bad Ministers bad Parliaments and bad judges was equal to the misery caused in a single year by bad crowns and bad shillings Those events which furnish the best themes for pathetic or indignant eloquence are not always those which most affect the happiness of the great body of the people The misgovernment of Charles and James gross as it had been had not prevented the common business of life from going steadily and prosperously on While the honour and independence of the State were sold to a foreign power while chartered rights were invaded while fundamental laws were violated hundreds of thousands of quiet honest and industrious families laboured and traded ate their meals and lay down to rest in comfort and security Whether Whigs or Tories Protestants or Jesuits were uppermost the grazier drove his beasts to market the grocer weighed out his currants the draper measured out his broadcloth the hum of buyers and sellers was as loud as ever in the towns the harvest home was celebrated as joyously as ever in the hamlets the cream overflowed the pails of Cheshire the apple juice foamed in the presses of Herefordshire the piles of crockery glowed in the furnaces of the Trent and the barrows of coal rolled fast along the timber railways of the Tyne But when the great instrument of exchange became thoroughly deranged all trade all industry were smitten as with a palsy The evil was felt daily and hourly in almost every place and by almost every class in the dairy and on the threshing floor by the anvil and by the loom on the billows of the ocean and in the depths of the mine Nothing could be purchased without a dispute Over every counter there was wrangling from morning to night The workman and his employer had a quarrel as regularly as the Saturday came round On a fair day or a market day the clamours the reproaches the taunts the curses were incessant and it was well if no booth was overturned and no head broken six hundred thirty seven No merchant would contract to deliver goods without making some stipulation about the quality of the coin in which he was to be paid Even men of business were often bewildered by the confusion into which all pecuniary transactions were thrown The simple and the careless were pillaged without mercy by extortioners whose demands grew even more rapidly than the money shrank The price of the necessaries of life of shoes of ale of oatmeal rose fast The labourer found that the bit of metal which when he received it was called a shilling would hardly when he wanted to purchase a pot of beer or a loaf of rye bread go as far as sixpence Where artisans of more than usual intelligence were collected together in great numbers as in the dockyard at Chatham they were able to make their complaints heard and to obtain some redress six hundred thirty eight But the ignorant and helpless peasant was cruelly ground between one class which would give money only by tale and another which would take it only by weight Yet his sufferings hardly exceeded those of the unfortunate race of authors Of the way in which obscure writers were treated we may easily form a judgment from the letters still extant of Dryden to his bookseller Tonson One day Tonson sends forty brass shillings to say nothing of clipped money Another day he pays a debt with pieces so bad that none of them will go The great poet sends them all back and demands in their place guineas at twenty nine shillings each I expect he says in one letter good silver not such as I have had formerly If you have any silver that will go he says in another letter my wife will be glad of it I lost thirty shillings or more by the last payment of fifty pounds These complaints and demands which have been preserved from destruction only by the eminence of the writer are doubtless merely a fair sample of the correspondence which filled all the mail bags of England during several months In the midst of the public distress one class prospered greatly the bankers and among the bankers none could in skill or in luck bear a comparison with Charles Duncombe He had been not many years before a goldsmith of very moderate wealth He had probably after the fashion of his craft plied for customers under the arcades of the Royal Exchange had saluted merchants with profound bows and had begged to be allowed the honour of keeping their cash But so dexterously did he now avail himself of the opportunities of profit which the general confusion of prices gave to a moneychanger that at the moment when the trade of the kingdom was depressed to the lowest point he laid down near ninety thousand pounds for the estate of Helmsley in the North Riding of Yorkshire That great property had in a troubled time been bestowed by the Commons of England on their victorious general Fairfax and had been part of the dower which Fairfax s daughter had brought to the brilliant and dissolute Buckingham Thither Buckingham having wasted in mad intemperance sensual and intellectual all the choicest bounties of nature and of fortune had carried the feeble ruins of his fine person and of his fine mind and there he had closed his chequered life under that humble roof and on that coarse pallet which the great satirist of the succeeding generation described in immortal verse The spacious domain passed to a new race and in a few years a palace more splendid and costly than had ever been inhabited by the magnificent Villiers rose amidst the beautiful woods and waters which had been his and was called by the once humble name of Duncombe Since the Revolution the state of the currency had been repeatedly discussed in Parliament In sixteen eighty nine a committee of the Commons had been appointed to investigate the subject but had made no report In sixteen ninety another committee had reported that immense quantities of silver were carried out of the country by Jews who it was said would do any thing for profit Schemes were formed for encouraging the importation and discouraging the exportation of the precious metals One foolish bill after another was brought in and dropped At length in the beginning of the year sixteen ninety five the question assumed so serious an aspect that the Houses applied themselves to it in earnest The only practical result of their deliberations however was a new penal law which it was hoped would prevent the clipping of the hammered coin and the melting and exporting of the milled coin It was enacted that every person who informed against a clipper should be entitled to a reward of forty pounds that every clipper who informed against two clippers should be entitled to a pardon and that whoever should be found in possession of silver filings or parings should be burned in the cheek with a redhot iron Certain officers were empowered to search for bullion If bullion were found in a house or on board of a ship the burden of proving that it had never been part of the money of the realm was thrown on the owner If he failed in making out a satisfactory history of every ingot he was liable to severe penalties This Act was as might have been expected altogether ineffective During the following summer and autumn the coins went on dwindling and the cry of distress from every county in the realm became louder and more piercing But happily for England there were among her rulers some who clearly perceived that it was not by halters and branding irons that her decaying industry and commerce could be restored to health The state of the currency had during some time occupied the serious attention of four eminent men closely connected by public and private ties Two of them were politicians who had never in the midst of official and parliamentary business ceased to love and honour philosophy and two were philosophers in whom habits of abstruse meditation had not impaired the homely good sense without which even genius is mischievous in politics Never had there been an occasion which more urgently required both practical and speculative abilities and never had the world seen the highest practical and the highest speculative abilities united in an alliance so close so harmonious and so honourable as that which bound Somers and Montague to Locke and Newton It is much to be lamented that we have not a minute history of the conferences of the men to whom England owed the restoration of her currency and the long series of prosperous years which dates from that restoration It would be interesting to see how the pure gold of scientific truth found by the two philosophers was mingled by the two statesmen with just that quantity of alloy which was necessary for the working It would be curious to study the many plans which were propounded discussed and rejected some as inefficacious some as unjust some as too costly some as too hazardous till at length a plan was devised of which the wisdom was proved by the best evidence complete success Newton has left to posterity no exposition of his opinions touching the currency But the tracts of Locke on this subject are happily still extant and it may be doubted whether in any of his writings even in those ingenious and deeply meditated chapters on language which form perhaps the most valuable part of the Essay on the Human Understanding the force of his mind appears more conspicuously Whether he had ever been acquainted with Dudley North is not known In moral character the two men bore little resemblance to each other They belonged to different parties Indeed had not Locke taken shelter from tyranny in Holland it is by no means impossible that he might have been sent to Tyburn by a jury which Dudley North had packed Intellectually however there was much in common between the Tory and the Whig They had laboriously thought out each for himself a theory of political economy substantially the same with that which Adam Smith afterwards expounded Nay in some respects the theory of Locke and North was more complete and symmetrical than that of their illustrious successor Adam Smith has often been justly blamed for maintaining in direct opposition to all his own principles that the rate of interest ought to be regulated by the State and he is the more blamable because long before he was born both Locke and North had taught that it was as absurd to make laws fixing the price of money as to make laws fixing the price of cutlery or of broadcloth six hundred thirty nine Dudley North died in sixteen ninety three A short time before his death he published without his name a small tract which contains a concise sketch of a plan for the restoration of the currency This plan appears to have been substantially the same with that which was afterwards fully developed and ably defended by Locke One question which was doubtless the subject of many anxious deliberations was whether any thing should be done while the war lasted In whatever way the restoration of the coin might be effected great sacrifices must be made the whole community or by a part of the community And to call for such sacrifices at a time when the nation was already paying taxes such as ten years before no financier would have thought it possible to raise was undoubtedly a course full of danger Timorous politicians were for delay but the deliberate conviction of the great Whig leaders was that something must be hazarded or that every thing was lost Montague in particular is said to have expressed in strong language his determination to kill or cure If indeed there had been any hope that the evil would merely continue to be what it was it might have been wise to defer till the return of peace an experiment which must severely try the strength of the body politic But the evil was one which daily made progress almost visible to the eye There might have been a recoinage in sixteen ninety one with half the risk which must be run in sixteen ninety six and great as would be the risk in sixteen ninety six that risk would be doubled if the coinage were postponed till sixteen ninety eight Those politicians whose voice was for delay gave less trouble than another set of politicians who were for a general and immediate recoinage but who insisted that the new shilling should be worth only ninepence or ninepence halfpenny At the head of this party was William Lowndes Secretary of the Treasury and member of Parliament for the borough of Seaford a most respectable and industrious public servant but much more versed in the details of his office than in the higher parts of political philosophy He was not in the least aware that a piece of metal with the King s head on it was a commodity of which the price was governed by the same laws which govern the price of a piece of metal fashioned into a spoon or a buckle and that it was no more in the power of Parliament to make the kingdom richer by calling a crown a pound than to make the kingdom larger by calling a furlong a mile He seriously believed incredible as it may seem that if the ounce of silver were divided into seven shillings instead of five foreign nations would sell us their wines and their silks for a smaller number of ounces He had a considerable following composed partly of dull men who really believed what he told them and partly of shrewd men who were perfectly willing to be authorised by law to pay a hundred pounds with eighty Had his arguments prevailed the evils of a vast confiscation would have been added to all the other evils which afflicted the nation public credit still in its tender and sickly infancy would have been destroyed and there would have been much risk of a general mutiny of the fleet and army Happily Lowndes was completely refuted by Locke in a paper drawn up for the use of Somers Somers was delighted with this little treatise and desired that it might be printed It speedily became the text book of all the most enlightened politicians in the kingdom and may still be read with pleasure and profit The effect of Locke s forcible and perspicuous reasoning is greatly heightened by his evident anxiety to get at the truth and by the singularly generous and graceful courtesy with which he treats an antagonist of powers far inferior to his own Flamsteed the Astronomer Royal described the controversy well by saying that the point in dispute was whether five was six or only five six hundred forty Thus far Somers and Montague entirely agreed with Locke but as to the manner in which the restoration of the currency ought to be effected there was some difference of opinion Locke recommended as Dudley North had recommended that the King should by proclamation fix a near day after which the hammered money should in all payments pass only by weight The advantages of this plan were doubtless great and obvious It was most simple and at the same time most efficient What searching fining branding hanging burning had failed to do would be done in an instant The clipping of the hammered pieces the melting of the milled pieces would cease Great quantities of good coin would come forth from secret drawers and from behind the panels of wainscots The mutilated silver would gradually flow into the mint and would come forth again in a form which would make mutilation impossible In a short time the whole currency of the realm would be in a sound state and during the progress of this great change there would never at any moment be any scarcity of money These were weighty considerations and to the joint authority of North and Locke on such a question great respect is due Yet it must be owned that their plan was open to one serious objection which did not indeed altogether escape their notice but of which they seem to have thought too lightly The restoration of the currency was a benefit to the whole community On what principle then was the expense of restoring the currency to be borne by a part of the community It was most desirable doubtless that the words pound and shilling should again have a fixed signification that every man should know what his contracts meant and what his property was worth But was it just to attain this excellent end by means of which the effect would be that every farmer who had put by a hundred pounds to pay his rent every trader who had scraped together a hundred pounds to meet his acceptances would find his hundred pounds reduced in a moment to fifty or sixty It was not the fault of such a farmer or of such a trader that his crowns and halfcrowns were not of full weight The government itself was to blame The evil which the State had caused the State was bound to repair and it would evidently have been wrong to throw the charge of the reparation on a particular class merely because that class was so situated that it could conveniently be pillaged It would have been as reasonable to require the timber merchants to bear the whole cost of fitting out the Channel fleet or the gunsmiths to bear the whole cost of supplying arms to the regiments in Flanders as to restore the currency of the kingdom at the expense of those individuals in whose hands the clipped sliver happened at a particular moment to be Locke declared that he regretted the loss which if his advice were taken would fall on the holders of the short money But it appeared to him that the nation must make a choice between evils And in truth it was much easier to lay down the general proposition that the expenses of restoring the currency ought to be borne by the public than to devise any mode in which they could without extreme inconvenience and danger be so borne Was it to be announced that every person who should within a term of a year or half a year carry to the mint a clipped crown should receive in exchange for it a milled crown and that the difference between the value of the two pieces should be made good out of the public purse That would be to offer a premium for clipping The shears would be more busy than ever The short money would every day become shorter The difference which the taxpayers would have to make good would probably be greater by a million at the end of the term than at the beginning and the whole of this million would go to reward malefactors If the time allowed for the bringing in of the hammered coin were much shortened the danger of further clipping would be proportionally diminished but another danger would be incurred The silver would flow into the mint so much faster than it could possibly flow out that there must during some months be a grievous scarcity of money A singularly bold and ingenious expedient occurred to Somers and was approved by William It was that a proclamation should be prepared with great secresy and published at once in all parts of the kingdom This proclamation was to announce that hammered coins would thenceforth pass only by weight But every possessor of such coins was to be invited to deliver them up within three days in a sealed packet to the public authorities The coins were to be examined numbered weighed and returned to the owner with a promissory note entitling him to receive from the Treasury at a future time the difference between the actual quantity of silver in his pieces and the quantity of silver which according to the standard those pieces ought to have contained six hundred forty one Had this plan been adopted an immediate stop would have been put to the clipping the melting and the exporting and the expense of the restoration of the currency would have been borne as was right by the public The inconvenience arising from a scarcity of money would have been of very short duration for the mutilated pieces would have been detained only till they could be told and weighed they would then have been sent back into circulation and the recoinage would have taken place gradually and without any perceptible suspension or disturbance of trade But against these great advantages were to be set off hazards which Somers was prepared to brave but from which it is not strange that politicians of less elevated character should have shrunk The course which he recommended to his colleagues was indeed the safest for the country but was by no means the safest for themselves His plan could not be successful unless the execution were sudden the execution could not be sudden if the previous sanction of Parliament were asked and obtained and to take a step of such fearful importance without the previous sanction of Parliament was to run the risk of censure impeachment imprisonment ruin The King and the Lord Keeper were alone in the Council Even Montague quailed and it was determined to do nothing without the authority of the legislature Montague undertook to submit to the Commons a scheme which was not indeed without dangers and inconveniences but which was probably the best which he could hope to carry On the twenty second of November the Houses met Foley was on that day again chosen Speaker On the following day he was presented and approved The King opened the session with a speech very skilfully framed He congratulated his hearers on the success of the campaign on the Continent That success he attributed in language which must have gratified their feelings to the bravery of the English army He spoke of the evils which had arisen from the deplorable state of the coin and of the necessity of applying a speedy remedy He intimated very plainly his opinion that the expense of restoring the currency ought to be borne by the State but he declared that he referred the whole matter to the wisdom of his Great Council Before he concluded he addressed himself particularly to the newly elected House of Commons and warmly expressed his approbation of the excellent choice which his people had made The speech was received with a low but very significant hum of assent both from above and from below the bar and was as favourably received by the public as by the Parliament six hundred forty two In the Commons an address of thanks was moved by Wharton faintly opposed by Musgrave adopted without a division and carried up by the whole House to Kensington At the palace the loyalty of the crowd of gentlemen showed itself in a way which would now be thought hardly consistent with senatorial gravity When refreshments were handed round in the antechamber the Speaker filled his glass and proposed two toasts the health of King William and confusion to King Lewis and both were drunk with loud acclamations Yet near observers could perceive that though the representatives of the nation were as a body zealous for civil liberty and for the Protestant religion and though they were prepared to endure every thing rather than see their country again reduced to vassalage they were anxious and dispirited All were thinking of the state of the coin all were saying that something must be done and all acknowledged that they did not know what could be done I am afraid said a member who expressed what many felt that the nation can bear neither the disease nor the cure six hundred forty three There was indeed a minority by which the difficulties and dangers of that crisis were seen with malignant delight and of that minority the keenest boldest and most factious leader was Howe whom poverty had made more acrimonious than ever He moved that the House should resolve itself into a Committee on the State of the Nation and the Ministry for that word may now with propriety be used readily consented Indeed the great question touching the currency could not be brought forward more conveniently than in such a Committee When the Speaker had left the chair Howe harangued against the war as vehemently as he had in former years harangued for it He called for peace peace on any terms The nation he said resembled a wounded man fighting desperately on with blood flowing in torrents During a short time the spirit might bear up the frame but faintness must soon come on No moral energy could long hold out against physical exhaustion He found very little support The great majority of his hearers were fully determined to put every thing to hazard rather than submit to France It was sneeringly remarked that the state of his own finances had suggested to him the image of a man bleeding to death and that if a cordial were administered to him in the form of a salary he would trouble himself little about the drained veins of the commonwealth We did not said the Whig orators degrade ourselves by suing for peace when our flag was chased out of our own Channel when Tourville s fleet lay at anchor in Torbay when the Irish nation was in arms against us when every post from the Netherlands brought news of some disaster when we had to contend against the genius of Louvois in the Cabinet and of Luxemburg in the field And are we to turn suppliants now when no hostile squadron dares to show itself even in the Mediterranean when our arms are victorious on the Continent when God has removed the great statesman and the great soldier whose abilities long frustrated our efforts and when the weakness of the French administration indicates in a manner not to be mistaken the ascendency of a female favourite Howe s suggestion was contemptuously rejected and the Committee proceeded to take into consideration the state of the currency six hundred forty four Meanwhile the newly liberated presses of the capital never rested a moment Innumerable pamphlets and broadsides about the coin lay on the counters of the booksellers and were thrust into the hands of members of Parliament in the lobby In one of the most curious and amusing of these pieces Lewis and his ministers are introduced expressing the greatest alarm lest England should make herself the richest country in the world by the simple expedient of calling ninepence a shilling and confidently predicting that if the old standard were maintained there would be another revolution Some writers vehemently objected to the proposition that the public should bear the expense of restoring the currency some urged the government to take this opportunity of assimilating the money of England to the money of neighbouring nations one projector was for coining guilders another for coining dollars six hundred forty five Within the walls of Parliament the debates continued during several anxious days At length Montague after defeating first those who were for letting things remain unaltered till the peace and then those who were for the little shilling carried eleven resolutions in which the outlines of his own plan were set forth It was resolved that the money of the kingdom should be recoined according to the old standard both of weight and of fineness that all the new pieces should be milled that the loss on the clipped pieces should be borne by the public that a time should be fixed after which no clipped money should pass except in payments to the government and that a later time should be fixed after which no clipped money should pass at all What divisions took place in the Committee cannot be ascertained When the resolutions were reported there was one division It was on the question whether the old standard of weight should be maintained The Noes were a hundred and fourteen the Ayes two hundred and twenty five six hundred forty six It was ordered that a bill founded on the resolutions should be brought in A few days later the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained to the Commons in a Committee of Ways and Means the plan by which he proposed to meet the expense of the recoinage It was impossible to estimate with precision the charge of making good the deficiencies of the clipped money But it was certain that at least twelve hundred thousand pounds would be required Twelve hundred thousand pounds the Bank of England undertook to advance on good security It was a maxim received among financiers that no security which the government could offer was so good as the old hearth money had been That tax odious as it was to the great majority of those who paid it was remembered with regret at the Treasury and in the City It occurred to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it might be possible to devise an impost on houses which might be not less productive nor less certain than the hearth money but which might press less heavily on the poor and might be collected by a less vexatious process The number of hearths in a house could not be ascertained without domiciliary visits The windows a collector might count without passing the threshold Montague proposed that the inhabitants of cottages who had been cruelly harassed by the chimney men should be altogether exempted from the new duty His plan was approved by the Committee of Ways and Means and was sanctioned by the House without a division Such was the origin of the window tax a tax which though doubtless a great evil must be considered as a blessing when compared with the curse from which it rescued the nation six hundred forty seven Thus far things had gone smoothly But now came a crisis which required the most skilful steering The news that the Parliament and the government were determined on a reform of the currency produced an ignorant panic among the common people Every man wished to get rid of his clipped crowns and halfcrowns No man liked to take them There were brawls approaching to riots in half the streets of London The Jacobites always full of joy and hope in a day of adversity and public danger ran about with eager looks and noisy tongues The health of King James was publicly drunk in taverns and on ale benches Many members of Parliament who had hitherto supported the government began to waver and that nothing might be wanting to the difficulties of the conjuncture a dispute on a point of privilege arose between the Houses The Recoinage Bill framed in conformity with Montague s resolutions had gone up to the Peers and had come back with amendments some of which in the opinion of the Commons their Lordships had no right to make The emergency was too serious to admit of delay Montague brought in a new bill which was in fact his former bill modified in some points to meet the wishes of the Lords the Lords though not perfectly contented with the new bill passed it without any alteration and the royal assent was immediately given The fourth of May a date long remembered over the whole kingdom and especially in the capital was fixed as the day on which the government would cease to receive the clipped money in payment of taxes six hundred forty eight The principles of the Recoinage Act are excellent But some of the details both of that Act and of a supplementary Act which was passed at a later period of the session seem to prove that Montague had not fully considered what legislation can and what it cannot effect For example he persuaded the Parliament to enact that it should be penal to give or take more than twenty two shillings for a guinea It may be confidently affirmed that this enactment was not suggested or approved by Locke He well knew that the high price of gold was not the evil which afflicted the State but merely a symptom of that evil and that a fall in the price of gold would inevitably follow and could by no human power or ingenuity be made to precede the recoinage of the silver In fact the penalty seems to have produced no effect whatever good or bad Till the milled silver was in circulation the guinea continued in spite of the law to pass for thirty shillings When the milled silver became plentiful the guinea fell not to twenty two shillings which was the highest price allowed by the law but to twenty one shillings and sixpence six hundred forty nine Early in February the panic which had been caused by the first debates on the currency subsided and from that time till the fourth of May the want of money was not very severely felt The recoinage began Ten furnaces were erected in the garden behind the Treasury and every day huge heaps of pared and defaced crowns and shillings were turned into massy ingots which were instantly sent off to the mint in the Tower six hundred fifty With the fate of the law which restored the currency was closely connected the fate of another law which had been several years under the consideration of Parliament and had caused several warm disputes between the hereditary and the elective branch of the legislature The session had scarcely commenced when the Bill for regulating Trials in cases of High Treason was again laid on the table of the Commons Of the debates to which it gave occasion nothing is known except one interesting circumstance which has been preserved by tradition Among those who supported the bill appeared conspicuous a young Whig of high rank of ample fortune and of great abilities which had been assiduously improved by study This was Anthony Ashley Cooper Lord Ashley eldest son of the second Earl of Shaftesbury and grandson of that renowned politician who had in the days of Charles the Second been at one time the most unprincipled of ministers and at another the most unprincipled of demagogues Ashley had just been returned to Parliament for the borough of Poole and was in his twenty fifth year In the course of his speech he faltered stammered and seemed to lose the thread of his reasoning The House then as now indulgent to novices and then as now well aware that on a first appearance the hesitation which is the effect of modesty and sensibility is quite as promising a sign as volubility of utterance and ease of manner encouraged him to proceed How can I Sir said the young orator recovering himself produce a stronger argument in favour of this bill than my own failure My fortune my character my life are not at stake I am speaking to an audience whose kindness might well inspire me with courage And yet from mere nervousness from mere want of practice in addressing large assemblies I have lost my recollection I am unable to go on with my argument How helpless then must be a poor man who never having opened his lips in public is called upon to reply without a moment s preparation to the ablest and most experienced advocates in the kingdom and whose faculties are paralysed by the thought that if he fails to convince his hearers he will in a few hours die on a gallows and leave beggary and infamy to those who are dearest to him It may reasonably be suspected that Ashley s confusion and the ingenious use which he made of it had been carefully premeditated His speech however made a great impression and probably raised expectations which were not fulfilled His health was delicate his taste was refined even to fastidiousness he soon left politics to men whose bodies and minds were of coarser texture than his own gave himself up to mere intellectual luxury lost himself in the mazes of the old Academic philosophy and aspired to the glory of reviving the old Academic eloquence His diction affected and florid but often singularly beautiful and melodious fascinated many young enthusiasts He had not merely disciples but worshippers His life was short but he lived long enough to become the founder of a new sect of English freethinkers diametrically opposed in opinions and feelings to that sect of freethinkers of which Hobbes was the oracle During many years the Characteristics continued to be the Gospel of romantic and sentimental unbelievers while the Gospel of coldblooded and hardheaded unbelievers was the Leviathan The bill so often brought in and so often lost went through the Commons without a division and was carried up to the Lords It soon came back with the long disputed clause altering the constitution of the Court of the Lord High Steward A strong party among the representatives of the people was still unwilling to grant any new privilege to the nobility but the moment was critical The misunderstanding which had arisen between the Houses touching the Recoinage Bill had produced inconveniences which might well alarm even a bold politician It was necessary to purchase concession by concession The Commons by a hundred and ninety two votes to a hundred and fifty agreed to the amendment on which the Lords had during four years so obstinately insisted and the Lords in return immediately passed the Recoinage Bill without any amendment There had been much contention as to the time at which the new system of procedure in cases of high treason should come into operation and the bill had once been lost in consequence of a dispute on this point Many persons were of opinion that the change ought not to take place till the close of the war It was notorious they said that the foreign enemy was abetted by too many traitors at home and at such a time the severity of the laws which protected the commonwealth against the machinations of bad citizens ought not to be relaxed It was at last determined that the new regulations should take effect on the twenty fifth of March the first day according to the old Calendar of the year sixteen ninety six On the twenty first of January the Recoinage Bill and the Bill for regulating Trials in cases of High Treason received the royal assent On the following day the Commons repaired to Kensington on an errand by no means agreeable either to themselves or to the King They were as a body fully resolved to support him at whatever cost and at whatever hazard against every foreign and domestic foe But they were as indeed every assembly of five hundred and thirteen English gentlemen that could by any process have been brought together must have been jealous of the favour which he showed to the friends of his youth He had set his heart on placing the house of Bentinck on a level in wealth and splendour with the houses of Howard and Seymour of Russell and Cavendish Some of the fairest hereditary domains of the Crown had been granted to Portland not without murmuring on the part both of Whigs and Tories Nothing had been done it is true which was not in conformity with the letter of the law and with a long series of precedents Every English sovereign had from time immemorial considered the lands to which he had succeeded in virtue of his office as his private property Every family that had been great in England from the De Veres down to the Hydes had been enriched by royal deeds of gift Charles the Second had carved ducal estates for his bastards out of his hereditary domain Nor did the Bill of Rights contain a word which could be construed to mean that the King was not at perfect liberty to alienate any part of the estates of the Crown At first therefore William s liberality to his countrymen though it caused much discontent called forth no remonstrance from the Parliament But he at length went too far In sixteen ninety five he ordered the Lords of the Treasury to make out a warrant granting to Portland a magnificent estate in Denbighshire This estate was said to be worth more than a hundred thousand pounds The annual income therefore can hardly have been less than six thousand pounds and the annual rent which was reserved to the Crown was only six and eightpence This however was not the worst With the property were inseparably connected extensive royalties which the people of North Wales could not patiently see in the hands of any subject More than a century before Elizabeth had bestowed a part of the same territory on her favourite Leicester On that occasion the population of Denbighshire had risen in arms and after much tumult and several executions Leicester had thought it advisable to resign his mistress s gift back to her The opposition to Portland was less violent but not less effective Some of the chief gentlemen of the principality made strong representations to the ministers through whose offices the warrant had to pass and at length brought the subject under the consideration of the Lower House An address was unanimously voted requesting the King to stop the grant Portland begged that he might not be the cause of a dispute between his master and the Parliament and the King though much mortified yielded to the general wish of the nation six hundred fifty one This unfortunate affair though it terminated without an open quarrel left much sore feeling The King was angry with the Commons and still more angry with the Whig ministers who had not ventured to defend his grant The loyal affection which the Parliament had testified to him during the first days of the session had perceptibly cooled and he was almost as unpopular as he had ever been when an event took place which suddenly brought back to him the hearts of millions and made him for a time as much the idol of the nation as he had been at the end of sixteen eighty eight six hundred fifty two The plan of assassination which had been formed in the preceding spring had been given up in consequence of William s departure for the Continent The plan of insurrection which had been formed in the summer had been given up for want of help from France But before the end of the autumn both plans were resumed William had returned to England and the possibility of getting rid of him by a lucky shot or stab was again seriously discussed The French troops had gone into winter quarters and the force which Charnock had in vain demanded while war was raging round Namur might now be spared without inconvenience Now therefore a plot was laid more formidable than any that had yet threatened the throne and the life of William or rather as has more than once happened in our history two plots were laid one within the other The object of the greater plot was an open insurrection an insurrection which was to be supported by a foreign army In this plot almost all the Jacobites of note were more or less concerned Some laid in arms some bought horses some made lists of the servants and tenants in whom they could place firm reliance The less warlike members of the party could at least take off bumpers to the King over the water and intimate by significant shrugs and whispers that he would not be over the water long It was universally remarked that the malecontents looked wiser than usual when they were sober and bragged more loudly than usual when they were drunk six hundred fifty three To the smaller plot of which the object was the murder of William only a few select traitors were privy Each of these plots was under the direction of a leader specially sent from Saint Germains The more honourable mission was entrusted to Berwick He was charged to communicate with the Jacobite nobility and gentry to ascertain what force they could bring into the field and to fix a time for the rising He was authorised to assure them that the French government was collecting troops and transports at Calais and that as soon as it was known there that a rebellion had broken out in England his father would embark with twelve thousand veteran soldiers and would be among them in a few hours A more hazardous part was assigned to an emissary of lower rank but of great address activity and courage This was Sir George Barclay a Scotch gentleman who had served with credit under Dundee and who when the war in the Highlands had ended had retired to Saint Germains Barclay was called into the royal closet and received his orders from the royal lips He was directed to steal across the Channel and to repair to London He was told that a few select officers and soldiers should speedily follow him by twos and threes That they might have no difficulty in finding him he was to walk on Mondays and Thursdays in the Piazza of Covent Garden after nightfall with a white handkerchief hanging from his coat pocket He was furnished with a considerable sum of money and with a commission which was not only signed but written from beginning to end by James himself This commission authorised the bearer to do from time to time such acts of hostility against the Prince of Orange and that Prince s adherents as should most conduce to the service of the King What explanation of these very comprehensive words was orally given by James we are not informed Lest Barclay s absence from Saint Germains should cause any suspicion it was given out that his loose way of life had made it necessary for him to put himself under the care of a surgeon at Paris six hundred fifty four He set out with eight hundred pounds in his portmanteau hastened to the coast and embarked on board of a privateer which was employed by the Jacobites as a regular packet boat between France and England This vessel conveyed him to a desolate spot in Romney Marsh About half a mile from the landing place a smuggler named Hunt lived on a dreary and unwholesome fen where he had no neighbours but a few rude shepherds His dwelling was singularly well situated for a contraband traffic in French wares Cargoes of Lyons silk and Valenciennes lace sufficient to load thirty packhorses had repeatedly been landed in that dismal solitude without attracting notice But since the Revolution Hunt had discovered that of all cargoes a cargo of traitors paid best His lonely abode became the resort of men of high consideration Earls and Barons Knights and Doctors of Divinity Some of them lodged many days under his roof while waiting for a passage A clandestine post was established between his house and London The couriers were constantly going and returning they performed their journeys up and down on foot but they appeared to be gentlemen and it was whispered that one of them was the son of a titled man The letters from Saint Germains were few and small Those directed to Saint Germains were numerous and bulky they were made up like parcels of millinery and were buried in the morass till they were called for by the privateer Here Barclay landed in January sixteen ninety six and hence he took the road to London He was followed a few days later by a tall youth who concealed his name but who produced credentials of the highest authority This youth too proceeded to London Hunt afterwards discovered that his humble roof had had the honour of sheltering the Duke of Berwick six hundred fifty five The part which Barclay had to perform was difficult and hazardous and he omitted no precaution He had been little in London and his face was consequently unknown to the agents of the government Nevertheless he had several lodgings he disguised himself so well that his oldest friends would not have known him by broad daylight and yet he seldom ventured into the streets except in the dark His chief agent was a monk who under several names heard confessions and said masses at the risk of his neck This man intimated to some of the zealots with whom he consorted a special agent of the royal family was to be spoken with in Covent Garden on certain nights at a certain hour and might be known by certain signs six hundred fifty six In this way Barclay became acquainted with several men fit for his purpose The first persons to whom he fully opened himself were Charnock and Parkyns He talked with them about the plot which they and some of their friends had formed in the preceding spring against the life of William Both Charnock and Parkyns declared that the scheme might easily be executed that there was no want of resolute hearts among the Royalists and that all that was wanting was some sign of His Majesty s approbation Then Barclay produced his commission He showed his two accomplices that James had expressly commanded all good Englishmen not only to rise in arms not only to make war on the usurping government not only to seize forts and towns but also to do from time to time such other acts of hostility against the Prince of Orange as might be for the royal service These words Barclay said plainly authorised an attack on the Prince s person Charnock and Parkyns were satisfied How in truth was it possible for them to doubt that James s confidential agent correctly construed James s expressions Nay how was it possible for them to understand the large words of the commission in any sense but one even if Barclay had not been there to act as commentator If indeed the subject had never been brought under James s consideration it might well be thought that those words had dropped from his pen without any definite meaning But he had been repeatedly apprised that some of his friends in England meditated a deed of blood and that they were waiting only for his approbation They had importuned him to speak one word to give one sign He had long kept silence and now that he had broken silence he merely told them to do what ever might be beneficial to himself and prejudicial to the usurper They had his authority as plainly given as they could reasonably expect to have it given in such a case six hundred fifty seven All that remained was to find a sufficient number of courageous and trustworthy assistants to provide horses and weapons and to fix the hour and the place of the slaughter Forty or fifty men it was thought would be sufficient Those troopers of James s guard who had already followed Barclay across the Channel made up nearly half that number James had himself seen some of these men before their departure from Saint Germains had given them money for their journey had told them by what name each of them was to pass in England had commanded them to act as they should be directed by Barclay and had informed them where Barclay was to be found and by what tokens he was to be known six hundred fifty eight They were ordered to depart in small parties and to assign different reasons for going Some were ill some were weary of the service Cassels one of the most noisy and profane among them announced that since he could not get military promotion he should enter at the Scotch college and study for a learned profession Under such pretexts about twenty picked men left the palace of James made their way by Romney Marsh to London and found their captain walking in the dim lamplight of the Piazza with the handkerchief hanging from his pocket One of these men was Ambrose Rockwood who held the rank of Brigadier and who had a high reputation for courage and honour another was Major John Bernardi an adventurer of Genoese extraction whose name has derived a melancholy celebrity from a punishment so strangely prolonged that it at length shocked a generation which could not remember his crime six hundred fifty nine It was in these adventurers from France that Barclay placed his chief trust In a moment of elation he once called them his Janissaries and expressed a hope that they would get him the George and Garter But twenty more assassins at least were wanted The conspirators probably expected valuable help from Sir John Friend who had received a Colonel s commission signed by James and had been most active in enlisting men and providing arms against the day when the French should appear on the coast of Kent The design was imparted to him but he thought it so rash and so likely to bring reproach and disaster on the good cause that he would lend no assistance to his friends though he kept their secret religiously six hundred sixty Charnock undertook to find eight brave and trusty fellows He communicated the design to Porter not with Barclay s entire approbation for Barclay appears to have thought that a tavern brawler who had recently been in prison for swaggering drunk about the streets and huzzaing in honour of the Prince of Wales was hardly to be trusted with a secret of such fearful import Porter entered into the plot with enthusiasm and promised to bring in others who would be useful Among those whose help he engaged was his servant Thomas Keyes Keyes was a far more formidable conspirator than might have been expected from his station in life The household troops generally were devoted to William but there was a taint of disaffection among the Blues The chief conspirators had already been tampering with some Roman Catholics who were in that regiment and Keyes was excellently qualified to bear a part in this work for he had formerly been trumpeter of the corps and though he had quitted the service he still kept up an acquaintaince with some of the old soldiers in whose company he had lived at free quarter on the Somersetshire farmers after the battle of Sedgemoor Parkyns who was old and gouty could not himself take a share in the work of death But he employed himself in providing horses saddles and weapons for his younger and more active accomplices In this department of business he was assisted by Charles Cranburne a person who had long acted as a broker between Jacobite plotters and people who dealt in cutlery and firearms Special orders were given by Barclay that the swords should be made rather for stabbing than for slashing Barclay himself enlisted Edward Lowick who had been a major in the Irish army and who had since the capitulation of Limerick been living obscurely in London The monk who had been Barclay s first confidant recommended two busy Papists Richard Fisher and Christopher Knightley and this recommendation was thought sufficient Knightley drew in Edward King a Roman Catholic gentleman of hot and restless temper and King procured the assistance of a French gambler and bully named De la Rue six hundred sixty one Meanwhile the heads of the conspiracy held frequent meetings at treason taverns for the purpose of settling a plan of operations Several schemes were proposed applauded and on full consideration abandoned At one time it was thought that an attack on Kensington House at dead of night might probably be successful The outer wall might easily be scaled If once forty armed men were in the garden the palace would soon be stormed or set on fire Some were of opinion that it would be best to strike the blow on a Sunday as William went from Kensington to attend divine service at the chapel of Saint James s Palace The murderers might assemble near the spot where Apsley House and Hamilton Place now stand Just as the royal coach passed out of Hyde Park and was about to enter what has since been called the Green Park thirty of the conspirators well mounted might fall on the guards The guards were ordinarily only five and twenty They would be taken completely by surprise and probably half of them would be shot or cut down before they could strike a blow Meanwhile ten or twelve resolute men on foot would stop the carriage by shooting the horses and would then without difficulty despatch the King At last the preference was given to a plan originally sketched by Fisher and put into shape by Porter William was in the habit of going every Saturday from Kensington to hunt in Richmond Park There was then no bridge over the Thames between London and Kingston The King therefore went in a coach escorted by some of his body guards through Turnham Green to the river There he took boat crossed the water and found another coach and another set of guards ready to receive him on the Surrey side The first coach and the first set of guards awaited his return on the northern bank The conspirators ascertained with great precision the whole order of these journeys and carefully examined the ground on both sides of the Thames They thought that they should attack the King with more advantage on the Middlesex than on the Surrey bank and when he was returning than when he was going For when he was going he was often attended to the water side by a great retinue of lords and gentlemen but on his return he had only his guards about him The place and time were fixed The place was to be a narrow and winding lane leading from the landingplace on the north of the rover to Turnham Green The spot may still be easily found The ground has since been drained by trenches But in the seventeenth century it was a quagmire through which the royal coach was with difficulty tugged at a foot s pace The time was to be the afternoon of Saturday the fifteenth of February On that day the Forty were to assemble in small parties at public houses near the Green When the signal was given that the coach was approaching they were to take horse and repair to their posts As the cavalcade came up this lane Charnock was to attack the guards in the rear Rockwood on one flank Porter on the other Meanwhile Barclay with eight trusty men was to stop the coach and to do the deed That no movement of the King might escape notice two orderlies were appointed to watch the palace One of these men a bold and active Fleming named Durant was especially charged to keep Barclay well informed The other whose business was to communicate with Charnock was a ruffian named Chambers who had served in the Irish army had received a severe wound in the breast at the Boyne and on account of that wound bore a savage personal hatred to William six hundred sixty two While Barclay was making all his arrangements for the assassination Berwick was endeavouring to persuade the Jacobite aristocracy to rise in arms But this was no easy task Several consultations were held and there was one great muster of the party under the pretence of a masquerade for which tickets were distributed among the initiated at one guinea each six hundred sixty three All ended however in talking singing and drinking Many men of rank and fortune indeed declared that they would draw their swords for their rightful Sovereign as soon as their rightful Sovereign was in the island with a French army and Berwick had been empowered to assure there that a French army should be sent as soon as they had drawn the sword But between what they asked and what he was authorised to grant there was a difference which admitted of no compromise Lewis situated as he was would not risk ten or twelve thousand excellent soldiers on the mere faith of promises Similar promises had been made in sixteen ninety and yet when the fleet of Tourville had appeared on the coast of Devonshire the western counties had risen as one man in defence of the government and not a single malecontent had dared to utter a whisper in favour of the invaders Similar promises had been made in sixteen ninety two and to the confidence which had been placed in those promises was to be attributed the great disaster of La Hogue The French King would not be deceived a third time He would gladly help the English royalists but he must first see them help themselves There was much reason in this and there was reason also in what the Jacobites urged on the other side If they said they were to rise without a single disciplined regiment to back them against an usurper supported by a regular army they should all be cut to pieces before the news that they were up could reach Versailles As Berwick could hold out no hope that there would be an invasion before there was an insurrection and as his English friends were immovable in their determination that there should be no insurrection till there was an invasion he had nothing more to do here and became impatient to depart He was the more impatient to depart because the fifteenth of February drew near For he was in constant communication with Barclay and was perfectly apprised of all the details of the crime which was to be perpetrated on that day He was generally considered as a man of sturdy and even ungracious integrity But to such a degree had his sense of right and wrong been perverted by his zeal for the interests of his family and by his respect for the lessons of his priests that he did not as he has himself ingenuously confessed think that he lay under any obligation to dissuade the assassins from the execution of their purpose He had indeed only one objection to their design and that objection he kept to himself It was simply this that all who were concerned were very likely to be hanged That however was their affair and if they chose to run such a risk in the good cause it was not his business to discourage them His mission was quite distinct from theirs he was not to act with them and he had no inclination to suffer with then He therefore hastened down to Romney Marsh and crossed to Calais six hundred sixty four At Calais he found preparations making for a descent on Kent Troops filled the town transports filled the port Boufflers had been ordered to repair thither from Flanders and to take the command James himself was daily expected In fact he had already left Saint Germains Berwick however would not wait He took the road to Paris met his father at Clermont and made a full report of the state of things in England His embassy had failed the Royalist nobility and gentry seemed resolved not to rise till a French army was in the island but there was still a hope news would probably come within a few days that the usurper was no more and such news would change the whole aspect of affairs James determined to go on to Calais and there to await the event of Barclay s plot Berwick hastened to Versailles for the purpose of giving explanations to Lewis What the nature of the explanations was we know from Berwick s own narrative He plainly told the French King that a small band of loyal men would in a short time make an attempt on the life of the great enemy of France The next courier might bring tidings of an event which would probably subvert the English government and dissolve the European coalition It might have been thought that a prince who ostentatiously affected the character of a devout Christian and of a courteous knight would instantly have taken measures for conveying to his rival a caution which perhaps might still arrive in time and would have severely reprimanded the guests who had so grossly abused his hospitality Such however was not the conduct of Lewis Had he been asked to give his sanction to a murder he would probably have refused with indignation But he was not moved to indignation by learning that without his sanction a crime was likely to be committed which would be far more beneficial to his interests than ten such victories as that of Landen He sent down orders to Calais that his fleet should be in such readiness as might enable him to take advantage of the great crisis which he anticipated At Calais James waited with still more impatience for the signal that his nephew was no more That signal was to be given by a fire of which the fuel was already prepared on the cliffs of Kent and which would be visible across the straits six hundred sixty five But a peculiar fate has in our country always attended such conspiracies as that of Barclay and Charnock The English regard assassination and have during some ages regarded it with a loathing peculiar to themselves So English indeed is this sentiment that it cannot even now be called Irish and till a recent period it was not Scotch In Ireland to this day the villain who shoots at his enemy from behind a hedge is too often protected from justice by public sympathy In Scotland plans of assassination were often during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries successfully executed though known to great numbers of persons The murders of Beaton of Rizzio of Darnley of Murray of Sharpe are conspicuous instances The royalists who murdered Lisle in Switzerland were Irishmen the royalists who murdered Ascham at Madrid were Irishmen the royalists who murdered Dorislaus at the Hague were Scotchmen In England as soon as such a design ceases to be a secret hidden in the recesses of one gloomy and ulcerated heart the risk of detection and failure becomes extreme Felton and Bellingham reposed trust in no human being and they were therefore able to accomplish their evil purposes But Babington s conspiracy against Elizabeth Fawkes s conspiracy against James Gerard s conspiracy against Cromwell the Rye House conspiracy the Cato Street conspiracy were all discovered frustrated and punished In truth such a conspiracy is here exposed to equal danger from the good and from the bad qualities of the conspirators Scarcely any Englishman not utterly destitute of conscience and honour will engage in a plot for slaying an unsuspecting fellow creature and a wretch who has neither conscience nor honour is likely to think much on the danger which he incurs by being true to his associates and on the rewards which he may obtain by betraying them There are it is true persons in whom religious or political fanaticism has destroyed all moral sensibility on one particular point and yet has left that sensibility generally unimpaired Such a person was Digby He had no scruple about blowing King Lords and Commons into the air Yet to his accomplices he was religiously and chivalrously faithful nor could even the fear of the rack extort from him one word to their prejudice But this union of depravity and heroism is very rare The vast majority of men are either not vicious enough or not virtuous enough to be loyal and devoted members of treacherous and cruel confederacies and if a single member should want either the necessary vice or the necessary virtue the whole confederacy is in danger To bring together in one body forty Englishmen all hardened cutthroats and yet all so upright and generous that neither the hope of opulence nor the dread of the gallows can tempt any one of them to be false to the rest has hitherto been found and will it is to be hoped always be found impossible There were among Barclay s followers both men too bad and men too good to be trusted with such a secret as his The first whose heart failed him was Fisher Even before the time and place of the crime had been fixed he obtained an audience of Portland and told that lord that a design was forming against the King s life Some days later Fisher came again with more precise intelligence But his character was not such as entitled him to much credit and the knavery of Fuller of Young of Whitney and of Taffe had made men of sense slow to believe stories of plots Portland therefore though in general very easily alarmed where the safety of his master and friend was concerned seems to have thought little about the matter But on the evening of the fourteenth of February he received a visit from a person whose testimony he could not treat lightly This was a Roman Catholic gentleman of known courage and honour named Pendergrass He had on the preceding day come up to town from Hampshire in consequence of a pressing summons from Porter who dissolute and unprincipled as he was had to Pendergrass been a most kind friend indeed almost a father In a Jacobite insurrection Pendergrass would probably have been one of the foremost But he learned with horror that he was expected to bear a part in a wicked and shameful deed He found himself in one of those situations which most cruelly torture noble and sensitive natures What was he to do Was he to commit a murder Was he to suffer a murder which he could prevent to be committed Yet was he to betray one who however culpable had loaded him with benefits Perhaps it might be possible to save William without harming Porter Pendergrass determined to make the attempt My Lord he said to Portland as you value King William s life do not let him hunt tomorrow He is the enemy of my religion yet my religion constrains me to give him this caution But the names of the conspirators I am resolved to conceal some of them are my friends one of them especially is my benefactor and I will not betray them Portland went instantly to the King but the King received the intelligence very coolly and seemed determined not to be frightened out of a good day s sport by such an idle story Portland argued and implored in vain He was at last forced to threaten that he would immediately make the whole matter public unless His Majesty would consent to remain within doors during the next day and this threat was successful six hundred sixty six Saturday the fifteenth came The Forty were all ready to mount when they received intelligence from the orderlies who watched Kensington House that the King did not mean to hunt that morning The fox said Chambers with vindictive bitterness keeps his earth Then he opened his shirt showed the great scar in his breast and vowed revenge on William The first thought of the conspirators was that their design had been detected But they were soon reassured It was given out that the weather had kept the King at home and indeed the day was cold and stormy There was no sign of agitation at the palace No extraordinary precaution was taken No arrest was made No ominous whisper was heard at the coffeehouses The delay was vexatious but Saturday the twenty second would do as well But before Saturday the twenty second arrived a third informer De la Rue had presented himself at the palace His way of life did not entitle him to much respect but his story agreed so exactly with what had been said by Fisher and Pendergrass that even William began to believe that there was real danger Very late in the evening of Friday the twenty first Pendergrass who had as yet disclosed much less than either of the other informers but whose single word was worth much more than their joint oath was sent for to the royal closet The faithful Portland and the gallant Cutts were the only persons who witnessed the singular interview between the King and his generous enemy William with courtesy and animation which he rarely showed but which he never showed without making a deep impression urged Pendergrass to speak out You are a man of true probity and honour I am deeply obliged to you but you must feel that the same considerations which have induced you to tell us so much ought to induce you to tell us something more The cautions which you have as yet given can only make me suspect every body that comes near me They are sufficient to embitter my life but not sufficient to preserve it You must let me know the names of these men During more than half an hour the King continued to entreat and Pendergrass to refuse At last Pendergrass said that he would give the information which was required if he could be assured that it would be used only for the prevention of the crime and not for the destruction of the criminals I give you my word of honour said William that your evidence shall not be used against any person without your own free consent It was long past midnight when Pendergrass wrote down the names of the chief conspirators While these things were passing at Kensington a large party of the assassins were revelling at a Jacobite tavern in Maiden Lane Here they received their final orders for the morrow Tomorrow or never said King Tomorrow boys cried Cassels with a curse we shall have the plunder of the field The morrow came All was ready the horses were saddled the pistols were loaded the swords were sharpened the orderlies were on the alert they early sent intelligence from the palace that the King was certainly going a hunting all the usual preparations had been made a party of guards had been sent round by Kingston Bridge to Richmond the royal coaches each with six horses had gone from the stables at Charing Cross to Kensington The chief murderers assembled in high glee at Porter s lodgings Pendergrass who by the King s command appeared among them was greeted with ferocious mirth Pendergrass said Porter you are named one of the eight who are to do his business I have a musquetoon for you that will carry eight balls mister Pendergrass said King pray do not be afraid of smashing the glass windows From Porter s lodgings the party adjourned to the Blue Posts in Spring Gardens where they meant to take some refreshment before they started for Turnham Green They were at table when a message came from an orderly that the King had changed his mind and would not hunt and scarcely had they recovered from their first surprise at this ominous news when Keyes who had been out scouting among his old comrades arrived with news more ominous still The coaches have returned to Charing Cross The guards that were sent round to Richmond have just come back to Kensington at full gallop the flanks of the horses all white with foam I have had a word with one of the Blues He told me that strange things are muttered Then the countenances of the assassins fell and their hearts died within them Porter made a feeble attempt to disguise his uneasiness He took up an orange and squeezed it What cannot be done one day may be done another Come gentlemen before we part let us have one glass to the squeezing of the rotten orange The squeezing of the rotten orange was drunk and the company dispersed six hundred sixty seven A few hours elapsed before all the conspirators abandoned all hope Some of them derived comfort from a report that the King had taken physic and that this was his only reason for not going to Richmond If it were so the blow might still be struck Two Saturdays had been unpropitious But Sunday was at hand One of the plans which had formerly been discussed and abandoned might be resumed The usurper might be set upon at Hyde Park Corner on his way to his chapel Charnock was ready for any enterprise however desperate If the hunt was up it was better to die biting and scratching to the last than to be worried without resistance or revenge He assembled some of his accomplices at one of the numerous houses at which he had lodgings and plied there hard with healths to the King to the Queen to the Prince and to the Grand Monarch as they called Lewis But the terror and dejection of the gang were beyond the power of wine and so many had stolen away that those who were left could effect nothing In the course of the afternoon it was known that the guards had been doubled at the palace and soon after nightfall messengers from the Secretary of State s office were hurrying to and fro with torches through the streets accompanied by files and musketeers Before the dawn of Sunday Charnock was in custody A little later Rockwood and Bernardi were found in bed at a Jacobite alehouse on Tower Hill Seventeen more traitors were seized before noon and three of the Blues were put under arrest That morning a Council was held and as soon as it rose an express was sent off to call home some regiments from Flanders Dorset set out for Sussex of which he was Lord Lieutenant Romney who was Warden of the Cinque Ports started for the coast of Kent and Russell hastened down the Thames to take the command of the fleet In the evening the Council sate again Some of the prisoners were examined and committed The Lord Mayor was in attendance was informed of what had been discovered and was specially charged to look well to the peace of the capital six hundred sixty eight On Monday morning all the trainbands of the City were under arms The King went in state to the House of Lords sent for the Commons and from the throne told the Parliament that but for the protection of a gracious Providence he should at that moment have been a corpse and the kingdom would have been invaded by a French army The danger of invasion he added was still great but he had already given such orders as would he hoped suffice for the protection of the realm Some traitors were in custody warrants were out against others he should do his part in this emergency and he relied on the Houses to do theirs six hundred sixty nine The Houses instantly voted a joint address in which they thankfully acknowledged the divine goodness which had preserved him to his people and implored him to take more than ordinary care of his person They concluded by exhorting him to seize and secure all persons whom he regarded as dangerous On the same day two important bills were brought into the Commons By one the Habeas Corpus Act was suspended The other provided that the Parliament should not be dissolved by the death of William Sir Rowland Gwyn an honest country gentleman made a motion of which he did not at all foresee the important consequences He proposed that the members should enter into an association for the defence of their Sovereign and their country Montague who of all men was the quickest at taking and improving a hint saw how much such an association would strengthen the government and the Whig party six hundred seventy An instrument was immediately drawn tip by which the representatives of the people each for himself solemnly recognised William as rightful and lawful King and bound themselves to stand by him and by each other against James and James s adherents Lastly they vowed that if His Majesty s life should be shortened by violence they would avenge him signally on his murderers and would with one heart strenuously support the order of succession settled by the Bill of Rights It was ordered that the House should be called over the next morning six hundred seventy one The attendance was consequently great the Association engrossed on parchment was on the table and the members went up county by county to sign their names six hundred seventy two The King s speech the joint address of both Houses the Association framed by the Commons and a proclamation containing a list of the conspirators and offering a reward of a thousand pounds for the apprehension of any one of them were soon cried in all the streets of the capital and carried out by all the postbags Wherever the news came it raised the whole country Those two hateful words assassination and invasion acted like a spell No impressment was necessary The seamen came forth from their hiding places by thousands to man the fleet Only three days after the King had appealed to the nation Russell sailed out of the Thames with one great squadron Another was ready for action at Spithead The militia of all the maritime counties from the Wash to the Land s End was under arms For persons accused of offences merely political there was generally much sympathy But Barclay s assassins were hunted like wolves by the whole population The abhorrence which the English have through many generations felt for domiciliary visits and for all those impediments which the police of continental states throws in the way of travellers was for a time suspended The gates of the City of London were kept many hours closed while a strict search was made within The magistrates of almost every walled town in the kingdom followed the example of the capital On every highway parties of armed men were posted with orders to stop passengers of suspicious appearance During a few days it was hardly possible to perform a journey without a passport or to procure posthorses without the authority of a justice of the peace Nor was any voice raised against these precautions The common people indeed were if possible more eager than the public functionaries to bring the traitors to justice This eagerness may perhaps be in part ascribed to the great rewards promised by the royal proclamation The hatred which every good Protestant felt for Popish cutthroats was not a little strengthened by the songs in which the street poets celebrated the lucky hackney coachman who had caught his traitor had received his thousand pounds and had set up as a gentleman six hundred seventy three The zeal of the populace could in some places hardly be kept within the limits of the law At the country seat of Parkyns in Warwickshire arms and accoutrements sufficient to equip a troop of cavalry were found As soon as this was known a furious mob assembled pulled down the house and laid the gardens utterly waste six hundred seventy four Parkyns himself was tracked to a garret in the Temple Porter and Keyes who had fled into Surrey were pursued by the hue and cry stopped by the country people near Leatherhead and after some show of resistance secured and sent to prison Friend was found hidden in the house of a Quaker Knightley was caught in the dress of a fine lady and recognised in spite of his patches and paint In a few days all the chief conspirators were in custody except Barclay who succeeded in making his escape to France At the same time some notorious malecontents were arrested and were detained for a time on suspicion Old Roger Lestrange now in his eightieth year was taken up Ferguson was found hidden under a bed in Gray s Inn Lane and was to the general joy locked up in Newgate six hundred seventy five Meanwhile a special commission was issued for the trial of the traitors There was no want of evidence For of the conspirators who had been seized ten or twelve were ready to save themselves by bearing witness against their associates None had been deeper in guilt and none shrank with more abject terror from death than Porter The government consented to spare him and thus obtained not only his evidence but the much more respectable evidence of Pendergrass Pendergrass was in no danger he had committed no offence his character was fair and his testimony would have far greater weight with a jury than the testimony of a crowd of approvers swearing for their necks But he had the royal word of honour that he should not be a witness without his own consent and he was fully determined not to be a witness unless he were assured of Porter s safety Porter was now safe and Pendergrass had no longer any scruple about relating the whole truth Charnock King and Keyes were set first to the bar The Chiefs of the three Courts of Common Law and several other judges were on the bench and among the audience were many members of both Houses of Parliament It was the eleventh of March The new Act which regulated the procedure in cases of high treason was not to come into force till the twenty fifth The culprits urged that as the Legislature had by passing that Act recognised the justice of allowing them to see their indictment and to avail themselves of the assistance of an advocate the tribunal ought either to grant them what the highest authority had declared to be a reasonable indulgence or to defer the trial for a fortnight The judges however would consent to no delay They have therefore been accused by later writers of using the mere letter of the law in order to destroy men who if that law had been construed according to its spirit might have had some chance of escape This accusation is unjust The judges undoubtedly carried the real intention of the Legislature into effect and for whatever injustice was committed the Legislature and not the judges ought to be held accountable The words twenty fifth of March had not slipped into the Act by mere inadvertence All parties in Parliament had long been agreed as to the principle of the new regulations The only matter about which there was any dispute was the time at which those regulations should take effect After debates extending through several sessions after repeated divisions with various results a compromise had been made and it was surely not for the Courts to alter the terms of that compromise It may indeed be confidently affirmed that if the Houses had foreseen the Assassination Plot they would have fixed not an earlier but a later day for the commencement of the new system Undoubtedly the Parliament and especially the Whig party deserved serious blame For if the old rules of procedure gave no unfair advantage to the Crown there was no reason for altering them and if as was generally admitted they did give an unfair advantage to the Crown and that against a defendant on trial for his life they ought not to have been suffered to continue in force a single day But no blame is due to the tribunals for not acting in direct opposition both to the letter and to the spirit of the law The government might indeed have postponed the trials till the new Act came into force and it would have been wise as well as right to do so for the prisoners would have gained nothing by the delay The case against them was one on which all the ingenuity of the Inns of Court could have made no impression Porter Pendergrass De la Rue and others gave evidence which admitted of no answer Charnock said the very little that he had to say with readiness and presence of mind The jury found all the defendants guilty It is not much to the honour of that age that the announcement of the verdict was received with loud huzzas by the crowd which surrounded the Courthouse Those huzzas were renewed when the three unhappy men having heard their doom were brought forth under a guard six hundred seventy six Charnock had hitherto shown no sign of flinching but when he was again in his cell his fortitude gave way He begged hard for mercy He would be content he said to pass the rest of his days in an easy confinement He asked only for his life In return for his life he promised to discover all that he knew of the schemes of the Jacobites against the government If it should appear that he prevaricated or that he suppressed any thing he was willing to undergo the utmost rigour of the law This offer produced much excitement and some difference of opinion among the councillors of William But the King decided as in such cases he seldom failed to decide wisely and magnanimously He saw that the discovery of the Assassination Plot had changed the whole posture of affairs His throne lately tottering was fixed on an immovable basis His popularity had risen impetuously to as great a height as when he was on his march from Torbay to London Many who had been out of humour with his administration and who had in their spleen held some communication with Saint Germains were shocked to find that they had been in some sense leagued with murderers He would not drive such persons to despair He would not even put them to the blush Not only should they not be punished they should not undergo the humiliation of being pardoned He would not know that they had offended Charnock was left to his fate six hundred seventy seven When he found that he had no chance of being received as a deserter he assumed the dignity of a martyr and played his part resolutely to the close That he might bid farewell to the world with a better grace he ordered a fine new coat to be hanged in and was very particular on his last day about the powdering and curling of his wig six hundred seventy eight Just before he was turned off he delivered to the Sheriffs a paper in which he avowed that he had conspired against the life of the Prince of Orange but solemnly denied that James had given any commission authorising assassination The denial was doubtless literally correct but Charnock did not deny and assuredly could not with truth have denied that he had seen a commission written and signed by James and containing words which might without any violence be construed and which were by all to whom they were shown actually construed to authorise the murderous ambuscade of Turnham Green Indeed Charnock in another paper which is still in existence but has never been printed held very different language He plainly said that for reasons too obvious to be mentioned he could not tell the whole truth in the paper which he had delivered to the Sheriffs He acknowledged that the plot in which he had been engaged seemed even to many loyal subjects highly criminal They called him assassin and murderer Yet what had he done more than had been done by Mucius Scaevola Nay what had he done more than had been done by every body who bore arms against the Prince of Orange If an array of twenty thousand men had suddenly landed in England and surprised the usurper this would have been called legitimate war Did the difference between war and assassination depend merely on the number of persons engaged What then was the smallest number which could lawfully surprise an enemy Was it five thousand or a thousand or a hundred Jonathan and his armourbearer were only two Yet they made a great slaughter of the Philistines Was that assassination It cannot said Charnock be the mere act it must be the cause that makes killing assassination It followed that it was not assassination to kill one and here the dying man gave a loose to all his hatred who had declared a war of extermination against loyal subjects who hung drew and quartered every man who stood up for the right and who had laid waste England to enrich the Dutch Charnock admitted that his enterprise would have been unjustifiable if it had not been authorised by James but he maintained that it had been authorised not indeed expressly but by implication His Majesty had indeed formerly prohibited similar attempts but had prohibited them not as in themselves criminal but merely as inexpedient at this or that conjuncture of affairs Circumstances had changed The prohibition might therefore reasonably be considered as withdrawn His Majesty s faithful subjects had then only to look to the words of his commission and those words beyond all doubt fully warranted an attack on the person of the usurper six hundred seventy nine King and Keyes suffered with Charnock King behaved with firmness and decency He acknowledged his crime and said that he repented of it He thought it due to the Church of which he was a member and on which his conduct had brought reproach to declare that he had been misled not by any casuistry about tyrannicide but merely by the violence of his own evil passions Poor Keyes was in an agony of terror His tears and lamentations moved the pity of some of the spectators It was said at the time and it has often since been repeated that a servant drawn into crime by a master was a proper object of royal clemency But those who have blamed the severity with which Keyes was treated have altogether omitted to notice the important circumstance which distinguished his case from that of every other conspirator He had been one of the Blues He had kept up to the last an intercourse with his old comrades On the very day fixed for the murder he had contrived to mingle with them and to pick up intelligence from them The regiment had been so deeply infected with disloyalty that it had been found necessary to confine some men and to dismiss many more Surely if any example was to be made it was proper to make an example of the agent by whose instrumentality the men who meant to shoot the King communicated with the men whose business was to guard him Friend was tried next His crime was not of so black a dye as that of the three conspirators who had just suffered He had indeed invited foreign enemies to invade the realm and had made preparations for joining them But though he had been privy to the design of assassination he had not been a party to it His large fortune however and the use which he was well known to have made of it marked him out as a fit object for punishment He like Charnock asked for counsel and like Charnock asked in vain The judges could not relax the law and the Attorney General would not postpone the trial The proceedings of that day furnish a strong argument in favour of the Act from the benefit of which Friend was excluded It is impossible to read them over at this distance of time without feeling compassion for a silly ill educated man unnerved by extreme danger and opposed to cool astute and experienced antagonists Charnock had defended himself and those who were tried with him as well as any professional advocate could have done But poor Friend was as helpless as a child He could do little more than exclaim that he was a Protestant and that the witnesses against him were Papists who had dispensations from their priests for perjury and who believed that to swear away the lives of heretics was a meritorious work He was so grossly ignorant of law and history as to imagine that the statute of treasons passed in the reign of Edward the Third at a time when there was only one religion in Western Europe contained a clause providing that no Papist should be a witness and actually forced the Clerk of the Court to read the whole Act from beginning to end About his guilt it was impossible that there could be a doubt in any rational mind He was convicted and he would have been convicted if he had been allowed the privileges for which he asked Parkyns came next He had been deeply concerned in the worst part of the plot and was in one respect less excusable than any of his accomplices for they were all nonjurors and he had taken the oaths to the existing government He too insisted that he ought to be tried according to the provisions of the new Act But the counsel for the Crown stood on their extreme right and his request was denied As he was a man of considerable abilities and had been bred to the bar he probably said for himself all that counsel could have said for him and that all amounted to very little He was found guilty and received sentence of death on the evening of the twenty fourth of March within six hours of the time when the law of which he had vainly demanded the benefit was to come into force six hundred eighty The execution of the two knights was eagerly expected by the population of London The States General were informed by their correspondent that of all sights that in which the English most delighted was a hanging and that of all hangings within the memory of the oldest man that of Friend and Parkyns excited the greatest interest The multitude had been incensed against Friend by reports touching the exceeding badness of the beer which he brewed It was even rumoured that he had in his zeal for the Jacobite cause poisoned all the casks which he had furnished to the navy An innumerable crowd accordingly assembled at Tyburn Scaffolding had been put up which formed an immense amphitheatre round the gallows On this scaffolding the wealthier spectators stood row above row and expectation was at the height when it was announced that the show was deferred The mob broke up in bad humour and not without many fights between those who had given money for their places and those who refused to return it six hundred eighty one The cause of this severe disappointment was a resolution suddenly passed by the Commons A member had proposed that a Committee should be sent to the Tower with authority to examine the prisoners and to hold out to them the hope that they might by a full and ingenuous confession obtain the intercession of the House The debate appears from the scanty information which has come down to us to have been a very curious one Parties seemed to have changed characters It might have been expected that the Whigs would have been inexorably severe and that if there was any tenderness for the unhappy men that tenderness would have been found among the Tories But in truth many of the Whigs hoped that they might by sparing two criminals who had no power to do mischief be able to detect and destroy numerous criminals high in rank and office On the other hand every man who had ever had any dealings direct or indirect with Saint Germains or who took an interest in any person likely to have had such dealings looked forward with dread to the disclosures which the captives might under the strong terrors of death be induced to make Seymour simply because he had gone further in treason than almost any other member of the House was louder than any other member of the House in exclaiming against all indulgence to his brother traitors Would the Commons usurp the most sacred prerogative of the Crown It was for His Majesty and not for them to judge whether lives justly forfeited could be without danger spared The Whigs however carried their point A Committee consisting of all the Privy Councillors in the House set off instantly for Newgate Friend and Parkyns were interrogated but to no purpose They had after sentence had been passed on them shown at first some symptoms of weakness but their courage had been fortified by the exhortations of nonjuring divines who had been admitted to the prison The rumour was that Parkyns would have given way but for the entreaties of his daughter who adjured him to suffer like a man for the good cause The criminals acknowledged that they had done the acts of which they had been convicted but with a resolution which is the more respectable because it seems to have sprung not from constitutional hardihood but from sentiments of honour and religion refused to say any thing which could compromise others six hundred eighty two In a few hours the crowd again assembled at Tyburn and this time the sightseers were not defrauded of their amusement They saw indeed one sight which they had not expected and which produced a greater sensation than the execution itself Jeremy Collier and two other nonjuring divines of less celebrity named Cook and Snatt had attended the prisoners in Newgate and were in the cart under the gallows When the prayers were over and just before the hangman did his office the three schismatical priests stood up and laid their hands on the heads of the dying men who continued to kneel Collier pronounced a form of absolution taken from the service for the Visitation of the Sick and his brethren exclaimed Amen This ceremony raised a great outcry and the outcry became louder when a few hours after the execution the papers delivered by the two traitors to the Sheriffs were made public It had been supposed that Parkyns at least would express some repentance for the crime which had brought him to the gallows Indeed he had before the Committee of the Commons owned that the Assassination Plot could not be justified But in his last declaration he avowed his share in that plot not only without a word indicating remorse but with something which resembled exultation Was this a man to be absolved by Christian divines absolved before the eyes of tens of thousands absolved with rites evidently intended to attract public attention with rites of which there was no trace in the Book of Common Prayer or in the practice of the Church of England In journals pamphlets and broadsides the insolence of the three Levites as they were called was sharply reprehended Warrants were soon out Cook and Snatt were taken and imprisoned but Collier was able to conceal himself and by the help of one of the presses which were at the service of his party sent forth from his hiding place a defence of his conduct He declared that he abhorred assassination as much as any of those who railed against him and his general character warrants us in believing that this declaration was perfectly sincere But the rash act into which he had been hurried by party spirit furnished his adversaries with very plausible reasons for questioning his sincerity A crowd of answers to his defence appeared Preeminent among them in importance was a solemn manifesto signed by the two Archbishops and by all the Bishops who were then in London twelve in number Even Crewe of Durham and Sprat of Rochester set their names to this document They condemned the proceedings of the three nonjuring divines as in form irregular and in substance impious To remit the sins of impenitent sinners was a profane abuse of the power which Christ had delegated to his ministers It was not denied that Parkyns had planned an assassination It was not pretended that he had professed any repentance for planning an assassination The plain inference was that the divines who absolved him did not think it sinful to assassinate King William Collier rejoined but though a pugnacious controversialist he on this occasion shrank from close conflict and made his escape as well as he could under a cloud of quotations from Tertullian Cyprian and Jerome Albaspinaeus and Hammond the Council of Carthage and the Council of Toledo The public feeling was strongly against the three absolvers The government however wisely determined not to confer on them the honour of martyrdom A bill was found against them by the grand jury of Middlesex but they were not brought to trial Cook and Snatt were set at liberty after a short detention and Collier would have been treated with equal lenity if he would have consented to put in bail But he was determined to do no act which could be construed into a recognition of the usurping government He was therefore outlawed and when he died more than thirty years later his outlawry had not been reversed six hundred eighty three Parkyns was the last Englishman who was tried for high treason under the old system of procedure The first who was tried under the new system was Rockwood He was defended by Sir Bartholomew Shower who in the preceding reign had made himself unenviably conspicuous as a servile and cruel sycophant who had obtained from James the Recordership of London when Holt honourably resigned it and who had as Recorder sent soldiers to the gibbet for breaches of military discipline By his servile cruelty he had earned the nickname of the Manhunter Shower deserved if any offender deserved to be excepted from the Act of Indemnity and left to the utmost rigour of those laws which he had so shamelessly perverted But he had been saved by the clemency of William and had requited that clemency by pertinacious and malignant opposition six hundred eighty four It was doubtless on account of Shower s known leaning towards Jacobitism that he was employed on this occasion He raised some technical objections which the Court overruled On the merits of the case he could make no defence The jury returned a verdict of guilty Cranburne and Lowick were then tried and convicted They suffered with Rookwood and there the executions stopped six hundred eighty five The temper of the nation was such that the government might have shed much more blood without incurring the reproach of cruelty The feeling which had been called forth by the discovery of the plot continued during several weeks to increase day by day Of that feeling the able men who were at the head of the Whig party made a singularly skilful use They saw that the public enthusiasm if left without guidance would exhaust itself in huzzas healths and bonfires but might if wisely guided be the means of producing a great and lasting effect The Association into which the Commons had entered while the King s speech was still in their ears furnished the means of combining four fifths of the nation in one vast club for the defence of the order of succession with which were inseparably combined the dearest liberties of the English people and of establishing a test which would distinguish those who were zealous for that order of succession from those who sullenly and reluctantly acquiesced in it Of the five hundred and thirty members of the Lower House about four hundred and twenty voluntarily subscribed the instrument which recognised William as rightful and lawful King of England It was moved in the Upper House that the same form should be adopted but objections were raised by the Tories Nottingham ever conscientious honourable and narrow minded declared that he could not assent to the words rightful and lawful He still held as he had held from the first that a prince who had taken the Crown not by birthright but by the gift of the Convention could not properly be so described William was doubtless King in fact and as King in fact was entitled to the obedience of Christians No man said Nottingham has served or will serve His Majesty more faithfully than I But to this document I cannot set my hand Rochester and Normanby held similar language Monmouth in a speech of two hours and a half earnestly exhorted the Lords to agree with the Commons Burnet was vehement on the same side Wharton whose father had lately died and who was now Lord Wharton appeared in the foremost rank of the Whig peers But no man distinguished himself more in the debate than one whose life both public and private had been one long series of faults and disasters the incestuous lover of Henrietta Berkeley the unfortunate lieutenant of Monmouth He had recently ceased to be called by the tarnished name of Grey of Wark and was now Earl of Tankerville He spoke on that day with great force and eloquence for the words rightful and lawful Leeds after expressing his regret that a question about a mere phrase should have produced dissension among noble persons who were all equally attached to the reigning Sovereign undertook the office of mediator He proposed that their Lordships instead of recognising William as rightful and lawful King should declare that William had the right by law to the English Crown and that no other person had any right whatever to that Crown Strange to say almost all the Tory peers were perfectly satisfied with what Leeds had suggested Among the Whigs there was some unwillingness to consent to a change which slight as it was might be thought to indicate a difference of opinion between the two Houses on a subject of grave importance But Devonshire and Portland declared themselves content their authority prevailed and the alteration was made How a rightful and lawful possessor is to be distinguished from a possessor who has the exclusive right by law is a question which a Whig may without any painful sense of shame acknowledge to be beyond the reach of his faculties and leave to be discussed by High Churchmen Eighty three peers immediately affixed their names to the amended form of association and Rochester was among them Nottingham not yet quite satisfied asked time for consideration six hundred eighty six Beyond the walls of Parliament there was none of this verbal quibbling The language of the House of Commons was adopted by the whole country The City of London led the way Within thirty six hours after the Association had been published under the direction of the Speaker it was subscribed by the Lord Mayor by the Aldermen and by almost all the members of the Common Council The municipal corporations all over the kingdom followed the example The spring assizes were just beginning and at every county town the grand jurors and the justices of the peace put down their names Soon shopkeepers artisans yeomen farmers husbandmen came by thousands to the tables where the parchments were laid out In Westminster there were thirty seven thousand associators in the Tower Hamlets eight thousand in Southwark eighteen thousand The rural parts of Surrey furnished seventeen thousand At Ipswich all the freemen signed except two At Warwick all the male inhabitants who had attained the age of sixteen signed except two Papists and two Quakers At Taunton where the memory of the Bloody Circuit was fresh every man who could write gave in his adhesion to the government All the churches and all the meeting houses in the town were crowded as they had never been crowded before with people who came to thank God for having preserved him whom they fondly called William the Deliverer Of all the counties of England Lancashire was the most Jacobitical Yet Lancashire furnished fifty thousand signatures Of all the great towns of England Norwich was the most Jacobitical The magistrates of that city were supposed to be in the interest of the exiled dynasty The nonjurors were numerous and had just before the discovery of the plot seemed to be in unusual spirits and ventured to take unusual liberties One of the chief divines of the schism had preached a sermon there which gave rise to strange suspicions He had taken for his text the verse in which the Prophet Jeremiah announced that the day of vengeance was come that the sword would be drunk with blood that the Lord God of Hosts had a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates Very soon it was known that at the time when this discourse was delivered swords had actually been sharpening under the direction of Barclay and Parkyns for a bloody sacrifice on the north bank of the river Thames The indignation of the common people of Norwich was not to be restrained They came in multitudes though discouraged by the municipal authorities to plight faith to William rightful and lawful King In Norfolk the number of signatures amounted to forty eight thousand in Suffolk to seventy thousand Upwards of five hundred rolls went up to London from every part of England The number of names attached to twenty seven of those rolls appears from the London Gazette to have been three hundred and fourteen thousand After making the largest allowance for fraud it seems certain that the Association included the great majority of the adult male inhabitants of England who were able to sign their names The tide of popular feeling was so strong that a man who was known not to have signed ran considerable risk of being publicly affronted In many places nobody appeared without wearing in his hat a red riband on which were embroidered the words General Association for King William Once a party of Jacobites had the courage to parade a street in London with an emblematic device which seemed to indicate their contempt for the new Solemn League and Covenant They were instantly put to rout by the mob and their leader was well ducked The enthusiasm spread to secluded isles to factories in foreign countries to remote colonies The Association was signed by the rude fishermen of the Scilly Rocks by the English merchants of Malaga by the English merchants of Genoa by the citizens of New York by the tobacco planters of Virginia and by the sugar planters of Barbadoes six hundred eighty seven Emboldened by success the Whig leaders ventured to proceed a step further They brought into the Lower House a bill for the securing of the King s person and government By this bill it was provided that whoever while the war lasted should come from France into England without the royal license should incur the penalties of treason that the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act should continue to the end of the year sixteen ninety six and that all functionaries appointed by William should retain their offices notwithstanding his death till his successor should be pleased to dismiss them The form of Association which the House of Commons had adopted was solemnly ratified and it was provided that no person should sit in that House or should hold any office civil or military without signing The Lords were indulged in the use of their own form and nothing was said about the clergy The Tories headed by Finch and Seymour complained bitterly of this new test and ventured once to divide but were defeated Finch seems to have been heard patiently but notwithstanding all Seymour s eloquence the contemptuous manner in which he spoke of the Association raised a storm against which he could not stand Loud cries of the Tower the Tower were heard Haughty and imperious as he was he was forced to explain away his words and could scarcely by apologizing in a manner to which he was little accustomed save himself from the humiliation of being called to the bar and reprimanded on his knees The bill went up to the Lords and passed with great speed in spite of the opposition of Rochester and Nottingham six hundred eighty eight The nature and extent of the change which the discovery of the Assassination Plot had produced in the temper of the House of Commons and of the nation is strikingly illustrated by the history of a bill entitled a Bill for the further Regulation of Elections of Members of Parliament The moneyed interest was almost entirely Whig and was therefore an object of dislike to the Tories The rapidly growing power of that interest was generally regarded with jealousy by landowners whether they were Whigs or Tories It was something new and monstrous to see a trader from Lombard Street who had no tie to the soil of our island and whose wealth was entirely personal and movable post down to Devonshire or Sussex with a portmanteau full of guineas offer himself as candidate for a borough in opposition to a neighbouring gentleman whose ancestors had been regularly returned ever since the Wars of the Roses and come in at the head of the poll Yet even this was not the worst More than one seat in Parliament it was said had been bought and sold over a dish of coffee at Garraway s The purchaser had not been required even to go through the form of showing himself to the electors Without leaving his counting house in Cheapside he had been chosen to represent a place which he had never seen Such things were intolerable No man it was said ought to sit in the English legislature who was not master of some hundreds of acres of English ground six hundred eighty nine A bill was accordingly brought in which provided that every member of the House of Commons must have a certain estate in land For a knight of a shire the qualification was fixed at five hundred a year for a burgess at two hundred a year Early in February this bill was read a second time and referred to a Select Committee A motion was made that the Committee should be instructed to add a clause enacting that all elections should be by ballot Whether this motion proceeded from a Whig or a Tory by what arguments it was supported and on what grounds it was opposed we have now no means of discovering We know only that it was rejected without a division Before the bill came back from the Committee some of the most respectable constituent bodies in the kingdom had raised their voices against the new restriction to which it was proposed to subject them There had in general been little sympathy between the commercial towns and the Universities For the commercial towns were the chief seats of Whiggism and Non conformity and the Universities were zealous for the Crown and the Church Now however Oxford and Cambridge made common cause with London and Bristol It was hard said the Academics that a grave and learned man sent by a large body of grave and learned men to the Great Council of the nation should be thought less fit to sit in that Council than a boozing clown who had scarcely literature enough to entitle him to the benefit of clergy It was hard said the traders that a merchant prince who had been the first magistrate of the first city in the world whose name on the back of a bill commanded entire confidence at Smyrna and at Genoa at Hamburg and at Amsterdam who had at sea ships every one of which was worth a manor and who had repeatedly when the liberty and religion of the kingdom were in peril advanced to the government at an hour s notice five or ten thousand pounds should be supposed to have a less stake in the prosperity of the commonwealth than a squire who sold his own bullocks and hops over a pot of ale at the nearest market town On the report it was moved that the Universities should be excepted but the motion was lost by a hundred and fifty one votes to a hundred and forty three On the third reading it was moved that the City of London should be excepted but it was not thought advisable to divide The final question that the bill do pass was carried by a hundred and seventy three votes to a hundred and fifty on the day which preceded the discovery of the Assassination Plot The Lords agreed to the bill without any amendment William had to consider whether he would give or withhold his assent The commercial towns of the kingdom and among them the City of London which had always stood firmly by him and which had extricated him many times from great embarrassments implored his protection It was represented to him that the Commons were far indeed from being unanimous on this subject that in the last stage the majority had been only twenty three in a full House that the motion to except the Universities had been lost by a majority of only eight On full consideration he resolved not to pass the bill Nobody he said could accuse him of acting selfishly on this occasion his prerogative was not concerned in the matter and he could have no objection to the proposed law except that it would be mischievous to his people On the tenth of April sixteen ninety six therefore the Clerk of the Parliament was commanded to inform the Houses that the King would consider of the Bill for the further Regulation of Elections Some violent Tories in the House of Commons flattered themselves that they might be able to carry a resolution reflecting on the King They moved that whoever had advised His Majesty to refuse his assent to their bill was an enemy to him and to the nation Never was a greater blunder committed The temper of the House was very different from what it had been on the day when the address against Portland s grant had been voted by acclamation The detection of a murderous conspiracy the apprehension of a French invasion had changed every thing The King was popular Every day ten or twelve bales of parchment covered with the signatures of associators were laid at his feet Nothing could be more imprudent than to propose at such a time a thinly disguised vote of censure on him The moderate Tories accordingly separated themselves from their angry and unreasonable brethren The motion was rejected by two hundred and nineteen votes to seventy and the House ordered the question and the numbers on both sides to be published in order that the world might know how completely the attempt to produce a quarrel between the King and the Parliament had failed six hundred ninety The country gentlemen might perhaps have been more inclined to resent the loss of their bill had they not been put into high goodhumour by another bill which they considered as even more important The project of a Land Bank had been revived not in the form in which it had two years before been brought under the consideration of the House of Commons but in a form much less shocking to common sense and less open to ridicule Chamberlayne indeed protested loudly against all modifications of his plan and proclaimed with undiminished confidence that he would make all his countrymen rich if they would only let him He was not he said the first great discoverer whom princes and statesmen had regarded as a dreamer Henry the Seventh had in an evil hour refused to listen to Christopher Columbus the consequence had been that England had lost the mines of Mexico and Peru yet what were the mines of Mexico and Peru to the riches of a nation blessed with an unlimited paper currency But the united force of reason and ridicule had reduced the once numerous sect which followed Chamberlayne to a small and select company of incorrigible fools Few even of the squires now believed in his two great doctrines the doctrine that the State can by merely calling a bundle of old rags ten millions sterling add ten millions sterling to the riches of the nation and the doctrine that a lease of land for a term of years may be worth many times the fee simple But it was still the general opinion of the country gentlemen that a bank of which it should be the special business to advance money on the security of land might be a great blessing to the nation Harley and the Speaker Foley now proposed that such a bank should be established by Act of Parliament and promised that if their plan was adopted the King should be amply supplied with money for the next campaign The Whig leaders and especially Montague saw that the scheme was a delusion that it must speedily fail and that before it failed it might not improbably ruin their own favourite institution the Bank of England But on this point they had against them not only the whole Tory party but also their master and many of their followers The necessities of the State were pressing The offers of the projectors were tempting The Bank of England had in return for its charter advanced to the State only one million at eight per cent The Land Bank would advance more than two millions and a half at seven per cent William whose chief object was to procure money for the service of the year was little inclined to find fault with any source from which two millions and a half could be obtained Sunderland who generally exerted his influence in favour of the Whig leaders failed them on this occasion The Whig country gentlemen were delighted by the prospect of being able to repair their stables replenish their cellars and give portions to their daughters It was impossible to contend against such a combination of force A bill was passed which authorised the government to borrow two million five hundred and sixty four thousand pounds at seven per cent A fund arising chiefly from a new tax on salt was set apart for the payment of the interest If before the first of August the subscription for one half of this loan should have been filled and if one half of the sum subscribed should have been paid into the Exchequer the subscribers were to become a corporate body under the name of the National Land Bank As this bank was expressly intended to accommodate country gentlemen it was strictly interdicted from lending money on any private security other than a mortgage of land and was bound to lend on mortgage at least half a million annually The interest on this half million was not to exceed three and a half per cent if the payments were quarterly or four per cent if the payments were half yearly At that time the market rate of interest on the best mortgages was full six per cent The shrewd observers at the Dutch Embassy therefore thought that capitalists would eschew all connection with what must necessarily be a losing concern and that the subscription would never be half filled up and it seems strange that any sane person should have thought otherwise six hundred ninety one It was vain however to reason against the general infatuation The Tories exultingly predicted that the Bank of Robert Harley would completely eclipse the Bank of Charles Montague The bill passed both Houses On the twenty seventh of April it received the royal assent and the Parliament was immediately afterwards prorogued CHAPTER XXII Military Operations in the Netherlands Commercial Crisis in England Financial Crisis Efforts to restore the Currency Distress of the

Jacobites General Rejoicing The King s Entry into London The Thanksgiving Day ON the seventh of May sixteen ninety six William landed in Holland six hundred ninety two Thence he proceeded to Flanders and took the command of the allied forces which were collected in the neighbourhood of Ghent Villeroy and Boufflers were already in the field All Europe waited impatiently for great news from the Netherlands but waited in vain No aggressive movement was made The object of the generals on both sides was to keep their troops from dying of hunger and it was an object by no means easily attained The treasuries both of France and England were empty Lewis had during the winter created with great difficulty and expense a gigantic magazine at Givet on the frontier of his kingdom The buildings were commodious and of vast extent The quantity of provender laid up in them for horses was immense The number of rations for men was commonly estimated at from three to four millions But early in the spring Athlone and Cohorn had by a bold and dexterous move surprised Givet and had utterly destroyed both storehouses and stores six hundred ninety three France already fainting from exhaustion was in no condition to repair such a loss Sieges such as those of Mons and Namur were operations too costly for her means The business of her army now was not to conquer but to subsist The army of William was reduced to straits not less painful The material wealth of England indeed had not been very seriously impaired by the drain which the war had caused but she was suffering severely from the defective state of that instrument by which her material wealth was distributed Saturday the second of May had been fixed by Parliament as the last day on which the clipped crowns halfcrowns and shillings were to be received by tale in payment of taxes six hundred ninety four The Exchequer was besieged from dawn till midnight by an immense multitude It was necessary to call in the guards for the purpose of keeping order On the following Monday began a cruel agony of a few months which was destined to be succeeded by many years of almost unbroken prosperity six hundred ninety five Most of the old silver had vanished The new silver had scarcely made its appearance About four millions sterling in ingots and hammered coin were lying in the vaults of the Exchequer and the milled money as yet came forth very slowly from the Mint six hundred ninety six Alarmists predicted that the wealthiest and most enlightened kingdom in Europe would be reduced to the state of those barbarous societies in which a mat is bought with a hatchet and a pair of mocassins with a piece of venison There were indeed some hammered pieces which had escaped mutilation and sixpences not clipped within the innermost ring were still current This old money and the new money together made up a scanty stock of silver which with the help of gold was to carry the nation through the summer six hundred ninety seven The manufacturers generally contrived though with extreme difficulty to pay their workmen in coin six hundred ninety eight The upper classes seem to have lived to a great extent on credit Even an opulent man seldom had the means of discharging the weekly bills of his baker and butcher six hundred ninety nine A promissory note however subscribed by such a man was readily taken in the district where his means and character were well known The notes of the wealthy moneychangers of Lombard Street circulated widely seven hundred The paper of the Bank of England did much service and would have done more but for the unhappy error into which the Parliament had recently been led by Harley and Foley The confidence which the public had felt in that powerful and opulent Company had been shaken by the Act which established the Land Bank It might well be doubted whether there would be room for the two rival institutions and of the two the younger seemed to be the favourite of the government and of the legislature The stock of the Bank of England had gone rapidly down from a hundred and ten to eighty three Meanwhile the goldsmiths who had from the first been hostile to that great corporation were plotting against it They collected its paper from every quarter and on the fourth of May when the Exchequer had just swallowed up most of the old money and when scarcely any of the new money had been issued they flocked to Grocers Hall and insisted on immediate payment A single goldsmith demanded thirty thousand pounds The Directors in this extremity acted wisely and firmly They refused to cash the notes which had been thus maliciously presented and left the holders to seek a remedy in Westminster Hall Other creditors who came in good faith to ask for their due were paid The conspirators affected to triumph over the powerful body which they hated and dreaded The bank which had recently begun to exist under such splendid auspices which had seemed destined to make a revolution in commerce and in finance which had been the boast of London and the envy of Amsterdam was already insolvent ruined dishonoured Wretched pasquinades were published the Trial of the Land Bank for murdering the Bank of England the last Will and Testament of the Bank of England the Epitaph of the Bank of England the Inquest on the Bank of England But in spite of all this clamour and all this wit the correspondents of the States General reported that the Bank of England had not really suffered in the public esteem and that the conduct of the goldsmiths was generally condemned seven hundred one The Directors soon found it impossible to procure silver enough to meet every claim which was made on them in good faith They then bethought them of a new expedient They made a call of twenty per cent on the proprietors and thus raised a sum which enabled them to give every applicant fifteen per cent in milled money on what was due to him They returned him his note after making a minute upon it that part had been paid seven hundred two A few notes thus marked are still preserved among the archives of the Bank as memorials of that terrible year The paper of the Corporation continued to circulate but the value fluctuated violently from day to day and indeed from hour to hour for the public mind was in so excitable a state that the most absurd lie which a stockjobber could invent sufficed to send the price up or down At one time the discount was only six per cent at another time twenty four per cent A tenpound note which had been taken in the morning as worth more than nine pounds was often worth less than eight pounds before night seven hundred three Another and at that conjuncture a more effectual substitute for a metallic currency owed its existence to the ingenuity of Charles Montague He had succeeded in engrafting on Harley s Land Bank Bill a clause which empowered the government to issue negotiable paper bearing interest at the rate of threepence a day on a hundred pounds In the midst of the general distress and confusion appeared the first Exchequer Bills drawn for various amounts from a hundred pounds down to five pounds These instruments were rapidly distributed over the kingdom by the post and were every where welcome The Jacobites talked violently against them in every coffeehouse and wrote much detestable verse against them but to little purpose The success of the plan was such that the ministers at one time resolved to issue twentyshilling bills and even fifteenshilling bills for the payment of the troops But it does not appear that this resolution was carried into effect seven hundred four It is difficult to imagine how without the Exchequer Bills the government of the country could have been carried on during that year Every source of revenue had been affected by the state of the currency and one source on which the Parliament had confidently reckoned for the means of defraying more than half the charge of the war had yielded not a single farthing The sum expected from the Land Bank was near two million six hundred thousand pounds Of this sum one half was to be subscribed and one quarter paid up by the first of August The King just before his departure had signed a warrant appointing certain commissioners among whom Harley and Foley were the most eminent to receive the names of the contributors seven hundred five A great meeting of persons interested in the scheme was held in the Hall of the Middle Temple One office was opened at Exeter Change another at Mercers Hall Forty agents went down into the country and announced to the landed gentry of every shire the approach of the golden age of high rents and low interest The Council of Regency in order to set an example to the nation put down the King s name for five thousand pounds and the newspapers assured the world that the subscription would speedily be filled seven hundred six But when three weeks had passed away it was found that only fifteen hundred pounds had been added to the five thousand contributed by the King Many wondered at this yet there was little cause for wonder The sum which the friends of the project had undertaken to raise was a sum which only the enemies of the project could furnish The country gentlemen wished well to Harley s scheme but they wished well to it because they wanted to borrow money on easy terms and wanting to borrow money they of course were not able to lend it The moneyed class alone could supply what was necessary to the existence of the Land Bank and the Land Bank was avowedly intended to diminish the profits to destroy the political influence and to lower the social position of the moneyed class As the usurers did not choose to take on themselves the expense of putting down usury the whole plan failed in a manner which if the aspect of public affairs had been less alarming would have been exquisitely ludicrous The day drew near The neatly ruled pages of the subscription book at Mercers Hall were still blank The Commissioners stood aghast In their distress they applied to the government for indulgence Many great capitalists they said were desirous to subscribe but stood aloof because the terms were too hard There ought to be some relaxation Would the Council of Regency consent to an abatement of three hundred thousand pounds The finances were in such a state and the letters in which the King represented his wants were so urgent that the Council of Regency hesitated The Commissioners were asked whether they would engage to raise the whole sum with this abatement Their answer was unsatisfactory They did not venture to say that they could command more than eight hundred thousand pounds The negotiation was therefore broken off The first of August came and the whole amount contributed by the whole nation to the magnificent undertaking from which so much had been expected was two thousand one hundred pounds seven hundred seven Just at this conjuncture Portland arrived from the Continent He had been sent by William with charge to obtain money at whatever cost and from whatever quarter The King had strained his private credit in Holland to procure bread for his army But all was insufficient He wrote to his Ministers that unless they could send him a speedy supply his troops would either rise in mutiny or desert by thousands He knew he said that it would be hazardous to call Parliament together during his absence But if no other resource could be devised that hazard must be run seven hundred eight The Council of Regency in extreme embarrassment began to wish that the terms hard as they were which had been offered by the Commissioners at Mercers Hall had been accepted The negotiation was renewed Shrewsbury Godolphin and Portland as agents for the King had several conferences with Harley and Foley who had recently pretended that eight hundred thousand pounds were ready to be subscribed to the Land Bank The Ministers gave assurances that if at this conjuncture even half that sum were advanced those who had done this service to the State should in the next session be incorporated as a National Land Bank Harley and Foley at first promised with an air of confidence to raise what was required But they soon went back from their word they showed a great inclination to be punctilious and quarrelsome about trifles at length the eight hundred thousand pounds dwindled to forty thousand and even the forty thousand could be had only on hard conditions seven hundred nine So ended the great delusion of the Land Bank The commission expired and the offices were closed And now the Council of Regency almost in despair had recourse to the Bank of England Two hundred thousand pounds was the very smallest sum which would suffice to meet the King s most pressing wants Would the Bank of England advance that sum The capitalists who lead the chief sway in that corporation were in bad humour and not without reason But fair words earnest entreaties and large promises were not spared all the influence of Montague which was justly great was exerted the Directors promised to do their best but they apprehended that it would be impossible for them to raise the money without making a second call of twenty per cent on their constituents It was necessary that the question should be submitted to a General Court in such a court more than six hundred persons were entitled to vote and the result might well be doubted The proprietors were summoned to meet on the fifteenth of August at Grocers Hall During the painful interval of suspense Shrewsbury wrote to his master in language more tragic than is often found in official letters If this should not succeed God knows what can be done Any thing must be tried and ventured rather than lie down and die seven hundred ten On the fifteenth of August a great epoch in the history of the Bank the General Court was held In the chair sate Sir John Houblon the Governor who was also Lord Mayor of London and what would in our time be thought strange a Commissioner of the Admiralty Sir John in a speech every word of which had been written and had been carefully considered by the Directors explained the case and implored the assembly to stand by King William There was at first a little murmuring If our notes would do it was said we should be most willing to assist His Majesty but two hundred thousand pounds in hard money at a time like this The Governor announced explicitly that nothing but gold or silver would supply the necessities of the army in Flanders At length the question was put to the vote and every hand in the Hall was held up for sending the money The letters from the Dutch Embassy informed the States General that the events of that day had bound the Bank and the government together in close alliance and that several of the ministers had immediately after the meeting purchased stock merely in order to give a pledge of their attachment to the body which had rendered so great a service to the State seven hundred eleven Meanwhile strenuous exertions were making to hasten the recoinage Since the Restoration the Mint had like every other public establishment in the kingdom been a nest of idlers and jobbers The important office of Warden worth between six and seven hundred a year had become a mere sinecure and had been filled by a succession of fine gentlemen who were well known at the hazard table of Whitehall but who never condescended to come near the Tower This office had just become vacant and Montague had obtained it for Newton seven hundred twelve The ability the industry and the strict uprightness of the great philosopher speedily produced a complete revolution throughout the department which was under his direction seven hundred thirteen He devoted himself to his task with an activity which left him no time to spare for those pursuits in which he had surpassed Archimedes and Galileo Till the great work was completely done he resisted firmly and almost angrily every attempt that was made by men of science here or on the Continent to draw him away from his official duties seven hundred fourteen The old officers of the Mint had thought it a great feat to coin silver to the amount of fifteen thousand pounds in a week When Montague talked of thirty or forty thousand these men of form and precedent pronounced the thing impracticable But the energy of the young Chancellor of the Exchequer and of his friend the Warden accomplished far greater wonders Soon nineteen mills were going at once in the Tower As fast as men could be trained to the work in London bands of them were sent off to other parts of the kingdom Mints were established at Bristol York Exeter Norwich and Chester This arrangement was in the highest degree popular The machinery and the workmen were welcomed to the new stations with the ringing of bells and the firing of guns The weekly issue increased to sixty thousand pounds to eighty thousand to a hundred thousand and at length to a hundred and twenty thousand seven hundred fifteen Yet even this issue though great not only beyond precedent but beyond hope was scanty when compared with the demands of the nation Nor did all the newly stamped silver pass into circulation for during the summer and autumn those politicians who were for raising the denomination of the coin were active and clamorous and it was generally expected that as soon as the Parliament should reassemble the standard would be lowered Of course no person who thought it probable that he should at a day not far distant be able to pay a debt of a pound with three crown pieces instead of four was willing to part with a crown piece till that day arrived Most of the milled pieces were therefore hoarded seven hundred sixteen May June and July passed away without any perceptible increase in the quantity of good money It was not till August that the keenest observer could discern the first faint signs of returning prosperity seven hundred seventeen The distress of the common people was severe and was aggravated by the follies of magistrates and by the arts of malecontents A squire who was one of the quorum would sometimes think it his duty to administer to his neighbours at this trying conjuncture what seemed to him to be equity and as no two of these rural praetors had exactly the same notion of what was equitable their edicts added confusion to confusion In one parish people were in outrageous violation of the law threatened with the stocks if they refused to take clipped shillings by tale In the next parish it was dangerous to pay such shillings except by weight seven hundred eighteen The enemies of the government at the same time laboured indefatigably in their vocation They harangued in every place of public resort from the Chocolate House in Saint James s Street to the sanded kitchen of the alehouse on the village green In verse and prose they incited the suffering multitude to rise up in arms Of the tracts which they published at this time the most remarkable was written by a deprived priest named Grascombe of whose ferocity and scurrility the most respectable nonjurors had long been ashamed He now did his best to persuade the rabble to tear in pieces those members of Parliament who had voted for the restoration of the currency seven hundred nineteen It would be too much to say that the malignant industry of this man and of men like him produced no effect on a population which was doubtless severely tried There were riots in several parts of the country but riots which were suppressed with little difficulty and as far as can be discovered without the shedding of a drop of blood seven hundred twenty In one place a crowd of poor ignorant creatures excited by some knavish agitator besieged the house of a Whig member of Parliament and clamorously insisted on having their short money changed The gentleman consented and desired to know how much they had brought After some delay they were able to produce a single clipped halfcrown seven hundred twenty one Such tumults as this were at a distance exaggerated into rebellions and massacres At Paris it was gravely asserted in print that in an English town which was not named a soldier and a butcher had quarrelled about a piece of money that the soldier had killed the butcher that the butcher s man had snatched up a cleaver and killed the soldier that a great fight had followed and that fifty dead bodies had been left on the ground seven hundred twenty two The truth was that the behaviour of the great body of the people was beyond all praise The judges when in September they returned from their circuits reported that the temper of the nation was excellent seven hundred twenty three There was a patience a reasonableness a good nature a good faith which nobody had anticipated Every body felt that nothing but mutual help and mutual forbearance could prevent the dissolution of society A hard creditor who sternly demanded payment to the day in milled money was pointed at in the streets and was beset by his own creditors with demands which soon brought him to reason Much uneasiness had been felt about the troops It was scarcely possible to pay them regularly if they were not paid regularly it might well be apprehended that they would supply their wants by rapine and such rapine it was certain that the nation altogether unaccustomed to military exaction and oppression would not tamely endure But strange to say there was through this trying year a better understanding than had ever been known between the soldiers and the rest of the community The gentry the farmers the shopkeepers supplied the redcoats with necessaries in a manner so friendly and liberal that there was no brawling and no marauding Severely as these difficulties have been felt L Hermitage writes they have produced one happy effect they have shown how good the spirit of the country is No person however favourable his opinion of the English may have been could have expected that a time of such suffering would have been a time of such tranquillity seven hundred twenty four Men who loved to trace in the strangely complicated maze of human affairs the marks of more than human wisdom were of opinion that but for the interference of a gracious Providence the plan so elaborately devised by great statesmen and great philosophers would have failed completely and ignominiously Often since the Revolution the English had been sullen and querulous unreasonably jealous of the Dutch and disposed to put the worst construction on every act of the King Had the fourth of May found our ancestors in such a mood it can scarcely be doubted that sharp distress irritating minds already irritable would have caused an outbreak which must have shaken and might have subverted the throne of William Happily at the moment at which the loyalty of the nation was put to the most severe test the King was more popular than he had ever been since the day on which the Crown was tendered to him in the Banqueting House The plot which had been laid against his life had excited general disgust and horror His reserved manners his foreign attachments were forgotten He had become an object of personal interest and of personal affection to his people They were every where coming in crowds to sign the instrument which bound them to defend and to avenge him They were every where carrying about in their hats the badges of their loyalty to him They could hardly be restrained from inflicting summary punishment on the few who still dared openly to question his title Jacobite was now a synonyme for cutthroat Noted Jacobite laymen had just planned a foul murder Noted Jacobite priests had in the face of day and in the administration of a solemn ordinance of religion indicated their approbation of that murder Many honest and pious men who thought that their allegiance was still due to James had indignantly relinquished all connection with zealots who seemed to think that a righteous end justified the most unrighteous means Such was the state of public feeling during the summer and autumn of sixteen ninety six and therefore it was that hardships which in any of the seven preceding years would certainly have produced a rebellion and might perhaps have produced a counterrevolution did not produce a single tumult too serious to be suppressed by the constable s staff Nevertheless the effect of the commercial and financial crisis in England was felt through all the fleets and armies of the coalition The great source of subsidies was dry No important military operation could any where be attempted Meanwhile overtures tending to peace had been made and a negotiation had been opened Callieres one of the ablest of the many able envoys in the service of France had been sent to the Netherlands and had held many conferences with Dykvelt Those conferences might perhaps have come to a speedy and satisfactory close had not France at this time won a great diplomatic victory in another quarter Lewis had during seven years been scheming and labouring in vain to break the great array of potentates whom the dread of his might and of his ambition had brought together and kept together But during seven years all his arts had been baffled by the skill of William and when the eighth campaign opened the confederacy had not been weakened by a single desertion Soon however it began to be suspected that the Duke of Savoy was secretly treating with the enemy He solemnly assured Galway who represented England at the Court of Turin that there was not the slightest ground for such suspicions and sent to William letters filled with professions of zeal for the common cause and with earnest entreaties for more money This dissimulation continued till a French army commanded by Catinat appeared in Piedmont Then the Duke threw off his disguise concluded peace with France joined his troops to those of Catinat marched into the Milanese and informed the allies whom he had just abandoned that unless they wished to have him for an enemy they must declare Italy neutral ground The Courts of Vienna and Madrid in great dismay submitted to the terms which he dictated William expostulated and protested in vain His influence was no longer what it had been The general opinion of Europe was that the riches and the credit of England were completely exhausted and both her confederates and her enemies imagined that they might safely treat her with indignity Spain true to her invariable maxim that every thing ought to be done for her and nothing by her had the effrontery to reproach the Prince to whom she owed it that she had not lost the Netherlands and Catalonia because he had not sent troops and ships to defend her possessions in Italy The Imperial ministers formed and executed resolutions gravely affecting the interests of the coalition without consulting him who had been the author and the soul of the coalition seven hundred twenty five Lewis had after the failure of the Assassination Plot made up his mind to the disagreeable necessity of recognising William and had authorised Callieres to make a declaration to that effect But the defection of Savoy the neutrality of Italy the disunion among the allies and above all the distresses of England exaggerated as they were in all the letters which the Jacobites of Saint Germains received from the Jacobites of London produced a change The tone of Callieres became high and arrogant he went back from his word and refused to give any pledge that his master would acknowledge the Prince of Orange as King of Great Britain The joy was great among the nonjurors They had always they said been certain that the Great Monarch would not be so unmindful of his own glory and of the common interest of Sovereigns as to abandon the cause of his unfortunate guests and to call an usurper his brother They knew from the best authority that His Most Christian Majesty had lately at Fontainebleau given satisfactory assurances on this subject to King James Indeed there is reason to believe that the project of an invasion of our island was again seriously discussed at Versailles seven hundred twenty six Catinat s army was now at liberty France relieved from all apprehension on the side of Savoy might spare twenty thousand men for a descent on England and if the misery and discontent here were such as was generally reported the nation might be disposed to receive foreign deliverers with open arms So gloomy was the prospect which lay before William when in the autumn of sixteen ninety six he quitted his camp in the Netherlands for England His servants here meanwhile were looking forward to his arrival with very strong and very various emotions The whole political world had been thrown into confusion by a cause which did not at first appear commensurate to such an effect During his absence the search for the Jacobites who had been concerned in the plots of the preceding winter had not been intermitted and of these Jacobites none was in greater peril than Sir John Fenwick His birth his connections the high situations which he had filled the indefatigable activity with which he had during several years laboured to subvert the government and the personal insolence with which he had treated the deceased Queen marked him out as a man fit to be made an example He succeeded however in concealing himself from the officers of justice till the first heat of pursuit was over In his hiding place he thought of an ingenious device which might as he conceived save him from the fate of his friends Charnock and Parkyns Two witnesses were necessary to convict him It appeared from what had passed on the trials of his accomplices that there were only two witnesses who could prove his guilt Porter and Goodman His life was safe if either of these men could be persuaded to abscond Fenwick was not the only person who had strong reason to wish that Porter or Goodman or both might be induced to leave England Aylesbury had been arrested and committed to the Tower and he well knew that if these men appeared against him his head would be in serious danger His friends and Fenwick s raised what was thought a sufficient sum and two Irishmen or in the phrase of the newspapers of that day bogtrotters a barber named Clancy and a disbanded captain named Donelagh undertook the work of corruption The first attempt was made on Porter Clancy contrived to fall in with him at a tavern threw out significant hints and finding that those hints were favourably received opened a regular negotiation The terms offered were alluring three hundred guineas down three hundred more as soon as the witness should be beyond sea a handsome annuity for life a free pardon from King James and a secure retreat in France Porter seemed inclined and perhaps was really inclined to consent He said that he still was what he had been that he was at heart attached to the good cause but that he had been tried beyond his strength Life was sweet It was easy for men who had never been in danger to say that none but a villain would save himself by hanging his associates but a few hours in Newgate with the near prospect of a journey on a sledge to Tyburn would teach such boasters to be more charitable After repeatedly conferring with Clancy Porter was introduced to Fenwick s wife Lady Mary a sister of the Earl of Carlisle Every thing was soon settled Donelagh made the arrangements for the flight A boat was in waiting The letters which were to secure to the fugitive the protection of King James were prepared by Fenwick The hour and place were fixed at which Porter was to receive the first instalment of the promised reward But his heart misgave him He had in truth gone such lengths that it would have been madness in him to turn back He had sent Charnock King Keyes Friend Parkyns Rookwood Cranburne to the gallows It was impossible that such a Judas could ever be really forgiven In France among the friends and comrades of those whom he had destroyed his life would not be worth one day s purchase No pardon under the Great Seal would avert the stroke of the avenger of blood Nay who could say that the bribe now offered was not a bait intended to lure the victim to the place where a terrible doom awaited him Porter resolved to be true to that government under which alone he could be safe he carried to Whitehall information of the whole intrigue and he received full instructions from the ministers On the eve of the day fixed for his departure he had a farewell meeting with Clancy at a tavern Three hundred guineas were counted out on the table Porter pocketed them and gave a signal Instantly several messengers from the office of the Secretary of State rushed into the room and produced a warrant The unlucky barber was carried off to prison tried for his offence convicted and pilloried seven hundred twenty seven This mishap made Fenwick s situation more perilous than ever At the next sessions for the City of London a bill of indictment against him for high treason was laid before the grand jury Porter and Goodman appeared as witnesses for the Crown and the bill was found Fenwick now thought that it was high time to steal away to the Continent Arrangements were made for his passage He quitted his hiding place and repaired to Romney Marsh There he hoped to find shelter till the vessel which was to convey him across the Channel should arrive For though Hunt s establishment had been broken up there were still in that dreary region smugglers who carried on more than one lawless trade It chanced that two of these men had just been arrested on a charge of harbouring traitors The messenger who had taken them into custody was returning to London with them when on the high road he met Fenwick face to face Unfortunately for Fenwick no face in England was better known than his It is Sir John said the officer to the prisoners Stand by me my good fellows and I warrant you you will have your pardons and a bag of guineas besides The offer was too tempting to be refused but Fenwick was better mounted than his assailants he dashed through them pistol in hand and was soon out of sight They pursued him the hue and cry was raised the bells of all the parish churches of the Marsh rang out the alarm the whole country was up every path was guarded every thicket was beaten every hut was searched and at length the fugitive was found in bed Just then a bark of very suspicious appearance came in sight she soon approached the shore and showed English colours but to the practised eyes of the Kentish fishermen she looked much like a French privateer It was not difficult to guess her errand After waiting a short time in vain for her passenger she stood out to sea seven hundred twenty eight Fenwick unluckily for himself was able so far to elude the vigilance of those who had charge of him as to scrawl with a lead pencil a short letter to his wife Every line contained evidence of his guilt All he wrote was over he was a dead man unless indeed his friends could by dint of solicitation obtain a pardon for him Perhaps the united entreaties of all the Howards might succeed He would go abroad he would solemnly promise never again to set foot on English ground and never to draw sword against the government Or would it be possible to bribe a juryman or two to starve out the rest That he wrote or nothing can save me This billet was intercepted in its way to the post and sent up to Whitehall Fenwick was soon carried to London and brought before the Lords Justices At first he held high language and bade defiance to his accusers He was told that he had not always been so confident and his letter to his wife was laid before him He had not till then been aware that it had fallen into hands for which it was not intended His distress and confusion became great He felt that if he were instantly sent before a jury a conviction was inevitable One chance remained If he could delay his trial for a short time the judges would leave town for their circuits a few weeks would be gained and in the course of a few weeks something might be done He addressed himself particularly to the Lord Steward Devonshire with whom he had formerly had some connection of a friendly kind The unhappy man declared that he threw himself entirely on the royal mercy and offered to disclose all that he knew touching the plots of the Jacobites That he knew much nobody could doubt Devonshire advised his colleagues to postpone the trial till the pleasure of William could be known This advice was taken The King was informed of what had passed and he soon sent an answer directing Devonshire to receive the prisoner s confession in writing and to send it over to the Netherlands with all speed seven hundred twenty nine Fenwick had now to consider what he should confess Had he according to his promise revealed all that he knew there can be no doubt that his evidence would have seriously affected many Jacobite noblemen gentlemen and clergymen But though he was very unwilling to die attachment to his party was in his mind a stronger sentiment than the fear of death The thought occurred to him that he might construct a story which might possibly be considered as sufficient to earn his pardon which would at least put off his trial some months yet which would not injure a single sincere adherent of the banished dynasty nay which would cause distress and embarrassment to the enemies of that dynasty and which would fill the Court the Council and the Parliament of William with fears and animosities He would divulge nothing that could affect those true Jacobites who had repeatedly awaited with pistols loaded and horses saddled the landing of the rightful King accompanied by a French army But if there were false Jacobites who had mocked their banished Sovereign year after year with professions of attachment and promises of service and yet had at every great crisis found some excuse for disappointing him and who were at that moment among the chief supports of the usurper s throne why should they be spared That there were such false Jacobites high in political office and in military command Fenwick had good reason to believe He could indeed say nothing against them to which a Court of Justice would have listened for none of them had ever entrusted him with any message or letter for France and all that he knew about their treachery he had learned at second hand and third hand But of their guilt he had no doubt One of them was Marlborough He had after betraying James to William promised to make reparation by betraying William to James and had at last after much shuffling again betrayed James and made peace with William Godolphin had practised similar deception He had long been sending fair words to Saint Germains in return for those fair words he had received a pardon and with this pardon in his secret drawer he had continued to administer the finances of the existing government To ruin such a man would be a just punishment for his baseness and a great service to King James Still more desirable was it to blast the fame and to destroy the influence of Russell and Shrewsbury Both were distinguished members of that party which had under different names been during three generations implacably hostile to the Kings of the House of Stuart Both had taken a great part in the Revolution The names of both were subscribed to the instrument which had invited the Prince of Orange to England One of them was now his Minister for Maritime Affairs the other his Principal Secretary of State but neither had been constantly faithful to him Both had soon after his accession bitterly resented his wise and magnanimous impartiality which to their minds disordered by party spirit seemed to be unjust and ungrateful partiality for the Tory faction and both had in their spleen listened to agents from Saint Germains Russell had vowed by all that was most sacred that he would himself bring back his exiled Sovereign But the vow was broken as soon as it had been uttered and he to whom the royal family had looked as to a second Monk had crushed the hopes of that family at La Hogue Shrewsbury had not gone such lengths Yet he too while out of humour with William had tampered with the agents of James With the power and reputation of these two great men was closely connected the power and reputation of the whole Whig party That party after some quarrels which were in truth quarrels of lovers was now cordially reconciled to William and bound to him by the strongest ties If those ties could be dissolved if he could be induced to regard with distrust and aversion the only set of men which was on principle and with enthusiasm devoted to his interests his enemies would indeed have reason to rejoice With such views as these Fenwick delivered to Devonshire a paper so cunningly composed that it would probably have brought some severe calamity on the Prince to whom it was addressed had not that Prince been a man of singularly clear judgment and singularly lofty spirit The paper contained scarcely any thing respecting those Jacobite plots in which the writer had been himself concerned and of which he intimately knew all the details It contained nothing which could be of the smallest prejudice to any person who was really hostile to the existing order of things The whole narrative was made up of stories too true for the most part yet resting on no better authority than hearsay about the intrigues of some eminent warriors and statesmen who whatever their former conduct might have been were now at least hearty in support of William Godolphin Fenwick averred had accepted a seat at the Board of Treasury with the sanction and for the benefit of King James Marlborough had promised to carry over the army Russell to carry over the fleet Shrewsbury while out of office had plotted with Middleton against the government and King Indeed the Whigs were now the favourites at Saint Germains Many old friends of hereditary right were moved to jealousy by the preference which James gave to the new converts Nay he had been heard to express his confident hope that the monarchy would be set up again by the very hands which had pulled it down Such was Fenwick s confession Devonshire received it and sent it by express to the Netherlands without intimating to any of his fellow councillors what it contained The accused ministers afterwards complained bitterly of this proceeding Devonshire defended himself by saying that he had been specially deputed by the King to take the prisoner s information and was bound as a true servant of the Crown to transmit that information to His Majesty and to His Majesty alone The messenger sent by Devonshire found William at Loo The King read the confession and saw at once with what objects it had been drawn up It contained little more than what he had long known and had long with politic and generous dissimulation affected not to know If he spared employed and promoted men who had been false to him it was not because he was their dupe His observation was quick and just his intelligence was good and he had during some years had in his hands proofs of much that Fenwick had only gathered from wandering reports It has seemed strange to many that a Prince of high spirit and acrimonious temper should have treated servants who had so deeply wronged him with a kindness hardly to be expected from the meekest of human beings But William was emphatically a statesman Ill humour the natural and pardonable effect of much bodily and much mental suffering might sometimes impel him to give a tart answer But never did he on any important occasion indulge his angry passions at the expense of the great interests of which he was the guardian For the sake of those interests proud and imperious as he was by nature he submitted patiently to galling restraints bore cruel indignities and disappointments with the outward show of serenity and not only forgave but often pretended not to see offences which might well have moved him to bitter resentment He knew that he must work with such tools as he had If he was to govern England he must employ the public men of England and in his age the public men of England with much of a peculiar kind of ability were as a class lowminded and immoral There were doubtless exceptions Such was Nottingham among the Tories and Somers among the Whigs But the majority both of the Tory and of the Whig ministers of William were men whose characters had taken the ply in the days of the Antipuritan reaction They had been formed in two evil schools in the most unprincipled of courts and the most unprincipled of oppositions a court which took its character from Charles an opposition headed by Shaftesbury From men so trained it would have been unreasonable to expect disinterested and stedfast fidelity to any cause But though they could not be trusted they might be used and they might be useful No reliance could be placed on their principles but much reliance might be placed on their hopes and on their fears and of the two Kings who laid claim to the English crown the King from whom there was most to hope and most to fear was the King in possession If therefore William had little reason to esteem these politicians his hearty friends he had still less reason to number them among his hearty foes Their conduct towards him reprehensible as it was might be called upright when compared with their conduct towards James To the reigning Sovereign they had given valuable service to the banished Sovereign little more than promises and professions Shrewsbury might in a moment of resentment or of weakness have trafficked with Jacobite agents but his general conduct had proved that he was as far as ever from being a Jacobite Godolphin had been lavish of fair words to the dynasty which was out but he had thriftily and skilfully managed the revenues of the dynasty which was in Russell had sworn that he would desert with the English fleet but he had burned the French fleet Even Marlborough s known treasons for his share in the disaster of Brest and the death of Talmash was unsuspected had not done so much harm as his exertions at Walcourt at Cork and at Kinsale had done good William had therefore wisely resolved to shut his eyes to perfidy which however disgraceful it might be had not injured him and still to avail himself with proper precautions of the eminent talents which some of his unfaithful counsellors possessed Having determined on this course and having long followed it with happy effect he could not but be annoyed and provoked by Fenwick s confession Sir John it was plain thought himself a Machiavel If his trick succeeded the Princess whom it was most important to keep in good humour would be alienated from the government by the disgrace of Marlborough The whole Whig party the firmest support of the throne would be alienated by the disgrace of Russell and Shrewsbury In the meantime not one of those plotters whom Fenwick knew to have been deeply concerned in plans of insurrection invasion assassination would be molested This cunning schemer should find that he had not to do with a novice William instead of turning his accused servants out of their places sent the confession to Shrewsbury and desired that it might be laid before the Lords Justices I am astonished the King wrote at the fellow s effrontery You know me too well to think that such stories as his can make any impression on me Observe this honest man s sincerity He has nothing to say except against my friends Not a word about the plans of his brother Jacobites The King concluded by directing the Lords justices to send Fenwick before a jury with all speed seven hundred thirty The effect produced by William s letter was remarkable Every one of the accused persons behaved himself in a manner singularly characteristic Marlborough the most culpable of all preserved a serenity mild majestic and slightly contemptuous Russell scarcely less criminal than Marlborough went into a towering passion and breathed nothing but vengeance against the villanous informer Godolphin uneasy but wary reserved and selfpossessed prepared himself to stand on the defensive But Shrewsbury who of all the four was the least to blame was utterly overwhelmed He wrote in extreme distress to William acknowledged with warm expressions of gratitude the King s rare generosity and protested that Fenwick had malignantly exaggerated and distorted mere trifles into enormous crimes My Lord Middleton such was the substance of the letter was certainly in communication with me about the time of the battle of La Hogue We are relations we frequently met we supped together just before he returned to France I promised to take care of his interests here he in return offered to do me good offices there but I told him that I had offended too deeply to be forgiven and that I would not stoop to ask forgiveness This Shrewsbury averred was the whole extent of his offence seven hundred thirty one It is but too fully proved that this confession was by no means ingenuous nor is it likely that William was deceived But he was determined to spare the repentant traitor the humiliation of owning a fault and accepting a pardon I can see the King wrote no crime at all in what you have acknowledged Be assured that these calumnies have made no unfavourable impression on me Nay you shall find that they have strengthened my confidence in you seven hundred thirty two A man hardened in depravity would have been perfectly contented with an acquittal so complete announced in language so gracious But Shrewsbury was quite unnerved by a tenderness which he was conscious that he had not merited He shrank from the thought of meeting the master whom he had wronged and by whom he had been forgiven and of sustaining the gaze of the peers among whom his birth and his abilities had gained for him a station of which he felt that he was unworthy The campaign in the Netherlands was over The session of Parliament was approaching The King was expected with the first fair wind Shrewsbury left town and retired to the Wolds of Gloucestershire In that district then one of the wildest in the south of the island he had a small country seat surrounded by pleasant gardens and fish ponds William had in his progress a year before visited this dwelling which lay far from the nearest high road and from the nearest market town and had been much struck by the silence and loneliness of the retreat in which he found the most graceful and splendid of English courtiers At one in the morning of the sixth of October the King landed at Margate Late in the evening he reached Kensington The following morning a brilliant crowd of ministers and nobles pressed to kiss his hand but he missed one face which ought to have been there and asked where the Duke of Shrewsbury was and when he was expected in town The next day came a letter from the Duke averring that he had just had a bad fall in hunting His side had been bruised his lungs had suffered he had spit blood and could not venture to travel seven hundred thirty three That he had fallen and hurt himself was true but even those who felt most kindly towards him suspected and not without strong reason that he made the most of his convenient misfortune and that if he had not shrunk from appearing in public he would have performed the journey with little difficulty His correspondents told him that if he was really as ill as he thought himself he would do well to consult the physicians and surgeons of the capital Somers especially implored him in the most earnest manner to come up to London Every hour s delay was mischievous His Grace must conquer his sensibility He had only to face calumny courageously and it would vanish seven hundred thirty four The King in a few kind lines expressed his sorrow for the accident You are much wanted here he wrote I am impatient to embrace you and to assure you that my esteem for you is undiminished seven hundred thirty five Shrewsbury answered that he had resolved to resign the seals seven hundred thirty six Somers adjured him not to commit so fatal an error If at that moment His Grace should quit office what could the world think except that he was condemned by his own conscience He would in fact plead guilty he would put a stain on his own honour and on the honour of all who lay under the same accusation It would no longer be possible to treat Fenwick s story as a romance Forgive me Somers wrote for speaking after this free manner for I do own I can scarce be temperate in this matter seven hundred thirty seven A few hours later William himself wrote to the same effect I have so much regard for you that if I could I would positively interdict you from doing what must bring such grave suspicions on you At any time I should consider your resignation as a misfortune to myself but I protest to you that at this time it is on your account more than on mine that I wish you to remain in my service seven hundred thirty eight Sunderland Portland Russell and Wharton joined their entreaties to their master s and Shrewsbury consented to remain Secretary in name But nothing could induce him to face the Parliament which was about to meet A litter was sent down to him from London but to no purpose He set out but declared that he found it impossible to proceed and took refuge again in his lonely mansion among the hills seven hundred thirty nine While these things were passing the members of both Houses were from every part of the kingdom going up to Westminster To the opening of the session not only England but all Europe looked forward with intense anxiety Public credit had been deeply injured by the failure of the Land Bank The restoration of the currency was not yet half accomplished The scarcity of money was still distressing Much of the milled silver was buried in private repositories as fast as it came forth from the Mint Those politicians who were bent on raising the denomination of the coin had found too ready audience from a population suffering under severe pressure and at one time the general voice of the nation had seemed to be on their side seven hundred forty Of course every person who thought it likely that the standard would be lowered hoarded as much money as he could hoard and thus the cry for little shillings aggravated the pressure from which it had sprung seven hundred forty one Both the allies and the enemies of England imagined that her resources were spent that her spirit was broken that the Commons so often querulous and parsimonious even in tranquil and prosperous times would now positively refuse to bear any additional burden and would with an importunity not to be withstood insist on having peace at any price But all these prognostications were confounded by the firmness and ability of the Whig leaders and by the steadiness of the Whig majority On the twentieth of October the Houses met William addressed to them a speech remarkable even among all the remarkable speeches in which his own high thoughts and purposes were expressed in the dignified and judicious language of Somers There was the King said great reason for congratulation It was true that the funds voted in the preceding session for the support of the war had failed and that the recoinage had produced great distress Yet the enemy had obtained no advantage abroad the State had been torn by no convulsion at home the loyalty shown by the army and by the nation under severe trials had disappointed all the hopes of those who wished evil to England Overtures tending to peace had been made What might be the result of those overtures was uncertain but this was certain that there could be no safe or honourable peace for a nation which was not prepared to wage vigorous war I am sure we shall all agree in opinion that the only way of treating with France is with our swords in our hands The Commons returned to their chamber and Foley read the speech from the chair A debate followed which resounded through all Christendom That was the proudest day of Montague s life and one of the proudest days in the history of the English Parliament In seventeen ninety eight Burke held up the proceedings of that day as an example to the statesmen whose hearts had failed them in the conflict with the gigantic power of the French republic In eighteen twenty two Huskisson held up the proceedings of that day as an example to a legislature which under the pressure of severe distress was tempted to alter the standard of value and to break faith with the public creditor Before the House rose the young Chancellor of the Exchequer whose ascendency since the ludicrous failure of the Tory scheme of finance was undisputed proposed and carried three memorable resolutions The first which passed with only one muttered No declared that the Commons would support the King against all foreign and domestic enemies and would enable him to prosecute the war with vigour The second which passed not without opposition but without a division declared that the standard of money should not be altered in fineness weight or denomination The third against which not a single opponent of the government dared to raise his voice pledged the House to make good all the deficiencies of all parliamentary fund s established since the King s accession The task of framing an answer to the royal speech was entrusted to a Committee exclusively composed of Whigs Montague was chairman and the eloquent and animated address which he drew up may still be read in the journals with interest and pride seven hundred forty two Within a fortnight two millions and a half were granted for the military expenditure of the approaching year and nearly as much for the maritime expenditure Provision was made without any dispute for forty thousand seamen About the amount of the land force there was a division The King asked for eighty seven thousand soldiers and the Tories thought that number too large The vote was carried by two hundred and twenty three to sixty seven The malecontents flattered themselves during a short time that the vigorous resolutions of the Commons would be nothing more than resolutions that it would be found impossible to restore public credit to obtain advances from capitalists or to wring taxes out of the distressed population and that therefore the forty thousand seamen and the eighty seven thousand soldiers would exist only on paper Howe who had been more cowed than was usual with him on the first day of the session attempted a week later to make a stand against the Ministry The King he said must have been misinformed or His Majesty never would have felicitated Parliament on the tranquil state of the country I come from Gloucestershire I know that part of the kingdom well The people are all living on alms or ruined by paying alms The soldier helps himself sword in hand to what he wants There have been serious riots already and still more serious riots are to be apprehended The disapprobation of the House was strongly expressed Several members declared that in their counties every thing was quiet If Gloucestershire were in a more disturbed state than the rest of England might not the cause be that Gloucestershire was cursed with a more malignant and unprincipled agitator than all the rest of England could show Some Gloucestershire gentlemen took issue with Howe on the facts There was no such distress they said no such discontent no such rioting as he had described In that county as in every other county the great body of the population was fully determined to support the King in waging a vigorous war till he could make an honourable peace seven hundred forty three In fact the tide had already turned From the moment at which the Commons notified their fixed determination not to raise the denomination of the coin the milled money began to come forth from a thousand strong boxes and private drawers There was still pressure but that pressure was less and less felt day by day The nation though still suffering was joyful and grateful Its feelings resembled those of a man who having been long tortured by a malady which has embittered his life has at last made up his mind to submit to the surgeon s knife who has gone through a cruel operation with safety and who though still smarting from the steel sees before him many years of health and enjoyment and thanks God that the worst is over Within four days after the meeting of Parliament there was a perceptible improvement in trade The discount on bank notes had diminished by one third The price of those wooden tallies which according to an usage handed to us from a rude age were given as receipts for sums paid into the Exchequer had risen The exchanges which had during many months been greatly against England had begun to turn seven hundred forty four Soon the effect of the magnanimous firmness of the House of Commons was felt at every Court in Europe So high indeed was the spirit of that assembly that the King had some difficulty in preventing the Whigs from moving and carrying a resolution that an address should be presented to him requesting him to enter into no negotiation with France till she should have acknowledged him as King of England seven hundred forty five Such an address was unnecessary The votes of the Parliament had already forced on Lewis the conviction that there was no chance of a counterrevolution There was as little chance that he would be able to effect that compromise of which he had in the course of the negotiations thrown out hints It was not to be hoped that either William or the English nation would ever consent to make the settlement of the English crown a matter of bargain with France And even had William and the English nation been disposed to purchase peace by such a sacrifice of dignity there would have been insuperable difficulties in another quarter James could not endure to hear of the expedient which Lewis had suggested I can bear the exile said to his benefactor I can bear with Christian patience to be robbed by the Prince of Orange but I never will consent to be robbed by my own son Lewis never again mentioned the subject Callieres received orders to make the concession on which the peace of the civilised world depended He and Dykvelt came together at the Hague before Baron Lilienroth the representative of the King of Sweden whose mediation the belligerent powers had accepted Dykvelt informed Lilienroth that the Most Christian King had engaged whenever the Treaty of Peace should be signed to recognise the Prince of Orange as King of Great Britain and added with a very intelligible allusion to the compromise proposed by France that the recognition would be without restriction condition or reserve Callieres then declared that he confirmed in the name of his master what Dykvelt had said seven hundred forty six A letter from Prior containing the good news was delivered to James Vernon the Under Secretary of State in the House of Commons The tidings ran along the benches such is Vernon s expression like fire in a field of stubble A load was taken away from every heart and all was joy and triumph seven hundred forty seven The Whig members might indeed well congratulate each other For it was to the wisdom and resolution which they had shown in a moment of extreme danger and distress that their country was indebted for the near prospect of an honourable peace Meanwhile public credit which had in the autumn sunk to the lowest point was fast reviving Ordinary financiers stood aghast when they learned that more than five millions were required to make good the deficiencies of past years But Montague was not an ordinary financier A bold and simple plan proposed by him and popularly called the General Mortgage restored confidence New taxes were imposed old taxes were augmented or continued and thus a consolidated fund was formed sufficient to meet every just claim on the State The Bank of England was at the same time enlarged by a new subscription and the regulations for the payment of the subscription were framed in such a manner as to raise the value both of the notes of the corporation and of the public securities Meanwhile the mints were pouring forth the new silver faster than ever The distress which began on the fourth of May sixteen ninety six which was almost insupportable during the five succeeding months and which became lighter from the day on which the Commons declared their immutable resolution to maintain the old standard ceased to be painfully felt in March sixteen ninety seven Some months were still to elapse before credit completely recovered from the most tremendous shock that it has ever sustained But already the deep and solid foundation had been laid on which was to rise the most gigantic fabric of commercial prosperity that the world had ever seen The great body of the Whigs attributed the restoration of the health of the State to the genius and firmness of their leader Montague His enemies were forced to confess sulkily and sneeringly that every one of his schemes had succeeded the first Bank subscription the second Bank subscription the Recoinage the General Mortgage the Exchequer Bills But some Tories muttered that he deserved no more praise than a prodigal who stakes his whole estate at hazard and has a run of good luck England had indeed passed safely through a terrible crisis and was the stronger for having passed through it But she had been in imminent danger of perishing and the minister who had exposed her to that danger deserved not to be praised but to be hanged Others admitted that the plans which were popularly attributed to Montague were excellent but denied that those plans were Montague s The voice of detraction however was for a time drowned by the loud applauses of the Parliament and the City The authority which the Chancellor of the Exchequer exercised in the House of Commons was unprecedented and unrivalled In the Cabinet his influence was daily increasing He had no longer a superior at the Board of Treasury In consequence of Fenwick s confession the last Tory who held a great and efficient office in the State had been removed and there was at length a purely Whig Ministry It had been impossible to prevent reports about that confession from getting abroad The prisoner indeed had found means of communicating with his friends and had doubtless given them to understand that he had said nothing against them and much against the creatures of the usurper William wished the matter to be left to the ordinary tribunals and was most unwilling that it should be debated elsewhere But his counsellors better acquainted than himself with the temper of large and divided assemblies were of opinion that a parliamentary discussion though perhaps undesirable was inevitable It was in the power of a single member of either House to force on such a discussion and in both Houses there were members who some from a sense of duty some from mere love of mischief were determined to know whether the prisoner had as it was rumoured brought grave charges against some of the most distinguished men in the kingdom If there must be an inquiry it was surely desirable that the accused statesmen should be the first to demand it There was however one great difficulty The Whigs who formed the majority of the Lower House were ready to vote as one man for the entire absolution of Russell and Shrewsbury and had no wish to put a stigma on Marlborough who was not in place and therefore excited little jealousy But a strong body of honest gentlemen as Wharton called them could not by any management be induced to join in a resolution acquitting Godolphin To them Godolphin was an eyesore All the other Tories who in the earlier years of William s reign had borne a chief part in the direction of affairs had one by one been dismissed Nottingham Trevor Leeds were no longer in power Pembroke could hardly be called a Tory and had never been really in power But Godolphin still retained his post at Whitehall and to the men of the Revolution it seemed intolerable that one who had sate at the Council Board of Charles and James and who had voted for a Regency should be the principal minister of finance Those who felt thus had learned with malicious delight that the First Lord of the Treasury was named in the confession about which all the world was talking and they were determined not to let slip so good an opportunity of ejecting him from office On the other hand every body who had seen Fenwick s paper and who had not in the drunkenness of factious animosity lost all sense of reason and justice must have felt that it was impossible to make a distinction between two parts of that paper and to treat all that related to Shrewsbury and Russell as false and all that related to Godolphin as true This was acknowledged even by Wharton who of all public men was the least troubled by scruples or by shame seven hundred forty eight If Godolphin had stedfastly refused to quit his place the Whig leaders would have been in a most embarrassing position But a politician of no common dexterity undertook to extricate them from their difficulties In the art of reading and managing the minds of men Sunderland had no equal and he was as he had been during several years desirous to see all the great posts in the kingdom filled by Whigs By his skilful management Godolphin was induced to go into the royal closet and to request permission to retire from office and William granted that permission with a readiness by which Godolphin was much more surprised than pleased seven hundred forty nine One of the methods employed by the Whig junto for the purpose of instituting and maintaining through all the ranks of the Whig party a discipline never before known was the frequent holding of meetings of members of the House of Commons Some of those meetings were numerous others were select The larger were held at the Rose a tavern frequently mentioned in the political pasquinades of that time seven hundred fifty the smaller at Russell s in Covent Garden or at Somers s in Lincoln s Inn Fields On the day on which Godolphin resigned his great office two select meetings were called In the morning the place of assembly was Russell s house In the afternoon there was a fuller muster at the Lord Keeper s Fenwick s confession which till that time had probably been known only by rumour to most of those who were present was read The indignation of the hearers was strongly excited particularly by one passage of which the sense seemed to be that not only Russell not only Shrewsbury but the great body of the Whig party was and had long been at heart Jacobite The fellow insinuates it was said that the Assassination Plot itself was a Whig scheme The general opinion was that such a charge could not be lightly passed over There must be a solemn debate and decision in Parliament The best course would be that the King should himself see and examine the prisoner and that Russell should then request the royal permission to bring the subject before the House of Commons As Fenwick did not pretend that he had any authority for the stories which he had told except mere hearsay there could be no difficulty in carrying a resolution branding him as a slanderer and an address to the throne requesting that he might be forthwith brought to trial for high treason seven hundred fifty one The opinion of the meeting was conveyed to William by his ministers and he consented though not without reluctance to see the prisoner Fenwick was brought into the royal closet at Kensington A few of the great officers of state and the Crown lawyers were present Your papers Sir John said the King are altogether unsatisfactory Instead of giving me an account of the plots formed by you and your accomplices plots of which all the details must be exactly known to you you tell me stories without authority without date without place about noblemen and gentlemen with whom you do not pretend to have had any intercourse In short your confession appears to be a contrivance intended to screen those who are really engaged in designs against me and to make me suspect and discard those in whom I have good reason to place confidence If you look for any favour from me give me this moment and on this spot a full and straightforward account of what you know of your own knowledge Fenwick said that he was taken by surprise and asked for time No Sir said the King For what purpose can you want time You may indeed want time if you mean to draw up another paper like this But what I require is a plain narrative of what you have yourself done and seen and such a narrative you can give if you will without pen and ink Then Fenwick positively refused to say any thing Be it so said William I will neither hear you nor hear from you any more seven hundred fifty two Fenwick was carried back to his prison He had at this audience shown a boldness and determination which surprised those who had observed his demeanour He had ever since he had been in confinement appeared to be anxious and dejected yet now at the very crisis of his fate he had braved the displeasure of the Prince whose clemency he had a short time before submissively implored In a very few hours the mystery was explained Just before he had been summoned to Kensington he had received from his wife intelligence that his life was in no danger that there was only one witness against him that she and her friends had succeeded in corrupting Goodman seven hundred fifty three Goodman had been allowed a liberty which was afterwards with some reason made matter of charge against the government For his testimony was most important his character was notoriously bad the attempts which had been made to seduce Porter proved that if money could save Fenwick s life money would not be spared and Goodman had not like Porter been instrumental in sending Jacobites to the gallows and therefore was not like Porter bound to the cause of William by an indissoluble tie The families of the imprisoned conspirators employed the agency of a cunning and daring adventurer named O Brien This man knew Goodman well Indeed they had belonged to the same gang of highwaymen They met at the Dog in Drury Lane a tavern which was frequented by lawless and desperate men O Brien was accompanied by another Jacobite of determined character A simple choice was offered to Goodman to abscond and to be rewarded with an annuity of five hundred a year or to have his throat cut on the spot He consented half from cupidity half from fear O Brien was not a man to be tricked as Clancy had been He never parted company with Goodman from the moment when the bargain was struck till they were at Saint Germains seven hundred fifty four On the afternoon of the day on which Fenwick was examined by the King at Kensington it began to be noised abroad that Goodman was missing He had been many hours absent from his house He had not been seen at his usual haunts At first a suspicion arose that he had been murdered by the Jacobites and this suspicion was strengthened by a singular circumstance Just after his disappearance a human head was found severed from the body to which it belonged and so frightfully mangled that no feature could be recognised The multitude possessed by the notion that there was no crime which an Irish Papist might not be found to commit was inclined to believe that the fate of Godfrey had befallen another victim On inquiry however it seemed certain that Goodman had designedly withdrawn himself A proclamation appeared promising a reward of a thousand pounds to any person who should stop the runaway but it was too late seven hundred fifty five This event exasperated the Whigs beyond measure No jury could now find Fenwick guilty of high treason Was he then to escape Was a long series of offences against the State to go unpunished merely because to those offences had now been added the offence of bribing a witness to suppress his evidence and to desert his bail Was there no extraordinary method by which justice might strike a criminal who solely because he was worse than other criminals was beyond the reach of the ordinary law Such a method there was a method authorised by numerous precedents a method used both by Papists and by Protestants during the troubles of the sixteenth century a method used both by Roundheads and by Cavaliers during the troubles of the seventeenth century a method which scarcely any leader of the Tory party could condemn without condemning himself a method of which Fenwick could not decently complain since he had a few years before been eager to employ it against the unfortunate Monmouth To that method the party which was now supreme in the State determined to have recourse Soon after the Commons had met on the morning of the sixth of November Russell rose in his place and requested to be heard The task which he had undertaken required courage not of the most respectable kind but to him no kind of courage was wanting Sir John Fenwick he said had sent to the King a paper in which grave accusations were brought against some of His Majesty s servants and His Majesty had at the request of his accused servants graciously given orders that this paper should be laid before the House The confession was produced and read The Admiral then with spirit and dignity worthy of a better man demanded justice for himself and Shrewsbury If we are innocent clear us If we are guilty punish us as we deserve I put myself on you as on my country and am ready to stand or fall by your verdict It was immediately ordered that Fenwick should be brought to the bar with all speed Cutts who sate in the House as member for Cambridgeshire was directed to provide a sufficient escort and was especially enjoined to take care that the prisoner should have no opportunity of making or receiving any communication oral or written on the road from Newgate to Westminster The House then adjourned till the afternoon At five o clock then a late hour the mace was again put on the table candles were lighted and the House and lobby were carefully cleared of strangers Fenwick was in attendance under a strong guard He was called in and exhorted from the chair to make a full and ingenuous confession He hesitated and evaded I cannot say any thing without the King s permission His Majesty may be displeased if what ought to be known only to him should be divulged to others He was told that his apprehensions were groundless The King well knew that it was the right and the duty of his faithful Commons to inquire into whatever concerned the safety of his person and of his government I may be tried in a few days said the prisoner I ought not to be asked to say any thing which may rise up in judgment against me You have nothing to fear replied the Speaker if you will only make a full and free discovery No man ever had reason to repent of having dealt candidly with the Commons of England Then Fenwick begged for delay He was not a ready orator his memory was bad he must have time to prepare himself He was told as he had been told a few days before in the royal closet that prepared or unprepared he could not but remember the principal plots in which he had been engaged and the names of his chief accomplices If he would honestly relate what it was quite impossible that he could have forgotten the House would make all fair allowances and would grant him time to recollect subordinate details Thrice he was removed from the bar and thrice he was brought back He was solemnly informed that the opportunity then given him of earning the favour of the Commons would probably be the last He persisted in his refusal and was sent back to Newgate It was then moved that his confession was false and scandalous Coningsby proposed to add that it was a contrivance to create jealousies between the King and good subjects for the purpose of screening real traitors A few implacable and unmanageable Whigs whose hatred of Godolphin had not been mitigated by his resignation hinted their doubts whether the whole paper ought to be condemned But after a debate in which Montague particularly distinguished himself the motion was carried One or two voices cried No but nobody ventured to demand a division Thus far all had gone smoothly but in a few minutes the storm broke forth The terrible words Bill of Attainder were pronounced and all the fiercest passions of both the great factions were instantly roused The Tories had been taken by surprise and many of them had left the house Those who remained were loud in declaring that they never would consent to such a violation of the first principles of justice The spirit of the Whigs was not less ardent and their ranks were unbroken The motion for leave to bring in a bill attainting Sir John Fenwick was carried very late at night by one hundred and seventy nine votes to sixty one but it was plain that the struggle would be long and hard seven hundred fifty six In truth party spirit had seldom been more strongly excited On both sides there was doubtless much honest zeal and on both sides an observant eye might have detected fear hatred and cupidity disguised under specious pretences of justice and public good The baleful heat of faction rapidly warmed into life poisonous creeping things which had long been lying torpid discarded spies and convicted false witnesses the leavings of the scourge the branding iron and the shears Even Fuller hoped that he might again find dupes to listen to him The world had forgotten him since his pillorying He now had the effrontery to write to the Speaker begging to be heard at the bar and promising much important information about Fenwick and others On the ninth of November the Speaker informed the House that he had received this communication but the House very properly refused even to suffer the letter of so notorious a villain to be read On the same day the Bill of Attainder having been prepared by the Attorney and Solicitor General was brought in and read a first time The House was full and the debate sharp John Manley member for Bossiney one of those stanch Tories who in the preceding session had long refused to sign the Association accused the majority in no measured terms of fawning on the Court and betraying the liberties of the people His words were taken down and though he tried to explain them away he was sent to the Tower Seymour spoke strongly against the bill and quoted the speech which Caesar made in the Roman Senate against the motion that the accomplices of Catiline should be put to death in an irregular manner A Whig orator keenly remarked that the worthy Baron had forgotten that Caesar was grievously suspected of having been himself concerned in Catiline s plot seven hundred fifty seven In this stage a hundred and ninety six members voted for the bill a hundred and four against it A copy was sent to Fenwick in order that he might be prepared to defend himself He begged to be heard by counsel his request was granted and the thirteenth was fixed for the hearing Never within the memory of the oldest member had there been such a stir round the House as on the morning of the thirteenth The approaches were with some difficulty cleared and no strangers except peers were suffered to come within the doors Of peers the throng was so great that their presence had a perceptible influence on the debate Even Seymour who having formerly been Speaker ought to have been peculiarly mindful of the dignity of the Commons so strangely forgot himself as once to say My Lords Fenwick having been formally given up by the Sheriffs of London to the Serjeant at Arms was put to the bar attended by two barristers who were generally employed by Jacobite culprits Sir Thomas Powis and Sir Bartholomew Shower Counsel appointed by the House appeared in support of the bill The examination of the witnesses and the arguments of the advocates occupied three days Porter was called in and interrogated It was established not indeed by legal proof but by such moral proof as determines the conduct of men in the affairs of common life that Goodman s absence was to be attributed to a scheme planned and executed by Fenwick s friends with Fenwick s privity Secondary evidence of what Goodman if he had been present would have been able to prove was after a warm debate admitted His confession made on oath and subscribed by his hand was put in Some of the grand jurymen who had found the bill against Sir John gave an account of what Goodman had sworn before them and their testimony was confirmed by some of the petty jurymen who had convicted another conspirator No evidence was produced in behalf of the prisoner After counsel for him and against him had been heard he was sent back to his cell seven hundred fifty eight Then the real struggle began It was long and violent The House repeatedly sate from daybreak till near midnight Once the Speaker was in the chair fifteen hours without intermission Strangers were freely admitted for it was felt that since the House chose to take on itself the functions of a court of justice it ought like a court of justice to sit with open doors seven hundred fifty nine The substance of the debates has consequently been preserved in a report meagre indeed when compared with the reports of our time but for that age unusually full Every man of note in the House took part in the discussion The bill was opposed by Finch with that fluent and sonorous rhetoric which had gained him the name of Silvertongue and by Howe with all the sharpness both of his wit and of his temper by Seymour with characteristic energy and by Harley with characteristic solemnity On the other side Montague displayed the powers of a consummate debater and was zealously supported by Littleton Conspicuous in the front ranks of the hostile parties were two distinguished lawyers Simon Harcourt and William Cowper Both were gentlemen of honourable descent both were distinguished by their fine persons and graceful manners both were renowned for eloquence and both loved learning and learned men It may be added that both had early in life been noted for prodigality and love of pleasure Dissipation had made them poor poverty had made them industrious and though they were still as age is reckoned at the Inns of Court very young men Harcourt only thirty six Cowper only thirty two they already had the first practice at the bar They were destined to rise still higher to be the bearers of the great seal of the realm and the founders of patrician houses In politics they were diametrically opposed to each other Harcourt had seen the Revolution with disgust had not chosen to sit in the Convention had with difficulty reconciled his conscience to the oaths and had tardily and unwillingly signed the Association Cowper had been in arms for the Prince of Orange and a free Parliament and had in the short and tumultuary campaign which preceded the flight of James distinguished himself by intelligence and courage Since Somers had been removed to the Woolsack the law officers of the Crown had not made a very distinguished figure in the Lower House or indeed any where else and their deficiencies had been more than once supplied by Cowper His skill had at the trial of Parkyns recovered the verdict which the mismanagement of the Solicitor General had for a moment put in jeopardy He had been chosen member for Hertford at the general election of sixteen ninety five and had scarcely taken his seat when he attained a high place among parliamentary speakers Chesterfield many years later in one of his letters to his son described Cowper as an orator who never spoke without applause but who reasoned feebly and who owed the influence which he long exercised over great assemblies to the singular charm of his style his voice and his action Chesterfield was beyond all doubt intellectually qualified to form a correct judgment on such a subject But it must be remembered that the object of his letters was to exalt good taste and politeness in opposition to much higher qualities He therefore constantly and systematically attributed the success of the most eminent persons of his age to their superiority not in solid abilities and acquirements but in superficial graces of diction and manner He represented even Marlborough as a man of very ordinary capacity who solely because he was extremely well bred and well spoken had risen from poverty and obscurity to the height of power and glory It may confidently be pronounced that both to Marlborough and to Cowper Chesterfield was unjust The general who saved the Empire and conquered the Low Countries was assuredly something more than a fine gentleman and the judge who presided during nine years in the Court of Chancery with the approbation of all parties must have been something more than a fine declaimer Whoever attentively and impartially studies the report of the debates will be of opinion that on many points which were discussed at great length and with great animation the Whigs had a decided superiority in argument but that on the main question the Tories were in the right It was true that the crime of high treason was brought home to Fenwick by proofs which could leave no doubt on the mind of any man of common sense and would have been brought home to him according to the strict rules of law if he had not by committing another crime eluded the justice of the ordinary tribunals It was true that he had in the very act of professing repentance and imploring mercy added a new offence to his former offences that while pretending to make a perfectly ingenuous confession he had with cunning malice concealed every thing which it was for the interest of the government that he should divulge and proclaimed every thing which it was for the interest of the government to bury in silence It was a great evil that he should be beyond the reach of punishment it was plain that he could be reached only by a bill of pains and penalties and it could not be denied either that many such bills had passed or that no such bill had ever passed in a clearer case of guilt or after a fairer hearing All these propositions the Whigs seem to have fully established They had also a decided advantage in the dispute about the rule which requires two witnesses in cases of high treason The truth is that the rule is absurd It is impossible to understand why the evidence which would be sufficient to prove that a man has fired at one of his fellow subjects should not be sufficient to prove that he has fired at his Sovereign It can by no means be laid down as a general maxim that the assertion of two witnesses is more convincing to the mind than the assertion of one witness The story told by one witness may be in itself probable The story told by two witnesses may be extravagant The story told by one witness may be uncontradicted The story told by two witnesses may be contradicted by four witnesses The story told by one witness may be corroborated by a crowd of circumstances The story told by two witnesses may have no such corroboration The one witness may be Tillotson or Ken The two witnesses may be Oates and Bedloe The chiefs of the Tory party however vehemently maintained that the law which required two witnesses was of universal and eternal obligation part of the law of nature part of the law of God Seymour quoted the book of Numbers and the book of Deuteronomy to prove that no man ought to be condemned to death by the mouth of a single witness Caiaphas and his Sanhedrim said Harley were ready enough to set up the plea of expediency for a violation of justice they said and we have heard such things said We must slay this man or the Romans will come and take away our place and nation Yet even Caiaphas and his Sanhedrim in that foulest act of judicial murder did not venture to set aside the sacred law which required two witnesses Even Jezebel said another orator did not dare to take Naboth s vineyard from him till she had suborned two men of Belial to swear falsely If the testimony of one grave elder had been sufficient it was asked what would have become of the virtuous Susannah This last allusion called forth a cry of Apocrypha Apocrypha from the ranks of the Low Churchmen seven hundred sixty Over these arguments which in truth can scarcely have imposed on those who condescended to use them Montague obtained a complete and easy victory An eternal law Where was this eternal law before the reign of Edward the Sixth Where is it now except in statutes which relate only to one very small class of offences If these texts from the Pentateuch and these precedents from the practice of the Sanhedrim prove any thing they prove the whole criminal jurisprudence of the realm to be a mass of injustice and impiety One witness is sufficient to convict a murderer a burglar a highwayman an incendiary a ravisher Nay there are cases of high treason in which only one witness is required One witness can send to Tyburn a gang of clippers and comers Are you then prepared to say that the whole law of evidence according to which men have during ages been tried in this country for offences against life and property is vicious and ought to be remodelled If you shrink from saying this you must admit that we are now proposing to dispense not with a divine ordinance of universal and perpetual obligation but simply with an English rule of procedure which applies to not more than two or three crimes which has not been in force a hundred and fifty years which derives all its authority from an Act of Parliament and which may therefore be by another Act abrogated or suspended without offence to God or men It was much less easy to answer the chiefs of the opposition when they set forth the danger of breaking down the partition which separates the functions of the legislator from those of the judge This man it was said may be a bad Englishman and yet his cause may be the cause of all good Englishmen Only last year we passed an Act to regulate the procedure of the ordinary courts in cases of treason We passed that Act because we thought that in those courts the life of a subject obnoxious to the government was not then sufficiently secured Yet the life of a subject obnoxious to the government was then far more secure than it will be if this House takes on itself to be the supreme criminal judicature in political cases Warm eulogies were pronounced on the ancient national mode of trial by twelve good men and true and indeed the advantages of that mode of trial in political cases are obvious The prisoner is allowed to challenge any number of jurors with cause and a considerable number without cause The twelve from the moment at which they are invested with their short magistracy till the moment when they lay it down are kept separate from the rest of the community Every precaution is taken to prevent any agent of power from soliciting or corrupting them Every one of them must hear every word of the evidence and every argument used on either side The case is then summed up by a judge who knows that if he is guilty of partiality he may be called to account by the great inquest of the nation In the trial of Fenwick at the bar of the House of Commons all these securities were wanting Some hundreds of gentlemen every one of whom had much more than half made up his mind before the case was opened performed the functions both of judge and jury They were not restrained as a judge is restrained by the sense of responsibility for who was to punish a Parliament They were not selected as a jury is selected in a manner which enables the culprit to exclude his personal and political enemies The arbiters of his fate came in and went out as they chose They heard a fragment here and there of what was said against him and a fragment here and there of what was said in his favour During the progress of the bill they were exposed to every species of influence One member was threatened by the electors of his borough with the loss of his seat another might obtain a frigate for his brother from Russell the vote of a third might be secured by the caresses and Burgundy of Wharton In the debates arts were practised and passions excited which are unknown to well constituted tribunals but from which no great popular assembly divided into parties ever was or ever will be free The rhetoric of one orator called forth loud cries of Hear him Another was coughed and scraped down A third spoke against time in order that his friends who were supping might come in to divide seven hundred sixty one If the life of the most worthless man could be sported with thus was the life of the most virtuous man secure The opponents of the bill did not indeed venture to say that there could be no public danger sufficient to justify an Act of Attainder They admitted that there might be cases in which the general rule must bend to an overpowering necessity But was this such a case Even if it were granted for the sake of argument that Strafford and Monmouth were justly attainted was Fenwick like Strafford a great minister who had long ruled England north of Trent and all Ireland with absolute power who was high in the royal favour and whose capacity eloquence and resolution made him an object of dread even in his fall Or was Fenwick like Monmouth a pretender to the Crown and the idol of the common people Were all the finest youths of three counties crowding to enlist under his banners What was he but a subordinate plotter He had indeed once had good employments but he had long lost them He had once had a good estate but he had wasted it Eminent abilities and weight of character he had never had He was no doubt connected by marriage with a very noble family but that family did not share his political prejudices What importance then had he except that importance which his persecutors were most unwisely giving him by breaking through all the fences which guard the lives of Englishmen in order to destroy him Even if he were set at liberty what could he do but haunt Jacobite coffeehouses squeeze oranges and drink the health of King James and the Prince of Wales If however the government supported by the Lords and the Commons by the fleet and the army by a militia one hundred and sixty thousand strong and by the half million of men who had signed the Association did really apprehend danger from this poor ruined baronet the benefit of the Habeas Corpus Act might be withheld from him He might be kept within four walls as long as there was the least chance of his doing mischief It could hardly be contended that he was an enemy so terrible that the State could be safe only when he was in the grave It was acknowledged that precedents might be found for this bill or even for a bill far more objectionable But it was said that whoever reviewed our history would be disposed to regard such precedents rather as warnings than as examples It had many times happened that an Act of Attainder passed in a fit of servility or animosity had when fortune had changed or when passion had cooled been repealed and solemnly stigmatized as unjust Thus in old times the Act which was passed against Roger Mortimer in the paroxysm of a resentment not unprovoked had been at a calmer moment rescinded on the ground that however guilty he might have been he had not had fair play for his life Thus within the memory of the existing generation the law which attainted Strafford had been annulled without one dissentient voice Nor it was added ought it to be left unnoticed that whether by virtue of the ordinary law of cause and effect or by the extraordinary judgment of God persons who had been eager to pass bills of pains and penalties had repeatedly perished by such bills No man had ever made a more unscrupulous use of the legislative power for the destruction of his enemies than Thomas Cromwell and it was by an unscrupulous use of the legislative power that he was himself destroyed If it were true that the unhappy gentleman whose fate was now trembling in the balance had himself formerly borne a part in a proceeding similar to that which was now instituted against him was not this a fact which ought to suggest very serious reflections Those who tauntingly reminded Fenwick that he had supported the bill which attainted Monmouth might perhaps themselves be tauntingly reminded in some dark and terrible hour that they had supported the bill which had attainted Fenwick Let us remember what vicissitudes we have seen Let us from so many signal examples of the inconstancy of fortune learn moderation in prosperity How little we thought when we saw this man a favourite courtier at Whitehall a general surrounded with military pomp at Hounslow that we should live to see him standing at our bar and awaiting his doom from our lips And how far is it from certain that we may not one day in the bitterness of our souls vainly invoke the protection of those mild laws which we now treat so lightly God forbid that we should ever again be subject to tyranny But God forbid above all that our tyrants should ever be able to plead in justification of the worst that they can inflict upon us precedents furnished by ourselves These topics skilfully handled produced a great effect on many moderate Whigs Montague did his best to rally his followers We still possess the rude outline of what must have been a most effective peroration Gentlemen warn us this or very nearly this seems to have been what he said not to furnish King James with a precedent which if ever he should be restored he may use against ourselves Do they really believe that if that evil day shall ever come this just and necessary law will be the pattern which he will imitate No Sir his model will be not our bill of attainder but his own not our bill which on full proof and after a most fair hearing inflicts deserved retribution on a single guilty head but his own bill which without a defence without an investigation without an accusation doomed near three thousand people whose only crimes were their English blood and their Protestant faith the men to the gallows and the women to the stake That is the precedent which he has set and which he will follow In order that he never may be able to follow it in order that the fear of a righteous punishment may restrain those enemies of our country who wish to see him ruling in London as he ruled at Dublin I give my vote for this bill In spite of all the eloquence and influence of the ministry the minority grew stronger and stronger as the debates proceeded The question that leave should be given to bring in the bill had been carried by nearly three to one On the question that the bill should be committed the Ayes were a hundred and eighty six the Noes a hundred and twenty eight On the question that the bill should pass the Ayes were a hundred and eighty nine the Noes a hundred and fifty six On the twenty sixth of November the bill was carried up to the Lords Before it arrived the Lords had made preparations to receive it Every peer who was absent from town had been summoned up every peer who disobeyed the summons and was unable to give a satisfactory explanation of his disobedience was taken into custody by Black Rod On the day fixed for the first reading the crowd on the benches was unprecedented The whole number of temporal Lords exclusive of minors Roman Catholics and nonjurors was about a hundred and forty Of these a hundred and five were in their places Many thought that the Bishops ought to have been permitted if not required to withdraw for by an ancient canon those who ministered at the altars of God were forbidden to take any part in the infliction of capital punishment On the trial of a peer impeached of high treason the prelates always retire and leave the culprit to be absolved or condemned by laymen And surely if it be unseemly that a divine should doom his fellow creatures to death as a judge it must be still more unseemly that he should doom them to death as a legislator In the latter case as in the former he contracts that stain of blood which the Church regards with horror and it will scarcely be denied that there are some grave objections to the shedding of blood by Act of Attainder which do not apply to the shedding of blood in the ordinary course of justice In fact when the bill for taking away the life of Strafford was under consideration all the spiritual peers withdrew Now however the example of Cranmer who had voted for some of the most infamous acts of attainder that ever passed was thought more worthy of imitation and there was a great muster of lawn sleeves It was very properly resolved that on this occasion the privilege of voting by proxy should be suspended that the House should be called over at the beginning and at the end of every sitting and that every member who did not answer to his name should be taken into custody seven hundred sixty two Meanwhile the unquiet brain of Monmouth was teeming with strange designs He had now reached a time of life at which youth could no longer be pleaded as an excuse for his faults but he was more wayward and eccentric than ever Both in his intellectual and in his moral character there was an abundance of those fine qualities which may be called luxuries and a lamentable deficiency of those solid qualities which are of the first necessity He had brilliant wit and ready invention without common sense and chivalrous generosity and delicacy without common honesty He was capable of rising to the part of the Black Prince and yet he was capable of sinking to the part of Fuller His political life was blemished by some most dishonourable actions yet he was not under the influence of those motives to which most of the dishonourable actions of politicians are to be ascribed He valued power little and money less Of fear he was utterly insensible If he sometimes stooped to be a villain for no milder word will come up to the truth it was merely to amuse himself and to astonish other people In civil as in military affairs he loved ambuscades surprises night attacks He now imagined that he had a glorious opportunity of making a sensation of producing a great commotion and the temptation was irresistible to a spirit so restless as his He knew or at least strongly suspected that the stories which Fenwick had told on hearsay and which King Lords and Commons Whigs and Tories had agreed to treat as calumnies were in the main true Was it impossible to prove that they were true to cross the wise policy of William to bring disgrace at once on some of the most eminent men of both parties to throw the whole political world into inextricable confusion Nothing could be done without the help of the prisoner and with the prisoner it was impossible to communicate directly It was necessary to employ the intervention of more than one female agent The Duchess of Norfolk was a Mordaunt and Monmouth s first cousin Her gallantries were notorious and her husband had some years before tried to induce his brother nobles to pass a bill for dissolving his marriage but the attempt had been defeated in consequence partly of the zeal with which Monmouth had fought the battle of his kinswoman The lady though separated from her lord lived in a style suitable to her rank and associated with many women of fashion among others with Lady Mary Fenwick and with a relation of Lady Mary named Elizabeth Lawson By the instrumentality of the Duchess Monmouth conveyed to the prisoner several papers containing suggestions framed with much art Let Sir John such was the substance of these suggestions boldly affirm that his confession is true that he has brought accusations on hearsay indeed but not on common hearsay that he has derived his knowledge of the facts which he has asserted from the highest quarters and let him point out a mode in which his veracity may be easily brought to the test Let him pray that the Earls of Portland and Romney who are well known to enjoy the royal confidence may be called upon to declare whether they are not in possession of information agreeing with what he has related Let him pray that the King may be requested to lay before Parliament the evidence which caused the sudden disgrace of Lord Marlborough and any letters which may have been intercepted while passing between Saint Germains and Lord Godolphin Unless said Monmouth to his female agents Sir John is under a fate unless he is out of his mind he will take my counsel If he does his life and honour are safe If he does not he is a dead man Then this strange intriguer with his usual license of speech reviled William for what was in truth one of William s best titles to glory He is the worst of men He has acted basely He pretends not to believe these charges against Shrewsbury Russell Marlborough Godolphin And yet he knows and Monmouth confirmed the assertion by a tremendous oath he knows that every word of the charges is true The papers written by Monmouth were delivered by Lady Mary to her husband If the advice which they contained had been followed there can be little doubt that the object of the adviser would have been attained The King would have been bitterly mortified there would have been a general panic among public men of every party even Marlborough s serene fortitude would have been severely tried and Shrewsbury would probably have shot himself But that Fenwick would have put himself in a better situation is by no means clear Such was his own opinion He saw that the step which he was urged to take was hazardous He knew that he was urged to take that step not because it was likely to save himself but because it was certain to annoy others and he was resolved not to be Monmouth s tool On the first of December the bill went through the earliest stage without a division Then Fenwick s confession which had by the royal command been laid on the table was read and then Marlborough stood up Nobody can wonder he said that a man whose head is in danger should try to save himself by accusing others I assure Your Lordships that since the accession of his present Majesty I have had no intercourse with Sir John on any subject whatever and this I declare on my word of honour seven hundred sixty three Marlborough s assertion may have been true but it was perfectly compatible with the truth of all that Fenwick had said Godolphin went further I certainly did he said continue to the last in the service of King James and of his Queen I was esteemed by them both But I cannot think that a crime It is possible that they and those who are about them may imagine that I am still attached to their interest That I cannot help But it is utterly false that I have had any such dealings with the Court of Saint Germains as are described in the paper which Your Lordships have heard read seven hundred sixty four Fenwick was then brought in and asked whether he had any further confession to make Several peers interrogated him but to no purpose Monmouth who could not believe that the papers which he had sent to Newgate had produced no effect put in a friendly and encouraging manner several questions intended to bring out answers which would have been by no means agreeable to the accused Lords No such answer however was to be extracted from Fenwick Monmouth saw that his ingenious machinations had failed Enraged and disappointed he suddenly turned round and became more zealous for the bill than any other peer in the House Every body noticed the rapid change in his temper and manner but that change was at first imputed merely to his well known levity On the eighth of December the bill was again taken into consideration and on that day Fenwick accompanied by his counsel was in attendance But before he was called in a previous question was raised Several distinguished Tories particularly Nottingham Rochester Normanby and Leeds said that in their opinion it was idle to inquire whether the prisoner was guilty or not guilty unless the House was of opinion that he was a person so formidable that if guilty he ought to be attainted by Act of Parliament They did not wish they said to hear any evidence For even on the supposition that the evidence left no doubt of his criminality they should still think it better to leave him unpunished than to make a law for punishing him The general sense however was decidedly for proceeding seven hundred sixty five The prisoner and his counsel were allowed another week to prepare themselves and at length on the fifteenth of December the struggle commenced in earnest The debates were the longest and the hottest the divisions were the largest the protests were the most numerously signed that had ever been known in the whole history of the House of Peers Repeatedly the benches continued to be filled from ten in the morning till past midnight seven hundred sixty six The health of many lords suffered severely for the winter was bitterly cold but the majority was not disposed to be indulgent One evening Devonshire was unwell he stole away and went to bed but Black Rod was soon sent to bring him back Leeds whose constitution was extremely infirm complained loudly It is very well he said for young gentlemen to sit down to their suppers and their wine at two o clock in the morning but some of us old men are likely to be of as much use here as they and we shall soon be in our graves if we are forced to keep such hours at such a season seven hundred sixty seven So strongly was party spirit excited that this appeal was disregarded and the House continued to sit fourteen or fifteen hours a day The chief opponents of the bill were Rochester Nottingham Normanby and Leeds The chief orators on the other side were Tankerville who in spite of the deep stains which a life singularly unfortunate had left on his public and private character always spoke with an eloquence which riveted the attention of his hearers Burnet who made a great display of historical learning Wharton whose lively and familiar style of speaking acquired in the House of Commons sometimes shocked the formality of the Lords and Monmouth who had always carried the liberty of debate to the verge of licentiousness and who now never opened his lips without inflicting a wound on the feelings of some adversary A very few nobles of great weight Devonshire Dorset Pembroke and Ormond formed a third party They were willing to use the Bill of Attainder as an instrument of torture for the purpose of wringing a full confession out of the prisoner But they were determined not to give a final vote for sending him to the scaffold The first division was on the question whether secondary evidence of what Goodman could have proved should be admitted On this occasion Burnet closed the debate by a powerful speech which none of the Tory orators could undertake to answer without premeditation A hundred and twenty six lords were present a number unprecedented in our history There were seventy three Contents and fifty three Not Contents Thirty six of the minority protested against the decision of the House seven hundred sixty eight The next great trial of strength was on the question whether the bill should be read a second time The debate was diversified by a curious episode Monmouth in a vehement declamation threw some severe and well merited reflections on the memory of the late Lord Jeffreys The title and part of the ill gotten wealth of Jeffreys had descended to his son a dissolute lad who had lately come of age and who was then sitting in the House The young man fired at hearing his father reviled The House was forced to interfere and to make both the disputants promise that the matter should go no further On this day a hundred and twenty eight peers were present The second reading was carried by seventy three to fifty five and forty nine of the fifty five protested seven hundred sixty nine It was now thought by many that Fenwick s courage would give way It was known that he was very unwilling to die Hitherto he might have flattered himself with hopes that the bill would miscarry But now that it had passed one House and seemed certain to pass the other it was probable that he would save himself by disclosing all that he knew He was again put to the bar and interrogated He refused to answer on the ground that his answers might be used against him by the Crown at the Old Bailey He was assured that the House would protect him but he pretended that this assurance was not sufficient the House was not always sitting he might be brought to trial during a recess and hanged before their Lordships met again The royal word alone he said would be a complete guarantee The Peers ordered him to be removed and immediately resolved that Wharton should go to Kensington and should entreat His Majesty to give the pledge which the prisoner required Wharton hastened to Kensington and hastened back with a gracious answer Fenwick was again placed at the bar The royal word he was told had been passed that nothing which he might say there should be used against him in any other place Still he made difficulties He might confess all that he knew and yet might be told that he was still keeping something back In short he would say nothing till he had a pardon He was then for the last time solemnly cautioned from the Woolsack He was assured that if he would deal ingenuously with the Lords they would be intercessors for him at the foot of the throne and that their intercession would not be unsuccessful If he continued obstinate they would proceed with the bill A short interval was allowed him for consideration and he was then required to give his final answer I have given it he said I have no security If I had I should be glad to satisfy the House He was then carried back to his cell and the Peers separated having sate far into the night seven hundred seventy At noon they met again The third reading was moved Tenison spoke for the bill with more ability than was expected from him and Monmouth with as much sharpness as in the previous debates But Devonshire declared that he could go no further He had hoped that fear would induce Fenwick to make a frank confession that hope was at an end the question now was simply whether this man should be put to death by an Act of Parliament and to that question Devonshire said that he must answer Not Content It is not easy to understand on what principle he can have thought himself justified in threatening to do what he did not think himself justified in doing He was however followed by Dorset Ormond Pembroke and two or three others Devonshire in the name of his little party and Rochester in the name of the Tories offered to waive all objections to the mode of proceeding if the penalty were reduced from death to perpetual imprisonment But the majority though weakened by the defection of some considerable men was still a majority and would hear of no terms of compromise The third reading was carried by only sixty eight votes to sixty one Fifty three Lords recorded their dissent and forty one subscribed a protest in which the arguments against the bill were ably summed up seven hundred seventy one The peers whom Fenwick had accused took different sides Marlborough steadily voted with the majority and induced Prince George to do the same Godolphin as steadily voted with the minority but with characteristic wariness abstained from giving any reasons for his votes No part of his life warrants us in ascribing his conduct to any exalted motive It is probable that having been driven from office by the Whigs and forced to take refuge among the Tories he thought it advisable to go with his party seven hundred seventy two As soon as the bill had been read a third time the attention of the Peers was called to a matter which deeply concerned the honour of their order Lady Mary Fenwick had been not unnaturally moved to the highest resentment by the conduct of Monmouth He had after professing a great desire to save her husband suddenly turned round and become the most merciless of her husband s persecutors and all this solely because the unfortunate prisoner would not suffer himself to be used as an instrument for the accomplishing of a wild scheme of mischief She might be excused for thinking that revenge would be sweet In her rage she showed to her kinsman the Earl of Carlisle the papers which she had received from the Duchess of Norfolk Carlisle brought the subject before the Lords The papers were produced Lady Mary declared that she had received them from the Duchess The Duchess declared that she had received them from Monmouth Elizabeth Lawson confirmed the evidence of her two friends All the bitter things which the petulant Earl had said about William were repeated The rage of both the great factions broke forth with ungovernable violence The Whigs were exasperated by discovering that Monmouth had been secretly labouring to bring to shame and ruin two eminent men with whose reputation the reputation of the whole party was bound up The Tories accused him of dealing treacherously and cruelly by the prisoner and the prisoner s wife Both among the Whigs and among the Tories Monmouth had by his sneers and invectives made numerous personal enemies whom fear of his wit and of his sword had hitherto kept in awe seven hundred seventy three All these enemies were now openmouthed against him There was great curiosity to know what he would be able to say in his defence His eloquence the correspondent of the States General wrote had often annoyed others He would now want it all to protect himself seven hundred seventy four That eloquence indeed was of a kind much better suited to attack than to defence Monmouth spoke near three hours in a confused and rambling manner boasted extravagantly of his services and sacrifices told the House that he had borne a great part in the Revolution that he had made four voyages to Holland in the evil times that he had since refused great places that he had always held lucre in contempt I he said turning significantly to Nottingham have bought no great estate I have built no palace I am twenty thousand pounds poorer than when I entered public life My old hereditary mansion is ready to fall about my ears Who that remembers what I have done and suffered for His Majesty will believe that I would speak disrespectfully of him He solemnly declared and this was the most serious of the many serious faults of his long and unquiet life that he had nothing to do with the papers which had caused so much scandal The Papists he said hated him they had laid a scheme to ruin him his ungrateful kinswoman had consented to be their implement and had requited the strenuous efforts which he had made in defence of her honour by trying to blast his When he concluded there was a long silence He asked whether their Lordships wished him to withdraw Then Leeds to whom he had once professed a strong attachment but whom he had deserted with characteristic inconstancy and assailed with characteristic petulance seized the opportunity of revenging himself It is quite unnecessary the shrewd old statesman said that the noble Earl should withdraw at present The question which we have now to decide is merely whether these papers do or do not deserve our censure Who wrote them is a question which may be considered hereafter It was then moved and unanimously resolved that the papers were scandalous and that the author had been guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour Monmouth himself was by these dexterous tactics forced to join in condemning his own compositions seven hundred seventy five Then the House proceeded to consider the charge against him The character of his cousin the Duchess did not stand high but her testimony was confirmed both by direct and by circumstantial evidence Her husband said with sour pleasantry that he gave entire faith to what she had deposed My Lord Monmouth thought her good enough to be wife to me and if she is good enough to be wife to me I am sure that she is good enough to be a witness against him In a House of near eighty peers only eight or ten seemed inclined to show any favour to Monmouth He was pronounced guilty of the act of which he had in the most solemn manner protested that he was innocent he was sent to the Tower he was turned out of all his places and his name was struck out of the Council Book seven hundred seventy six It might well have been thought that the ruin of his fame and of his fortunes was irreparable But there was about his nature an elasticity which nothing could subdue In his prison indeed he was as violent as a falcon just caged and would if he had been long detained have died of mere impatience His only solace was to contrive wild and romantic schemes for extricating himself from his difficulties and avenging himself on his enemies When he regained his liberty he stood alone in the world a dishonoured man more hated by the Whigs than any Tory and by the Tories than any Whig and reduced to such poverty that he talked of retiring to the country living like a farmer and putting his Countess into the dairy to churn and to make cheeses Yet even after this fall that mounting spirit rose again and rose higher than ever When he next appeared before the world he had inherited the earldom of the head of his family he had ceased to be called by the tarnished name of Monmouth and he soon added new lustre to the name of Peterborough He was still all air and fire His ready wit and his dauntless courage made him formidable some amiable qualities which contrasted strangely with his vices and some great exploits of which the effect was heightened by the careless levity with which they were performed made him popular and his countrymen were willing to forget that a hero of whose achievements they were proud and who was not more distinguished by parts and valour than by courtesy and generosity had stooped to tricks worthy of the pillory It is interesting and instructive to compare the fate of Shrewsbury with the fate of Peterborough The honour of Shrewsbury was safe He had been triumphantly acquitted of the charges contained in Fenwick s confession He was soon afterwards still more triumphantly acquitted of a still more odious charge A wretched spy named Matthew Smith who thought that he had not been sufficiently rewarded and was bent on being revenged affirmed that Shrewsbury had received early information of the Assassination Plot but had suppressed that information and had taken no measures to prevent the conspirators from accomplishing their design That this was a foul calumny no person who has examined the evidence can doubt The King declared that he could himself prove his minister s innocence and the Peers after examining Smith pronounced the accusation unfounded Shrewsbury was cleared as far as it was in the power of the Crown and of the Parliament to clear him He had power and wealth the favour of the King and the favour of the people No man had a greater number of devoted friends He was the idol of the Whigs yet he was not personally disliked by the Tories It should seem that his situation was one which Peterborough might well have envied But happiness and misery are from within Peterborough had one of those minds of which the deepest wounds heal and leave no scar Shrewsbury had one of those minds in which the slightest scratch may fester to the death He had been publicly accused of corresponding with Saint Germains and though King Lords and Commons had pronounced him innocent his conscience told him that he was guilty The praises which he knew that he had not deserved sounded to him like reproaches He never regained his lost peace of mind He left office but one cruel recollection accompanied him into retirement He left England but one cruel recollection pursued him over the Alps and the Apennines On a memorable day indeed big with the fate of his country he again after many inactive and inglorious years stood forth the Shrewsbury of sixteen eighty eight Scarcely any thing in history is more melancholy than that late and solitary gleam lighting up the close of a life which had dawned so splendidly and which had so early become hopelessly troubled and gloomy On the day on which the Lords passed the Bill of Attainder they adjourned over the Christmas holidays The fate of Fenwick consequently remained during more than a fortnight in suspense In the interval plans of escape were formed and it was thought necessary to place a strong military guard round Newgate seven hundred seventy seven Some Jacobites knew William so little as to send him anonymous letters threatening that he should be shot or stabbed if he dared to touch a hair of the prisoner s head seven hundred seventy eight On the morning of the eleventh of January he passed the bill He at the same time passed a bill which authorised the government to detain Bernardi and some other conspirators in custody during twelve months On the evening of that day a deeply mournful event was the talk of all London The Countess of Aylesbury had watched with intense anxiety the proceedings against Sir John Her lord had been as deep as Sir John in treason was like Sir John in confinement and had like Sir John been a party to Goodman s flight She had learned with dismay that there was a method by which a criminal who was beyond the reach of the ordinary law might be punished Her terror had increased at every stage in the progress of the Bill of Attainder On the day on which the royal assent was to be given her agitation became greater than her frame could support When she heard the sound of the guns which announced that the King was on his way to Westminster she fell into fits and died in a few hours seven hundred seventy nine Even after the bill had become law strenuous efforts were made to save Fenwick His wife threw herself at William s feet and offered him a petition He took the petition and said very gently that it should be considered but that the matter was one of public concern and that he must deliberate with his ministers before he decided seven hundred eighty She then addressed herself to the Lords She told them that her husband had not expected his doom that he had not had time to prepare himself for death that he had not during his long imprisonment seen a divine They were easily induced to request that he might be respited for a week A respite was granted but forty eight hours before it expired Lady Mary presented to the Lords another petition imploring them to intercede with the King that her husband s punishment might be commuted to banishment The House was taken by surprise and a motion to adjourn was with difficulty carried by two votes seven hundred eighty one On the morrow the last day of Fenwick s life a similar petition was presented to the Commons But the Whig leaders were on their guard the attendance was full and a motion for reading the Orders of the Day was carried by a hundred and fifty two to a hundred and seven seven hundred eighty two In truth neither branch of the legislature could without condemning itself request William to spare Fenwick s life Jurymen who have in the discharge of a painful duty pronounced a culprit guilty may with perfect consistency recommend him to the favourable consideration of the Crown But the Houses ought not to have passed the Bill of Attainder unless they were convinced not merely that Sir John had committed high treason but also that he could not without serious danger to the Commonwealth be suffered to live He could not be at once a proper object of such a bill and a proper object of the royal mercy On the twenty eighth of January the execution took place In compliment to the noble families with which Fenwick was connected orders were given that the ceremonial should be in all respects the same as when a peer of the realm suffers death A scaffold was erected on Tower Hill and hung with black The prisoner was brought from Newgate in the coach of his kinsman the Earl of Carlisle which was surrounded by a troop of the Life Guards Though the day was cold and stormy the crowd of spectators was immense but there was no disturbance and no sign that the multitude sympathized with the criminal He behaved with a firmness which had not been expected from him He ascended the scaffold with steady steps and bowed courteously to the persons who were assembled on it but spoke to none except White the deprived Bishop of Peterborough White prayed with him during about half an hour In the prayer the King was commended to the Divine protection but no name which could give offence was pronounced Fenwick then delivered a sealed paper to the Sheriffs took leave of the Bishop knelt down laid his neck on the block and exclaimed Lord Jesus receive my soul His head was severed from his body at a single blow His remains were placed in a rich coffin and buried that night by torchlight under the pavement of Saint Martin s Church No person has since that day suffered death in England by Act of Attainder seven hundred eighty three Meanwhile an important question about which public feeling was much excited had been under discussion As soon as the Parliament met a Bill for Regulating Elections differing little in substance from the bill which the King had refused to pass in the preceding session was brought into the House of Commons was eagerly welcomed by the country gentlemen and was pushed through every stage On the report it was moved that five thousand pounds in personal estate should be a sufficient qualification for the representative of a city or borough But this amendment was rejected On the third reading a rider was added which permitted a merchant possessed of five thousand pounds to represent the town in which he resided but it was provided that no person should be considered as a merchant because he was a proprietor of Bank Stock or East India Stock The fight was hard Cowper distinguished himself among the opponents of the bill His sarcastic remarks on the hunting hawking boors who wished to keep in their own hands the whole business of legislation called forth some sharp rustic retorts A plain squire he was told was as likely to serve the country well as the most fluent gownsman who was ready for a guinea to prove that black was white On the question whether the bill should pass the Ayes were two hundred the Noes a hundred and sixty seven hundred eighty four The Lords had twelve months before readily agreed to a similar bill but they had since reconsidered the subject and changed their opinion The truth is that if a law requiring every member of the House of Commons to possess an estate of some hundreds of pounds a year in land could have been strictly enforced such a law would have been very advantageous to country gentlemen of moderate property but would have been by no means advantageous to the grandees of the realm A lord of a small manor would have stood for the town in the neighbourhood of which his family had resided during centuries without any apprehension that he should be opposed by some alderman of London whom the electors had never seen before the day of nomination and whose chief title to their favour was a pocketbook full of bank notes But a great nobleman who had an estate of fifteen or twenty thousand pounds a year and who commanded two or three boroughs would no longer be able to put his younger son his younger brother his man of business into Parliament or to earn a garter or a step in the peerage by finding a seat for a Lord of the Treasury or an Attorney General On this occasion therefore the interest of the chiefs of the aristocracy Norfolk and Somerset Newcastle and Bedford Pembroke and Dorset coincided with that of the wealthy traders of the City and of the clever young aspirants of the Temple and was diametrically opposed to the interest of a squire of a thousand or twelve hundred a year On the day fixed for the second reading the attendance of lords was great Several petitions from constituent bodies which thought it hard that a new restriction should be imposed on the exercise of the elective franchise were presented and read After a debate of some hours the bill was rejected by sixty two votes to thirty seven seven hundred eighty five Only three days later a strong party in the Commons burning with resentment proposed to tack the bill which the Peers had just rejected to the Land Tax Bill This motion would probably have been carried had not Foley gone somewhat beyond the duties of his place and under pretence of speaking to order shown that such a tack would be without a precedent in parliamentary history When the question was put the Ayes raised so loud a cry that it was believed that they were the majority but on a division they proved to be only a hundred and thirty five The Noes were a hundred and sixty three seven hundred eighty six Other parliamentary proceedings of this session deserve mention While the Commons were busily engaged in the great work of restoring the finances an incident took place which seemed during a short time likely to be fatal to the infant liberty of the press but which eventually proved the means of confirming that liberty Among the many newspapers which had been established since the expiration of the censorship was one called the Flying Post The editor John Salisbury was the tool of a band of stockjobbers in the City whose interest it happened to be to cry down the public securities He one day published a false and malicious paragraph evidently intended to throw suspicion on the Exchequer Bills On the credit of the Exchequer Bills depended at that moment the political greatness and the commercial prosperity of the realm The House of Commons was in a flame The Speaker issued his warrant against Salisbury It was resolved without a division that a bill should be brought in to prohibit the publishing of news without a license Forty eight hours later the bill was presented and read But the members had now had time to cool There was scarcely one of them whose residence in the country had not during the preceding summer been made more agreeable by the London journals Meagre as those journals may seem to a person who has the Times daily on his breakfast table they were to that generation a new and abundant source of pleasure No Devonshire or Yorkshire gentleman Whig or Tory could bear the thought of being again dependent during seven months of every year for all information about what was doing in the world on newsletters If the bill passed the sheets which were now so impatiently expected twice a week at every country seat in the kingdom would contain nothing but what it suited the Secretary of State to make public they would be in fact so many London Gazettes and the most assiduous reader of the London Gazette might be utterly ignorant of the most important events of his time A few voices however were raised in favour of a censorship These papers it was said frequently contain mischievous matter Then why are they not prosecuted was the answer Has the Attorney General filed an information against any one of them And is it not absurd to ask us to give a new remedy by statute when the old remedy afforded by the common law has never been tried On the question whether the bill should be read a second time the Ayes were only sixteen the Noes two hundred seven hundred eighty seven Another bill which fared better ought to be noticed as an instance of the slow but steady progress of civilisation The ancient immunities enjoyed by some districts of the capital of which the largest and the most infamous was Whitefriars had produced abuses which could no longer be endured The Templars on one side of Alsatia and the citizens on the other had long been calling on the government and the legislature to put down so monstrous a nuisance Yet still bounded on the west by the great school of English jurisprudence and on the east by the great mart of English trade stood this labyrinth of squalid tottering houses close packed every one from cellar to cockloft with outcasts whose life was one long war with society The best part of the population consisted of debtors who were in fear of bailiffs The rest were attorneys struck off the roll witnesses who carried straw in their shoes as a sign to inform the public where a false oath might be procured for half a crown sharpers receivers of stolen goods clippers of coin forgers of bank notes and tawdry women blooming with paint and brandy who in their anger made free use of their nails and their scissors yet whose anger was less to be dreaded than their kindness With these wretches the narrow alleys of the sanctuary swarmed The rattling of dice the call for more punch and more wine and the noise of blasphemy and ribald song never ceased during the whole night The benchers of the Inner Temple could bear the scandal and the annoyance no longer They ordered the gate leading into Whitefriars to be bricked up The Alsatians mustered in great force attacked the workmen killed one of them pulled down the wall knocked down the Sheriff who came to keep the peace and carried off his gold chain which no doubt was soon in the melting pot The riot was not suppressed till a company of the Foot Guards arrived This outrage excited general indignation The City indignant at the outrage offered to the Sheriff cried loudly for justice Yet so difficult was it to execute any process in the dens of Whitefriars that near two years elapsed before a single ringleader was apprehended seven hundred eighty eight The Savoy was another place of the same kind smaller indeed and less renowned but inhabited by a not less lawless population An unfortunate tailor who ventured to go thither for the purpose of demanding payment of a debt was set upon by the whole mob of cheats ruffians and courtesans He offered to give a full discharge to his debtor and a treat to the rabble but in vain He had violated their franchises and this crime was not to be pardoned He was knocked down stripped tarred feathered A rope was tied round his waist He was dragged naked up and down the streets amidst yells of A bailiff A bailiff Finally he was compelled to kneel down and to curse his father and mother Having performed this ceremony he was permitted and the permission was blamed by many of the Savoyards to limp home without a rag upon him seven hundred eighty nine The Bog of Allen the passes of the Grampians were not more unsafe than this small knot of lanes surrounded by the mansions of the greatest nobles of a flourishing and enlightened kingdom At length in sixteen ninety seven a bill for abolishing the franchises of these places passed both Houses and received the royal assent The Alsatians and Savoyards were furious Anonymous letters containing menaces of assassination were received by members of Parliament who had made themselves conspicuous by the zeal with which they had supported the bill but such threats only strengthened the general conviction that it was high time to destroy these nests of knaves and ruffians A fortnight s grace was allowed and it was made known that when that time had expired the vermin who had been the curse of London would be unearthed and hunted without mercy There was a tumultuous flight to Ireland to France to the Colonies to vaults and garrets in less notorious parts of the capital and when on the prescribed day the Sheriff s officers ventured to cross the boundary they found those streets where a few weeks before the cry of A writ would have drawn together a thousand raging bullies and vixens as quiet as the cloister of a cathedral seven hundred ninety On the sixteenth of April the King closed the session with a speech in which he returned warm and well merited thanks to the Houses for the firmness and wisdom which had rescued the nation from commercial and financial difficulties unprecedented in our history Before he set out for the Continent he conferred some new honours and made some new ministerial arrangements Every member of the Whig junto was distinguished by some conspicuous mark of royal favour Somers delivered up the seal of which he was Keeper he received it back again with the higher title of Chancellor and was immediately commanded to affix it to a patent by which he was created Baron Somers of Evesham seven hundred ninety one Russell became Earl of Orford and Viscount Barfleur No English title had ever before been taken from a place of battle lying within a foreign territory But the precedent then set has been repeatedly followed and the names of Saint Vincent Trafalgar Camperdown and Douro are now borne by the successors of great commanders Russell seems to have accepted his earldom after his fashion not only without gratitude but grumblingly and as if some great wrong had been done him What was a coronet to him He had no child to inherit it The only distinction which he should have prized was the garter and the garter had been given to Portland Of course such things were for the Dutch and it was strange presumption in an Englishman though he might have won a victory which had saved the State to expect that his pretensions would be considered till all the Mynheers about the palace had been served seven hundred ninety two Wharton still retaining his place of Comptroller of the Household obtained the lucrative office of Chief Justice in Eyre South of Trent and his brother Godwin Wharton was made a Lord of the Admiralty seven hundred ninety three Though the resignation of Godolphin had been accepted in October no new commission of Treasury was issued till after the prorogation Who should be First Commissioner was a question long and fiercely disputed For Montague s faults had made him many enemies and his merits many more Dull formalists sneered at him as a wit and poet who no doubt showed quick parts in debate but who had already been raised far higher than his services merited or than his brain would bear It would be absurd to place such a young coxcomb merely because he could talk fluently and cleverly in an office on which the wellbeing of the kingdom depended Surely Sir Stephen Fox was of all the Lords of the Treasury the fittest to be at the head of the Board He was an elderly man grave experienced exact laborious and he had never made a verse in his life The King hesitated during a considerable time between the two candidates but time was all in Montague s favour for from the first to the last day of the session his fame was constantly rising The voice of the House of Commons and of the City loudly designated him as preeminently qualified to be the chief minister of finance At length Sir Stephen Fox withdrew from the competition though not with a very good grace He wished it to be notified in the London Gazette that the place of First Lord had been offered to him and declined by him Such a notification would have been an affront to Montague and Montague flushed with prosperity and glory was not in a mood to put up with affronts The dispute was compromised Montague became First Lord of the Treasury and the vacant seat at the Board was filled by Sir Thomas Littleton one of the ablest and most consistent Whigs in the House of Commons But from tenderness to Fox these promotions were not announced in the Gazette seven hundred ninety four Dorset resigned the office of Chamberlain but not in ill humour and retired loaded with marks of royal favour He was succeeded by Sunderland who was also appointed one of the Lords Justices not without much murmuring from various quarters seven hundred ninety five To the Tories Sunderland was an object of unmixed detestation Some of the Whig leaders had been unable to resist his insinuating address and others were grateful for the services which he had lately rendered to the party But the leaders could not restrain their followers Plain men who were zealous for civil liberty and for the Protestant religion who were beyond the range of Sunderland s irresistible fascination and who knew that he had sate in the High Commission concurred in the Declaration of Indulgence borne witness against the Seven Bishops and received the host from a Popish priest could not without indignation and shame see him standing with the staff in his hand close to the throne Still more monstrous was it that such a man should be entrusted with the administration of the government during the absence of the Sovereign William did not understand these feelings Sunderland was able he was useful he was unprincipled indeed but so were all the English politicians of the generation which had learned under the sullen tyranny of the Saints to disbelieve in virtue and which had during the wild jubilee of the Restoration been utterly dissolved in vice He was a fair specimen of his class a little worse perhaps than Leeds or Godolphin and about as bad as Russell or Marlborough Why he was to be hunted from the herd the King could not imagine Notwithstanding the discontent which was caused by Sunderland s elevation England was during this summer perfectly quiet and in excellent temper All but the fanatical Jacobites were elated by the rapid revival of trade and by the near prospect of peace Nor were Ireland and Scotland less tranquil In Ireland nothing deserving to be minutely related had taken place since Sidney had ceased to be Lord Lieutenant The government had suffered the colonists to domineer unchecked over the native population and the colonists had in return been profoundly obsequious to the government The proceedings of the local legislature which sate at Dublin had been in no respect more important or more interesting than the proceedings of the Assembly of Barbadoes Perhaps the most momentous event in the parliamentary history of Ireland at this time was a dispute between the two Houses which was caused by a collision between the coach of the Speaker and the coach of the Chancellor There were indeed factions but factions which sprang merely from personal pretensions and animosities The names of Whig and Tory had been carried across Saint George s Channel but had in the passage lost all their meaning A man who was called a Tory at Dublin would have passed at Westminster for as stanch a Whig as Wharton The highest Churchmen in Ireland abhorred and dreaded Popery so much that they were disposed to consider every Protestant as a brother They remembered the tyranny of James the robberies the burnings the confiscations the brass money the Act of Attainder with bitter resentment They honoured William as their deliverer and preserver Nay they could not help feeling a certain respect even for the memory of Cromwell for whatever else he might have been he had been the champion and the avenger of their race Between the divisions of England therefore and the divisions of Ireland there was scarcely any thing in common In England there were two parties of the same race and religion contending with each other In Ireland there were two castes of different races and religions one trampling on the other Scotland too was quiet The harvest of the last year had indeed been scanty and there was consequently much suffering But the spirit of the nation was buoyed up by wild hopes destined to end in cruel disappointment A magnificent daydream of wealth and empire so completely occupied the minds of men that they hardly felt the present distress How that dream originated and by how terrible an awakening it was broken will be related hereafter In the autumn of sixteen ninety six the Estates of Scotland met at Edinburgh The attendance was thin and the session lasted only five weeks A supply amounting to little more than a hundred thousand pounds sterling was voted Two Acts for the securing of the government were passed One of those Acts required all persons in public trust to sign an Association similar to the Association which had been so generally subscribed in the south of the island The other Act provided that the Parliament of Scotland should not be dissolved by the death of the King But by far the most important event of this short session was the passing of the Act for the settling of Schools By this memorable law it was in the Scotch phrase statuted and ordained that every parish in the realm should provide a commodious schoolhouse and should pay a moderate stipend to a schoolmaster The effect could not be immediately felt But before one generation had passed away it began to be evident that the common people of Scotland were superior in intelligence to the common people of any other country in Europe To whatever land the Scotchman might wander to whatever calling he might betake himself in America or in India in trade or in war the advantage which he derived from his early training raised him above his competitors If he was taken into a warehouse as a porter he soon became foreman If he enlisted in the army he soon became a serjeant Scotland meanwhile in spite of the barrenness of her soil and the severity of her climate made such progress in agriculture in manufactures in commerce in letters in science in all that constitutes civilisation as the Old World had never seen equalled and as even the New World has scarcely seen surpassed This wonderful change is to be attributed not indeed solely but principally to the national system of education But to the men by whom that system was established posterity owes no gratitude They knew not what they were doing They were the unconscious instruments of enlightening the understandings and humanising the hearts of millions But their own understandings were as dark and their own hearts as obdurate as those of the Familiars of the Inquisition at Lisbon In the very month in which the Act for the settling of Schools was touched with the sceptre the rulers of the Church and State in Scotland began to carry on with vigour two persecutions worthy of the tenth century a persecution of witches and a persecution of infidels A crowd of wretches guilty only of being old and miserable were accused of trafficking with the devil The Privy Council was not ashamed to issue a Commission for the trial of twenty two of these poor creatures seven hundred ninety six The shops of the booksellers of Edinburgh were strictly searched for heretical works Impious books among which the sages of the Presbytery ranked Thomas Burnet s Sacred Theory of the Earth were strictly suppressed seven hundred ninety seven But the destruction of mere paper and sheepskin would not satisfy the bigots Their hatred required victims who could feel and was not appeased till they had perpetrated a crime such as has never since polluted the island A student of eighteen named Thomas Aikenhead whose habits were studious and whose morals were irreproachable had in the course of his reading met with some of the ordinary arguments against the Bible He fancied that he had lighted on a mine of wisdom which had been hidden from the rest of mankind and with the conceit from which half educated lads of quick parts are seldom free proclaimed his discoveries to four or five of his companions Trinity in unity he said was as much a contradiction as a square circle Ezra was the author of the Pentateuch The Apocalypse was an allegorical book about the philosopher s stone Moses had learned magic in Egypt Christianity was a delusion which would not last till the year eighteen hundred For this wild talk of which in all probability he would himself have been ashamed long before he was five and twenty he was prosecuted by the Lord Advocate The Lord Advocate was that James Stewart who had been so often a Whig and so often a Jacobite that it is difficult to keep an account of his apostasies He was now a Whig for the third if not for the fourth time Aikenhead might undoubtedly have been by the law of Scotland punished with imprisonment till he should retract his errors and do penance before the congregation of his parish and every man of sense and humanity would have thought this a sufficient punishment for the prate of a forward boy But Stewart as cruel as he was base called for blood There was among the Scottish statutes one which made it a capital crime to revile or curse the Supreme Being or any person of the Trinity Nothing that Aikenhead had said could without the most violent straining be brought within the scope of this statute But the Lord Advocate exerted all his subtlety The poor youth at the bar had no counsel He was altogether unable to do justice to his own cause He was convicted and sentenced to be hanged and buried at the foot of the gallows It was in vain that he with tears abjured his errors and begged piteously for mercy Some of those who saw him in his dungeon believed that his recantation was sincere and indeed it is by no means improbable that in him as in many other pretenders to philosophy who imagine that they have completely emancipated themselves from the religion of their childhood the near prospect of death may have produced an entire change of sentiment He petitioned the Privy Council that if his life could not be spared he might be allowed a short respite to make his peace with the God whom he had offended Some of the Councillors were for granting this small indulgence Others thought that it ought not to be granted unless the ministers of Edinburgh would intercede The two parties were evenly balanced and the question was decided against the prisoner by the casting vote of the Chancellor The Chancellor was a man who has been often mentioned in the course of this history and never mentioned with honour He was that Sir Patrick Hume whose disputatious and factious temper had brought ruin on the expedition of Argyle and had caused not a little annoyance to the government of William In the Club which had braved the King and domineered over the Parliament there had been no more noisy republican But a title and a place had produced a wonderful conversion Sir Patrick was now Lord Polwarth he had the custody of the Great Seal of Scotland he presided in the Privy Council and thus he had it in his power to do the worst action of his bad life It remained to be seen how the clergy of Edinburgh would act That divines should be deaf to the entreaties of a penitent who asks not for pardon but for a little more time to receive their instructions and to pray to Heaven for the mercy which cannot be extended to him on earth seems almost incredible Yet so it was The ministers demanded not only the poor boy s death but his speedy death though it should be his eternal death Even from their pulpits they cried out for cutting him off It is probable that their real reason for refusing him a respite of a few days was their apprehension that the circumstances of his case might be reported at Kensington and that the King who while reciting the Coronation Oath had declared from the throne that he would not be a persecutor might send down positive orders that the sentence should not be executed Aikenhead was hanged between Edinburgh and Leith He professed deep repentance and suffered with the Bible in his hand The people of Edinburgh though assuredly not disposed to think lightly of his offence were moved to compassion by his youth by his penitence and by the cruel haste with which he was hurried out of the world It seems that there was some apprehension of a rescue for a strong body of fusileers was under arms to support the civil power The preachers who were the boy s murderers crowded round him at the gallows and while he was struggling in the last agony insulted Heaven with prayers more blasphemous than any thing that he had ever uttered Wodrow has told no blacker story of Dundee seven hundred ninety eight On the whole the British islands had not during ten years been so free from internal troubles as when William at the close of April sixteen ninety seven set out for the Continent The war in the Netherlands was a little and but a little less languid than in the preceding year The French generals opened the campaign by taking the small town of Aeth They then meditated a far more important conquest They made a sudden push for Brussels and would probably have succeeded in their design but for the activity of William He was encamped on ground which lies within sight of the Lion of Waterloo when he received late in the evening intelligence that the capital of the Netherlands was in danger He instantly put his forces in motion marched all night and having traversed the field destined to acquire a hundred and eighteen years later a terrible renown and threaded the long defiles of the Forest of Soignies he was at ten in the morning on the spot from which Brussels had been bombarded two years before and would if he had been only three hours later have been bombarded again Here he surrounded himself with entrenchments which the enemy did not venture to attack This was the most important military event which during that summer took place in the Low Countries In both camps there was an unwillingness to run any great risk on the eve of a general pacification Lewis had early in the spring for the first time during his long reign spontaneously offered equitable and honourable conditions to his foes He had declared himself willing to relinquish the conquests which he had made in the course of the war to cede Lorraine to its own Duke to give back Luxemburg to Spain to give back Strasburg to the Empire and to acknowledge the existing government of England seven hundred ninety nine Those who remembered the great woes which his faithless and merciless ambition had brought on Europe might well suspect that this unwonted moderation was not to be ascribed to sentiments of justice or humanity But whatever might be his motive for proposing such terms it was plainly the interest and the duty of the Confederacy to accept them For there was little hope indeed of wringing from him by war concessions larger than those which he now tendered as the price of peace The most sanguine of his enemies could hardly expect a long series of campaigns as successful as the campaign of sixteen ninety five Yet in a long series of campaigns as successful as that of sixteen ninety five the allies would hardly be able to retake all that he now professed himself ready to restore William who took as usual a clear and statesmanlike view of the whole situation now gave his voice as decidedly for concluding peace as he had in former years given it for vigorously prosecuting the war and he was backed by the public opinion both of England and of Holland But unhappily just at the time when the two powers which alone among the members of the coalition had manfully done their duty in the long struggle were beginning to rejoice in the near prospect of repose some of those governments which had never furnished their full contingents which had never been ready in time which had been constantly sending excuses in return for subsidies began to raise difficulties such as seemed likely to make the miseries of Europe eternal Spain had as William in the bitterness of his spirit wrote to Heinsius contributed nothing to the common cause but rodomontades She had made no vigorous effort even to defend her own territories against invasion She would have lost Flanders and Brabant but for the English and Dutch armies She would have lost Catalonia but for the English and Dutch fleets The Milanese she had saved not by arms but by concluding in spite of the remonstrances of the English and Dutch governments an ignominious treaty of neutrality She had not a ship of war able to weather a gale She had not a regiment that was not ill paid and ill disciplined ragged and famished Yet repeatedly within the last two years she had treated both William and the States General with an impertinence which showed that she was altogether ignorant of her place among states She now became punctilious demanded from Lewis concessions which the events of the war gave her no right to expect and seemed to think it hard that allies whom she was constantly treating with indignity were not willing to lavish their blood and treasure for her during eight years more The conduct of Spain is to be attributed merely to arrogance and folly But the unwillingness of the Emperor to consent even to the fairest terms of accommodation was the effect of selfish ambition The Catholic King was childless he was sickly his life was not worth three years purchase and when he died his dominions would be left to be struggled for by a crowd of competitors Both the House of Austria and the House of Bourbon had claims to that immense heritage It was plainly for the interest of the House of Austria that the important day come when it might should find a great European coalition in arms against the House of Bourbon The object of the Emperor therefore was that the war should continue to be carried on as it had hitherto been carried on at a light charge to him and a heavy charge to England and Holland not till just conditions of peace could be obtained but simply till the King of Spain should die The ministers of the Emperor William wrote to Heinsius ought to be ashamed of their conduct It is intolerable that a government which is doing every thing in its power to make the negotiations fail should contribute nothing to the common defence eight hundred It is not strange that in such circumstances the work of pacification should have made little progress International law like other law has its chicanery its subtle pleadings its technical forms which may too easily be so employed as to make its substance inefficient Those litigants therefore who did not wish the litigation to come to a speedy close had no difficulty in interposing delays There was a long dispute about the place where the conferences should be held The Emperor proposed Aix la Chapelle The French objected and proposed the Hague Then the Emperor objected in his turn At last it was arranged that the ministers of the Allied Powers should meet at the Hague and that the French plenipotentiaries should take up their abode five miles off at Delft eight hundred one To Delft accordingly repaired Harlay a man of distinguished wit and good breeding sprung from one of the great families of the robe Crecy a shrewd patient and laborious diplomatist and Cailleres who though he was named only third in the credentials was much better informed than either of his colleagues touching all the points which were likely to be debated eight hundred two At the Hague were the Earl of Pembroke and Edward Viscount Villiers who represented England Prior accompanied them with the rank of Secretary At the head of the Imperial Legation was Count Kaunitz at the head of the Spanish Legation was Don Francisco Bernardo de Quiros the ministers of inferior rank it would be tedious to enumerate eight hundred three Half way between Delft and the Hague is a village named Ryswick and near it then stood in a rectangular garden which was bounded by straight canals and divided into formal woods flower beds and melon beds a seat of the Princes of Orange The house seemed to have been built expressly for the accommodation of such a set of diplomatists as were to meet there In the centre was a large hall painted by Honthorst On the right hand and on the left were wings exactly corresponding to each other Each wing was accessible by its own bridge its own gate and its own avenue One wing was assigned to the Allies the other to the French the hall in the centre to the mediator eight hundred four Some preliminary questions of etiquette were not without difficulty adjusted and at length on the ninth of May many coaches and six attended by harbingers footmen and pages approached the mansion by different roads The Swedish Minister alighted at the grand entrance The procession from the Hague came up the side alley on the right The procession from Delft came up the side alley on the left At the first meeting the full powers of the representatives of the belligerent governments were delivered to the mediator At the second meeting forty eight hours later the mediator performed the ceremony of exchanging these full powers Then several meetings were spent in settling how many carriages how many horses how many lacqueys how many pages each minister should be entitled to bring to Ryswick whether the serving men should carry canes whether they should wear swords whether they should have pistols in their holsters who should take the upper hand in the public walks and whose carriage should break the way in the streets It soon appeared that the mediator would have to mediate not only between the coalition and the French but also between the different members of the coalition The Imperial Ambassadors claimed a right to sit at the head of the table The Spanish Ambassador would not admit this pretension and tried to thrust himself in between two of them The Imperial Ambassadors refused to call the Ambassadors of Electors and Commonwealths by the title of Excellency If I am not called Excellency said the Minister of the Elector of Brandenburg my master will withdraw his troops from Hungary The Imperial Ambassadors insisted on having a room to themselves in the building and on having a special place assigned to their carriages in the court All the other Ministers of the Confederacy pronounced this a most unjustifiable demand and a whole sitting was wasted in this childish dispute It may easily be supposed that allies who were so punctilious in their dealings with each other were not likely to be very easy in their intercourse with the common enemy The chief business of Earlay and Kaunitz was to watch each other s legs Neither of them thought it consistent with the dignity of the Crown which he served to advance towards the other faster than the other advanced towards him If therefore one of them perceived that he had inadvertently stepped forward too quick he went back to the door and the stately minuet began again The ministers of Lewis drew up a paper in their own language The German statesmen protested against this innovation this insult to the dignity of the Holy Roman Empire this encroachment on the rights of independent nations and would not know any thing about the paper till it had been translated from good French into bad Latin In the middle of April it was known to every body at the Hague that Charles the Eleventh King of Sweden was dead and had been succeeded by his son but it was contrary to etiquette that any of the assembled envoys should appear to be acquainted with this fact till Lilienroth had made a formal announcement it was not less contrary to etiquette that Lilienroth should make such an announcement till his equipages and his household had been put into mourning and some weeks elapsed before his coachmakers and tailors had completed their task At length on the twelfth of June he came to Ryswick in a carriage lined with black and attended by servants in black liveries and there in full congress proclaimed that it had pleased God to take to himself the most puissant King Charles the Eleventh All the Ambassadors then condoled with him on the sad and unexpected news and went home to put off their embroidery and to dress themselves in the garb of sorrow In such solemn trifling week after week passed away No real progress was made Lilienroth had no wish to accelerate matters While the congress lasted his position was one of great dignity He would willingly have gone on mediating for ever and he could not go on mediating unless the parties on his right and on his left went on wrangling eight hundred five In June the hope of peace began to grow faint Men remembered that the last war had continued to rage year after year while a congress was sitting at Nimeguen The mediators had made their entrance into that town in February sixteen seventy six The treaty had not been signed till February sixteen seventy nine Yet the negotiation of Nimeguen had not proceeded more slowly than the negotiation of Ryswick It seemed but too probable that the eighteenth century would find great armies still confronting each other on the Meuse and the Rhine industrious populations still ground down by taxation fertile provinces still lying waste the ocean still made impassable by corsairs and the plenipotentiaries still exchanging notes drawing up protocols and wrangling about the place where this minister should sit and the title by which that minister should be called But William was fully determined to bring this mummery to a speedy close He would have either peace or war Either was in his view better than this intermediate state which united the disadvantages of both While the negotiation was pending there could be no diminution of the burdens which pressed on his people and yet he could expect no energetic action from his allies If France was really disposed to conclude a treaty on fair terms that treaty should be concluded in spite of the imbecility of the Catholic King and in spite of the selfish cunning of the Emperor If France was insecure the sooner the truth was known the sooner the farce which was acting at Ryswick was over the sooner the people of England and Holland for on them every thing depended were told that they must make up their minds to great exertions and sacrifices the better Pembroke and Villiers though they had now the help of a veteran diplomatist Sir Joseph Williamson could do little or nothing to accelerate the proceedings of the Congress For though France had promised that whenever peace should be made she would recognise the Prince of Orange as King of Great Britain and Ireland she had not yet recognised him His ministers had therefore had no direct intercourse with Harlay Crecy and Cailleres William with the judgment and decision of a true statesman determined to open a communication with Lewis through one of the French Marshals who commanded in the Netherlands Of those Marshals Villeroy was the highest in rank But Villeroy was weak rash haughty irritable Such a negotiator was far more likely to embroil matters than to bring them to an amicable settlement Boufflers was a man of sense and temper and fortunately he had during the few days which he had passed at Huy after the fall of Namur been under the care of Portland by whom he had been treated with the greatest courtesy and kindness A friendship had sprung up between the prisoner and his keeper They were both brave soldiers honourable gentlemen trusty servants William justly thought that they were far more likely to come to an understanding than Harlay and Kaunitz even with the aid of Lilienroth Portland indeed had all the essential qualities of an excellent diplomatist In England the people were prejudiced against him as a foreigner his earldom his garter his lucrative places his rapidly growing wealth excited envy his dialect was not understood his manners were not those of the men of fashion who had been formed at Whitehall his abilities were therefore greatly underrated and it was the fashion to call him a blockhead fit only to carry messages But on the Continent where he was judged without malevolence he made a very different impression It is a remarkable fact that this man who in the drawingrooms and coffeehouses of London was described as an awkward stupid Hogan Mogan such was the phrase at that time was considered at Versailles as an eminently polished courtier and an eminently expert negotiator eight hundred six His chief recommendation however was his incorruptible integrity It was certain that the interests which were committed to his care would be as dear to him as his own life and that every report which he made to his master would be literally exact Towards the close of June Portland sent to Boufflers a friendly message begging for an interview of half an hour Boufflers instantly sent off an express to Lewis and received an answer in the shortest time in which it was possible for a courier to ride post to Versailles and back again Lewis directed the Marshal to comply with Portland s request to say as little as possible and to learn as much as possible eight hundred seven On the twenty eighth of June according to the Old Style the meeting took place in the neighbourhood of Hal a town which lies about ten miles from Brussels on the road to Mons After the first civilities had been exchanged Boufflers and Portland dismounted their attendants retired and the two negotiators were left alone in an orchard Here they walked up and down during two hours and in that time did much more business than the plenipotentiaries at Ryswick were able to despatch in as many months eight hundred eight Till this time the French government had entertained a suspicion natural indeed but altogether erroneous that William was bent on protracting the war that he had consented to treat merely because he could not venture to oppose himself to the public opinion both of England and of Holland but that he wished the negotiation to be abortive and that the perverse conduct of the House of Austria and the difficulties which had arisen at Ryswick were to be chiefly ascribed to his machinations That suspicion was now removed Compliments cold austere and full of dignity yet respectful were exchanged between the two great princes whose enmity had during a quarter of a century kept Europe in constant agitation The negotiation between Boufflers and Portland proceeded as fast as the necessity of frequent reference to Versailles would permit Their first five conferences were held in the open air but at their sixth meeting they retired into a small house in which Portland had ordered tables pens ink and paper to be placed and here the result of their labours was reduced to writing The really important points which had been in issue were four William had at first demanded two concessions from Lewis and Lewis had demanded two concessions from William William s first demand was that France should bind herself to give no help or countenance directly or indirectly to any attempt which might be made by James or by James s adherents to disturb the existing order of things in England William s second demand was that James should no longer be suffered to reside at a place so dangerously near to England as Saint Germains To the first of these demands Lewis replied that he was perfectly ready to bind himself by the most solemn engagements not to assist or countenance in any manner any attempt to disturb the existing order of things in England but that it was inconsistent with his honour that the name of his kinsman and guest should appear in the treaty To the second demand Lewis replied that he could not refuse his hospitality to an unfortunate king who had taken refuge in his dominions and that he could not promise even to indicate a wish that James would quit Saint Germains But Boufflers as if speaking his own thoughts though doubtless saying nothing but what he knew to be in conformity to his master s wishes hinted that the matter would probably be managed and named Avignon as a place where the banished family might reside without giving any umbrage to the English government Lewis on the other side demanded first that a general amnesty should be granted to the Jacobites and secondly that Mary of Modena should receive her jointure of fifty thousand pounds a year With the first of these demands William peremptorily refused to comply He should always be ready of his own free will to pardon the offences of men who showed a disposition to live quietly for the future under his government but he could not consent to make the exercise of his prerogative of mercy a matter of stipulation with any foreign power The annuity claimed by Mary of Modena he would willingly pay if he could only be satisfied that it would not be expended in machinations against his throne and his person in supporting on the coast of Kent another establishment like that of Hunt or in buying horses and arms for another enterprise like that of Turnham Green Boufflers had mentioned Avignon If James and his Queen would take up their abode there no difficulties would be made about the jointure At length all the questions in dispute were settled After much discussion an article was framed by which Lewis pledged his word of honour that he would not favour in any manner any attempt to subvert or disturb the existing government of England William in return gave his promise not to countenance any attempt against the government of France This promise Lewis had not asked and at first seemed inclined to consider as an affront His throne he said was perfectly secure his title undisputed There were in his dominions no nonjurors no conspirators and he did not think it consistent with his dignity to enter into a compact which seemed to imply that he was in fear of plots and insurrections such as a dynasty sprung from a revolution might naturally apprehend On this point however he gave way and it was agreed that the covenants should be strictly reciprocal William ceased to demand that James should be mentioned by name and Lewis ceased to demand that an amnesty should be granted to James s adherents It was determined that nothing should be said in the treaty either about the place where the banished King of England should reside or about the jointure of his Queen But William authorised his plenipotentiaries at the Congress to declare that Mary of Modena should have whatever on examination it should appear that she was by law entitled to have What she was by law entitled to have was a question which it would have puzzled all Westminster Hall to answer But it was well understood that she would receive without any contest the utmost that she could have any pretence for asking as soon as she and her husband should retire to Provence or to Italy eight hundred nine Before the end of July every thing was settled as far as France and England were concerned Meanwhile it was known to the ministers assembled at Ryswick that Boufflers and Portland had repeatedly met in Brabant and that they were negotiating in a most irregular and indecorous manner without credentials or mediation or notes or protocols without counting each other s steps and without calling each other Excellency So barbarously ignorant were they of the rudiments of the noble science of diplomacy that they had very nearly accomplished the work of restoring peace to Christendom while walking up and down an alley under some apple trees The English and Dutch loudly applauded William s prudence and decision He had cut the knot which the Congress had only twisted and tangled He had done in a month what all the formalists and pedants assembled at the Hague would not have done in ten years Nor were the French plenipotentiaries ill pleased It is curious said Harlay a man of wit and sense that while the Ambassadors are making war the generals should be making peace eight hundred ten But Spain preserved the same air of arrogant listlessness and the ministers of the Emperor forgetting apparently that their master had a few months before concluded a treaty of neutrality for Italy without consulting William seemed to think it most extraordinary that William should presume to negotiate without consulting their master It became daily more evident that the Court of Vienna was bent on prolonging the war On the tenth of July the French ministers again proposed fair and honourable terms of peace but added that if those terms were not accepted by the twenty first of August the Most Christian King would not consider himself bound by his offer eight hundred eleven William in vain exhorted his allies to be reasonable The senseless pride of one branch of the House of Austria and the selfish policy of the other were proof to all argument The twenty first of August came and passed the treaty had not been signed France was at liberty to raise her demands and she did so For just at this time news arrived of two great blows which had fallen on Spain one in the Old and one in the New World A French army commanded by Vendome had taken Barcelona A French squadron had stolen out of Brest had eluded the allied fleets had crossed the Atlantic had sacked Carthagena and had returned to France laden with treasure eight hundred twelve The Spanish government passed at once from haughty apathy to abject terror and was ready to accept any conditions which the conqueror might dictate The French plenipotentiaries announced to the Congress that their master was determined to keep Strasburg and that unless the terms which he had offered thus modified were accepted by the tenth of September he should hold himself at liberty to insist on further modifications Never had the temper of William been more severely tried He was provoked by the perverseness of his allies he was provoked by the imperious language of the enemy It was not without a hard struggle and a sharp pang that he made up his mind to consent to what France now proposed But he felt that it would be utterly impossible even if it were desirable to prevail on the House of Commons and on the States General to continue the war for the purpose of wresting from France a single fortress a fortress in the fate of which neither England nor Holland had any immediate interest a fortress too which had been lost to the Empire solely in consequence of the unreasonable obstinacy of the Imperial Court He determined to accept the modified terms and directed his Ambassadors at Ryswick to sign on the prescribed day The Ambassadors of Spain and Holland received similar instructions There was no doubt that the Emperor though he murmured and protested would soon follow the example of his confederates That he might have time to make up his mind it was stipulated that he should be included in the treaty if he notified his adhesion by the first of November Meanwhile James was moving the mirth and pity of all Europe by his lamentations and menaces He had in vain insisted on his right to send as the only true King of England a minister to the Congress eight hundred thirteen He had in vain addressed to all the Roman Catholic princes of the Confederacy a memorial in which he adjured them to join with France in a crusade against England for the purpose of restoring him to his inheritance and of annulling that impious Bill of Rights which excluded members of the true Church from the throne eight hundred fourteen When he found that this appeal was disregarded he put forth a solemn protest against the validity of all treaties to which the existing government of England should be a party He pronounced all the engagements into which his kingdom had entered since the Revolution null and void He gave notice that he should not if he should regain his power think himself bound by any of those engagements He admitted that he might by breaking those engagements bring great calamities both on his own dominions and on all Christendom But for those calamities he declared that he should not think himself answerable either before God or before man It seems almost incredible that even a Stuart and the worst and dullest of the Stuarts should have thought that the first duty not merely of his own subjects but of all mankind was to support his rights that Frenchmen Germans Italians Spaniards were guilty of a crime if they did not shed their blood and lavish their wealth year after year in his cause that the interests of the sixty millions of human beings to whom peace would be a blessing were of absolutely no account when compared with the interests of one man eight hundred fifteen In spite of his protests the day of peace drew nigh On the tenth of September the Ambassadors of France England Spain and the United Provinces met at Ryswick Three treaties were to be signed and there was a long dispute on the momentous question which should be signed first It was one in the morning before it was settled that the treaty between France and the States General should have precedence and the day was breaking before all the instruments had been executed Then the plenipotentiaries with many bows congratulated each other on having had the honour of contributing to so great a work eight hundred sixteen A sloop was in waiting for Prior He hastened on board and on the third day after weathering an equinoctial gale landed on the coast of Suffolk eight hundred seventeen Very seldom had there been greater excitement in London than during the month which preceded his arrival When the west wind kept back the Dutch packets the anxiety of the people became intense Every morning hundreds of thousands rose up hoping to hear that the treaty was signed and every mail which came in without bringing the good news caused bitter disappointment The malecontents indeed loudly asserted that there would be no peace and that the negotiation would even at this late hour be broken off One of them had seen a person just arrived from Saint Germains another had had the privilege of reading a letter in the handwriting of Her Majesty and all were confident that Lewis would never acknowledge the usurper Many of those who held this language were under so strong a delusion that they backed their opinion by large wagers When the intelligence of the fall of Barcelona arrived all the treason taverns were in a ferment with nonjuring priests laughing talking loud and shaking each other by the hand eight hundred eighteen At length in the afternoon of the thirteenth of September some speculators in the City received by a private channel certain intelligence that the treaty had been signed before dawn on the morning of the eleventh They kept their own secret and hastened to make a profitable use of it but their eagerness to obtain Bank stock and the high prices which they offered excited suspicion and there was a general belief that on the next day something important would be announced On the next day Prior with the treaty presented himself before the Lords justices at Whitehall Instantly a flag was hoisted on the Abbey another on Saint Martin s Church The Tower guns proclaimed the glad tidings All the spires and towers from Greenwich to Chelsea made answer It was not one of the days on which the newspapers ordinarily appeared but extraordinary numbers with headings in large capitals were for the first time cried about the streets The price of Bank stock rose fast from eighty four to ninety seven In a few hours triumphal arches began to rise in some places Huge bonfires were blazing in others The Dutch ambassador informed the States General that he should try to show his joy by a bonfire worthy of the commonwealth which he represented and he kept his word for no such pyre had ever been seen in London A hundred and forty barrels of pitch roared and blazed before his house in Saint James s Square and sent up a flame which made Pall Mall and Piccadilly as bright as at noonday eight hundred nineteen Among the Jacobites the dismay was great Some of those who had betted deep on the constancy of Lewis took flight One unfortunate zealot of divine right drowned himself But soon the party again took heart The treaty had been signed but it surely would never be ratified In a short time the ratification came the peace was solemnly proclaimed by the heralds and the most obstinate nonjurors began to despair Some divines who had during eight years continued true to James now swore allegiance to William They were probably men who held with Sherlock that a settled government though illegitimate in its origin is entitled to the obedience of Christians but who had thought that the government of William could not properly be said to be settled while the greatest power in Europe not only refused to recognise him but strenuously supported his competitor eight hundred twenty The fiercer and more determined adherents of the banished family were furious against Lewis He had deceived he had betrayed his suppliants It was idle to talk about the misery of his people It was idle to say that he had drained every source of revenue dry and that in all the provinces of his kingdom the peasantry were clothed in rags and were unable to eat their fill even of the coarsest and blackest bread His first duty was that which he owed to the royal family of England The Jacobites talked against him and wrote against him as absurdly and almost as scurrilously as they had long talked and written against William One of their libels was so indecent that the Lords justices ordered the author to be arrested and held to bail eight hundred twenty one But the rage and mortification were confined to a very small minority Never since the year of the Restoration had there been such signs of public gladness In every part of the kingdom where the peace was proclaimed the general sentiment was manifested by banquets pageants loyal healths salutes beating of drums blowing of trumpets breaking up of hogsheads At some places the whole population of its own accord repaired to the churches to give thanks At others processions of girls clad all in white and crowned with laurels carried banners inscribed with God bless King William At every county town a long cavalcade of the principal gentlemen from a circle of many miles escorted the mayor to the market cross Nor was one holiday enough for the expression of so much joy On the fourth of November the anniversary of the King s birth and on the fifth the anniversary of his landing at Torbay the bellringing the shouting and the illuminations were renewed both in London and all over the country eight hundred twenty two On the day on which he returned to his capital no work was done no shop was opened in the two thousand streets of that immense mart For that day the chiefs streets had mile after mile been covered with gravel all the Companies had provided new banners all the magistrates new robes Twelve thousand pounds had been expended in preparing fireworks Great multitudes of people from all the neighbouring shires had come up to see the show Never had the City been in a more loyal or more joyous mood The evil days were past The guinea had fallen to twenty one shillings and sixpence The bank note had risen to par The new crowns and halfcrowns broad heavy and sharply milled were ringing on all the counters After some days of impatient expectation it was known on the fourteenth of November that His Majesty had landed at Margate Late on the fifteenth he reached Greenwich and rested in the stately building which under his auspices was turning from a palace into a hospital On the next morning a bright and soft morning eighty coaches and six filled with nobles prelates privy councillors and judges came to swell his train In Southwark he was met by the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen in all the pomp of office The way through the Borough to the bridge was lined by the Surrey militia the way from the bridge to Walbrook by three regiments of the militia of the City All along Cheapside on the right hand and on the left the livery were marshalled under the standards of their trades At the east end of Saint Paul s churchyard stood the boys of the school of Edward the Sixth wearing as they still wear the garb of the sixteenth century Round the Cathedral down Ludgate Hill and along Fleet Street were drawn up three more regiments of Londoners From Temple Bar to Whitehall gate the trainbands of Middlesex and the Foot Guards were under arms The windows along the whole route were gay with tapestry ribands and flags But the finest part of the show was the innumerable crowd of spectators all in their Sunday clothing and such clothing as only the upper classes of other countries could afford to wear I never William wrote that evening to Heinsius I never saw such a multitude of welldressed people Nor was the King less struck by the indications of joy and affection with which he was greeted from the beginning to the end of his triumph His coach from the moment when he entered it at Greenwich till he alighted from it in the court of Whitehall was accompanied by one long huzza Scarcely had he reached his palace when addresses of congratulation from all the great corporations of his kingdom were presented to him It was remarked that the very foremost among those corporations was the University of Oxford The eloquent composition in which that learned body extolled the wisdom the courage and the virtue of His Majesty was read with cruel vexation by the nonjurors and with exultation by the Whigs eight hundred twenty three The rejoicings were not yet over At a council which was held a few hours after the King s public entry the second of December was appointed to be the day of thanksgiving for the peace The Chapter of Saint Paul s resolved that on that day their noble Cathedral which had been long slowly rising on the ruins of a succession of pagan and Christian temples should be opened for public worship William announced his intention of being one of the congregation But it was represented to him that if he persisted in that intention three hundred thousand people would assemble to see him pass and all the parish churches of London would be left empty He therefore attended the service in his own chapel at Whitehall and heard Burnet preach a sermon somewhat too eulogistic for the place eight hundred twenty four At Saint Paul s the magistrates of the City appeared in all their state Compton ascended for the first time a throne rich with the sculpture of Gibbons and thence exhorted a numerous and splendid assembly His discourse has not been preserved but its purport may be easily guessed for he preached on that noble Psalm I was glad when they said unto me Let us go into the house of the Lord He doubtless reminded his hearers that in addition to the debt which was common to them with all Englishmen they owed as Londoners a peculiar debt of gratitude to the divine goodness which had permitted them to efface the last trace of the ravages of the great fire and to assemble once more for prayer and praise after so many years on that spot consecrated by the devotions of thirty generations Throughout London and in every part of the realm even to the remotest parishes of Cumberland and Cornwall the churches were filled on the morning of that day and the evening was an evening of festivity eight hundred twenty five These was indeed reason for joy and thankfulness England had passed through severe trials and had come forth renewed in health and vigour Ten years before it had seemed that both her liberty and her independence were no more Her liberty she had vindicated by a just and necessary revolution Her independence she had reconquered by a not less just and necessary war She had successfully defended the order of things established by the Bill of Rights against the mighty monarchy of France against the aboriginal population of Ireland against the avowed hostility of the nonjurors against the more dangerous hostility of traitors who were ready to take any oath and whom no oath could bind Her open enemies had been victorious on many fields of battle Her secret enemies had commanded her fleets and armies had been in charge of her arsenals had ministered at her altars had taught at her Universities had swarmed in her public offices had sate in her Parliament had bowed and fawned in the bedchamber of her King More than once it had seemed impossible that any thing could avert a restoration which would inevitably have been followed first by proscriptions and confiscations by the violation of fundamental laws and the persecution of the established religion and then by a third rising up of the nation against that House which two depositions and two banishments had only made more obstinate in evil To the dangers of war and the dangers of treason had recently been added the dangers of a terrible financial and commercial crisis But all those dangers were over There was peace abroad and at home The kingdom after many years of ignominious vassalage had resumed its ancient place in the first rank of European powers Many signs justified the hope that the Revolution of sixteen eighty eight would be our last Revolution The ancient constitution was adapting itself by a natural a gradual a peaceful development to the wants of a modern society Already freedom of conscience and freedom of discussion existed to an extent unknown in any preceding age The currency had been restored Public credit had been reestablished Trade had revived The Exchequer was overflowing There was a sense of relief every where from the Royal Exchange to the most secluded hamlets among the mountains of Wales and the fens of Lincolnshire The ploughmen the shepherds the miners of the Northumbrian coalpits the artisans who toiled at the looms of Norwich and the anvils of Birmingham felt the change without understanding it and the cheerful bustle in every seaport and every market town indicated not obscurely the commencement of a happier age Footnote one Relation de la Voyage de Sa Majeste Britannique en Hollande enrichie de planches tres curieuses sixteen ninety

calls Quakers in scorn do deny all opinions and they do deny all conceivings and they do deny all sects and they do deny all imaginations and notions and judgments which riseth out of the will and the thoughts and do deny witchcraft and all oaths and the world and the works of it and their worships and their customs with the light and do deny false ways and false worships seducers and deceivers which are now seen to be in the world with the light and with it they are condemned which light leadeth to peace and life from death which now thousands do witness the new teacher Christ him by whom

have made nearer advances towards Christianity than ever before and among them the ingenious mister Penn has of late refined some of their gross notions and brought them into some form and has made them speak sense and English of both which George Fox their first and great apostle was totally ignorant They endeavour all they can to make it appear that their doctrine was uniform from the beginning and that there has been no alteration and therefore they take upon them to defend all the writings of George Fox and others of the first Quakers and turn and wind them to make them but it is impossible agree with what they teach now at this day The Snake in the Grass third ed sixteen ninety eight Introduction Leslie was always more civil to his brother Jacobite Penn than to any other Quaker Penn himself says of his master As abruptly and brokenly as sometimes his sentences would fall from him about divine things it is well known they were often as texts to many fairer declarations That is to say George Fox talked nonsense and some of his friends paraphrased it into sense Footnote thirty eight In the Life of Penn which is prefixed to his works we are told that the warrants were issued on the sixteenth of January sixteen ninety in consequence of an accusation backed by the oath of William Fuller who is truly designated as a wretch a cheat and an impostor and this story is repeated by mister Clarkson It is however certainly false Caermarthen writing to William on the third of February says that there was then only one witness against Penn and that Preston was that one witness It is therefore evident that Fuller was not the informer on whose oath the warrant against Penn was issued In fact Fuller appears from his Life of himself to have been then at the Hague When Nottingham wrote to William on the twenty sixth of June another witness had come forward Footnote thirty nine Sidney to William Feb twenty seven sixteen ninety The letter is in Dalrymple s Appendix

of conscience or merely a scruple of delicacy See his Life by his Son Footnote sixty See Overall s Convocation Book chapter twenty eight Nothing can be clearer or more to the purpose than his language When having attained their ungodly desires whether ambitious kings by bringing any country into their subjection or disloyal subjects by rebellious rising against their natural sovereigns they have established any of the said degenerate governments among their people the authority either so unjustly established or wrung by force from the true and lawful possessor being always God s authority and therefore receiving no impeachment by the wickedness of those that have it is ever when such alterations are thoroughly settled to be reverenced and obeyed and the people of all sorts as well of the clergy as of the laity are to be subject unto it not only for fear but likewise for conscience sake Then follows the canon If any man shall affirm that when any such new forms of government begun by rebellion are after thoroughly settled the authority in them is not of God or that any who live within the territories of any such new governments are not bound to be subject to God s authority which is there executed but may rebel against the same he doth greatly err Footnote sixty one A list of all the pieces which I have read relating to Sherlock s apostasy would fatigue the reader I will

will give two or three specimens of the rhymes which the Case of Allegiance called forth When Eve the fruit had tasted She to her husband hasted And chuck d him on the chin a Dear Bud quoth she come

ear Swear husband as you love me swear Twill ease you of your anguish At first he had doubt and therefore did pray That heaven would instruct him in the right way Whether Jemmy or William he ought to obey Which nobody can deny The pass at the Boyne determin d that case And precept to Providence then did give place To change his opinion he thought no disgrace Which nobody can deny But this with the Scripture can never agree As by Hosea the eighth and the fourth you may see They have set up kings but yet not by me Which nobody can deny Footnote sixty two The chief authority for this part of my

Oppidum ad Salaminium amnis latus recentibus ac sumptuosioribus aedificiis attollebatur antiquius et ipsa vetustate in cultius quod in Paphiis finibus exstructum erat The English version is The town on Salaminia side was better built than that in Paphia Surely there is in the Latin the particularity which we might expect from a person who had known Athlone before the war The English version is contemptibly bad I need hardly say that the Paphian side is Connaught and the Salaminian side Leinster Footnote ninety two I have consulted several contemporary maps of Athlone One will be found in

bad translation from the Latin The English merely says Lysander Sarsfield accused him a few days before in the general s presence without intimating what the accusation was The Latin original runs thus Acriter Lysander paucos ante dies coram praefecto copiarum illi exprobraverat nescio quid quod in aula Syriaca in Cypriorum opprobrium effutivisse dicebatur The English translator has by omitting

baseness of disposition As far as their history has been known the son has regularly improved upon the vices of the father and has taken care to transmit them pure and undiminished into the bosom of his successors Elsewhere he says of the member for Middlesex He has degraded even the name of Luttrell He exclaims in allusion to the marriage of the Duke of Cumberland and missus Horton who was born a Luttrell Let Parliament look to it A Luttrell shall never succeed to the Crown of England It is certain that very few Englishmen can have sympathized with Junius s abhorrence of the Luttrells or can even have understood it Why then did he use expressions which to the great majority of his readers must have been unintelligible My answer is that Philip Francis was born and passed the first ten

language language held not once but repeatedly and at long intervals In the Letter on the Sacramental Test written in seventeen oh eight he says If we the clergy were under any real fear of the Papists in this kingdom it would be hard to think us so stupid as not to be equally apprehensive with others since we are likely to be the greater and more immediate sufferers but on the contrary we look upon them to be altogether as inconsiderable as the women and children The common people without leaders without discipline or natural courage being little better than hewers of wood and drawers of water are out of all capacity of doing any mischief if they were ever so well inclined In the Drapier s Sixth Letter written in seventeen twenty four he says As to the people of this kingdom they consist either of Irish Papists who are as inconsiderable in point of power as the women and children or of English Protestants Again in the Presbyterian s Plea of Merit written in seventeen thirty one he says The estates of Papists are very few crumbling into small parcels and daily diminishing their common people are sunk in poverty ignorance and cowardice and of as little consequence as women and children Their nobility and gentry are at least one half ruined banished or converted They all soundly feel the smart of what they suffered in the last Irish war Some of them are already retired into foreign countries others as I am told intend to follow them and the rest I believe to a man who still possess any lands are absolutely resolved never to hazard them again for the sake of establishing their superstition I may observe that to the best of my belief Swift never in any thing that he wrote used the word Irishman to denote a person of Anglosaxon race born in Ireland He no more considered himself as an Irishman than an Englishman born at Calcutta considers himself as a Hindoo Footnote one hundred forty two In seventeen forty nine Lucas was the idol of the democracy of

for we see there the minority prevailing over the majority I suspect that Alderman Beckford and Alderman Sawbridge would have been far from sympathizing with him Charles O Connor whose unfavourable

decouvrir le tout a Benthing et detournerent ainsi le coup A translation of this most remarkable passage which at once solves many interesting and perplexing problems was published eighty years ago by Macpherson But strange to say it attracted no notice and has never as far as I know been mentioned by any biographer of Marlborough The narrative of James requires no confirmation but it is strongly confirmed by the Burnet MS Harl six thousand five hundred eighty four Marleburrough Burnet wrote in September sixteen ninety three set himself to decry the King s conduct and to lessen him in all his discourses and to possess the English with an aversion to the Dutch who as he pretended had a much larger share of the King s favour and confidence than they the English I suppose had This was a point on which the English who are too apt to despise all other nations and to overvalue themselves were easily enough inflamed So it grew to be the universal subject of discourse and was the constant entertainment at Marleburrough s where there was a constant randivous of the English officers About the dismission of Marlborough Burnet wrote at the same time The King said to myself upon it that he had very good reason to believe that he had made his peace with King James and was engaged in a correspondence with France It is certain he was doing all he could to set on a faction in the army and the nation against the Dutch It is curious to compare this plain tale told while the facts were recent with the shuffling narrative which Burnet prepared for the public eye many years later when Marlborough was closely united to the Whigs and was rendering great and splendid services to the country Burnet ii ninety The Duchess of Marlborough in her Vindication had the effrontery to declare that she could never learn what cause the King assigned for his displeasure She suggests that Young s forgery may have been the cause Now she must have known that Young s forgery was not committed till some months after her husband s disgrace She was indeed lamentably deficient in memory a faculty which is proverbially said to be necessary to persons of the class to which she belonged Her own volume convicts her of falsehood She gives us a letter from Mary to Anne in which Mary says I need not repeat the cause my Lord Marlborough has given the King to do what he has done These words plainly imply that Anne had been apprised of the cause If she had not been apprised of the cause would she not have said so in her answer But we have her answer and it contains not a word on the subject She was then apprised of the cause and is it possible to believe that she kept it a secret from her adored missus Freeman Footnote one hundred eighty nine My account of these transactions I

subject in any of the numerous Jacobite lampoons of that day But there is a remarkable passage in a pamphlet which appeared towards the close of William s reign and which is entitled The Art of Governing by Parties The writer says We still want an Act to ascertain some fund for the salaries of the judges and there was a bill since the Revolution past both Houses of Parliament to this purpose but whether it was for being any way defective or otherwise that His Majesty refused to assent to it I cannot remember But I know the reason satisfied me at that time And I make no doubt but he ll consent to any good bill of this nature whenever tis offered These words convinced me that the bill was open to some grave objection which did not appear in the title and which no historian had noticed I found among the archives of the House of Lords the original parchment endorsed with the words Le Roy et La Royne s aviseront And it was clear at the first glance what the objection was There is a hiatus in that part of Narcissus Luttrell s Diary which relates to this matter The King he wrote passed ten public bills and thirty four private ones and rejected that of the As to the present practice of the House of Commons in such cases see Hatsell s valuable work ii three hundred fifty six I quote the edition of eighteen eighteen Hatsell says that many bills which affect the interest of the Crown may be brought in without any signification of the royal consent and that it is enough if the consent be signified on the second reading or even later but that in a proceeding which affects the hereditary revenue the consent must be signified in the earliest stage Footnote two hundred two The history of these ministerial arrangements I have taken chiefly from the London Gazette of March

selected so strange a title for a pamphlet on the massacre of Glencoe The explanation will be found in a letter of the Emperor Gallienus preserved by Trebellius Pollio in the Life of Ingenuus Ingenuus had raised a rebellion in Moesia He was defeated and killed Gallienus ordered the whole province to be laid waste and wrote to one of his lieutenants in language to which that of the Master of Stair bore but too much resemblance Non mihi satisfacies si tantum armatos occideris quos et fors belli interimere potuisset Perimendus est omnis sexus virilis Occidendus est quicunque maledixit Occidendus

the present King for if ever man had a just cause of war he had and that creates a right to the thing gained by it The King by withdrawing and disbanding his army yielded him the throne and if he had without any more ceremony ascended it he had done no more than all other princes do on the like occasions Footnote three hundred eighty two Character of Edmund Bohun sixteen ninety two Footnote three

acknowledgment Footnote three hundred ninety I unhesitatingly attribute this pamphlet to Blount though it was not reprinted among his works by Gildon If Blount did not actually write it he must certainly have superintended the writing That two men of letters acting without concert should bring out within a very short time two treatises one made out of one half of the Areopagitica and the

Toryes never liked me and the Whiggs hated me because I went not into their notions and passions But even this and worse things that may happen to me shall not I hope be able to make me depart from

Britannica he is extolled as having borne a principal share in the emancipation of the press But the writer was very imperfectly informed as to the facts It is strange that the circumstances of Blount s death should be so uncertain That he died of a wound inflicted by his own hand and that he languished long are undisputed facts The common story was that he shot himself and Narcissus Luttrell at the time made an entry to this effect in his Diary On the other hand Pope who had the very best opportunities of obtaining accurate information asserts that Blount being in love with a near kinswoman of his and rejected gave himself a stab in the arm as pretending to kill himself of the consequence of which he really died Note on the Epilogue to the Satires Dialogue I Warburton who had lived first with the heroes of the Dunciad and then with the most eminent men of letters of his time ought to have known the truth and Warburton by his silence confirms Pope s assertion Gildon s rhapsody about the death of his friend will suit either story equally Footnote four hundred one The charges brought against Coningsby will be found in the journals of the two Houses of the English Parliament Those charges were after the lapse of a quarter of a century versified by Prior whom Coningsby had treated with great insolence and harshness I will quote a few stanzas It will be seen that the poet

and to induce Macarthy to soothe others Nothing more disingenuous was ever written by a Minister of State The King says the Secretary promises in the foresaid Declaration to restore the Settlement but at the same time declares that he will recompense all those who may suffer by it by giving them equivalents Now James did not declare that he would recompense any body but merely that he would advise with his Parliament on the subject He did not declare that he would even advise with his Parliament about recompensing all who might suffer but merely about recompensing such as had followed him to the last Finally he said nothing about equivalents Indeed the notion of giving an equivalent to every body who suffered by the Act of Settlement in other words of giving an equivalent for the fee simple of half the soil of Ireland was obviously absurd Middleton s letter will be found in Macpherson s collection I will give a sample of the language held by the Whigs on this occasion The Roman

an error of a kind very rare with him He says that the name of Caermarthen is perpetually mentioned among those whom James reckoned as his friends I believe that the evidence against Caermarthen will be found to begin and to end with the letter of Melfort which I have mentioned There is indeed among the Nairne MSS which Macpherson printed an undated and anonymous letter in which Caermarthen is reckoned among the friends of James But this letter is altogether undeserving of consideration The writer was evidently a silly hotheaded Jacobite who knew nothing about the situation or character of any of the public men whom he mentioned He blunders grossly about Marlborough Godolphin Russell Shrewsbury and the Beaufort family Indeed the whole composition is a tissue of absurdities It ought to be remarked that in the Life of James compiled from his own Papers the assurances of support which he received from Marlborough Russell Godolphin Shrewsbury and other men of note are mentioned with

This says Johnson in a note has been the advice of every man who in any age understood and favoured the interest of England Footnote four hundred seventy seven Swift in his Inquiry into the Behaviour of the Queen s last Ministry mentions Somers as a person of great abilities who used to talk in so frank a manner that he seemed to discover the bottom of his heart In the Memoirs relating to the Change in the Queen s Ministry Swift says that Somers had one and only one unconversable fault formality It is not very easy to understand how the same man can be the most unreserved of companions and yet err on the side of formality Yet there may be truth in both the descriptions It is well known that Swift loved to take rude liberties with men of high rank and fancied that by doing so he asserted his own independence He has been justly blamed for this fault by his two illustrious biographers both of them men of spirit at least as independent as his Samuel Johnson and Walter Scott I suspect that he showed a disposition to behave with offensive familiarity to Somers and that Somers not choosing to submit to impertinence and not wishing to be forced to resent it resorted in selfdefence to a ceremonious politeness which he never would have practised towards Locke or Addison Footnote four hundred seventy eight The eulogies on Somers and the invectives against him are innumerable Perhaps the best way to come to a just judgment would be to collect all that has been said about him by Swift and by Addison They were the two keenest observers of their time and they both knew him well But it ought to be remarked that till Swift turned Tory he always extolled Somers not only as the most accomplished but as the most virtuous of men In the dedication of the Tale of a Tub are these words There is no virtue either of a public or private life which some circumstances of your own have not often produced upon the stage of the world and again I should be very loth the bright example of your Lordship s virtues should be lost to other eyes both for their sake and your own In the Discourse of the Contests and Dissensions at Athens and Rome Somers is the just Aristides After Swift had ratted he described Somers as a man who possessed all excellent qualifications except virtue Footnote four hundred seventy nine See Whiston s Autobiography Footnote four hundred eighty Swift s note on

know what he was about and every thing he went to tell you was in the epic way for he always began in the middle Spence s Anecdotes Footnote four hundred eighty four He used said Pope to send trifling verses from Court to the Scriblerus Club almost every day and would come and talk idly with them almost every night even when his all was at stake Some specimens of Harley s poetry are in print The best I think is a stanza which he made on his own fall in seventeen fourteen and bad is the best To serve with love And shed your blood Approved is above But here below The examples show Tis fatal to be good Footnote four hundred eighty five The character of Harley is to be collected from innumerable panegyrics and lampoons from the works and the private correspondence of Swift Pope Arbuthnot Prior and Bolingbroke and from multitudes of such works as Ox and Bull the High German Doctor and The History of Robert Powell the Puppet Showman Footnote four hundred eighty six In a letter dated Sept twelve seventeen oh nine a short time before he was brought into power on the shoulders of the High Church mob he says My soul has been among Lyons even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongues sharp swords But I learn how good it is to wait on the Lord and to possess one s soul in peace The letter was to Carstairs I doubt whether Harley would have canted thus if he had been writing to Atterbury Footnote four hundred eighty seven The anomalous position which Harley and Foley at this time occupied is noticed in the Dialogue between a Whig and a Tory sixteen ninety three Your great P Fo y says the Tory turns cadet and carries arms under the General of the West Saxons The two Har ys father and son are engineers under the late Lieutenant of the Ordnance and bomb

said to have been one hundred seventy two Footnote five hundred two The bill is in the Archives of the Lords Its history I have collected from the journals from Grey s Debates and from the highly

sixteen ninety six Briscoe seems to have been as much versed in Latin literature as in political economy Footnote five hundred eighteen In confirmation of what is said in the text I extract a single paragraph from Briscoe s proposals Admit a gentleman hath barely one hundredL per annum estate to live on and hath a wife and four children to provide for this person supposing no taxes were upon his estates must be a great husband to be able to keep his charge but cannot think of laying up anything to place out his children in the world but according to this proposed method he may give his children five hundredl a piece and have ninetyl per annum left for himself and his wife to live upon the which he may also leave to such of his children as he pleases after his and his wife s decease For first having settled his estate of one hundredl per annum as in proposals one three he may have bills of credit for two thousandL for his own proper use for tens per cent per annum as in proposal twenty two which is but tenL per annum for the two thousandL which being deducted out of his estate of one hundredL per annum there remains ninetyL per annum clear to himself It ought to be observed

of one hundredL per annum free from all manner of taxes and deductions whatsoever every such freeholder shall receive four thousandL in the said current credit and shall have two thousandL more put

to Newton announcing the appointment has been repeatedly printed It bears date March nineteen sixteen ninety five six Footnote seven hundred thirteen I have very great pleasure in quoting the words of Haynes an able experienced and practical man who had been in the habit of transacting business with Newton They have never I believe been printed mister Isaac Newton public Professor of the Mathematicks in Cambridge the greatest philosopher and one of the best men of this age was by a great and wise statesman recommended to the favour of the late King for Warden of the King s Mint and Exchanges for which he was peculiarly qualified because of his extraordinary skill in numbers and his great integrity by the first of which he could judge correctly of the Mint accounts and transactions as soon as he entered upon his office and by the latter I mean his integrity he set a standard to the conduct and behaviour of every officer and clerk in the Mint Well had it been for the publick had he acted a few years sooner in that situation It is interesting to compare this testimony borne by a man who thoroughly understood the business of the Mint with the childish talk of Pope Sir Isaac Newton said Pope though so deep in algebra and fluxions could not readily make up a common account and whilst he was Master of the Mint used to get somebody to make up the accounts for him Some of the statesmen with whom Pope lived might have told him that it is not always from ignorance of arithmetic that persons at the head of great departments leave to clerks the business of casting up pounds shillings and pence Footnote seven hundred fourteen I do not love he wrote to Flamsteed to be printed on every occasion much less to be dunned and teased by foreigners about mathematical things or to be thought by our own people to be trifling away my time about them when I am about the King s business Footnote seven hundred fifteen Hopton Haynes s Brief Memoires Lansdowne MSS eight

Norfolk is coloured no doubt by his constitutionally gloomy temper and by the feeling with which he not unnaturally regarded the House of Commons His statistics are not to be trusted and his predictions were signally falsified But he may be believed as to plain facts which happened in his immediate neighbourhood Footnote seven hundred nineteen As to Grascombe s character and the opinion entertained of him by the most estimable Jacobites see the Life of Kettlewell part iii section fifty five Lee the compiler of the Life of Kettlewell mentions with just censure some of Grascombe s

utilement in another Portland parut avec un eclat personnel une politesse un air de monde et de cour une galanterie et des graces qui surprirent avec cela beaucoup de dignite meme le hauteur mais avec

to Boufflers June twenty two July two Boufflers to Lewis June twenty five July five Footnote eight hundred eight Boufflers to Lewis June twenty eight July eight June twenty nine July nine sixteen ninety seven Footnote eight hundred nine My account of this negotiation I have taken chiefly from the despatches in the French Foreign Office Translations of those despatches have been published by M Grimblot See also Burnet ii two hundred two hundred one It has been frequently asserted that William promised to pay Mary of Modena fifty thousand pounds a year Whoever takes the trouble to read the Protocol of Sept ten twenty sixteen ninety seven among the Acts of the Peace of Ryswick will see that my account is correct Prior evidently understood the protocol as I understand it For he says in a letter to Lexington of Sept seventeen sixteen ninety seven No two is the thing to which the King consents as to Queen Marie s settlements It is fairly giving her what the law allows her The mediator is to dictate this paper to the French and enter it into his protocol and so I think we shall come off a bon marche upon that article It was rumoured at the time see Boyer s History of King William III seventeen oh three that Portland and Boufflers had agreed on a secret article by which it was stipulated that after the death of William the Prince of Wales should succeed to the English throne This fable has often been repeated but was never believed by men of sense and can hardly since the publication of the letters which passed between Lewis and Boufflers find credit even with the weakest Dalrymple and other writers imagined that they had found in the Life of James ii five hundred seventy four five hundred seventy five proof that the story of the secret article was true The passage on which they relied was certainly not written by James nor under his direction and the authority of those portions of the Life which were not written by him or under his direction is but small Moreover when we examine this passage we shall find that it not only does not bear out the story of the secret article but directly contradicts that story The compiler of the Life tells us that after James had declared that he never would consent to purchase the English throne for his posterity by surrendering his own rights nothing more was said on the subject Now it is quite certain that James in his Memorial published in March sixteen ninety seven a Memorial which will be found both in the Life ii five hundred sixty six and in the Acts of the Peace of Ryswick declared to all Europe that he never would stoop to so low and degenerate an action as to permit the Prince of Orange to reign on condition that the Prince of Wales should succeed It follows therefore that nothing can have been said on this subject after March sixteen ninety seven Nothing therefore can have been said on this subject in the conferences between Boufflers and Portland which did not begin till late in June Was there then absolutely no foundation for the story I believe that there was a foundation and I have already related the facts on which this superstructure of fiction has been reared It is quite certain that Lewis in sixteen ninety three intimated to the allies through the government of Sweden his hope that some expedient might be devised which would reconcile the Princes who laid claim to the English crown The expedient at which he hinted was no doubt that the Prince of Wales should succeed William and Mary It is possible that as the compiler of the Life of James says William may have show d no great aversness to this arrangement He had no reason public or private for preferring his sister in law to his brother in law if his brother in law were bred a Protestant But William could do nothing without the concurrence of the Parliament and it is in the highest degree improbable that either he or the Parliament would ever have consented to make the settlement of the English crown a matter of stipulation with France What he would or would not have done however we cannot with certainty pronounce For James proved impracticable Lewis consequently gave up all thoughts of effecting a compromise and promised as we have seen to recognise William as King of England without any difficulty restriction condition or reserve It seems certain that after this promise which was made in December sixteen ninety six the Prince of Wales was not again mentioned in the negotiations Footnote eight hundred ten Prior MS Williamson to Lexington July twenty thirty sixteen ninety seven Williamson to Shrewsbury
