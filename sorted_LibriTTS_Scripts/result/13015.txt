on Wood by Japanese Artists nineteen ten Illustration THE RONINS INVITE KOTSUKE NO SUKE TO PERFORM HARA KIRI PREFACE In the Introduction to the story of the Forty seven Ronins I have said almost as much as is needful by way of preface to my stories Those of my readers who are most capable of pointing out the many shortcomings and faults of my work will also be the most indulgent towards me for any one who has been in Japan and studied Japanese knows the great difficulties by which the learner is beset For the illustrations at least I feel that I need make no apology Drawn in the first instance by one Odake an artist in my employ they were cut on wood by a famous wood engraver at Yedo and are therefore genuine specimens of Japanese art Messrs Dalziel on examining the wood blocks pointed out to me as an interesting fact that the lines are cut with the grain of the wood after the manner of Albert Duerer and some of the old German masters a process which has been abandoned by modern European wood engravers It will be noticed that very little allusion is made in these Tales to the Emperor and his Court Although I searched diligently I was able to find no story in which they played a conspicuous part Another class to which no allusion is made is that of the Goshi The Goshi are a kind of yeomen or bonnet lairds as they would be called over the border living on their own land and owning no allegiance to any feudal lord Their rank is inferior to that of the Samurai or men of the military class between whom and the peasantry they hold a middle place Like the Samurai they wear two swords and are in many cases prosperous and wealthy men claiming a descent more ancient than that of many of the feudal Princes A large number of them are enrolled among the Emperor s body guard and these have played a conspicuous part in the recent political changes in Japan as the most conservative and anti foreign element in the nation With these exceptions I think that all classes are fairly represented in my stories The feudal system has passed away like a dissolving view before the eyes of those who have lived in Japan during the last few years But when they arrived there it was in full force and there is not an incident narrated in the following pages however strange it may appear to Europeans for the possibility and probability of which those most competent to judge will not vouch Nor as many a recent event can prove have heroism chivalry and devotion gone out of the land altogether We may deplore and inveigh against the Yamato Damashi or Spirit of Old Japan which still breathes in the soul of the Samurai but we cannot withhold our admiration from the self sacrifices which men will still make for the love of their country The first two of the Tales have already appeared in the Fortnightly Review and two of the Sermons with a portion of the Appendix on the subject of the Hara Kiri in the pages of the Cornhill Magazine I have to thank the editors

from official records or have contained the sketchy impressions of passing travellers Of the inner life of the Japanese the world at large knows but little their religion their superstitions their ways of thought the hidden springs by which they move all these are as yet mysteries Nor is this to be wondered at The first Western men who came in contact with Japan I am speaking not of the old Dutch and Portuguese traders and priests but of the diplomatists and merchants of eleven years ago met with a cold reception Above all things the native Government threw obstacles in the way of any inquiry into their language literature and history The fact was that the Tycoon s Government with whom alone so long as the Mikado remained in seclusion in his sacred capital at Kioto any relations were maintained knew that the Imperial purple with which they sought to invest their chief must quickly fade before the strong sunlight which would be brought upon it so soon as there should be European linguists capable of examining their books and records No opportunity was lost of throwing dust in the eyes of the new comers whom even in the most trifling details it was the official policy to lead astray Now however there is no cause for concealment the Roi Faineant has shaken off his sloth and his Maire du Palais together and an intelligible Government which need not fear scrutiny from abroad is the result the records of the country being but so many proofs of the Mikado s title to power there is no reason for keeping up any show of mystery The path of inquiry is open to all and although there is yet much to be learnt some knowledge has been attained in which it may interest those who stay at home to share The recent revolution in Japan has wrought changes social as well as political and it may be that when in addition to the advance which has already been made railways and telegraphs shall have connected the principal points of the Land of Sunrise the old Japanese such as he was and had been for centuries when we found him eleven short years ago will have become extinct It has appeared to me that no better means could be chosen of preserving a record of a curious and fast disappearing civilization than the translation of some of the most interesting national legends and histories together with other specimens of literature bearing upon the same subject Thus the Japanese may tell their own tale their translator only adding here and there a few words of heading or tag to a chapter where an explanation or amplification may seem necessary I fear that the long and hard names will often make my tales tedious reading but I believe that those who will bear with the difficulty will learn more of the character of the Japanese people than by skimming over descriptions of travel and adventure however brilliant The lord and his retainer the warrior and the priest the humble artisan and the despised Eta or pariah each in his turn will become a leading character in my budget of stories and it is out of the mouths of these personages that I hope to show forth a tolerably complete picture of Japanese society Having said so much by way of preface I beg my readers to fancy themselves wafted away to the shores of the Bay of Yedo a fair smiling landscape gentle slopes crested by a dark fringe of pines and firs lead down to the sea the quaint eaves of many a temple and holy shrine peep out here and there from the groves the bay itself is studded with picturesque fisher craft the torches of which shine by night like glow worms among the outlying forts far away to the west loom the goblin haunted heights of Oyama and beyond the twin hills of the Hakone Pass Fuji Yama the Peerless Mountain solitary and grand stands in the centre of the plain from which it sprang vomiting flames twenty one centuries ago one For a hundred and sixty years the huge mountain has been at peace but the frequent earthquakes still tell of hidden fires and none can say when the red hot stones and ashes may once more fall like rain over five provinces In the midst of a nest of venerable trees in Takanawa a suburb of Yedo is hidden Sengakuji or the Spring hill Temple renowned throughout the length and breadth of the land for its cemetery which contains the graves of the Forty seven Ronins two famous in Japanese history heroes of Japanese drama the tale of whose deeds I am about to transcribe On the left hand side of the main court of the temple is a chapel in which surmounted by a gilt figure of Kwanyin the goddess of mercy are enshrined the images of the forty seven men and of the master whom they loved so well The statues are carved in wood the faces coloured and the dresses richly lacquered as works of art they have great merit the action of the heroes each armed with his favourite weapon being wonderfully life like and spirited Some are venerable men with thin grey hair one is seventy seven years old others are mere boys of sixteen Close by the chapel at the side of a path leading up the hill is a little well of pure water fenced in and adorned with a tiny fernery over which is an inscription setting forth that This is the well in which the head was washed you must not wash your hands or your feet here A little further on is a stall at which a poor old man earns a pittance by selling books pictures and medals commemorating the loyalty of the Forty seven and higher up yet shaded by a grove of stately trees is a neat inclosure kept up as a signboard announces by voluntary contributions round which are ranged forty eight little tombstones each decked with evergreens each with its tribute of water and incense for the comfort of the departed spirit There were forty seven Ronins there are forty eight tombstones and the story of the forty eighth is truly characteristic of Japanese ideas of honour Almost touching the rail of the graveyard is a more imposing monument under which lies buried the lord whose death his followers piously avenged Footnote one According to Japanese tradition in the fifth year of the Emperor Korei two hundred eighty six B C the earth opened in the province of Omi near Kioto and Lake Biwa sixty miles long by about eighteen broad was formed in the shape of a Biwa or four stringed lute from which it takes its name At the same time to compensate for the depression of the earth but at a distance of over three hundred miles from the lake rose Fuji Yama the last eruption of which was in the year seventeen oh seven The last great earthquake at Yedo took place about fifteen years ago Twenty thousand souls are said to have perished in it and the dead were carried away and buried by cartloads many persons trying to escape from their falling and burning houses were caught in great clefts which yawned suddenly in the earth and as suddenly closed upon the victims crushing them to death For several days heavy shocks continued to be felt and the people camped out not daring to return to such houses as had been spared nor to build up those which lay in ruins Footnote two The word Ronin means literally a wave man one who is tossed about hither and thither as a wave of the sea It is used to designate persons of gentle blood entitled to bear arms who having become separated from their feudal lords by their own act or by dismissal or by fate wander about the country in the capacity of somewhat disreputable knights errant without ostensible means of living in some cases offering themselves for hire to new masters in others supporting themselves by pillage or who falling a grade in the social scale go into trade and become simple wardsmen Sometimes it happens that for political reasons a man will become Ronin in order that his lord may not be implicated in some deed of blood in which he is about to engage Sometimes also men become Ronins and leave their native place for a while until some scrape in which they have become entangled shall have blown over after which they return to their former allegiance Nowadays it is not unusual for men to become Ronins for a time and engage themselves in the service of foreigners at the open ports even in menial capacities in the hope that they may pick up something of the language and lore of Western folks I know instances of men of considerable position who have adopted this course in their zeal for education And now for the story At the beginning of the eighteenth century there lived a daimio called Asano Takumi no Kami the Lord of the castle of Ako in the province of Harima Now it happened that an Imperial ambassador from the Court of the Mikado having been sent to the Shogun three at Yedo Takumi no Kami and another noble called Kamei Sama were appointed to receive and feast the envoy and a high official named Kira Kotsuke no Suke was named to teach them the proper ceremonies to be observed upon the occasion The two nobles were accordingly forced to go daily to the castle to listen to the instructions of Kotsuke no Suke But this Kotsuke no Suke was a man greedy of money and as he deemed that the presents which the two daimios according to time honoured custom had brought him in return for his instruction were mean and unworthy he conceived a great hatred against them and took no pains in teaching them but on the contrary rather sought to make laughing stocks of them Takumi no Kami restrained by a stern sense of duty bore his insults with patience but Kamei Sama who had less control over his temper was violently incensed and determined to kill Kotsuke no Suke Footnote three The full title of the Tycoon was Sei i tai Shogun Barbarian repressing Commander in chief The style Tai Kun Great Prince was borrowed in order to convey the idea of sovereignty to foreigners at the time of the conclusion of the Treaties The envoys sent by the Mikado from Kioto to communicate to the Shogun the will of his sovereign were received with Imperial honours and the duty of entertaining them was confided to nobles of rank The title Sei i tai Shogun was first borne by Minamoto no Yoritomo in the seventh month of the year A D eleven ninety two Illustration THE WELL IN WHICH THE HEAD WAS WASHED One night when his duties at the castle were ended Kamei Sama returned to his own palace and having summoned his councillors four to a secret conference said to them Kotsuke no Suke has insulted Takumi no Kami and myself during our service in attendance on the Imperial envoy This is against all decency and I was minded to kill him on the spot but I bethought me that if I did such a deed within the precincts of the castle not only would my own life be forfeit but my family and vassals would be ruined so I stayed my hand Still the life of such a wretch is a sorrow to the people and to morrow when I go to Court I will slay him my mind is made up and I will listen to no remonstrance And as he spoke his face became livid with rage Footnote four Councillor lit elder The councillors of daimios were of two classes the Karo or elder an hereditary office held by cadets of the Prince s family and the Yonin or man of business who was selected on account of his merits These councillors play no mean part in Japanese history Now one of Kamei Sama s councillors was a man of great judgment and when he saw from his lord s manner that remonstrance would be useless he said Your lordship s words are law your servant will make all preparations accordingly and to morrow when your lordship goes to Court if this Kotsuke no Suke should again be insolent let him die the death And his lord was pleased at this speech and waited with impatience for the day to break that he might return to Court and kill his enemy But the councillor went home and was sorely troubled and thought anxiously about what his prince had said And as he reflected it occurred to him that since Kotsuke no Suke had the reputation of being a miser he would certainly be open to a bribe and that it was better to pay any sum no matter how great than that his lord and his house should be ruined So he collected all the money he could and giving it to his servants to carry rode off in the night to Kotsuke no Suke s palace and said to his retainers My master who is now in attendance upon the Imperial envoy owes much thanks to my Lord Kotsuke no Suke who has been at so great pains to teach him the proper ceremonies to be observed during the reception of the Imperial envoy This is but a shabby present which he has sent by me but he hopes that his lordship will condescend to accept it and commends himself to his lordship s favour And with these words he produced a thousand ounces of silver for Kotsuke no Suke and a hundred ounces to be distributed among his retainers When the latter saw the money their eyes sparkled with pleasure and they were profuse in their thanks and begging the councillor to wait a little they went and told their master of the lordly present which had arrived with a polite message from Kamei Sama Kotsuke no Suke in eager delight sent for the councillor into an inner chamber and after thanking him promised on the morrow to instruct his master carefully in all the different points of etiquette So the councillor seeing the miser s glee rejoiced at the success of his plan and having taken his leave returned home in high spirits But Kamei Sama little thinking how his vassal had propitiated his enemy lay brooding over his vengeance and on the following morning at daybreak went to Court in solemn procession When Kotsuke no Suke met him his manner had completely changed and nothing could exceed his courtesy You have come early to Court this morning my Lord Kamei said he I cannot sufficiently admire your zeal I shall have the honour to call your attention to several points of etiquette to day I must beg your lordship to excuse my previous conduct which must have seemed very rude but I am naturally of a cross grained disposition so I pray you to forgive me And as he kept on humbling himself and making fair speeches the heart of Kamei Sama was gradually softened and he renounced his intention of killing him Thus by the cleverness of his councillor was Kamei Sama with all his house saved from ruin Shortly after this Takumi no Kami who had sent no present arrived at the castle and Kotsuke no Suke turned him into ridicule even more than before provoking him with sneers and covert insults but Takumi no Kami affected to ignore all this and submitted himself patiently to Kotsuke no Suke s orders This conduct so far from producing a good effect only made Kotsuke no Suke despise him the more until at last he said haughtily Here my Lord of Takumi the ribbon of my sock has come untied be so good as to tie it up for me Takumi no Kami although burning with rage at the affront still thought that as he was on duty he was bound to obey and tied up the ribbon of the sock Then Kotsuke no Suke turning from him petulantly exclaimed Why how clumsy you are You cannot so much as tie up the ribbon of a sock properly Any one can see that you are a boor from the country and know nothing of the manners of Yedo And with a scornful laugh he moved towards an inner room But the patience of Takumi no Kami was exhausted this last insult was more than he could bear Stop a moment my lord cried he Well what is it replied the other And as he turned round Takumi no Kami drew his dirk and aimed a blow at his head but Kotsuke no Suke being protected by the Court cap which he wore the wound was but a scratch so he ran away and Takumi no Kami pursuing him tried a second time to cut him down but missing his aim struck his dirk into a pillar At this moment an officer named Kajikawa Yosobei seeing the affray rushed up and holding back the infuriated noble gave Kotsuke no Suke time to make good his escape Then there arose a great uproar and confusion and Takumi no Kami was arrested and disarmed and confined in one of the apartments of the palace under the care of the censors A council was held and the prisoner was given over to the safeguard of a daimio called Tamura Ukiyo no Daibu who kept him in close custody in his own house to the great grief of his wife and of his retainers and when the deliberations of the council were completed it was decided that as he had committed an outrage and attacked another man within the precincts of the palace he must perform hara kiri that is commit suicide by disembowelling his goods must be confiscated and his family ruined Such was the law So Takumi no Kami performed hara kiri his castle of Ako was confiscated and his retainers having become Ronins some of them took service with other daimios and others became merchants Now amongst these retainers was his principal councillor a man called Oishi Kuranosuke who with forty six other faithful dependants formed a league to avenge their master s death by killing Kotsuke no Suke This Oishi Kuranosuke was absent at the castle of Ako at the time of the affray which had he been with his prince would never have occurred for being a wise man he would not have failed to propitiate Kotsuke no Suke by sending him suitable presents while the councillor who was in attendance on the prince at Yedo was a dullard who neglected this precaution and so caused the death of his master and the ruin of his house So Oishi Kuranosuke and his forty six companions began to lay their plans of vengeance against Kotsuke no Suke but the latter was so well guarded by a body of men lent to him by a daimio called Uyesugi Sama whose daughter he had married that they saw that the only way of attaining their end would be to throw their enemy off his guard With this object they separated and disguised themselves some as carpenters or craftsmen others as merchants and their chief Kuranosuke went to Kioto and built a house in the quarter called Yamashina where he took to frequenting houses of the worst repute and gave himself up to drunkenness and debauchery as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge Kotsuke no Suke in the meanwhile suspecting that Takumi no Kami s former retainers would be scheming against his life secretly sent spies to Kioto and caused a faithful account to be kept of all that Kuranosuke did The latter however determined thoroughly to delude the enemy into a false security went on leading a dissolute life with harlots and winebibbers One day as he was returning home drunk from some low haunt he fell down in the street and went to sleep and all the passers by laughed him to scorn It happened that a Satsuma man saw this and said Is not this Oishi Kuranosuke who was a councillor of Asano Takumi no Kami and who not having the heart to avenge his lord gives himself up to women and wine See how he lies drunk in the public street Faithless beast Fool and craven Unworthy the name of a Samurai five Footnote five Samurai a man belonging to the Buke or military class entitled to bear arms Illustration THE SATSUMA MAN INSULTS OISHI KURANOSUKE And he trod on Kuranosuke s face as he slept and spat upon him but when Kotsuke no Suke s spies reported all this at Yedo he was greatly relieved at the news and felt secure from danger One day Kuranosuke s wife who was bitterly grieved to see her husband lead this abandoned life went to him and said My lord you told me at first that your debauchery was but a trick to make your enemy relax in watchfulness But indeed indeed this has gone too far I pray and beseech you to put some restraint upon yourself Trouble me not replied Kuranosuke for I will not listen to your whining Since my way of life is displeasing to you I will divorce you and you may go about your business and I will buy some pretty young girl from one of the public houses and marry her for my pleasure I am sick of the sight of an old woman like you about the house so get you gone the sooner the better So saying he flew into a violent rage and his wife terror stricken pleaded piteously for mercy Oh my lord unsay those terrible words I have been your faithful wife for twenty years and have borne you three children in sickness and in sorrow I have been with you you cannot be so cruel as to turn me out of doors now Have pity have pity Cease this useless wailing My mind is made up and you must go and as the children are in my way also you are welcome to take them with you When she heard her husband speak thus in her grief she sought her eldest son Oishi Chikara and begged him to plead for her and pray that she might be pardoned But nothing would turn Kuranosuke from his purpose so his wife was sent away with the two younger children and went back to her native place But Oishi Chikara remained with his father The spies communicated all this without fail to Kotsuke no Suke and he when he heard how Kuranosuke having turned his wife and children out of doors and bought a concubine was grovelling in a life of drunkenness and lust began to think that he had no longer anything to fear from the retainers of Takumi no Kami who must be cowards without the courage to avenge their lord So by degrees he began to keep a less strict watch and sent back half of the guard which had been lent to him by his father in law Uyesugi Sama Little did he think how he was falling into the trap laid for him by Kuranosuke who in his zeal to slay his lord s enemy thought nothing of divorcing his wife and sending away his children Admirable and faithful man In this way Kuranosuke continued to throw dust in the eyes of his foe by persisting in his apparently shameless conduct but his associates all went to Yedo and having in their several capacities as workmen and pedlars contrived to gain access to Kotsuke no Suke s house made themselves familiar with the plan of the building and the arrangement of the different rooms and ascertained the character of the inmates who were brave and loyal men and who were cowards upon all of which matters they sent regular reports to Kuranosuke And when at last it became evident from the letters which arrived from Yedo that Kotsuke no Suke was thoroughly off his guard Kuranosuke rejoiced that the day of vengeance was at hand and having appointed a trysting place at Yedo he fled secretly from Kioto eluding the vigilance of his enemy s spies Then the forty seven men having laid all their plans bided their time patiently It was now midwinter the twelfth month of the year and the cold was bitter One night during a heavy fall of snow when the whole world was hushed and peaceful men were stretched in sleep upon the mats the Ronins determined that no more favourable opportunity could occur for carrying out their purpose So they took counsel together and having divided their band into two parties assigned to each man his post One band led by Oishi Kuranosuke was to attack the front gate and the other under his son Oishi Chikara was to attack the postern of Kotsuke no Suke s house but as Chikara was only sixteen years of age Yoshida Chiuzayemon was appointed to act as his guardian Further it was arranged that a drum beaten at the order of Kuranosuke should be the signal for the simultaneous attack and that if any one slew Kotsuke no Suke and cut off his head he should blow a shrill whistle as a signal to his comrades who would hurry to the spot and having identified the head carry it off to the temple called Sengakuji and lay it as an offering before the tomb of their dead lord Then they must report their deed to the Government and await the sentence of death which would surely be passed upon them To this the Ronins one and all pledged themselves Midnight was fixed upon as the hour and the forty seven comrades having made all ready for the attack partook of a last farewell feast together for on the morrow they must die Then Oishi Kuranosuke addressed the band and said To night we shall attack our enemy in his palace his retainers will certainly resist us and we shall be obliged to kill them But to slay old men and women and children is a pitiful thing therefore I pray you each one to take great heed lest you kill a single helpless person His comrades all applauded this speech and so they remained waiting for the hour of midnight to arrive When the appointed hour came the Ronins set forth The wind howled furiously and the driving snow beat in their faces but little cared they for wind or snow as they hurried on their road eager for revenge At last they reached Kotsuke no Suke s house and divided themselves into two bands and Chikara with twenty three men went round to the back gate Then four men by means of a ladder of ropes which they hung on to the roof of the porch effected an entry into the courtyard and as they saw signs that all the inmates of the house were asleep they went into the porter s lodge where the guard slept and before the latter had time to recover from their astonishment bound them The terrified guard prayed hard for mercy that their lives might be spared and to this the Ronins agreed on condition that the keys of the gate should be given up but the others tremblingly said that the keys were kept in the house of one of their officers and that they had no means of obtaining them Then the Ronins lost patience and with a hammer dashed in pieces the big wooden bolt which secured the gate and the doors flew open to the right and to the left At the same time Chikara and his party broke in by the back gate Then Oishi Kuranosuke sent a messenger to the neighbouring houses bearing the following message We the Ronins who were formerly in the service of Asano Takumi no Kami are this night about to break into the palace of Kotsuke no Suke to avenge our lord As we are neither night robbers nor ruffians no hurt will be done to the neighbouring houses We pray you to set your minds at rest And as Kotsuke no Suke was hated by his neighbours for his covetousness they did not unite their forces to assist him Another precaution was yet taken Lest any of the people inside should run out to call the relations of the family to the rescue and these coming in force should interfere with the plans of the Ronins Kuranosuke stationed ten of his men armed with bows on the roof of the four sides of the courtyard with orders to shoot any retainers who might attempt to leave the place Having thus laid all his plans and posted his men Kuranosuke with his own hand beat the drum and gave the signal for attack Ten of Kotsuke no Suke s retainers hearing the noise woke up and drawing their swords rushed into the front room to defend their master At this moment the Ronins who had burst open the door of the front hall entered the same room Then arose a furious fight between the two parties in the midst of which Chikara leading his men through the garden broke into the back of the house and Kotsuke no Suke in terror of his life took refuge with his wife and female servants in a closet in the verandah while the rest of his retainers who slept in the barrack outside the house made ready to go to the rescue But the Ronins who had come in by the front door and were fighting with the ten retainers ended by overpowering and slaying the latter without losing one of their own number after which forcing their way bravely towards the back rooms they were joined by Chikara and his men and the two bands were united in one By this time the remainder of Kotsuke no Suke s men had come in and the fight became general and Kuranosuke sitting on a camp stool gave his orders and directed the Ronins Soon the inmates of the house perceived that they were no match for their enemy so they tried to send out intelligence of their plight to Uyesugi Sama their lord s father in law begging him to come to the rescue with all the force at his command But the messengers were shot down by the archers whom Kuranosuke had posted on the roof So no help coming they fought on in despair Then Kuranosuke cried out with a loud voice Kotsuke no Suke alone is our enemy let some one go inside and bring him forth dead or alive Now in front of Kotsuke no Suke s private room stood three brave retainers with drawn swords The first was Kobayashi Hehachi the second was Waku Handaiyu and the third was Shimidzu Ikkaku all good men and true and expert swordsmen So stoutly did these men lay about them that for a while they kept the whole of the Ronins at bay and at one moment even forced them back When Oishi Kuranosuke saw this he ground his teeth with rage and shouted to his men What did not every man of you swear to lay down his life in avenging his lord and now are you driven back by three men Cowards not fit to be spoken to to die fighting in a master s cause should be the noblest ambition of a retainer Then turning to his own son Chikara he said Here boy engage those men and if they are too strong for you die Spurred by these words Chikara seized a spear and gave battle to Waku Handaiyu but could not hold his ground and backing by degrees was driven out into the garden where he missed his footing and slipped into a pond but as Handaiyu thinking to kill him looked down into the pond Chikara cut his enemy in the leg and caused him to fall and then crawling out of the water dispatched him In the meanwhile Kobayashi Hehachi and Shimidzu Ikkaku had been killed by the other Ronins and of all Kotsuke no Suke s retainers not one fighting man remained Chikara seeing this went with his bloody sword in his hand into a back room to search for Kotsuke no Suke but he only found the son of the latter a young lord named Kira Sahioye who carrying a halberd attacked him but was soon wounded and fled Thus the whole of Kotsuke no Suke s men having been killed there was an end of the fighting but as yet there was no trace of Kotsuke no Suke to be found Then Kuranosuke divided his men into several parties and searched the whole house but all in vain women and children weeping were alone to be seen At this the forty seven men began to lose heart in regret that after all their toil they had allowed their enemy to escape them and there was a moment when in their despair they agreed to commit suicide together upon the spot but they determined to make one more effort So Kuranosuke went into Kotsuke no Suke s sleeping room and touching the quilt with his hands exclaimed I have just felt the bed clothes and they are yet warm and so methinks that our enemy is not far off He must certainly be hidden somewhere in the house Greatly excited by this the Ronins renewed their search Now in the raised part of the room near the place of honour there was a picture hanging taking down this picture they saw that there was a large hole in the plastered wall and on thrusting a spear in they could feel nothing beyond it So one of the Ronins called Yazama Jiutaro got into the hole and found that on the other side there was a little courtyard in which there stood an outhouse for holding charcoal and firewood Looking into the outhouse he spied something white at the further end at which he struck with his spear when two armed men sprang out upon him and tried to cut him down but he kept them back until one of his comrades came up and killed one of the two men and engaged the other while Jiutaro entered the outhouse and felt about with his spear Again seeing something white he struck it with his lance when a cry of pain betrayed that it was a man so he rushed up and the man in white clothes who had been wounded in the thigh drew a dirk and aimed a blow at him But Jiutaro wrested the dirk from him and clutching him by the collar dragged him out of the outhouse Then the other Ronin came up and they examined the prisoner attentively and saw that he was a noble looking man some sixty years of age dressed in a white satin sleeping robe which was stained by the blood from the thigh wound which Jiutaro had inflicted The two men felt convinced that this was no other than Kotsuke no Suke and they asked him his name but he gave no answer so they gave the signal whistle and all their comrades collected together at the call then Oishi Kuranosuke bringing a lantern scanned the old man s features and it was indeed Kotsuke no Suke and if further proof were wanting he still bore a scar on his forehead where their master Asano Takumi no Kami had wounded him during the affray in the castle There being no possibility of mistake therefore Oishi Kuranosuke went down on his knees and addressing the old man very respectfully said My lord we are the retainers of Asano Takumi no Kami Last year your lordship and our master quarrelled in the palace and our master was sentenced to hara kiri and his family was ruined We have come to night to avenge him as is the duty of faithful and loyal men I pray your lordship to acknowledge the justice of our purpose And now my lord we beseech you to perform hara kiri I myself shall have the honour to act as your second and when with all humility I shall have received your lordship s head it is my intention to lay it as an offering upon the grave of Asano Takumi no Kami Thus in consideration of the high rank of Kotsuke no Suke the Ronins treated him with the greatest courtesy and over and over again entreated him to perform hara kiri But he crouched speechless and trembling At last Kuranosuke seeing that it was vain to urge him to die the death of a nobleman forced him down and cut off his head with the same dirk with which Asano Takumi no Kami had killed himself Then the forty seven comrades elated at having accomplished their design placed the head in a bucket and prepared to depart but before leaving the house they carefully extinguished all the lights and fires in the place lest by any accident a fire should break out and the neighbours suffer As they were on their way to Takanawa the suburb in which the temple called Sengakuji stands the day broke and the people flocked out to see the forty seven men who with their clothes and arms all blood stained presented a terrible appearance and every one praised them wondering at their valour and faithfulness But they expected every moment that Kotsuke no Suke s father in law would attack them and carry off the head and made ready to die bravely sword in hand However they reached Takanawa in safety for Matsudaira Aki no Kami one of the eighteen chief daimios of Japan of whose house Asano Takumi no Kami had been a cadet had been highly pleased when he heard of the last night s work and he had made ready to assist the Ronins in case they were attacked So Kotsuke no Suke s father in law dared not pursue them At about seven in the morning they came opposite to the palace of Matsudaira Mutsu no Kami the Prince of Sendai and the Prince hearing of it sent for one of his councillors and said The retainers of Takumi no Kami have slain their lord s enemy and are passing this way I cannot sufficiently admire their devotion so as they must be tired and hungry after their night s work do you go and invite them to come in here and set some gruel and a cup of wine before them So the councillor went out and said to Oishi Kuranosuke Sir I am a councillor of the Prince of Sendai and my master bids me beg you as you must be worn out after all you have undergone to come in and partake of such poor refreshment as we can offer you This is my message to you from my lord I thank you sir replied Kuranosuke It is very good of his lordship to trouble himself to think of us We shall accept his kindness gratefully So the forty seven Ronins went into the palace and were feasted with gruel and wine and all the retainers of the Prince of Sendai came and praised them Then Kuranosuke turned to the councillor and said Sir we are truly indebted to you for this kind hospitality but as we have still to hurry to Sengakuji we must needs humbly take our leave And after returning many thanks to their hosts they left the palace of the Prince of Sendai and hastened to Sengakuji where they were met by the abbot of the monastery who went to the front gate to receive them and led them to the tomb of Takumi no Kami And when they came to their lord s grave they took the head of Kotsuke no Suke and having washed it clean in a well hard by laid it as an offering before the tomb When they had done this they engaged the priests of the temple to come and read prayers while they burnt incense first Oishi Kuranosuke burnt incense and then his son Oishi Chikara and after them the other forty five men performed the same ceremony Then Kuranosuke having given all the money that he had by him to the abbot said When we forty seven men shall have performed hara kiri I beg you to bury us decently I rely upon your kindness This is but a trifle that I have to offer such as it is let it be spent in masses for our souls And the abbot marvelling at the faithful courage of the men with tears in his eyes pledged himself to fulfil their wishes So the forty seven Ronins with their minds at rest waited patiently until they should receive the orders of the Government At last they were summoned to the Supreme Court where the governors of Yedo and the public censors had assembled and the sentence passed upon them was as follows Whereas neither respecting the dignity of the city nor fearing the Government having leagued yourselves together to slay your enemy you violently broke into the house of Kira Kotsuke no Suke by night and murdered him the sentence of the Court is that for this audacious conduct you perform hara kiri When the sentence had been read the forty seven Ronins were divided into four parties and handed over to the safe keeping of four different daimios and sheriffs were sent to the palaces of those daimios in whose presence the Ronins were made to perform hara kiri But as from the very beginning they had all made up their minds that to this end they must come they met their death nobly and their corpses were carried to Sengakuji and buried in front of the tomb of their master Asano Takumi no Kami And when the fame of this became noised abroad the people flocked to pray at the graves of these faithful men Illustration THE TOMBS OF THE RONINS Among those who came to pray was a Satsuma man who prostrating himself before the grave of Oishi Kuranosuke said When I saw you lying drunk by the roadside at Yamashina in Kioto I knew not that you were plotting to avenge your lord and thinking you to be a faithless man I trampled on you and spat in your face as I passed And now I have come to ask pardon and offer atonement for the insult of last year With those words he prostrated himself again before the grave and drawing a dirk from his girdle stabbed himself in the belly and died And the chief priest of the temple taking pity upon him buried him by the side of the Ronins and his tomb still remains to be seen with those of the forty seven comrades This is the end of the story of the forty seven Ronins A terrible picture of fierce heroism which it is impossible not to admire In the Japanese mind this feeling of admiration is unmixed and hence it is that the forty seven Ronins receive almost divine honours Pious hands still deck their graves with green boughs and burn incense upon them the clothes and arms which they wore are preserved carefully in a fire proof store house attached to the temple and exhibited yearly to admiring crowds who behold them probably with little less veneration than is accorded to the relics of Aix la Chapelle or Treves and once in sixty years the monks of Sengakuji reap quite a harvest for the good of their temple by holding a commemorative fair or festival to which the people flock during nearly two months A silver key once admitted me to a private inspection of the relics We were ushered my friend and myself into a back apartment of the spacious temple overlooking one of those marvellous miniature gardens cunningly adorned with rockeries and dwarf trees in which the Japanese delight One by one carefully labelled and indexed boxes containing the precious articles were brought out and opened by the chief priest Such a curious medley of old rags and scraps of metal and wood Home made chain armour composed of wads of leather secured together by pieces of iron bear witness to the secrecy with which the Ronins made ready for the fight To have bought armour would have attracted attention so they made it with their own hands Old moth eaten surcoats bits of helmets three flutes a writing box that must have been any age at the time of the tragedy and is now tumbling to pieces tattered trousers of what once was rich silk brocade now all unravelled and befringed scraps of leather part of an old gauntlet crests and badges bits of sword handles spear heads and dirks the latter all red with rust but with certain patches more deeply stained as if the fatal clots of blood were never to be blotted out all these were reverently shown to us Among the confusion and litter were a number of documents Yellow with age and much worn at the folds One was a plan of Kotsuke no Suke s house which one of the Ronins obtained by marrying the daughter of the builder who designed it Three of the manuscripts appeared to me so curious that I obtained leave to have copies taken of them The first is the receipt given by the retainers of Kotsuke no Suke s son in return for the head of their lord s father which the priests restored to the family and runs as follows MEMORANDUM ITEM ONE HEAD ITEM ONE PAPER PARCEL The above articles are acknowledged to have been received Signed SAYADA MAGOBELI Loc sigill SAITO KUNAI Loc sigill To the priests deputed from the Temple Sengakuji His Reverence SEKISHI His Reverence ICHIDON The second paper is a document explanatory of their conduct a copy of which was found on the person of each of the forty seven men Last year in the third month Asano Takumi no Kami upon the occasion of the entertainment of the Imperial ambassador was driven by the force of circumstances to attack and wound my Lord Kotsuke no Suke in the castle in order to avenge an insult offered to him Having done this without considering the dignity of the place and having thus disregarded all rules of propriety he was condemned to hara kiri and his property and castle of Ako were forfeited to the State and were delivered up by his retainers to the officers deputed by the Shogun to receive them After this his followers were all dispersed At the time of the quarrel the high officials present prevented Asano Takumi no Kami from carrying out his intention of killing his enemy my Lord Kotsuke no Suke So Asano Takumi no Kami died without having avenged himself and this was more than his retainers could endure It is impossible to remain under the same heaven with the enemy of lord or father for this reason we have dared to declare enmity against a personage of so exalted rank This day we shall attack Kira Kotsuke no Suke in order to finish the deed of vengeance which was begun by our dead lord If any honourable person should find our bodies after death he is respectfully requested to open and read this document fifteenth year of Genroku twelfth month Signed OISHI KURANOSUKE Retainer of Asano Takumi no Kami and forty six others six Footnote six It is usual for a Japanese when bent upon some deed of violence the end of which in his belief justifies the means to carry about with him a document such as that translated above in which he sets forth his motives that his character may be cleared after death The third manuscript is a paper which the Forty seven Ronins laid upon the tomb of their master together with the head of Kira Kotsuke no Suke The fifteenth year of Genroku the twelfth month and fifteenth day We have come this day to do homage here forty seven men in all from Oishi Kuranosuke down to the foot soldier Terasaka Kichiyemon all cheerfully about to lay down our lives on your behalf We reverently announce this to the honoured spirit of our dead master On the fourteenth day of the third month of last year our honoured master was pleased to attack Kira Kotsuke no Suke for what reason we know not Our honoured master put an end to his own life but Kira Kotsuke no Suke lived Although we fear that after the decree issued by the Government this plot of ours will be displeasing to our honoured master still we who have eaten of your food could not without blushing repeat the verse Thou shalt not live under the same heaven nor tread the same earth with the enemy of thy father or lord nor could we have dared to leave hell and present ourselves before you in paradise unless we had carried out the vengeance which you began Every day that we waited seemed as three autumns to us Verily we have trodden the snow for one day nay for two days and have tasted food but once The old and decrepit the sick and ailing have come forth gladly to lay down their lives Men might laugh at us as at grasshoppers trusting in the strength of their arms and thus shame our honoured lord but we could not halt in our deed of vengeance Having taken counsel together last night we have escorted my Lord Kotsuke no Suke hither to your tomb This dirk seven by which our honoured lord set great store last year and entrusted to our care we now bring back If your noble spirit be now present before this tomb we pray you as a sign to take the dirk and striking the head of your enemy with it a second time to dispel your hatred for ever This is the respectful statement of forty seven men Footnote seven The dirk with which Asano Takumi no Kumi disembowelled himself and with which Oishi Kuranosuke cut off Kotsuke no Suke s head The text Thou shalt not live under the same heaven with the enemy of thy father is based upon the Confucian books doctor Legge in his Life and Teachings of Confucius p one hundred thirteen has an interesting paragraph summing up the doctrine of the sage upon the subject of revenge In the second book of the Le Ke there is the following passage With the slayer of his father a man may not live under the same heaven against the slayer of his brother a man must never have to go home to fetch a weapon with the slayer of his friend a man may not live in the same State The lex talionis is here laid down in its fullest extent The Chow Le tells us of a provision made against the evil consequences of the principle by the appointment of a minister called The Reconciler The provision is very inferior to the cities of refuge which were set apart by Moses for the manslayer to flee to from the fury of the avenger Such as it was however it existed and it is remarkable that Confucius when consulted on the subject took no notice of it but affirmed the duty of blood revenge in the strongest and most unrestricted terms His disciple Tsze Hea asked him What course is to be pursued in the murder of a father or mother He replied The son must sleep upon a matting of grass with his shield for his pillow he must decline to take office he must not live under the same heaven with the slayer When he meets him in the market place or the court he must have his weapon ready to strike him And what is the course in the murder of a brother The surviving brother must not take office in the same State with the slayer yet if he go on his prince s service to the State where the slayer is though he meet him he must not fight with him And what is the course in the murder of an uncle or cousin In this case the nephew or cousin is not the principal If the principal on whom the revenge devolves can take it he has only to stand behind with his weapon in his hand and support him I will add one anecdote to show the sanctity which is attached to the graves of the Forty seven In the month of September eighteen sixty eight a certain man came to pray before the grave of Oishi Chikara Having finished his prayers he deliberately performed hara kiri eight and the belly wound not being mortal dispatched himself by cutting his throat Upon his person were found papers setting forth that being a Ronin and without means of earning a living he had petitioned to be allowed to enter the clan of the Prince of Choshiu which he looked upon as the noblest clan in the realm his petition having been refused nothing remained for him but to die for to be a Ronin was hateful to him and he would serve no other master than the Prince of Choshiu what more fitting place could he find in which to put an end to his life than the graveyard of these Braves This happened at about two hundred yards distance from my house and when I saw the spot an hour or two later the ground was all bespattered with blood and disturbed by the death struggles of the man Footnote eight A purist in Japanese matters may object to the use of the words hara kiri instead of the more elegant expression Seppuku I retain the more vulgar form as being better known and therefore more convenient THE LOVES OF GOMPACHI AND KOMURASAKI Within two miles or so from Yedo and yet well away from the toil and din of the great city stands the village of Meguro Once past the outskirts of the town the road leading thither is bounded on either side by woodlands rich in an endless variety of foliage broken at intervals by the long low line of villages and hamlets As we draw near to Meguro the scenery becoming more and more rustic increases in beauty Deep shady lanes bordered by hedgerows as luxurious as any in England lead down to a valley of rice fields bright with the emerald green of the young crops To the right and to the left rise knolls of fantastic shape crowned with a profusion of Cryptomerias Scotch firs and other cone bearing trees and fringed with thickets of feathery bamboos bending their stems gracefully to the light summer breeze Wherever there is a spot shadier and pleasanter to look upon than the rest there may be seen the red portal of a shrine which the simple piety of the country folk has raised to Inari Sama the patron god of farming or to some other tutelary deity of the place At the eastern outlet of the valley a strip of blue sea bounds the horizon westward are the distant mountains In the foreground in front of a farmhouse snug looking with its roof of velvety brown thatch a troop of sturdy urchins suntanned and stark naked are frisking in the wildest gambols all heedless of the scolding voice of the withered old grandam who sits spinning and minding the house while her son and his wife are away toiling at some outdoor labour Close at our feet runs a stream of pure water in which a group of countrymen are washing the vegetables which they will presently shoulder and carry off to sell by auction in the suburbs of Yedo Not the least beauty of the scene consists in the wondrous clearness of an atmosphere so transparent that the most distant outlines are scarcely dimmed while the details of the nearer ground stand out in sharp bold relief now lit by the rays of a vertical sun now darkened under the flying shadows thrown by the fleecy clouds which sail across the sky Under such a heaven what painter could limn the lights and shades which flit over the woods the pride of Japan whether in late autumn when the russets and yellows of our own trees are mixed with the deep crimson glow of the maples or in spring time when plum and cherry trees and wild camellias giants fifty feet high are in full blossom All that we see is enchanting but there is a strange stillness in the groves rarely does the song of a bird break the silence indeed I know but one warbler whose note has any music in it the uguisu by some enthusiasts called the Japanese nightingale at best a king in the kingdom of the blind The scarcity of animal life of all descriptions man and mosquitoes alone excepted is a standing wonder to the traveller the sportsman must toil many a weary mile to get a shot at boar or deer or pheasant and the plough of the farmer and the trap of the poacher who works in and out of season threaten to exterminate all wild creatures unless indeed the Government should as they threatened in the spring of eighteen sixty nine put in force some adaptation of European game laws But they are lukewarm in the matter a little hawking on a duck pond satisfies the cravings of the modern Japanese sportsman who knows that game laws or no game laws the wild fowl will never fail in winter and the days are long past when my Lord the Shogun used to ride forth with a mighty company to the wild places about Mount Fuji there camping out and hunting the boar the deer and the wolf believing that in so doing he was fostering a manly and military spirit in the land There is one serious drawback to the enjoyment of the beauties of the Japanese country and that is the intolerable affront which is continually offered to one s sense of smell the whole of what should form the sewerage of the city is carried out on the backs of men and horses to be thrown upon the fields and if you would avoid the overpowering nuisance you must walk handkerchief in hand ready to shut out the stench which assails you at every moment It would seem natural while writing of the Japanese country to say a few words about the peasantry their relation to the lord of the soil and their government But these I must reserve for another place At present our dealings are with the pretty village of Meguro At the bottom of a little lane close to the entrance of the village stands an old shrine of the Shinto the form of hero worship which existed in Japan before the introduction of Confucianism or of Buddhism surrounded by lofty Cryptomerias The trees around a Shinto shrine are specially under the protection of the god to whom the altar is dedicated and in connection with them there is a kind of magic still respected by the superstitious which recalls the waxen dolls through the medium of which sorcerers of the middle ages in Europe and indeed those of ancient Greece as Theocritus tells us pretended to kill the enemies of their clients This is called Ushi no toki mairi or going to worship at the hour of the ox nine and is practised by jealous women who wish to be revenged upon their faithless lovers Footnote nine The Chinese and the Japanese following them divide the day of twenty four hours into twelve periods each of which has a sign something like the signs of the Zodiac Midnight until two in the morning is represented by the rat two a m four a m ox four a m six a m tiger six a m eight a m hare eight a m ten a m dragon ten a m twelve noon snake twelve noon two p m horse two p m four p m ram four p m six p m ape six p m eight p m cock eight p m ten p m hog ten p m Midnight fox When the world is at rest at two in the morning the hour of which the ox is the symbol the woman rises she dons a white robe and high sandals or clogs her coif is a metal tripod in which are thrust three lighted candles around her neck she hangs a mirror which falls upon her bosom in her left hand she carries a small straw figure the effigy of the lover who has abandoned her and in her right she grasps a hammer and nails with which she fastens the figure to one of the sacred trees that surround the shrine There she prays for the death of the traitor vowing that if her petition be heard she will herself pull out the nails which now offend the god by wounding the mystic tree Night after night she comes to the shrine and each night she strikes in two or more nails believing that every nail will shorten her lover s life for the god to save his tree will surely strike him dead Meguro is one of the many places round Yedo to which the good citizens flock for purposes convivial or religious or both hence it is that cheek by jowl with the old shrines and temples you will find many a pretty tea house standing at the rival doors of which Mesdemoiselles Sugar Wave of the Sea Flower Seashore and Chrysanthemum are pressing in their invitations to you to enter and rest Not beautiful these damsels if judged by our standard but the charm of Japanese women lies in their manner and dainty little ways and the tea house girl being a professional decoy duck is an adept in the art of flirting en tout bien tout honneur be it remembered for she is not to be confounded with the frail beauties of the Yoshiwara nor even with her sisterhood near the ports open to foreigners and to their corrupting influence For strange as it seems our contact all over the East has an evil effect upon the natives In one of the tea houses a thriving trade is carried on in the sale of wooden tablets some six inches square adorned with the picture of a pink cuttlefish on a bright blue ground These are ex votos destined to be offered up at the Temple of Yakushi Niurai the Buddhist AEsculapius which stands opposite and concerning the foundation of which the following legend is told In the days of old there was a priest called Jikaku who at the age of forty years it being the autumn of the tenth year of the period called Tencho A D eight hundred thirty three was suffering from disease of the eyes which had attacked him three years before In order to be healed from this disease he carved a figure of Yakushi Niurai to which he used to offer up his prayers Five years later he went to China taking with him the figure as his guardian saint and at a place called Kairetsu it protected him from robbers and wild beasts and from other calamities There he passed his time in studying the sacred laws both hidden and revealed and after nine years set sail to return to Japan When he was on the high seas a storm arose and a great fish attacked and tried to swamp the ship so that the rudder and mast were broken and the nearest shore being that of a land inhabited by devils to retreat or to advance was equally dangerous Then the holy man prayed to the patron saint whose image he carried and as he prayed behold the true Yakushi Niurai appeared in the centre of the ship and said to him Verily thou hast travelled far that the sacred laws might be revealed for the salvation of many men now therefore take my image which thou carriest in thy bosom and cast it into the sea that the wind may abate and that thou mayest be delivered from this land of devils The commands of the saints must be obeyed so with tears in his eyes the priest threw into the sea the sacred image which he loved Then did the wind abate and the waves were stilled and the ship went on her course as though she were being drawn by unseen hands until she reached a safe haven In the tenth month of the same year the priest again set sail trusting to the power of his patron saint and reached the harbour of Tsukushi without mishap For three years he prayed that the image which he had cast away might be restored to him until at last one night he was warned in a dream that on the sea shore at Matsura Yakushi Niurai would appear to him In consequence of this dream he went to the province of Hizen and landed on the sea shore at Hirato where in the midst of a blaze of light the image which he had carved appeared to him twice riding on the back of a cuttlefish Thus was the image restored to the world by a miracle In commemoration of his recovery from the disease of the eyes and of his preservation from the dangers of the sea that these things might be known to all posterity the priest established the worship of Tako Yakushi Niurai Yakushi Niurai of the Cuttlefish and came to Meguro where he built the Temple of Fudo Sama ten another Buddhist divinity At this time there was an epidemic of small pox in the village so that men fell down and died in the street and the holy man prayed to Fudo Sama that the plague might be stayed Then the god appeared to him and said The saint Yakushi Niurai of the Cuttlefish whose image thou carriest desires to have his place in this village and he will heal this plague Thou shalt therefore raise a temple to him here that not only this small pox but other diseases for future generations may be cured by his power Footnote ten Fudo literally the motionless Buddha in the state called Nirvana Hearing this the priest shed tears of gratitude and having chosen a piece of fine wood carved a large figure of his patron saint of the cuttlefish and placed the smaller image inside of the larger and laid it up in this temple to which people still flock that they may be healed of their diseases Such is the story of the miracle translated from a small ill printed pamphlet sold by the priests of the temple all the decorations of which even to a bronze lantern in the middle of the yard are in the form of a cuttlefish the sacred emblem of the place What pleasanter lounge in which to while away a hot day could a man wish for than the shade of the trees borne by the hill on which stands the Temple of Fudo Sama Two jets of pure water springing from the rock are voided by spouts carved in the shape of dragons into a stone basin enclosed by rails within which it is written that no woman may enter If you are in luck you may cool yourself by watching some devotee naked save his loin cloth performing the ceremony called Suigiyo that is to say praying under the waterfall that his soul may be purified through his body In winter it requires no small pluck to go through this penance yet I have seen a penitent submit to it for more than a quarter of an hour on a bitterly cold day in January In summer on the other hand the religious exercise called Hiyakudo or the hundred times which may also be seen here to advantage is no small trial of patience It consists in walking backwards and forwards a hundred times between two points within the sacred precincts repeating a prayer each time The count is kept either upon the fingers or by depositing a length of twisted straw each time that the goal is reached at this temple the place allotted for the ceremony is between a grotesque bronze figure of Tengu Sama the Dog of Heaven the terror of children a most hideous monster with a gigantic nose which it is beneficial to rub with a finger afterwards to be applied to one s own nose and a large brown box inscribed with the characters Hiyaku Do in high relief which may generally be seen full of straw tallies It is no sinecure to be a good Buddhist for the gods are not lightly to be propitiated Prayer and fasting mortification of the flesh abstinence from wine from women and from favourite dishes are the only passports to rising in office prosperity in trade recovery from sickness or a happy marriage with a beloved maiden Nor will mere faith without works be efficient A votive tablet of proportionate value to the favour prayed for or a sum of money for the repairs of the shrine or temple is necessary to win the favour of the gods Poorer persons will cut off the queue of their hair and offer that up and at Horinouchi a temple in great renown some eight or nine miles from Yedo there is a rope about two inches and a half in diameter and about six fathoms long entirely made of human hair so given to the gods it lies coiled up dirty moth eaten and uncared for at one end of a long shed full of tablets and pictures by the side of a rude native fire engine The taking of life being displeasing to Buddha outside many of the temples old women and children earn a livelihood by selling sparrows small eels carp and tortoises which the worshipper sets free in honour of the deity within whose territory cocks and hens and doves tame and unharmed perch on every jutty frieze buttress and coigne of vantage But of all the marvellous customs that I wot of in connection with Japanese religious exercises none appears to me so strange as that of spitting at the images of the gods more especially at the statues of the Ni o the two huge red or red and green statues which like Gog and Magog emblems of strength stand as guardians of the chief Buddhist temples The figures are protected by a network of iron wire through which the votaries praying the while spit pieces of paper which they had chewed up into a pulp If the pellet sticks to the statue the omen is favourable if it falls the prayer is not accepted The inside of the great bell at the Tycoon s burial ground and almost every holy statue throughout the country are all covered with these outspittings from pious mouths eleven Footnote eleven It will be readily understood that the customs and ceremonies to which I have alluded belong only to the gross superstitions with which ignorance has overlaid that pure Buddhism of which Professor Max Mueller has pointed out the very real beauties Illustration THE TOMB OF THE SHIYOKU Through all this discourse about temples and tea houses I am coming by degrees to the goal of our pilgrimage two old stones mouldering away in a rank overgrown graveyard hard by an old old burying ground forgotten by all save those who love to dig out the tales of the past The key is kept by a ghoulish old dame almost as time worn and mildewed as the tomb over which she watches Obedient to our call and looking forward to a fee ten times greater than any native would give her she hobbles out and opening the gate points out the stone bearing the inscription the Tomb of the Shiyoku fabulous birds which living one within the other a mysterious duality contained in one body are the emblem of connubial love and fidelity By this stone stands another graven with a longer legend which runs as follows In the old days of Genroku she pined for the beauty of her lover who was as fair to look upon as the flowers and now beneath the moss of this old tombstone all has perished of her save her name Amid the changes of a fitful world this tomb is decaying under the dew and rain gradually crumbling beneath its own dust its outline alone remains Stranger bestow an alms to preserve this stone and we sparing neither pain nor labour will second you with all our hearts Erecting it again let us preserve it from decay for future generations and let us write the following verse upon it These two birds beautiful as the cherry blossoms perished before their time like flowers broken down by the wind before they have borne seed Under the first stone is the dust of Gompachi robber and murderer mixed with that of his true love Komurasaki who lies buried with him Her sorrows and constancy have hallowed the place and pious people still come to burn incense and lay flowers before the grave How she loved him even in death may be seen from the following old world story About two hundred and thirty years ago there lived in the service of a daimio of the province of Inaba a young man called Shirai Gompachi who when he was but sixteen years of age had already won a name for his personal beauty and valour and for his skill in the use of arms Now it happened that one day a dog belonging to him fought with another dog belonging to a fellow clansman and the two masters being both passionate youths disputing as to whose dog had had the best of the fight quarrelled and came to blows and Gompachi slew his adversary and in consequence of this he was obliged to flee from his country and make his escape to Yedo And so Gompachi set out on his travels One night weary and footsore he entered what appeared to him to be a roadside inn ordered some refreshment and went to bed little thinking of the danger that menaced him for as luck would have it this inn turned out to be the trysting place of a gang of robbers into whose clutches he had thus unwittingly fallen To be sure Gompachi s purse was but scantily furnished but his sword and dirk were worth some three hundred ounces of silver and upon these the robbers of whom there were ten had cast envious eyes and had determined to kill the owner for their sake but he all unsuspicious slept on in fancied security In the middle of the night he was startled from his deep slumbers by some one stealthily opening the sliding door which led into his room and rousing himself with an effort he beheld a beautiful young girl fifteen years of age who making signs to him not to stir came up to his bedside and said to him in a whisper Sir the master of this house is the chief of a gang of robbers who have been plotting to murder you this night for the sake of your clothes and your sword As for me I am the daughter of a rich merchant in Mikawa last year the robbers came to our house and carried off my father s treasure and myself I pray you sir take me with you and let us fly from this dreadful place She wept as she spoke and Gompachi was at first too much startled to answer but being a youth of high courage and a cunning fencer to boot he soon recovered his presence of mind and determined to kill the robbers and to deliver the girl out of their hands So he replied Since you say so I will kill these thieves and rescue you this very night only do you when I begin the fight run outside the house that you may be out of harm s way and remain in hiding until I join you Upon this understanding the maiden left him and went her way But he lay awake holding his breath and watching and when the thieves crept noiselessly into the room where they supposed him to be fast asleep he cut down the first man that entered and stretched him dead at his feet The other nine seeing this laid about them with their drawn swords but Gompachi fighting with desperation mastered them at last and slew them After thus ridding himself of his enemies he went outside the house and called to the girl who came running to his side and joyfully travelled on with him to Mikawa where her father dwelt and when they reached Mikawa he took the maiden to the old man s house and told him how when he had fallen among thieves his daughter had come to him in his hour of peril and saved him out of her great pity and how he in return rescuing her from her servitude had brought her back to her home When the old folks saw their daughter whom they had lost restored to them they were beside themselves with joy and shed tears for very happiness and in their gratitude they pressed Gompachi to remain with them and they prepared feasts for him and entertained him hospitably but their daughter who had fallen in love with him for his beauty and knightly valour spent her days in thinking of him and of him alone The young man however in spite of the kindness of the old merchant who wished to adopt him as his son and tried hard to persuade him to consent to this was fretting to go to Yedo and take service as an officer in the household of some noble lord so he resisted the entreaties of the father and the soft speeches of the daughter and made ready to start on his journey and the old merchant seeing that he would not be turned from his purpose gave him a parting gift of two hundred ounces of silver and sorrowfully bade him farewell Illustration GOMPACHI AWAKENED BY THE MAIDEN IN THE ROBBERS DEN But alas for the grief of the maiden who sat sobbing her heart out and mourning over her lover s departure He all the while thinking more of ambition than of love went to her and comforted her and said Dry your eyes sweetheart and weep no more for I shall soon come back to you Do you in the meanwhile be faithful and true to me and tend your parents with filial piety So she wiped away her tears and smiled again when she heard him promise that he would soon return to her And Gompachi went his way and in due time came near to Yedo But his dangers were not yet over for late one night arriving at a place called Suzugamori in the neighbourhood of Yedo he fell in with six highwaymen who attacked him thinking to make short work of killing and robbing him Nothing daunted he drew his sword and dispatched two out of the six but being weary and worn out with his long journey he was sorely pressed and the struggle was going hard with him when a wardsman twelve who happened to pass that way riding in a chair seeing the affray jumped down from his chair and drawing his dirk came to the rescue and between them they put the robbers to flight Footnote twelve Japanese cities are divided into wards and every tradesman and artisan is under the authority of the chief of the ward in which he resides The word chonin or wardsman is generally used in contradistinction to the word samurai which has already been explained as denoting a man belonging to the military class Now it turned out that this kind tradesman who had so happily come to the assistance of Gompachi was no other than Chobei of Bandzuin the chief of the Otokodate or Friendly Society of the wardsmen of Yedo a man famous in the annals of the city whose life exploits and adventures are recited to this day and form the subject of another tale When the highwaymen had disappeared Gompachi turning to his deliverer said I know not who you may be sir but I have to thank you for rescuing me from a great danger And as he proceeded to express his gratitude Chobei replied I am but a poor wardsman a humble man in my way sir and if the robbers ran away it was more by good luck than owing to any merit of mine But I am filled with admiration at the way you fought you displayed a courage and a skill that were beyond your years sir Indeed said the young man smiling with pleasure at hearing himself praised I am still young and inexperienced and am quite ashamed of my bungling style of fencing And now may I ask you sir whither you are bound That is almost more than I know myself for I am a ronin and have no fixed purpose in view That is a bad job said Chobei who felt pity for the lad However if you will excuse my boldness in making such an offer being but a wardsman until you shall have taken service I would fain place my poor house at your disposal Gompachi accepted the offer of his new but trusty friend with thanks so Chobei led him to his house where he lodged him and hospitably entertained him for some months And now Gompachi being idle and having nothing to care for fell into bad ways and began to lead a dissolute life thinking of nothing but gratifying his whims and passions he took to frequenting the Yoshiwara the quarter of the town which is set aside for tea houses and other haunts of wild young men where his handsome face and figure attracted attention and soon made him a great favourite with all the beauties of the neighbourhood About this time men began to speak loud in praise of the charms of Komurasaki or Little Purple a young girl who had recently come to the Yoshiwara and who in beauty and accomplishments outshone all her rivals Gompachi like the rest of the world heard so much of her fame that he determined to go to the house where she dwelt at the sign of The Three Sea coasts and judge for himself whether she deserved all that men said of her Accordingly he set out one day and having arrived at The Three Sea coasts asked to see Komurasaki and being shown into the room where she was sitting advanced towards her but when their eyes met they both started back with a cry of astonishment for this Komurasaki the famous beauty of the Yoshiwara proved to be the very girl whom several months before Gompachi had rescued from the robbers den and restored to her parents in Mikawa He had left her in prosperity and affluence the darling child of a rich father when they had exchanged vows of love and fidelity and now they met in a common stew in Yedo What a change what a contrast How had the riches turned to rust the vows to lies What is this cried Gompachi when he had recovered from his surprise How is it that I find you here pursuing this vile calling in the Yoshiwara Pray explain this to me for there is some mystery beneath all this which I do not understand But Komurasaki who having thus unexpectedly fallen in with her lover that she had yearned for was divided between joy and shame answered weeping Alas my tale is a sad one and would be long to tell After you left us last year calamity and reverses fell upon our house and when my parents became poverty stricken I was at my wits end to know how to support them so I sold this wretched body of mine to the master of this house and sent the money to my father and mother but in spite of this troubles and misfortunes multiplied upon them and now at last they have died of misery and grief And oh lives there in this wide world so unhappy a wretch as I But now that I have met you again you who are so strong help me who am weak You saved me once do not I implore you desert me now and as she told her piteous tale the tears streamed from her eyes This is indeed a sad story replied Gompachi much affected by the recital There must have been a wonderful run of bad luck to bring such misfortune upon your house which but a little while ago I recollect so prosperous However mourn no more for I will not forsake you It is true that I am too poor to redeem you from your servitude but at any rate I will contrive so that you shall be tormented no more Love me therefore and put your trust in me When she heard him speak so kindly she was comforted and wept no more but poured out her whole heart to him and forgot her past sorrows in the great joy of meeting him again When it became time for them to separate he embraced her tenderly and returned to Chobei s house but he could not banish Komurasaki from his mind and all day long he thought of her alone and so it came about that he went daily to the Yoshiwara to see her and if any accident detained him she missing the accustomed visit would become anxious and write to him to inquire the cause of his absence At last pursuing this course of life his stock of money ran short and as being a ronin and without any fixed employment he had no means of renewing his supplies he was ashamed of showing himself penniless at The Three Sea coasts Then it was that a wicked spirit arose within him and he went out and murdered a man and having robbed him of his money carried it to the Yoshiwara From bad to worse is an easy step and the tiger that has once tasted blood is dangerous Blinded and infatuated by his excessive love Gompachi kept on slaying and robbing so that while his outer man was fair to look upon the heart within him was that of a hideous devil At last his friend Chobei could no longer endure the sight of him and turned him out of his house and as sooner or later virtue and vice meet with their reward it came to pass that Gompachi s crimes became notorious and the Government having set spies upon his track he was caught red handed and arrested and his evil deeds having been fully proved against him he was carried off to the execution ground at Suzugamori the Bell Grove and beheaded as a common male factor Now when Gompachi was dead Chobei s old affection for the young man returned and being a kind and pious man he went and claimed his body and head and buried him at Meguro in the grounds of the Temple called Boronji When Komurasaki heard the people at Yoshiwara gossiping about her lover s end her grief knew no bounds so she fled secretly from The Three Sea coasts and came to Meguro and threw herself upon the newly made grave Long she prayed and bitterly she wept over the tomb of him whom with all his faults she had loved so well and then drawing a dagger from her girdle she plunged it in her breast and died The priests of the temple when they saw what had happened wondered greatly and were astonished at the loving faithfulness of this beautiful girl and taking compassion on her they laid her side by side with Gompachi in one grave and over the grave they placed a stone which remains to this day bearing the inscription The Tomb of the Shiyoku And still the people of Yedo visit the place and still they praise the beauty of Gompachi and the filial piety and fidelity of Komurasaki Let us linger for a moment longer in the old graveyard The word which I have translated a few lines above as loving faithfulness means literally chastity When Komurasaki sold herself to supply the wants of her ruined parents she was not according to her lights forfeiting her claim to virtue On the contrary she could perform no greater act of filial piety and so far from incurring reproach among her people her self sacrifice would be worthy of all praise in their eyes This idea has led to grave misunderstanding abroad and indeed no phase of Japanese life has been so misrepresented as this I have heard it stated and seen it printed that it is no disgrace for a respectable Japanese to sell his daughter that men of position and family often choose their wives from such places as The Three Sea coasts and that up to the time of her marriage the conduct of a young girl is a matter of no importance whatever Nothing could be more unjust or more untrue It is only the neediest people that sell their children to be waitresses singers or prostitutes It does occasionally happen that the daughter of a Samurai or gentleman is found in a house of ill fame but such a case could only occur at the death or utter ruin of the parents and an official investigation of the matter has proved it to be so exceptional that the presence of a young lady in such a place is an enormous attraction her superior education and accomplishments shedding a lustre over the house As for gentlemen marrying women of bad character are not such things known in Europe Do ladies of the demi monde never make good marriages Mesalliances are far rarer in Japan than with us Certainly among the lowest class of the population such marriages may occasionally occur for it often happens that a woman can lay by a tempting dowry out of her wretched earnings but amongst the gentry of the country they are unknown And yet a girl is not disgraced if for her parents sake she sells herself to a life of misery so great that when a Japanese enters a house of ill fame he is forced to leave his sword and dirk at the door for two reasons first to prevent brawling secondly because it is known that some of the women inside so loathe their existence that they would put an end to it could they get hold of a weapon It is a curious fact that in all the Daimio s castle towns with the exception of some which are also seaports open prostitution is strictly forbidden although if report speaks truly public morality rather suffers than gains by the prohibition The misapprehension which exists upon the subject of prostitution in Japan may be accounted for by the fact that foreign writers basing their judgment upon the vice of the open ports have not hesitated to pronounce the Japanese women unchaste As fairly might a Japanese writing about England argue from the street walkers of Portsmouth or Plymouth to the wives sisters and daughters of these very authors In some respects the gulf fixed between virtue and vice in Japan is even greater than in England The Eastern courtesan is confined to a certain quarter of the town and distinguished by a peculiarly gaudy costume and by a head dress which consists of a forest of light tortoiseshell hair pins stuck round her head like a saint s glory a glory of shame which a modest woman would sooner die than wear Vice jostling virtue in the public places virtue imitating the fashions set by vice and buying trinkets or furniture at the sale of vice s effects these are social phenomena which the East knows not The custom prevalent among the lower orders of bathing in public bath houses without distinction of the sexes is another circumstance which has tended to spread abroad very false notions upon the subject of the chastity of the Japanese women Every traveller is shocked by it and every writer finds in it matter for a page of pungent description Yet it is only those who are so poor and they must be poor indeed that they cannot afford a bath at home who at the end of their day s work go to the public bath house to refresh themselves before sitting down to their evening meal having been used to the scene from their childhood they see no indelicacy in it it is a matter of course and honi soit qui mal y pense certainly there is far less indecency and immorality resulting from this public bathing than from the promiscuous herding together of all sexes and ages which disgraces our own lodging houses in the great cities and the hideous hovels in which some of our labourers have to pass their lives nor can it be said that there is more confusion of sexes amongst the lowest orders in Japan than in Europe Speaking upon the subject once with a Japanese gentleman I observed that we considered it an act of indecency for men and women to wash together He shrugged his shoulders as he answered But then Westerns have such prurient minds Some time ago at the open port of Yokohama the Government out of deference to the prejudices of foreigners forbade the men and women to bathe together and no doubt this was the first step towards putting down the practice altogether as for women tubbing in the open streets of Yedo I have read of such things in books written by foreigners but during a residence of three years and a half in which time I crossed and recrossed every part of the great city at all hours of the day I never once saw such a sight I believe myself that it can only be seen at certain hot mineral springs in remote country districts The best answer to the general charge of immorality which has been brought against the Japanese women during their period of unmarried life lies in the fact that every man who can afford to do so keeps the maidens of his family closely guarded in the strictest seclusion The daughter of poverty indeed must work and go abroad but not a man is allowed to approach the daughter of a gentleman and she is taught that if by accident any insult should be offered to her the knife which she carries at her girdle is meant for use and not merely as a badge of her rank Not long ago a tragedy took place in the house of one of the chief nobles in Yedo One of My Lady s tire women herself a damsel of gentle blood and gifted with rare beauty had attracted the attention of a retainer in the palace who fell desperately in love with her For a long time the strict rules of decorum by which she was hedged in prevented him from declaring his passion but at last he contrived to gain access to her presence and so far forgot himself that she drawing her poniard stabbed him in the eye so that he was carried off fainting and presently died The girl s declaration that the dead man had attempted to insult her was held to be sufficient justification of her deed and instead of being blamed she was praised and extolled for her valour and chastity As the affair had taken place within the four walls of a powerful noble there was no official investigation into the matter with which the authorities of the palace were competent to deal The truth of this story was vouched for by two or three persons whose word I have no reason to doubt and who had themselves been mixed up in it I can bear witness that it is in complete harmony with Japanese ideas and certainly it seems more just that Lucretia should kill Tarquin than herself The better the Japanese people come to be known and understood the more I am certain will it be felt that a great injustice has been done them in the sweeping attacks which have been made upon their women Writers are agreed I believe that their matrons are as a rule without reproach If their maidens are chaste as I contend that from very force of circumstances they cannot help being what becomes of all these charges of vice and immodesty Do they not rather recoil upon the accusers who would appear to have studied the Japanese woman only in the harlot of Yokohama Having said so much I will now try to give some account of the famous Yoshiwara thirteen of Yedo to which frequent allusion will have to be made in the course of these tales Footnote thirteen The name Yoshiwara which is becoming generic for Flower Districts Anglice quarters occupied by brothels is sometimes derived from the town Yoshiwara in Sunshine because it was said that the women of that place furnished a large proportion of the beauties of the Yedo Yoshiwara The correct derivation is probably that given below At the end of the sixteenth century the courtesans of Yedo lived in three special places these were the street called Koji machi in which dwelt the women who came from Kioto the Kamakura Street and a spot opposite the great bridge in which last two places lived women brought from Suruga Besides these there afterwards came women from Fushimi and from Nara who lodged scattered here and there throughout the town This appears to have scandalized a certain reformer named Shoji Jinyemon who in the year sixteen twelve addressed a memorial to the Government petitioning that the women who lived in different parts of the town should be collected in one Flower Quarter His petition was granted in the year sixteen seventeen and he fixed upon a place called Fukiyacho which on account of the quantities of rushes which grew there was named Yoshi Wara or the rush moor a name which now a days by a play upon the word yoshi is written with two Chinese characters signifying the good or lucky moor The place was divided into four streets called the Yedo Street the Second Yedo Street the Kioto Street and the Second Kioto Street In the eighth month of the year sixteen fifty five when Yedo was beginning to increase in size and importance the Yoshiwara preserving its name was transplanted bodily to the spot which it now occupies at the northern end of the town And the streets in it were named after the places from which the greater number of their inhabitants originally came as the Sakai Street the Fushimi Street c The official Guide to the Yoshiwara for eighteen sixty nine gives a return of one hundred fifty three brothels containing three thousand two hundred eighty nine courtesans of all classes from the Oiran or proud beauty who dressed up in gorgeous brocade of gold and silver with painted face and gilded lips and with her teeth fashionably blacked has all the young bloods of Yedo at her feet down to the humble Shinzo or white toothed woman who rots away her life in the common stews These figures do not however represent the whole of the prostitution of Yedo the Yoshiwara is the chief but not the only abiding place of the public women At Fukagawa there is another Flower District built upon the same principle as the Yoshiwara while at Shinagawa Shinjiku Itabashi Senji and Kadzukappara the hotels contain women who nominally only waitresses are in reality prostitutes There are also women called Jigoku Omna or hell women who without being borne on the books of any brothel live in their own houses and ply their trade in secret On the whole I believe the amount of prostitution in Yedo to be wonderfully small considering the vast size of the city There are three hundred ninety four tea houses in the Yoshiwara which are largely used as places of assignation and which on those occasions are paid not by the visitors frequenting them but by the keepers of the brothels It is also the fashion to give dinners and drinking parties at these houses for which the services of Taikomochi or jesters among whom there are thirty nine chief celebrities and of singing and dancing girls are retained The Guide to the Yoshiwara gives a list of fifty five famous singing girls besides a host of minor stars These women are not to be confounded with the courtesans Their conduct is very closely watched by their masters and they always go out to parties in couples or in bands so that they may be a check upon one another Doubtless however in spite of all precautions the shower of gold does from time to time find its way to Danae s lap and to be the favoured lover of a fashionable singer or dancer is rather a feather in the cap of a fast young Japanese gentleman The fee paid to singing girls for performing during a space of two hours is one shilling and fourpence each for six hours the fee is quadrupled and it is customary to give the girls a hana or present for themselves besides their regular pay which goes to the master of the troupe to which they belong Courtesans singing women and dancers are bought by contractors either as children when they are educated for their calling or at a more advanced age when their accomplishments and charms render them desirable investments The engagement is never made life long for once past the flower of their youth the poor creatures would be mere burthens upon their masters a courtesan is usually bought until she shall have reached the age of twenty seven after which she becomes her own property Singers remain longer in harness but even they rarely work after the age of thirty for Japanese women like Italians age quickly and have none of that intermediate stage between youth and old age which seems to be confined to countries where there is a twilight Children destined to be trained as singers are usually bought when they are five or six years old a likely child fetching from about thirty five to fifty shillings the purchaser undertakes the education of his charge and brings the little thing up as his own child The parents sign a paper absolving him from all responsibility in case of sickness or accident but they know that their child will be well treated and cared for the interests of the buyer being their material guarantee Girls of fifteen or upwards who are sufficiently accomplished to join a company of singers fetch ten times the price paid for children for in their case there is no risk and no expense of education Little children who are bought for purposes of prostitution at the age of five or six years fetch about the same price as those that are bought to be singers During their novitiate they are employed to wait upon the Oiran or fashionable courtesans in the capacity of little female pages Kamuro They are mostly the children of distressed persons or orphans whom their relatives cruelly sell rather than be at the expense and trouble of bringing them up Of the girls who enter the profession later in life some are orphans who have no other means of earning a livelihood others sell their bodies out of filial piety that they may succour their sick or needy parents others are married women who enter the Yoshiwara to supply the wants of their husbands and a very small proportion is recruited from girls who have been seduced and abandoned perhaps sold by faithless lovers The time to see the Yoshiwara to the best advantage is just after nightfall when the lamps are lighted Then it is that the women who for the last two hours have been engaged in gilding their lips and painting their eyebrows black and their throats and bosoms a snowy white carefully leaving three brown Van dyke collar points where the back of the head joins the neck in accordance with one of the strictest rules of Japanese cosmetic science leave the back rooms and take their places side by side in a kind of long narrow cage the wooden bars of which open on to the public thoroughfare Here they sit for hours gorgeous in dresses of silk and gold and silver embroidery speechless and motionless as wax figures until they shall have attracted the attention of some of the passers by who begin to throng the place At Yokohama indeed and at the other open ports the women of the Yoshiwara are loud in their invitations to visitors frequently relieving the monotony of their own language by some blasphemous term of endearment picked up from British and American seamen but in the Flower District at Yedo and wherever Japanese customs are untainted the utmost decorum prevails Although the shape which vice takes is ugly enough still it has this merit that it is unobtrusive Never need the pure be contaminated by contact with the impure he who goes to the Yoshiwara goes there knowing full well what he will find but the virtuous man may live through his life without having this kind of vice forced upon his sight Here again do the open ports contrast unfavourably with other places Yokohama at night is as leprous a place as the London Haymarket fourteen Footnote fourteen Those who are interested in this branch of social science will find much curious information upon the subject of prostitution in Japan in a pamphlet published at Yokohama by doctor Newton R N a philanthropist who has been engaged for the last two years in establishing a Lock Hospital at that place In spite of much opposition from prejudice and ignorance his labours have been crowned by great success A public woman or singer on entering her profession assumes a nom de guerre by which she is known until her engagement is at an end Some of these names are so pretty and quaint that I will take a few specimens from the Yoshiwara Saiken the guidebook upon which this notice is based Little Pine Little Butterfly Brightness of the Flowers The Jewel River Gold Mountain Pearl Harp The Stork that lives a Thousand Years Village of Flowers Sea Beach The Little Dragon Little Purple Silver Chrysanthemum Waterfall White Brightness Forest of Cherries these and a host of other quaint conceits are the one prettiness of a very foul place KAZUMA S REVENGE It is a law that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword In Japan where there exists a large armed class over whom there is practically little or no control party and clan broils and single quarrels ending in bloodshed and death are matters of daily occurrence and it has been observed that Edinburgh in the olden time when the clansmen roistering through the streets at night would pass from high words to deadly blows is perhaps the best European parallel of modern Yedo or Kioto It follows that of all his possessions the Samurai sets most store by his sword his constant companion his ally defensive and offensive The price of a sword by a famous maker reaches a high sum a Japanese noble will sometimes be found girding on a sword the blade of which unmounted is worth from six hundred to a thousand riyos say from Ltwo hundred to Lthree hundred and the mounting rich in cunning metal work will be of proportionate value These swords are handed down as heirlooms from father to son and become almost a part of the wearer s own self Iyeyasu the founder of the last dynasty of Shoguns wrote in his Legacy fifteen a code of rules drawn up for the guidance of his successors and their advisers in the government The girded sword is the living soul of the Samurai In the case of a Samurai forgetting his sword act as is appointed it may not be overlooked Footnote fifteen The Legacy of Iyeyasu translated by F Lowder Yokohama eighteen sixty eight Printed for private circulation The occupation of a swordsmith is an honourable profession the members of which are men of gentle blood In a country where trade is looked down upon as degrading it is strange to find this single exception to the general rule The traditions of the craft are many and curious During the most critical moment of the forging of the sword when the steel edge is being welded into the body of the iron blade it is a custom which still obtains among old fashioned armourers to put on the cap and robes worn by the Kuge or nobles of the Mikado s court and closing the doors of the workshop to labour in secrecy and freedom from interruption the half gloom adding to the mystery of the operation Sometimes the occasion is even invested with a certain sanctity a tasselled cord of straw such as is hung before the shrines of the Kami or native gods of Japan being suspended between two bamboo poles in the forge which for the nonce is converted into a holy altar At Osaka I lived opposite to one Kusano Yoshiaki a swordsmith a most intelligent and amiable gentleman who was famous throughout his neighbourhood for his good and charitable deeds His idea was that having been bred up to a calling which trades in life and death he was bound so far as in him lay to atone for this by seeking to alleviate the suffering which is in the world and he carried out his principle to the extent of impoverishing himself No neighbour ever appealed to him in vain for help in tending the sick or burying the dead No beggar or lazar was ever turned from his door without receiving some mark of his bounty whether in money or in kind Nor was his scrupulous honesty less remarkable than his charity While other smiths are in the habit of earning large sums of money by counterfeiting the marks of the famous makers of old he was able to boast that he had never turned out a weapon which bore any other mark than his own From his father and his forefathers he inherited his trade which in his turn he will hand over to his son a hard working honest and sturdy man the clank of whose hammer and anvil may be heard from daybreak to sundown Illustration FORGING THE SWORD The trenchant edge of the Japanese sword is notorious It is said that the best blades will in the hands of an expert swordsman cut through the dead bodies of three men laid one upon the other at a blow The swords of the Shogun used to be tried upon the corpses of executed criminals the public headsman was entrusted with the duty and for a nose medicine or bribe of two bus about three shillings would substitute the weapon of a private individual for that of his Lord Dogs and beggars lying helpless by the roadside not unfrequently serve to test a ruffian s sword but the executioner earns many a fee from those who wish to see how their blades will cut off a head The statesman who shall enact a law forbidding the carrying of this deadly weapon will indeed have deserved well of his country but it will be a difficult task to undertake and a dangerous one I would not give much for that man s life The hand of every swashbuckler in the empire would be against him One day as we were talking over this and other kindred subjects a friend of mine a man of advanced and liberal views wrote down his opinion more Japonico in a verse of poetry which ran as follows I would that all the swords and dirks in the country might be collected in one place and molten down and that from the metal so produced one huge sword might be forged which being the only blade left should be the girded sword of Great Japan The following history is in more senses than one a Tale of a Sword About two hundred and fifty years ago Ikeda Kunaishoyu was Lord of the Province of Inaba Among his retainers were two gentlemen named Watanabe Yukiye and Kawai Matazayemon who were bound together by strong ties of friendship and were in the habit of frequently visiting at one another s houses One day Yukiye was sitting conversing with Matazayemon in the house of the latter when on a sudden a sword that was lying in the raised part of the room caught his eye As he saw it he started and said Pray tell me how came you by that sword Well as you know when my Lord Ikeda followed my Lord Tokugawa Iyeyasu to fight at Nagakude my father went in his train and it was at the battle of Nagakude that he picked up this sword My father went too and was killed in the fight and this sword which was an heirloom in our family for many generations was lost at that time As it is of great value in my eyes I do wish that if you set no special store by it you would have the great kindness to return it to me That is a very easy matter and no more than what one friend should do by another Pray take it Upon this Yukiye gratefully took the sword and having carried it home put it carefully away At the beginning of the ensuing year Matazayemon fell sick and died and Yukiye mourning bitterly for the loss of his good friend and anxious to requite the favour which he had received in the matter of his father s sword did many acts of kindness to the dead man s son a young man twenty two years of age named Matagoro Now this Matagoro was a base hearted cur who had begrudged the sword that his father had given to Yukiye and complained publicly and often that Yukiye had never made any present in return and in this way Yukiye got a bad name in my Lord s palace as a stingy and illiberal man But Yukiye had a son called Kazuma a youth sixteen years of age who served as one of the Prince s pages of honour One evening as he and one of his brother pages were talking together the latter said Matagoro is telling everybody that your father accepted a handsome sword from him and never made him any present in return and people are beginning to gossip about it Indeed replied the other my father received that sword from Matagoro s father as a mark of friendship and good will and considering that it would be an insult to send a present of money in return thought to return the favour by acts of kindness towards Matagoro I suppose it is money he wants When Kazuma s service was over he returned home and went to his father s room to tell him the report that was being spread in the palace and begged him to send an ample present of money to Matagoro Yukrye reflected for a while and said You are too young to understand the right line of conduct in such matters Matagoro s father and myself were very close friends so seeing that he had ungrudgingly given me back the sword of my ancestors I thinking to requite his kindness at his death rendered important services to Matagoro It would be easy to finish the matter by sending a present of money but I had rather take the sword and return it than be under an obligation to this mean churl who knows not the laws which regulate the intercourse and dealings of men of gentle blood So Yukiye in his anger took the sword to Matagoro s house and said to him I have come to your house this night for no other purpose than to restore to you the sword which your father gave me and with this he placed the sword before Matagoro Indeed replied the other I trust that you will not pain me by returning a present which my father made you Amongst men of gentle birth said Yukiye laughing scornfully it is the custom to requite presents in the first place by kindness and afterwards by a suitable gift offered with a free heart But it is no use talking to such as you who are ignorant of the first principles of good breeding so I have the honour to give you back the sword As Yukiye went on bitterly to reprove Matagoro the latter waxed very wroth and being a ruffian would have killed Yukiye on the spot but he old man as he was was a skilful swordsman so Matagoro craven like determined to wait until he could attack him unawares Little suspecting any treachery Yukiye started to return home and Matagoro under the pretence of attending him to the door came behind him with his sword drawn and cut him in the shoulder The older man turning round drew and defended himself but having received a severe wound in the first instance he fainted away from loss of blood and Matagoro slew him The mother of Matagoro startled by the noise came out and when she saw what had been done she was afraid and said Passionate man what have you done You are a murderer and now your life will be forfeit What terrible deed is this I have killed him now and there s nothing to be done Come mother before the matter becomes known let us fly together from this house I will follow you do you go and seek out my Lord Abe Shirogoro a chief among the Hatamotos sixteen who was my foster child You had better fly to him for protection and remain in hiding Footnote sixteen Hatamotos The Hatamotos were the feudatory nobles of the Shogun or Tycoon The office of Taikun having been abolished the Hatamotos no longer exist For further information respecting them see the note at the end of the story So the old woman persuaded her son to make his escape and sent him to the palace of Shirogoro Now it happened that at this time the Hatamotos had formed themselves into a league against the powerful Daimios and Abe Shirogoro with two other noblemen named Kondo Noborinosuke and Midzuno Jiurozayemon was at the head of the league It followed as a matter of course that his forces were frequently recruited by vicious men who had no means of gaining their living and whom he received and entreated kindly without asking any questions as to their antecedents how much the more then on being applied to for an asylum by the son of his own foster mother did he willingly extend his patronage to him and guarantee him against all danger So he called a meeting of the principal Hatamotos and introduced Matagoro to them saying This man is a retainer of Ikeda Kunaishoyu who having cause of hatred against a man named Watanabe Yukiye has slain him and has fled to me for protection this man s mother suckled me when I was an infant and right or wrong I will befriend him If therefore Ikeda Kunaishoyu should send to require me to deliver him up I trust that you will one and all put forth your strength and help me to defend him Ay that will we with pleasure replied Kondo Noborinosuke We have for some time had cause to complain of the scorn with which the Daimios have treated us Let Ikeda Kunaishoyu send to claim this man and we will show him the power of the Hatamotos All the other Hatamotos with one accord applauded this determination and made ready their force for an armed resistance should my Lord Kunaishoyu send to demand the surrender of Matugoro But the latter remained as a welcome guest in the house of Abe Shirogoro Illustration MATAGORO KILLS YUKIYE Now when Watanabe Kazuma saw that as the night advanced his father Yukiye did not return home he became anxious and went to the house of Matagoro to seek for him and finding to his horror that he was murdered fell upon the corpse and embraced it weeping On a sudden it flashed across him that this must assuredly be the handiwork of Matagoro so he rushed furiously into the house determined to kill his father s murderer upon the spot But Matagoro had already fled and he found only the mother who was making her preparations for following her son to the house of Abe Shirogoro so he bound the old woman and searched all over the house for her son but seeing that his search was fruitless he carried off the mother and handed her over to one of the elders of the clan at the same time laying information against Matagoro as his father s murderer When the affair was reported to the Prince he was very angry and ordered that the old woman should remain bound and be cast into prison until the whereabouts of her son should be discovered Then Kazuma buried his father s corpse with great pomp and the widow and the orphan mourned over their loss It soon became known amongst the people of Abe Shirogoro that the mother of Matagoro had been imprisoned for her son s crime and they immediately set about planning her rescue so they sent to the palace of my Lord Kunaishoyu a messenger who when he was introduced to the councillor of the Prince said We have heard that in consequence of the murder of Yukiye my lord has been pleased to imprison the mother of Matagoro Our master Shirogoro has arrested the criminal and will deliver him up to you But the mother has committed no crime so we pray that she may be released from a cruel imprisonment she was the foster mother of our master and he would fain intercede to save her life Should you consent to this we on our side will give up the murderer and hand him over to you in front of our master s gate to morrow The councillor repeated this message to the Prince who in his pleasure at being able to give Kazuma his revenge on the morrow immediately agreed to the proposal and the messenger returned triumphant at the success of the scheme On the following day the Prince ordered the mother of Matagoro to be placed in a litter and carried to the Hatamoto s dwelling in charge of a retainer named Sasawo Danyemon who when he arrived at the door of Abe Shirogoro s house said I am charged to hand over to you the mother of Matagoro and in exchange I am authorized to receive her son at your hands We will immediately give him up to you but as the mother and son are now about to bid an eternal farewell to one another we beg you to be so kind as to tarry a little With this the retainers of Shirogoro led the old woman inside their master s house and Sasawo Danyemon remained waiting outside until at last he grew impatient and ventured to hurry on the people within We return you many thanks replied they for your kindness in bringing us the mother but as the son cannot go with you at present you had better return home as quickly as possible We are afraid we have put you to much trouble And so they mocked him When Danyemon saw that he had not only been cheated into giving up the old woman but was being made a laughing stock of into the bargain he flew into a great rage and thought to break into the house and seize Matagoro and his mother by force but peeping into the courtyard he saw that it was filled with Hatamotos carrying guns and naked swords Not caring then to die fighting a hopeless battle and at the same time feeling that after having been so cheated he would be put to shame before his lord Sasawo Danyemon went to the burial place of his ancestors and disembowelled himself in front of their graves Illustration THE DEATH OF DANYEMON When the Prince heard how his messenger had been treated he was indignant and summoning his councillors resolved although he was suffering from sickness to collect his retainers and attack Abe Shirogoro and the other chief Daimios when the matter became publicly known took up the cause and determined that the Hatamotos must be chastised for their insolence On their side the Hatamotos put forth all their efforts to resist the Daimios So Yedo became disturbed and the riotous state of the city caused great anxiety to the Government who took counsel together how they might restore peace As the Hatamotos were directly under the orders of the Shogun it was no difficult matter to put them down the hard question to solve was how to put a restraint upon the great Daimios However one of the Gorojin seventeen named Matsudaira Idzu no Kami a man of great intelligence hit upon a plan by which he might secure this end Footnote seventeen The first Council of the Shogun s ministers literally assembly of imperial elders There was at this time in the service of the Shogun a physician named Nakarai Tsusen who was in the habit of frequenting the palace of my Lord Kunaishoyu and who for some time past had been treating him for the disease from which he was suffering Idzu no Kami sent secretly for this physician and summoning him to his private room engaged him in conversation in the midst of which he suddenly dropped his voice and said to him in a whisper Listen Tsusen You have received great favours at the hands of the Shogun The Government is now sorely straitened are you willing to carry your loyalty so far as to lay down your life on its behalf Ay my lord for generations my forefathers have held their property by the grace of the Shogun I am willing this night to lay down my life for my Prince as a faithful vassal should Well then I will tell you The great Daimios and the Hatamotos have fallen out about this affair of Matagoro and lately it has seemed as if they meant to come to blows The country will be agitated and the farmers and townsfolk suffer great misery if we cannot quell the tumult The Hatamotos will be easily kept under but it will be no light task to pacify the great Daimios If you are willing to lay down your life in carrying out a stratagem of mine peace will be restored to the country but your loyalty will be your death I am ready to sacrifice my life in this service This is my plan You have been attending my Lord Kunaishoyu in his sickness to morrow you must go to see him and put poison in his physic If we can kill him the agitation will cease This is the service which I ask of you Tsusen agreed to undertake the deed and on the following day when he went to see Kunaishoyu he carried with him poisoned drugs Half the draught he drank himself eighteen and thus put the Prince off his guard so that he swallowed the remainder fearlessly Tsusen seeing this hurried away and as he was carried home in his litter the death agony seized him and he died vomiting blood Footnote eighteen A physician attending a personage of exalted rank has always to drink half the potion he prescribes as a test of his good faith My Lord Kunaishoyu died in the same way in great torture and in the confusion attending upon his death and funeral ceremonies the struggle which was impending with the Hatamotos was delayed In the meanwhile the Gorojiu Idzu no Kami summoned the three leaders of the Hatamotos and addressed them as follows The secret plottings and treasonable turbulent conduct of you three men so unbecoming your position as Hatamotos have enraged my lord the Shogun to such a degree that he has been pleased to order that you be imprisoned in a temple and that your patrimony be given over to your next heirs Accordingly the three Hatamotos after having been severely admonished were confined in a temple called Kanyeiji and the remaining Hatamotos scared by this example dispersed in peace As for the great Daimios inasmuch as after the death of my Lord Kunaishoyu the Hatamotos were all dispersed there was no enemy left for them to fight with so the tumult was quelled and peace was restored Thus it happened that Matagoro lost his patron so taking his mother with him he went and placed himself under the protection of an old man named Sakurai Jiuzayemon This old man was a famous teacher of lance exercise and enjoyed both wealth and honour so he took in Matagoro and having engaged as a guard thirty Ronins all resolute fellows and well skilled in the arts of war they all fled together to a distant place called Sagara All this time Watanabe Kazuma had been brooding over his father s death and thinking how he should be revenged upon the murderer so when my Lord Kunaishoyu suddenly died he went to the young Prince who succeeded him and obtained leave of absence to go and seek out his father s enemy Now Kazuma s elder sister was married to a man named Araki Matayemon who at that time was famous as the first swordsman in Japan As Kazuma was but sixteen years of age this Matayemon taking into consideration his near relationship as son in law to the murdered man determined to go forth with the lad as his guardian and help him to seek out Matagoro and two of Matayemon s retainers named Ishidome Busuke and Ikezoye Magohachi made up their minds at all hazards to follow their master The latter when he heard their intention thanked them but refused the offer saying that as he was now about to engage in a vendetta in which his life would be continually in jeopardy and as it would be a lasting grief to him should either of them receive a wound in such a service he must beg them to renounce their intention but they answered Master this is a cruel speech of yours All these years have we received nought but kindness and favours at your hands and now that you are engaged in the pursuit of this murderer we desire to follow you and if needs must to lay down our lives in your service Furthermore we have heard that the friends of this Matagoro are no fewer than thirty six men so however bravely you may fight you will be in peril from the superior numbers of your enemy However if you are pleased to persist in your refusal to take us we have made up our minds that there is no resource for us but to disembowel ourselves on the spot When Matayemon and Kazuma heard these words they wondered at these faithful and brave men and were moved to tears Then Matayemon said The kindness of you two brave fellows is without precedent Well then I will accept your services gratefully Then the two men having obtained their wish cheerfully followed their master and the four set out together upon their journey to seek out Matagoro of whose whereabouts they were completely ignorant Matagoro in the meanwhile had made his way with the old man Sakurai Jiuzayemon and his thirty Ronins to Osaka But strong as they were in numbers they travelled in great secrecy The reason for this was that the old man s younger brother Sakurai Jinsuke a fencing master by profession had once had a fencing match with Matayemon Kazuma s brother in law and had been shamefully beaten so that the party were greatly afraid of Matayemon and felt that since he was taking up Kazuma s cause and acting as his guardian they might be worsted in spite of their numbers so they went on their way with great caution and having reached Osaka put up at an inn in a quarter called Ikutama and hid from Kazuma and Matayemon The latter also in good time reached Osaka and spared no pains to seek out Matagoro One evening towards dusk as Matayemon was walking in the quarter where the enemy were staying he saw a man dressed as a gentleman s servant enter a cook shop and order some buckwheat porridge for thirty six men and looking attentively at the man he recognized him as the servant of Sakurai Jiuzayemon so he hid himself in a dark place and watched and heard the fellow say My master Sakurai Jiuzayemon is about to start for Sagara to morrow morning to return thanks to the gods for his recovery from a sickness from which he has been suffering so I am in a great hurry With these words the servant hastened away and Matayemon entering the shop called for some porridge and as he ate it made some inquiries as to the man who had just given so large an order for buckwheat porridge The master of the shop answered that he was the attendant of a party of thirty six gentlemen who were staying at such and such an inn Then Matayemon having found out all that he wanted to know went home and told Kazuma who was delighted at the prospect of carrying his revenge into execution on the morrow That same evening Matayemon sent one of his two faithful retainers as a spy to the inn to find out at what hour Matagoro was to set out on the following morning and he ascertained from the servants of the inn that the party was to start at daybreak for Sagara stopping at Ise to worship at the shrine of Tersho Daijin nineteen Footnote nineteen Goddess of the sun and ancestress of the Mikados Matayemon made his preparations accordingly and with Kazuma and his two retainers started before dawn Beyond Uyeno in the province of Iga the castle town of the Daimio Todo Idzumi no Kami there is a wide and lonely moor and this was the place upon which they fixed for the attack upon the enemy When they had arrived at the spot Matayemon went into a tea house by the roadside and wrote a petition to the governor of the Daimio s castle town for permission to carry out the vendetta within its precincts twenty then he addressed Kazuma and said When we fall in with Matagoro and begin the fight do you engage and slay your father s murderer attack him and him only and I will keep off his guard of Ronins then turning to his two retainers As for you keep close to Kazuma and should the Ronins attempt to rescue Matagoro it will be your duty to prevent them and succour Kazuma And having further laid down each man s duties with great minuteness they lay in wait for the arrival of the enemy Whilst they were resting in the tea house the governor of the castle town arrived and asking for Matayemou said I have the honour to be the governor of the castle town of Todo Idzumi no Kami My lord having learnt your intention of slaying your enemy within the precincts of his citadel gives his consent and as a proof of his admiration of your fidelity and valour he has further sent you a detachment of infantry one hundred strong to guard the place so that should any of the thirty six men attempt to escape you may set your mind at ease for flight will be impossible Footnote twenty In respect to revenging injury done to master or father it is granted by the wise and virtuous Confucius that you and the injurer cannot live together under the canopy of heaven A person harbouring such vengeance shall notify the same in writing to the Criminal Court and although no check or hindrance may be offered to his carrying out his desire within the period allowed for that purpose it is forbidden that the chastisement of an enemy be attended with riot Fellows who neglect to give notice of their intended revenge are like wolves of pretext and their punishment or pardon should depend upon the circumstances of the case Legacy of Iyeyasu ut supra When Matayemon and Kazurna had expressed their thanks for his lordship s gracious kindness the governor took his leave and returned home At last the enemy s train was seen in the distance First came Sakurai Jiuzayemon and his younger brother Jinsuke and next to them followed Kawai Matagoro and Takenouchi Gentan These four men who were the bravest and the foremost of the band of Ronins were riding on pack horses and the remainder were marching on foot keeping close together As they drew near Kazuma who was impatient to avenge his father stepped boldly forward and shouted in a loud voice Here stand I Kazuma the son of Yukiye whom you Matagoro treacherously slew determined to avenge my father s death Come forth then and do battle with me and let us see which of us twain is the better man And before the Ronins had recovered from their astonishment Matayemon said I Arake Matayemon the son in law of Yukiye have come to second Kazuma in his deed of vengeance Win or lose you must give us battle When the thirty six men heard the name of Matayemon they were greatly afraid but Sakurai Jiuzayemon urged them to be upon their guard and leaped from his horse and Matayemon springing forward with his drawn sword cleft him from the shoulder to the nipple of his breast so that he fell dead Sakurai Jinsuke seeing his brother killed before his eyes grew furious and shot an arrow at Matayemon who deftly cut the shaft in two with his dirk as it flew and Jinsuke amazed at this feat threw away his bow and attacked Matayemon who with his sword in his right hand and his dirk in his left fought with desperation The other Ronins attempted to rescue Jinsuke and in the struggle Kazuma who had engaged Matagoro became separated from Matayemon whose two retainers Busuke and Magohachi bearing in mind their master s orders killed five Ronins who had attacked Kazuma but were themselves badly wounded In the meantime Matayemon who had killed seven of the Ronins and who the harder he was pressed the more bravely he fought soon cut down three more and the remainder dared not approach him At this moment there came up one Kano Tozayemon a retainer of the lord of the castle town and an old friend of Matayemon who when he heard that Matayemon was this day about to avenge his father in law had seized his spear and set out for the sake of the good will between them to help him and act as his second and said Sir Matayemon hearing of the perilous adventure in which you have engaged I have come out to offer myself as your second Matayemon hearing this was rejoiced and fought with renewed vigour Then one of the Ronins named Takenouchi Gentan a very brave man leaving his companions to do battle with Matayemon came to the rescue of Matagoro who was being hotly pressed by Kazuma and in attempting to prevent this Busuke fell covered with wounds His companion Magohachi seeing him fall was in great anxiety for should any harm happen to Kazuma what excuse could he make to Matayemon So wounded as he was he too engaged Takenouchi Gentan and being crippled by the gashes he had received was in deadly peril Then the man who had come up from the castle town to act as Matayemon s second cried out See there Sir Matayemon your follower who is fighting with Gentan is in great danger Do you go to his rescue and second Sir Kazuma I will give an account of the others Great thanks to you sir I will go and second Kazuma So Matayemon went to help Kazuma whilst his second and the infantry soldiers kept back the surviving Ronins who already wearied by their fight with Matayemon were unfit for any further exertion Kazuma meanwhile was still fighting with Matagoro and the issue of the conflict was doubtful and Takenouchi Gentan in his attempt to rescue Matagoro was being kept at bay by Magohachi who weakened by his wounds and blinded by the blood which was streaming into his eyes from a cut in the forehead had given himself up for lost when Matayemon came and cried Be of good cheer Magohachi it is I Matayemon who have come to the rescue You are badly hurt get out of harm s way and rest yourself Then Magohachi who until then had been kept up by his anxiety for Kazuma s safety gave in and fell fainting from loss of blood and Matayemon worsted and slew Gentan and even then although be had received two wounds he was not exhausted but drew near to Kazuma and said Courage Kazuma The Ronins are all killed and there now remains only Matagoro your father s murderer Fight and win The youth thus encouraged redoubled his efforts but Matagoro losing heart quailed and fell So Kazuma s vengeance was fulfilled and the desire of his heart was accomplished The two faithful retainers who had died in their loyalty were buried with great ceremony and Kazuma carried the head of Matagoro and piously laid it upon his father s tomb So ends the tale of Kazuma s revenge I fear that stories of which killing and bloodshed form the principal features can hardly enlist much sympathy in these peaceful days Still when such tales are based upon history they are interesting to students of social phenomena The story of Kazuma s revenge is mixed up with events which at the present time are peculiarly significant I mean the feud between the great Daimios and the Hatamotos Those who have followed the modern history of Japan will see that the recent struggle which has ended in the ruin of the Tycoon s power and the abolition of his office was the outburst of a hidden fire which had been smouldering for centuries But the repressive might had been gradually weakened and contact with Western powers had rendered still more odious a feudality which men felt to be out of date The revolution which has ended in the triumph of the Daimios over the Tycoon is also the triumph of the vassal over his feudal lord and is the harbinger of political life to the people at large In the time of Iyeyasu the burden might be hateful but it had to be borne and so it would have been to this day had not circumstances from without broken the spell The Japanese Daimio in advocating the isolation of his country was hugging the very yoke which he hated Strange to say however there are still men who while they embrace the new political creed yet praise the past and look back with regret upon the day when Japan stood alone without part or share in the great family of nations NOTE Hatamoto This word means under the flag The Hatamotos were men who as their name implied rallied round the standard of the Shogun or Tycoon in war time They were eighty thousand in number When Iyeyasu left the Province of Mikawa and became Shogun the retainers whom he ennobled and who received from him grants of land yielding revenue to the amount of ten thousand kokus of rice a year and from that down to one hundred kokus were called Hatamoto In return for these grants of land the Hatamotos had in war time to furnish a contingent of soldiers in proportion to their revenue For every thousand kokus of rice five men were required Those Hatamotos whose revenue fell short of a thousand kokus substituted a quota of money In time of peace most of the minor offices of the Tycoon s government were filled by Hatamotos the more important places being held by the Fudai or vassal Daimios of the Shogun Seven years ago in imitation of the customs of foreign nations a standing army was founded and then the Hatamotos had to contribute their quota of men or of money whether the country were at peace or at war When the Shogun was reduced in eighteen sixty eight to the rank of a simple Daimio his revenue of eight million kokus reverted to the Government with the exception of seven hundred thousand kokus The title of Hatamoto exists no more and those who until a few months ago held the rank are for the most part ruined or dispersed From having been perhaps the proudest and most overbearing class in Japan they are driven to the utmost straits of poverty Some have gone into trade with the heirlooms of their families as their stock others are wandering through the country as Ronins while a small minority have been allowed to follow the fallen fortunes of their master s family the present chief of which is known as the Prince of Tokugawa Thus are the eighty thousand dispersed The koku of rice in which all revenue is calculated is of varying value At the cheapest it is worth rather more than a pound sterling and sometimes almost three times as much The salaries of officials being paid in rice it follows that there is a large and influential class throughout the country who are interested in keeping up the price of the staple article of food Hence the opposition with which a free trade in rice has met even in famine times Hence also the frequent so called Rice Riots The amounts at which the lands formerly held by the chief Daimios but now patriotically given up by them to the Mikado were assessed sound fabulous The Prince of Kaga alone had an income of more than one million two hundred thousand kokus Yet these great proprietors were latterly at least embarrassed men They had many thousand mouths to feed and were mulcted of their dues right and left while their mania for buying foreign ships and munitions of war often at exorbitant prices had plunged them heavily in debt A STORY OF THE OTOKODATE OF YEDO BEING THE SUPPLEMENT OF THE STORY OF GOMPACHI AND KOMURASAKI The word Otokodate occurs several times in these Tales and as I cannot convey its full meaning by a simple translation I must preserve it in the text explaining it by the following note taken from the Japanese of a native scholar The Otokodate were friendly associations of brave men bound together by an obligation to stand by one another in weal or in woe regardless of their own lives and without inquiring into one another s antecedents A bad man however having joined the Otokodate must forsake his evil ways for their principle was to treat the oppressor as an enemy and to help the feeble as a father does his child If they had money they gave it to those that had none and their charitable deeds won for them the respect of all men The head of the society was called its Father if any of the others who were his apprentices were homeless they lived with the Father and served him paying him at the same time a small fee in consideration of which if they fell sick or into misfortune he took charge of them and assisted them The Father of the Otokodate pursued the calling of farming out coolies to the Daimios and great personages for their journeys to and from Yedo and in return for this received from them rations in rice He had more influence with the lower classes even than the officials and if the coolies had struck work or refused to accompany a Daimio on his journey a word from the Father would produce as many men as might be required When Prince Tokugawa Iyemochi the last but one of the Shoguns left Yedo for Kioto one Shimmon Tatsugoro chief of the Otokodate undertook the management of his journey and some three or four years ago was raised to the dignity of Hatamoto for many faithful services After the battle of Fushimi and the abolition of the Shogunate he accompanied the last of the Shoguns in his retirement In old days there were also Otokodate among the Hatamotos this was after the civil wars of the time of Iyeyasu when though the country was at peace the minds of men were still in a state of high excitement and could not be reconciled to the dulness of a state of rest it followed that broils and faction fights were continually taking place among the young men of the Samurai class and that those who distinguished themselves by their personal strength and valour were looked up to as captains Leagues after the manner of those existing among the German students were formed in different quarters of the city under various names and used to fight for the honour of victory When the country became more thoroughly tranquil the custom of forming these leagues amongst gentlemen fell into disuse The past tense is used in speaking even of the Otokodate of the lower classes for although they nominally exist they have no longer the power and importance which they enjoyed at the time to which these stories belong They then like the prentices of Old London played a considerable part in the society of the great cities and that man was lucky were he gentle Samurai or simple wardsman who could claim the Father of the Otokodate for his friend The word taken by itself means a manly or plucky fellow Chobei of Bandzuin was the chief of the Otokodate of Yedo He was originally called Itaro and was the son of a certain Ronin who lived in the country One day when he was only ten years of age he went out with a playfellow to bathe in the river and as the two were playing they quarrelled over their game and Itaro seizing the other boy threw him into the river and drowned him Then he went home and said to his father I went to play by the river to day with a friend and as he was rude to me I threw him into the water and killed him When his father heard him speak thus quite calmly as if nothing had happened he was thunderstruck and said This is indeed a fearful thing Child as you are you will have to pay the penalty of your deed so to night you must fly to Yedo in secret and take service with some noble Samurai and perhaps in time you may become a soldier yourself With these words he gave him twenty ounces of silver and a fine sword made by the famous swordsmith Rai Kunitoshi and sent him out of the province with all dispatch The following morning the parents of the murdered child came to claim that Itaro should be given up to their vengeance but it was too late and all they could do was to bury their child and mourn for his loss Itaro made his way to Yedo in hot haste and there found employment as a shop boy but soon tiring of that sort of life and burning to become a soldier he found means at last to enter the service of a certain Hatamoto called Sakurai Shozayemon and changed his name to Tsunehei Now this Sakurai Shozayemon had a son called Shonosuke a young man in his seventeenth year who grew so fond of Tsunehei that he took him with him wherever he went and treated him in all ways as an equal When Shonosuke went to the fencing school Tsunehei would accompany him and thus as he was by nature strong and active soon became a good swordsman One day when Shozayemon had gone out his son Shonosuke said to Tsunehei You know how fond my father is of playing at football it must be great sport As he has gone out to day suppose you and I have a game That will be rare sport answered Tsunehei Let us make haste and play before my lord comes home So the two boys went out into the garden and began trying to kick the football but lacking skill do what they would they could not lift it from the ground At last Shonosuke with a vigorous kick raised the football but having missed his aim it went tumbling over the wall into the next garden which belonged to one Hikosaka Zempachi a teacher of lance exercise who was known to be a surly ill tempered fellow Oh dear what shall we do said Shonosuke We have lost my father s football in his absence and if we go and ask for it back from that churlish neighbour of ours we shall only be scolded and sworn at for our pains Oh never mind answered Tsunehei I will go and apologize for our carelessness and get the football back Well but then you will be chidden and I don t want that Never mind me Little care I for his cross words So Tsunehei went to the next door house to reclaim the ball Now it so happened that Zempachi the surly neighbour had been walking in his garden whilst the two youths were playing and as he was admiring the beauty of his favourite chrysanthemums the football came flying over the wall and struck him full in the face Zempachi not used to anything but flattery and coaxing flew into a violent rage at this and while he was thinking how he would revenge himself upon any one who might be sent to ask for the lost ball Tsunehei came in and said to one of Zempachi s servants I am sorry to say that in my lord s absence I took his football and in trying to play with it clumsily kicked it over your wall I beg you to excuse my carelessness and to be so good as to give me back the ball The servant went in and repeated this to Zempachi who worked himself up into a great rage and ordered Tsunehei to be brought before him and said Here fellow is your name Tsunehei Yes sir at your service I am almost afraid to ask pardon for my carelessness but please forgive me and let me have the ball I thought your master Shozayemon was to blame for this but it seems that it was you who kicked the football Yes sir I am sure I am very sorry for what I have done Please may I ask for the ball said Tsunehei bowing humbly For a while Zempachi made no answer but at length he said Do you know villain that your dirty football struck me in the face I ought by rights to kill you on the spot for this but I will spare your life this time so take your football and be off And with that he went up to Tsunehei and beat him and kicked him in the head and spat in his face Then Tsunehei who up to that time had demeaned himself very humbly in his eagerness to get back the football jumped up in a fury and said I made ample apologies to you for my carelessness and now you have insulted and struck me Ill mannered ruffian take back the ball I ll none of it and he drew his dirk and cutting the football in two threw it at Zempachi and returned home But Zempachi growing more and more angry called one of his servants and said to him That fellow Tsunehei has been most insolent go next door and find out Shozayemon and tell him that I have ordered you to bring back Tsunehei that I may kill him So the servant went to deliver the message In the meantime Tsunehei went back to his master s house and when Shonosuke saw him he said Well of course you have been ill treated but did you get back the football When I went in I made many apologies but I was beaten and kicked in the head and treated with the greatest indignity I would have killed that wretch Zempachi at once but that I knew that if I did so while I was yet a member of your household I should bring trouble upon your family For your sake I bore this ill treatment patiently but now I pray you let me take leave of you and become a Ronin that I may be revenged upon this man Think well what you are doing answered Shonosuke After all we have only lost a football and my father will not care nor upbraid us But Tsimehei would not listen to him and was bent upon wiping out the affront that he had received As they were talking the messenger arrived from Zempachi demanding the surrender of Tsunehei on the ground that he had insulted him to this Shonosuke replied that his father was away from home and that in his absence he could do nothing At last Shozayemon came home and when he heard what had happened he was much grieved and at a loss what to do when a second messenger arrived from Zempachi demanding that Tsunehei should be given up without delay Then Shozayemon seeing that the matter was serious called the youth to him and said This Zempachi is heartless and cruel and if you go to his house will assuredly kill you take therefore these fifty riyos and fly to Osaka or Kioto where you may safely set up in business Sir answered Tsunehei with tears of gratitude for his lord s kindness from my heart I thank you for your great goodness but I have been insulted and trampled upon and if I lay down my life in the attempt I will repay Zempachi for what he has this day done Well then since you needs must be revenged go and fight and may success attend you Still as much depends upon the blade you carry and I fear yours is likely to be but a sorry weapon I will give you a sword and with this he offered Tsunehei his own Nay my lord replied Tsunehei I have a famous sword by Rai Kunitoshi which my father gave me I have never shown it to your lordship but I have it safely stowed away in my room When Shozayemon saw and examined the sword he admired it greatly and said This is indeed a beautiful blade and one on which you may rely Take it then and bear yourself nobly in the fight only remember that Zempachi is a cunning spearsman and be sure to be very cautious So Tsunehei after thanking his lord for his manifold kindnesses took an affectionate leave and went to Zempachi s house and said to the servant It seems that your master wants to speak to me Be so good as to take me to see him So the servant led him into the garden where Zempachi spear in hand was waiting to kill him When Zempachi saw him he cried out Ha so you have come back and now for your insolence this day I mean to kill you with my own hand Insolent yourself replied Tsunehei Beast and no Samurai Come let us see which of us is the better man Furiously incensed Zempachi thrust with his spear at Tsunehei but he trusting to his good sword attacked Zempachi who cunning warrior as he was could gain no advantage At last Zempachi losing his temper began fighting less carefully so that Tsunehei found an opportunity of cutting the shaft of his spear Zempachi then drew his sword and two of his retainers came up to assist him but Tsunehei killed one of them and wounded Zempachi in the forehead The second retainer fled affrighted at the youth s valour and Zempachi was blinded by the blood which flowed from the wound on his forehead Then Tsunehei said To kill one who is as a blind man were unworthy a soldier Wipe the blood from your eyes Sir Zempachi and let us fight it out fairly So Zempachi wiping away his blood bound a kerchief round his head and fought again desperately But at last the pain of his wound and the loss of blood overcame him and Tsunehei cut him down with a wound in the shoulder and easily dispatched him Then Tsunehei went and reported the whole matter to the Governor of Yedo and was put in prison until an inquiry could be made But the Chief Priest of Bandzuin who had heard of the affair went and told the governor all the bad deeds of Zempachi and having procured Tsunehei s pardon took him home and employed him as porter in the temple So Tsunehei changed his name to Chobei and earned much respect in the neighbourhood both for his talents and for his many good works If any man were in distress he would help him heedless of his own advantage or danger until men came to look up to him as to a father and many youths joined him and became his apprentices So he built a house at Hanakawado in Asakusa and lived there with his apprentices whom he farmed out as spearsmen and footmen to the Daimios and Hatamotos taking for himself the tithe of their earnings But if any of them were sick or in trouble Chobei would nurse and support them and provide physicians and medicine And the fame of his goodness went abroad until his apprentices were more than two thousand men and were employed in every part of the city But as for Chobei the more he prospered the more he gave in charity and all men praised his good and generous heart This was the time when the Hatamotos had formed themselves into bands of Otokodate twenty one of which Midzuno Jiurozayemon Kondo Noborinosuke and Abe Shirogoro were the chiefs And the leagues of the nobles despised the leagues of the wardsmen and treated them with scorn and tried to put to shame Chobei and his brave men but the nobles weapons recoiled upon themselves and whenever they tried to bring contempt upon Chobei they themselves were brought to ridicule So there was great hatred on both sides Footnote twenty one See the story of Kazuma s Revenge One day that Chobei went to divert himself in a tea house in the Yoshiwara he saw a felt carpet spread in an upper room which had been adorned as for some special occasion and he asked the master of the house what guest of distinction was expected The landlord replied that my Lord Jiurozayemon the chief of the Otokodate of the Hatamotos was due there that afternoon On hearing this Chobei replied that as he much wished to meet my Lord Jiurozayemon he would lie down and await his coming The landlord was put out at this and knew not what to say but yet he dare not thwart Chobei the powerful chief of the Otokodate So Chobei took off his clothes and laid himself down upon the carpet After a while my Lord Jiurozayemon arrived and going upstairs found a man of large stature lying naked upon the carpet which had been spread for him What low ruffian is this shouted he angrily to the landlord My lord it is Chobei the chief of the Otokodate answered the man trembling Jiurozayemon at once suspected that Chobei was doing this to insult him so he sat down by the side of the sleeping man and lighting his pipe began to smoke When he had finished his pipe he emptied the burning ashes into Chobei s navel but Chobei patiently bearing the pain still feigned sleep Ten times did Jiurozayemon fill his pipe twenty two and ten times he shook out the burning ashes on to Chobei s navel but he neither stirred nor spoke Then Jiurozayemon astonished at his fortitude shook him and roused him saying Chobei Chobei wake up man What is the matter said Chobei rubbing his eyes as though he were awaking from a deep sleep then seeing Jiurozayemon he pretended to be startled and said Oh my lord I know not who you are but I have been very rude to your lordship I was overcome with wine and fell asleep I pray your lordship to forgive me Is your name Chobei Yes my lord at your service A poor wardsman and ignorant of good manners I have been very rude but I pray your lordship to excuse my ill breeding Nay nay we have all heard the fame of Chobei of Bandzuin and I hold myself lucky to have met you this day Let us be friends It is a great honour for a humble wardsman to meet a nobleman face to face Footnote twenty two The tiny Japanese pipe contains but two or three whiffs and as the tobacco is rolled up tightly in the fingers before it is inserted the ash when shaken out is a little fire ball from which a second pipe is lighted As they were speaking the waitresses brought in fish and wine and Jiurozayemon pressed Chobei to feast with him and thinking to annoy Chobei offered him a large wine cup twenty three which however he drank without shrinking and then returned to his entertainer who was by no means so well able to bear the fumes of the wine Then Jiurozayemon hit upon another device for annoying Chobei and hoping to frighten him said Here Chobei let me offer you some fish and with those words he drew his sword and picking up a cake of baked fish upon the point of it thrust it towards the wardsman s mouth Any ordinary man would have been afraid to accept the morsel so roughly offered but Chobei simply opened his mouth and taking the cake off the sword s point ate it without wincing Whilst Jiurozayemon was wondering in his heart what manner of man this was that nothing could daunt Chobei said to him This meeting with your lordship has been an auspicious occasion to me and I would fain ask leave to offer some humble gift to your lordship in memory of it twenty four Is there anything which your lordship would specially fancy I am very fond of cold macaroni Footnote twenty three It is an act of rudeness to offer a large wine cup As however the same cup is returned to the person who has offered it the ill carries with it its own remedy At a Japanese feast the same cup is passed from hand to hand each person rinsing it in a bowl of water after using it and before offering it to another Footnote twenty four The giving of presents from inferiors to superiors is a common custom Then I shall have the honour of ordering some for your lordship and with this Chobei went downstairs and calling one of his apprentices named Token Gombei twenty five who was waiting for him gave him a hundred riyos about Ltwenty eight and bade him collect all the cold macaroni to be found in the neighbouring cook shops and pile it up in front of the tea house So Gombei went home and collecting Chobei s apprentices sent them out in all directions to buy the macaroni Jiurozayemon all this while was thinking of the pleasure he would have in laughing at Chobei for offering him a mean and paltry present but when by degrees the macaroni began to be piled mountain high around the tea house he saw that he could not make a fool of Chobei and went home discomfited Footnote twenty five Token a nickname given to Gombei after a savage dog that he killed As a Chonin or wardsman he had no surname It has already been told how Shirai Gompachi was befriended and helped by Chobei twenty six His name will occur again in this story Footnote twenty six See the story of Gompachi and Komurasaki At this time there lived in the province of Yamato a certain Daimio called Honda Dainaiki who one day when surrounded by several of his retainers produced a sword and bade them look at it and say from what smith s workshop the blade had come I think this must be a Masamune blade said one Fuwa Banzayemon No said Nagoya Sanza after examining the weapon attentively this certainly is a Muramasa twenty seven Footnote twenty seven The swords of Muramasa although so finely tempered that they are said to cut hard iron as though it were a melon have the reputation of being unlucky they are supposed by the superstitious to hunger after taking men s lives and to be unable to repose in their scabbards The principal duty of a sword is to preserve tranquillity in the world by punishing the wicked and protecting the good But the bloodthirsty swords of Muramasa rather have the effect of maddening their owners so that they either kill others indiscriminately or commit suicide At the end of the sixteenth century Prince Tokugawa Iyeyasu was in the habit of carrying a spear made by Muramasa with which he often scratched or cut himself by mistake Hence the Tokugawa family avoid girding on Muramasa blades which are supposed to be specially unlucky to their race The murders of Gompachi who wore a sword by this maker also contributed to give his weapons a bad name The swords of one Toshiro Yoshimitsu on the other hand are specially auspicious to the Tokugawa family for the following reason After Iyeyasu had been defeated by Taketa Katsuyori at the battle of the river Tenrin he took refuge in the house of a village doctor intending to put an end to his existence by hara kiri and drawing his dirk which was made by Yoshimitsu tried to plunge it into his belly when to his surprise the blade turned Thinking that the dirk must be a bad one he took up an iron mortar for grinding medicines and tried it upon that and the point entered and transfixed the mortar He was about to stab himself a second time when his followers who had missed him and had been searching for him everywhere came up and seeing their master about to kill himself stayed his hand and took away the dirk by force Then they set him upon his horse and compelled him to fly to his own province of Mikawa whilst they kept his pursuers at bay After this when by the favour of Heaven Iyeyasu became Shogun it was considered that of a surety there must have been a good spirit in the blade that refused to drink his blood and ever since that time the blades of Yoshimitsu have been considered lucky in his family A third Samurai named Takagi Umanojo pronounced it to be the work of Shidzu Kanenji and as they could not agree but each maintained his opinion their lord sent for a famous connoisseur to decide the point and the sword proved as Sanza had said to be a genuine Muramasa Sanza was delighted at the verdict but the other two went home rather crestfallen Umanojo although he had been worsted in the argument bore no malice nor ill will in his heart but Banzayemon who was a vainglorious personage puffed up with the idea of his own importance conceived a spite against Sanza and watched for an opportunity to put him to shame At last one day Banzayemon eager to be revenged upon Sanza went to the Prince and said Your lordship ought to see Sanza fence his swordsmanship is beyond all praise I know that I am no match for him still if it will please your lordship I will try a bout with him and the Prince who was a mere stripling and thought it would be rare sport immediately sent for Sanza and desired he would fence with Banzayemon So the two went out into the garden and stood up facing each other armed with wooden swords Now Banzayemon was proud of his skill and thought he had no equal in fencing so he expected to gain an easy victory over Sanza and promised himself the luxury of giving his adversary a beating that should fully make up for the mortification which he had felt in the matter of the dispute about the sword It happened however that he had undervalued the skill of Sanza who when he saw that his adversary was attacking him savagely and in good earnest by a rapid blow struck Banzayemon so sharply on the wrist that he dropped the sword and before he could pick it up again delivered a second cut on the shoulder which sent him rolling over in the dust All the officers present seeing this praised Sanza s skill and Banzayemon utterly stricken with shame ran away home and hid himself After this affair Sanza rose high in the favour of his lord and Banzayemon who was more than ever jealous of him feigned sickness and stayed at home devising schemes for Sanza s ruin Now it happened that the Prince wishing to have the Muramasa blade mounted sent for Sanza and entrusted it to his care ordering him to employ the most cunning workmen in the manufacture of the scabbard hilt and ornaments and Sanza having received the blade took it home and put it carefully away When Banzayemon heard of this he was overjoyed for he saw that his opportunity for revenge had come He determined if possible to kill Sanza but at any rate to steal the sword which had been committed to his care by the Prince knowing full well that if Sanza lost the sword he and his family would be ruined Being a single man without wife or child he sold his furniture and turning all his available property into money made ready to fly the country When his preparations were concluded he went in the middle of the night to Sanza s house and tried to get in by stealth but the doors and shutters were all carefully bolted from the inside and there was no hole by which he could effect an entrance All was still however and the people of the house were evidently fast asleep so he climbed up to the second storey and having contrived to unfasten a window made his way in With soft cat like footsteps he crept downstairs and looking into one of the rooms saw Sanza and his wife sleeping on the mats with their little son Kosanza a boy of thirteen curled up in his quilt between them The light in the night lamp was at its last flicker but peering through the gloom he could just see the Prince s famous Muramasa sword lying on a sword rack in the raised part of the room so he crawled stealthily along until he could reach it and stuck it in his girdle Then drawing near to Sanza he bestrode his sleeping body and brandishing the sword made a thrust at his throat but in his excitement his hand shook so that he missed his aim and only scratched Sanza who waking with a start and trying to jump up felt himself held down by a man standing over him Stretching out his hands he would have wrestled with his enemy when Banzayemon leaping back kicked over the night lamp and throwing open the shutters dashed into the garden Snatching up his sword Sanza rushed out after him and his wife having lit a lantern and armed herself with a halberd twenty eight went out with her son Kosanza who carried a drawn dirk to help her husband Then Banzayemon who was hiding in the shadow of a large pine tree seeing the lantern and dreading detection seized a stone and hurled it at the light and chancing to strike it put it out and then scrambling over the fence unseen fled into the darkness When Sanza had searched all over the garden in vain he returned to his room and examined his wound which proving very slight he began to look about to see whether the thief had carried off anything but when his eye fell upon the place where the Muramasa sword had lain he saw that it was gone He hunted everywhere but it was not to be found The precious blade with which his Prince had entrusted him had been stolen and the blame would fall heavily upon him Filled with grief and shame at the loss Sanza and his wife and child remained in great anxiety until the morning broke when he reported the matter to one of the Prince s councillors and waited in seclusion until he should receive his lord s commands Footnote twenty eight The halberd is the special arm of the Japanese woman of gentle blood That which was used by Kasa Gozen one of the ladies of Yoshitsune the hero of the twelfth century is still preserved at Asakusa In old fashioned families young ladies are regularly instructed in fencing with the halberds It soon became known that Banzayemon who had fled the province was the thief and the councillors made their report accordingly to the Prince who although he expressed his detestation of the mean action of Banzayemon could not absolve Sanza from blame in that he had not taken better precautions to insure the safety of the sword that had been committed to his trust It was decided therefore that Sanza should be dismissed from his service and that his goods should be confiscated with the proviso that should he be able to find Banzayemon and recover the lost Muramasa blade he should be restored to his former position Sanza who from the first had made up his mind that his punishment would be severe accepted the decree without a murmur and having committed his wife and son to the care of his relations prepared to leave the country as a Ronin and search for Banzayemon Before starting however he thought that he would go to his brother officer Takagi Umanojo and consult with him as to what course he should pursue to gain his end But this Umanojo who was by nature a churlish fellow answered him unkindly and said It is true that Banzayemon is a mean thief but still it was through your carelessness that the sword was lost It is of no avail your coming to me for help you must get it back as best you may Ah replied Sanza I see that you too bear me a grudge because I defeated you in the matter of the judgment of the sword You are no better than Banzayemon yourself And his heart was bitter against his fellow men and he left the house determined to kill Umanojo first and afterwards to track out Banzayemon so pretending to start on his journey he hid in an inn and waited for an opportunity to attack Umanojo One day Umanojo who was very fond of fishing had taken his son Umanosuke a lad of sixteen down to the sea shore with him and as the two were enjoying themselves all of a sudden they perceived a Samurai running towards them and when he drew near they saw that it was Sanza Umanojo thinking that Sanza had come back in order to talk over some important matter left his angling and went to meet him Then Sanza cried out Now Sir Umanojo draw and defend yourself What were you in league with Banzayemon to vent your spite upon me Draw sir draw You have spirited away your accomplice but at any rate you are here yourself and shall answer for your deed It is no use playing the innocent your astonished face shall not save you Defend yourself coward and traitor and with these words Sanza flourished his naked sword Nay Sir Sanza replied the other anxious by a soft answer to turn away his wrath I am innocent of this deed Waste not your valour on so poor a cause Lying knave said Sanza think not that you can impose upon me I know your treacherous heart and rushing upon Umanojo he cut him on the forehead so that he fell in agony upon the sand Umanosuke in the meanwhile who had been fishing at some distance from his father rushed up when he saw him in this perilous situation and threw a stone at Sanza hoping to distract his attention but before he could reach the spot Sanza had delivered the death blow and Umanojo lay a corpse upon the beach Stop Sir Sanza murderer of my father cried Umanosuke drawing his sword stop and do battle with me that I may avenge his death That you should wish to slay your father s enemy replied Sanza is but right and proper and although I had just cause of quarrel with your father and killed him as a Samurai should yet would I gladly forfeit my life to you here but my life is precious to me for one purpose that I may punish Banzayemon and get back the stolen sword When I shall have restored that sword to my lord then will I give you your revenge and you may kill me A soldier s word is truth but as a pledge that I will fulfil my promise I will give to you as hostages my wife and boy Stay your avenging hand I pray you until my desire shall have been attained Umanosuke who was a brave and honest youth as famous in the clan for the goodness of his heart as for his skill in the use of arms when he heard Sanza s humble petition relented and said I agree to wait and will take your wife and boy as hostages for your return I humbly thank you said Sanza When I shall have chastised Banzayemon I will return and you shall claim your revenge So Sanza went his way to Yedo to seek for Banzayemon and Umanosuke mourned over his father s grave Now Banzayemon when he arrived in Yedo found himself friendless and without the means of earning his living when by accident he heard of the fame of Chobei of Bandzuin the chief of the Otokodate to whom he applied for assistance and having entered the fraternity supported himself by giving fencing lessons He had been plying his trade for some time and had earned some little reputation when Sanza reached the city and began his search for him But the days and months passed away and after a year s fruitless seeking Sanza who had spent all his money without obtaining a clue to the whereabouts of his enemy was sorely perplexed and was driven to live by his wits as a fortune teller Work as he would it was a hard matter for him to gain the price of his daily food and in spite of all his pains his revenge seemed as far off as ever when he bethought him that the Yoshiwara was one of the most bustling places in the city and that if he kept watch there sooner or later he would be sure to fall in with Banzayemon So be bought a hat of plaited bamboo that completely covered his face and lay in wait at the Yoshiwara One day Banzayemon and two of Chobei s apprentices Token Gombei and Shirobei who from his wild and indocile nature was surnamed the Colt were amusing themselves and drinking in an upper storey of a tea house in the Yoshiwara when Token Gombei happening to look down upon the street below saw a Samurai pass by poorly clad in worn out old clothes but whose poverty stricken appearance contrasted with his proud and haughty bearing Look there said Gombei calling the attention of the others look at that Samurai Dirty and ragged as his coat is how easy it is to see that he is of noble birth Let us wardsmen dress ourselves up in never so fine clothes we could not look as he does Ay said Shirobei I wish we could make friends with him and ask him up here to drink a cup of wine with us However it would not be seemly for us wardsmen to go and invite a person of his condition We can easily get over that difficulty said Banzayemon As I am a Samurai myself there will be no impropriety in my going and saying a few civil words to him and bringing him in The other two having joyfully accepted the offer Banzayemon ran downstairs and went up to the strange Samurai and saluted him saying I pray you to wait a moment Sir Samurai My name is Fuwa Banzayemon at your service I am a Ronin as I judge from your appearance that you are yourself I hope you will not think me rude if I venture to ask you to honour me with your friendship and to come into this tea house to drink a cup of wine with me and two of my friends The strange Samurai who was no other than Sanza looking at the speaker through the interstices of his deep bamboo hat and recognizing his enemy Banzayemon gave a start of surprise and uncovering his head said sternly Have you forgotten my face Banzayemon For a moment Banzayemon was taken aback but quickly recovering himself he replied Ah Sir Sanza you may well be angry with me but since I stole the Muramasa sword and fled to Yedo I have known no peace I have been haunted by remorse for my crime I shall not resist your vengeance do with me as it shall seem best to you or rather take my life and let there be an end of this quarrel Nay answered Sanza to kill a man who repents him of his sins is a base and ignoble action When you stole from me the Muramasa blade which had been confided to my care by my lord I became a disgraced and ruined man Give me back that sword that I may lay it before my lord and I will spare your life I seek to slay no man needlessly Sir Sanza I thank you for your mercy At this moment I have not the sword by me but if you will go into yonder tea house and wait awhile I will fetch it and deliver it into your hands Sanza having consented to this the two men entered the tea house where Banzayemon s two companions were waiting for them But Banzayemon ashamed of his own evil deed still pretended that Sanza was a stranger and introduced him as such saying Come Sir Samurai since we have the honour of your company let me offer you a wine cup Banzayemon and the two men pressed the wine cup upon Sanza so often that the fumes gradually got into his head and he fell asleep the two wardsmen seeing this went out for a walk and Banzayemon left alone with the sleeping man began to revolve fresh plots against him in his mind On a sudden a thought struck him Noiselessly seizing Sanza s sword which he had laid aside on entering the room he stole softly downstairs with it and carrying it into the back yard pounded and blunted its edge with a stone and having made it useless as a weapon he replaced it in its scabbard and running upstairs again laid it in its place without disturbing Sanza who little suspecting treachery lay sleeping off the effects of the wine At last however he awoke and ashamed at having been overcome by drink he said to Banzayemon Come Banzayemon we have dallied too long give me the Muramasa sword and let me go Of course replied the other sneeringly I am longing to give it back to you but unfortunately in my poverty I have been obliged to pawn it for fifty ounces of silver If you have so much money about you give it to me and I will return the sword to you Wretch cried Sanza seeing that Banzayemon was trying to fool him have I not had enough of your vile tricks At any rate if I cannot get back the sword your head shall be laid before my lord in its place Come added he stamping his foot impatiently defend yourself With all my heart But not here in this tea house Let us go to the Mound and fight it out Agreed There is no need for us to bring trouble on the landlord Come to the Mound of the Yoshiwara So they went to the Mound and drawing their swords began to fight furiously As the news soon spread abroad through the Yoshiwara that a duel was being fought upon the Mound the people flocked out to see the sight and among them came Token Gombei and Shirobei Banzayemon s companions who when they saw that the combatants were their own friend and the strange Samurai tried to interfere and stop the fight but being hindered by the thickness of the crowd remained as spectators The two men fought desperately each driven by fierce rage against the other but Sanza who was by far the better fencer of the two once twice and again dealt blows which should have cut Banzayemon down and yet no blood came forth Sanza astonished at this put forth all his strength and fought so skilfully that all the bystanders applauded him and Banzayemon though he knew his adversary s sword to be blunted was so terrified that he stumbled and fell Sanza brave soldier that he was scorned to strike a fallen foe and bade him rise and fight again So they engaged again and Sanza who from the beginning had had the advantage slipped and fell in his turn Banzayemon forgetting the mercy which had been shown to him rushed up with bloodthirsty joy glaring in his eyes and stabbed Sanza in the side as he lay on the ground Faint as he was he could not lift his hand to save himself and his craven foe was about to strike him again when the bystanders all cried shame upon his baseness Then Gombei and Shirobei lifted up their voices and said Hold coward Have you forgotten how your own life was spared but a moment since Beast of a Samurai we have been your friends hitherto but now behold in us the avengers of this brave man With these words the two men drew their dirks and the spectators fell back as they rushed in upon Banzayemon who terror stricken by their fierce looks and words fled without having dealt the death blow to Sanza They tried to pursue him but he made good his escape so the two men returned to help the wounded man When he came to himself by dint of their kind treatment they spoke to him and comforted him and asked him what province he came from that they might write to his friends and tell them what had befallen him Sanza in a voice faint from pain and loss of blood told them his name and the story of the stolen sword and of his enmity against Banzayemon But said he just now when I was fighting I struck Banzayemon more than once and without effect How could that have been Then they looked at his sword which had fallen by his side and saw that the edge was all broken away More than ever they felt indignant at the baseness of Banzayemon s heart and redoubled their kindness to Sanza but in spite of all their efforts he grew weaker and weaker until at last his breathing ceased altogether So they buried the corpse honourably in an adjoining temple and wrote to Sanza s wife and son describing to them the manner of his death Now when Sanza s wife who had long been anxiously expecting her husband s return opened the letter and learned the cruel circumstances of his death she and her son Kosanza mourned bitterly over his loss Then Kosanza who was now fourteen years old said to his mother Take comfort mother for I will go to Yedo and seek out this Banzayemon my father s murderer and I will surely avenge his death Now therefore make ready all that I need for this journey And as they were consulting over the manner of their revenge Umanosuke the son of Umanojo whom Sanza had slain having heard of the death of his father s enemy came to the house But he came with no hostile intent True Sanza had killed his father but the widow and the orphan were guiltless and he bore them no ill will on the contrary he felt that Banzayemon was their common enemy It was he who by his evil deeds had been the cause of all the mischief that had arisen and now again by murdering Sanza he had robbed Umanosuke of his revenge In this spirit he said to Kosanza Sir Kosanza I hear that your father has been cruelly murdered by Banzayemon at Yedo I know that you will avenge the death of your father as the son of a soldier should if therefore you will accept my poor services I will be your second and will help you to the best of my ability Banzayemon shall be my enemy as he is yours Nay Sir Umanosuke although I thank you from my heart I cannot accept this favour at your hands My father Sanza slew your noble father that you should requite this misfortune thus is more than kind but I cannot think of suffering you to risk your life on my behalf Listen to me replied Umanosuke smiling and you will think it less strange that I should offer to help you Last year when my father lay a bleeding corpse on the sea shore your father made a covenant with me that he would return to give me my revenge so soon as he should have regained the stolen sword Banzayemon by murdering him on the Mound of the Yoshiwara has thwarted me in this and now upon whom can I avenge my father s death but upon him whose baseness was indeed its cause Now therefore I am determined to go with you to Yedo and not before the murders of our two fathers shall have been fully atoned for will we return to our own country When Kosanza heard this generous speech he could not conceal his admiration and the widow prostrating herself at Umanosuke s feet shed tears of gratitude The two youths having agreed to stand by one another made all ready for their journey and obtained leave from their prince to go in search of the traitor Banzayemon They reached Yedo without meeting with any adventures and taking up their abode at a cheap inn began to make their inquiries but although they sought far and wide they could learn no tidings of their enemy When three months had passed thus Kosanza began to grow faint hearted at their repeated failures but Umanosuke supported and comforted him urging him to fresh efforts But soon a great misfortune befell them Kosanza fell sick with ophthalmia and neither the tender nursing of his friend nor the drugs and doctors upon whom Umanosuke spent all their money had any effect on the suffering boy who soon became stone blind Friendless and penniless the one deprived of his eyesight and only a clog upon the other the two youths were thrown upon their own resources Then Umanosuke reduced to the last extremity of distress was forced to lead out Kosanza to Asakusa to beg sitting by the roadside whilst he himself wandering hither and thither picked up what he could from the charity of those who saw his wretched plight But all this while he never lost sight of his revenge and almost thanked the chance which had made him a beggar for the opportunity which it gave him of hunting out strange and hidden haunts of vagabond life into which in his more prosperous condition he could not have penetrated So he walked to and fro through the city leaning on a stout staff in which he had hidden his sword waiting patiently for fortune to bring him face to face with Banzayemon Illustration TRICKS OF SWORDSMANSHIP AT ASAKUSA Now Banzayemon after he had killed Sanza on the Mound of the Yoshiwara did not dare to show his face again in the house of Chobei the Father of the Otokodate for he knew that the two men Token Gombei and Shirobei the loose Colt would not only bear an evil report of him but would even kill him if he fell into their hands so great had been their indignation at his cowardly Conduct so he entered a company of mountebanks and earned his living by showing tricks of swordsmanship and selling tooth powder at the Okuyama at Asakusa twenty nine One day as he was going towards Asakusa to ply his trade he caught sight of a blind beggar in whom in spite of his poverty stricken and altered appearance he recognized the son of his enemy Rightly he judged that in spite of the boy s apparently helpless condition the discovery boded no weal for him so mounting to the upper storey of a tea house hard by he watched to see who should come to Kosanza s assistance Nor had he to wait long for presently he saw a second beggar come up and speak words of encouragement and kindness to the blind youth and looking attentively he saw that the new comer was Umanosuke Having thus discovered who was on his track he went home and sought means of killing the two beggars so he lay in wait and traced them to the poor hut where they dwelt and one night when he knew Umanosuke to be absent he crept in Kosanza being blind thought that the footsteps were those of Umanosuke and jumped up to welcome him but he in his heartless cruelty which not even the boy s piteous state could move slew Kosanza as he helplessly stretched out his hands to feel for his friend The deed was yet unfinished when Umanosuke returned and hearing a scuffle inside the hut drew the sword which was hidden in his staff and rushed in but Banzayemon profiting by the darkness eluded him and fled from the hut Umanosuke followed swiftly after him but just as he was on the point of catching him Banzayemon making a sweep backwards with his drawn sword wounded Umanosuke in the thigh so that he stumbled and fell and the murderer swift of foot made good his escape The wounded youth tried to pursue him again but being compelled by the pain of his wound to desist returned home and found his blind companion lying dead weltering in his own blood Cursing his unhappy fate he called in the beggars of the fraternity to which he belonged and between them they buried Kosanza and he himself being too poor to procure a surgeon s aid or to buy healing medicaments for his wound became a cripple Footnote twenty nine See Note at end of story It was at this time that Shirai Gompachi who was living under the protection of Chobei the Father of the Otokodate was in love with Komurasaki the beautiful courtesan who lived at the sign of the Three Sea shores in the Yoshiwara He had long exhausted the scanty supplies which he possessed and was now in the habit of feeding his purse by murder and robbery that he might have means to pursue his wild and extravagant life One night when he was out on his cutthroat business his fellows who had long suspected that he was after no good sent one of their number named Seibei to watch him Gompachi little dreaming that any one was following him swaggered along the street until he fell in with a wardsman whom he cut down and robbed but the booty proving small he waited for a second chance and seeing a light moving in the distance hid himself in the shadow of a large tub for catching rain water till the bearer of the lantern should come up When the man drew near Gompachi saw that he was dressed as a traveller and wore a long dirk so he sprung out from his lurking place and made to kill him but the traveller nimbly jumped on one side and proved no mean adversary for he drew his dirk and fought stoutly for his life However he was no match for so skilful a swordsman as Gompachi who after a sharp struggle dispatched him and carried off his purse which contained two hundred riyos Overjoyed at having found so rich a prize Gompachi was making off for the Yoshiwara when Seibei who horror stricken had seen both murders came up and began to upbraid him for his wickedness But Gompachi was so smooth spoken and so well liked by his comrades that he easily persuaded Seibei to hush the matter up and accompany him to the Yoshiwara for a little diversion As they were talking by the way Seibei said to Gompachi I bought a new dirk the other day but I have not had an opportunity to try it yet You have had so much experience in swords that you ought to be a good judge Pray look at this dirk and tell me whether you think it good for anything We ll soon see what sort of metal it is made of answered Gompachi We ll just try it on the first beggar we come across At first Seibei was horrified by this cruel proposal but by degrees he yielded to his companion s persuasions and so they went on their way until Seibei spied out a crippled beggar lying asleep on the bank outside the Yoshiwara The sound of their footsteps aroused the beggar who seeing a Samurai and a wardsman pointing at him and evidently speaking about him thought that their consultation could bode him no good So he pretended to be still asleep watching them carefully all the while and when Seibei went up to him brandishing his dirk the beggar avoiding the blow seized Seibei s arm and twisting it round flung him into the ditch below Gompachi seeing his companion s discomfiture attacked the beggar who drawing a sword from his staff made such lightning swift passes that crippled though he was and unable to move his legs freely Gompachi could not overpower him and although Seibei crawled out of the ditch and came to his assistance the beggar nothing daunted dealt his blows about him to such good purpose that he wounded Seibei in the temple and arm Then Gompachi reflecting that after all he had no quarrel with the beggar and that he had better attend to Seibei s wounds than go on fighting to no purpose drew Seibei away leaving the beggar who was too lame to follow them in peace When he examined Seibei s wounds he found that they were so severe that they must give up their night s frolic and go home So they went back to the house of Chobei the Father of the Otokodate and Seibei afraid to show himself with his sword cuts feigned sickness and went to bed On the following morning Chobei happening to need his apprentice Seibei s services sent for him and was told that he was sick so he went to the room where he lay abed and to his astonishment saw the cut upon his temple At first the wounded man refused to answer any questions as to how he had been hurt but at last on being pressed by Chobei he told the whole story of what had taken place the night before When Chobei heard the tale be guessed that the valiant beggar must be some noble Samurai in disguise who having a wrong to avenge was biding his time to meet with his enemy and wishing to help so brave a man he went in the evening with his two faithful apprentices Token Gombei and Shirobei the loose Colt to the bank outside the Yoshiwara to seek out the beggar The latter not one whit frightened by the adventure of the previous night had taken his place as usual and was lying on the bank when Chobei came up to him and said Sir I am Chobei the chief of the Otokodate at your service I have learnt with deep regret that two of my men insulted and attacked you last night However happily even Gompachi famous swordsman though he be was no match for you and had to beat a retreat before you I know therefore that you must be a noble Samurai who by some ill chance have become a cripple and a beggar Now therefore I pray you tell me all your story for humble wardsman as I am I may be able to assist you if you will condescend to allow me The cripple at first tried to shun Chobei s questions but at last touched by the honesty and kindness of his speech he replied Sir my name is Takagi Umanosuke and I am a native of Yamato and then he went on to narrate all the misfortunes which the wickedness of Banzayemon had brought about This is indeed a strange story said Chobei who had listened with indignation This Banzayemon before I knew the blackness of his heart was once under my protection But after he murdered Sanza hard by here he was pursued by these two apprentices of mine and since that day he has been no more to my house When he had introduced the two apprentices to Umanosuke Chobei pulled forth a suit of silk clothes befitting a gentleman and having made the crippled youth lay aside his beggar s raiment led him to a bath and had his hair dressed Then he bade Token Gombei lodge him and take charge of him and having sent for a famous physician caused Umanosuke to undergo careful treatment for the wound in his thigh In the course of two months the pain had almost disappeared so that he could stand easily and when after another month he could walk about a little Chobei removed him to his own house pretending to his wife and apprentices that he was one of his own relations who had come on a visit to him After a while when Umanosuke had become quite cured he went one day to worship at a famous temple and on his way home after dark he was overtaken by a shower of rain and took shelter under the eaves of a house in a part of the city called Yanagiwara waiting for the sky to clear Now it happened that this same night Gompachi had gone out on one of his bloody expeditions to which his poverty and his love for Komurasaki drove him in spite of himself and seeing a Samurai standing in the gloom he sprang upon him before he had recognized Umanosuke whom he knew as a friend of his patron Chobei Umanosuke drew and defended himself and soon contrived to slash Gompachi on the forehead so that the latter seeing himself overmatched fled under the cover of the night Umanosuke fearing to hurt his recently healed wound did not give chase and went quietly back to Chobei s house When Gompachi returned home he hatched a story to deceive Chobei as to the cause of the wound on his forehead Chobei however having overheard Umanosuke reproving Gompachi for his wickedness soon became aware of the truth and not caring to keep a robber and murderer near him gave Gompachi a present of money and bade him return to his house no more And now Chobei seeing that Umanosuke had recovered his strength divided his apprentices into bands to hunt out Banzayemon in order that the vendetta might be accomplished It soon was reported to him that Banzayemon was earning his living among the mountebanks of Asakusa so Chobei communicated this intelligence to Umanosuke who made his preparations accordingly and on the following morning the two went to Asakusa where Banzayemon was astonishing a crowd of country boors by exhibiting tricks with his sword Then Umanosuke striding through the gaping rabble shouted out False murderous coward your day has come I Umanosuke the son of Umanojo have come to demand vengeance for the death of three innocent men who have perished by your treachery If you are a man defend yourself This day shall your soul see hell With these words he rushed furiously upon Banzayemon who seeing escape to be impossible stood upon his guard But his coward s heart quailed before the avenger and he soon lay bleeding at his enemy s feet But who shall say how Umanosuke thanked Chobei for his assistance or how when he had returned to his own country he treasured up his gratitude in his heart looking upon Chobei as more than a second father Thus did Chobei use his power to punish the wicked and to reward the good giving of his abundance to the poor and succouring the unfortunate so that his name was honoured far and near It remains only to record the tragical manner of his death We have already told how my lord Midzuno Jiurozayemon the chief of the associated nobles had been foiled in his attempts to bring shame upon Chobei the Father of the Otokodate and how on the contrary the latter by his ready wit never failed to make the proud noble s weapons recoil upon him The failure of these attempts rankled in the breast of Jiurozayemon who hated Chobei with an intense hatred and sought to be revenged upon him One day he sent a retainer to Chobei s house with a message to the effect that on the following day my lord Jiurozayemon would be glad to see Chobei at his house and to offer him a cup of wine in return for the cold macaroni with which his lordship had been feasted some time since Chobei immediately suspected that in sending this friendly summons the cunning noble was hiding a dagger in a smile however he knew that if he stayed away out of fear he would be branded as a coward and made a laughing stock for fools to jeer at Not caring that Jiurozayemon should succeed in his desire to put him to shame he sent for his favourite apprentice Token Gombei and said to him I have been invited to a drinking bout by Midzuno Jiurozayemon I know full well that this is but a stratagem to requite me for having fooled him and maybe his hatred will go the length of killing me However I shall go and take my chance and if I detect any sign of foul play I ll try to serve the world by ridding it of a tyrant who passes his life in oppressing the helpless farmers and wardsmen Now as even if I succeed in killing him in his own house my life must pay forfeit for the deed do you come to morrow night with a burying tub thirty and fetch my corpse from this Jiurozayemon s house Footnote thirty The lowest classes in Japan are buried in a squatting position in a sort of barrel One would have expected a person of Chobei s condition and means to have ordered a square box It is a mistake to suppose the burning of the dead to be universal in Japan only about thirty per cent of the lower classes chiefly belonging to the Monto sect of Buddhism are burnt The rich and noble are buried in several square coffins one inside the other in a sitting position and their bodies are partially preserved from decay by filling the nose ears and mouth with vermilion In the case of the very wealthy the coffin is completely filled in with vermilion The family of the Princes of Mito and some other nobles bury their dead in a recumbent position Token Gombei when he heard the Father speak thus was horrified and tried to dissuade him from obeying the invitation But Chobei s mind was fixed and without heeding Gombei s remonstrances he proceeded to give instructions as to the disposal of his property after his death and to settle all his earthly affairs On the following day towards noon he made ready to go to Jiurozayemon s house bidding one of his apprentices precede him with a complimentary present thirty one Jiurozayemon who was waiting with impatience for Chobei to come so soon as he heard of his arrival ordered his retainers to usher him into his presence and Chobei having bade his apprentices without fail to come and fetch him that night went into the house Footnote thirty one It is customary on the occasion of a first visit to a house to carry a present to the owner who gives something of equal value on returning the visit No sooner had he reached the room next to that in which Jiurozayemon was sitting than he saw that his suspicions of treachery were well founded for two men with drawn swords rushed upon him and tried to cut him down Deftly avoiding their blows however he tripped up the one and kicking the other in the ribs sent him reeling and breathless against the wall then as calmly as if nothing had happened he presented himself before Jiurozayemon who peeping through a chink in the sliding doors had watched his retainers failure Welcome welcome Master Chobei said he I always had heard that you were a man of mettle and I wanted to see what stuff you were made of so I bade my retainers put your courage to the test That was a masterly throw of yours Well you must excuse this churlish reception come and sit down by me Pray do not mention it my lord said Chobei smiling rather scornfully I know that my poor skill is not to be measured with that of a noble Samurai and if these two good gentlemen had the worst of it just now it was mere luck that s all So after the usual compliments had been exchanged Chobei sat down by Jiurozayemon and the attendants brought in wine and condiments Before they began to drink however Jiurozayemon said You must be tired and exhausted with your walk this hot day Master Chobei I thought that perhaps a bath might refresh you so I ordered my men to get it ready for you Would you not like to bathe and make yourself comfortable Chobei suspected that this was a trick to strip him and take him unawares when he should have laid aside his dirk However he answered cheerfully Your lordship is very good I shall be glad to avail myself of your kind offer Pray excuse me for a few moments So he went to the bath room and leaving his clothes outside he got into the bath with the full conviction that it would be the place of his death Yet he never trembled nor quailed determined that if he needs must die no man should say he had been a coward Then Jiurozayemon calling to his attendants said Quick lock the door of the bath room We hold him fast now If he gets out more than one life will pay the price of his He s a match for any six of you in fair fight Lock the door I say and light up the fire under the bath thirty two and we ll boil him to death and be rid of him Quick men quick Footnote thirty two This sort of bath in which the water is heated by the fire of a furnace which is lighted from outside is called Goyemon buro or Goyemon s bath after a notorious robber named Goyemon who attempted the life of Taiko Sama the famous general and ruler of the sixteenth century and suffered for his crimes by being boiled to death in oil a form of execution which is now obsolete So they locked the door and fed the fire until the water hissed and bubbled within and Chobei in his agony tried to burst open the door but Jiurozayemon ordered his men to thrust their spears through the partition wall and dispatch him Two of the spears Chobei clutched and broke short off but at last he was struck by a mortal blow under the ribs and died a brave man by the hands of cowards Illustration THE DEATH OF CHOBEI OF BANDZUIN That evening Token Gombei who to the astonishment of Chobei s wife had bought a burying tub came with seven other apprentices to fetch the Father of the Otokodate from Jiurozayemon s house and when the retainers saw them they mocked at them and said What have you come to fetch your drunken master home in a litter Nay answered Gombei but we have brought a coffin for his dead body as he bade us When the retainers heard this they marvelled at the courage of Chobei who had thus wittingly come to meet his fate So Chobei s corpse was placed in the burying tub and handed over to his apprentices who swore to avenge his death Far and wide the poor and friendless mourned for this good man His son Chomatsu inherited his property and his wife remained a faithful widow until her dying day praying that she might sit with him in paradise upon the cup of the same lotus flower Many a time did the apprentices of Chobei meet together to avenge him but Jiurozayemon eluded all their efforts until having been imprisoned by the Government in the temple called Kanyeiji at Uyeno as is related in the story of Kazuma s Revenge he was placed beyond the reach of their hatred So lived and so died Chobei of Bandzuin the Father of the Otokodate of Yedo NOTE ON ASAKUSA Translated from a native book called the Yedo Hanjoki or Guide to the prosperous City of Yedo and other sources Asakusa is the most bustling place in all Yedo It is famous for the Temple Sensoji on the hill of Kinriu or the Golden Dragon which from morning till night is thronged with visitors rich and poor old and young flocking in sleeve to sleeve The origin of the temple was as follows In the days of the Emperor Suiko who reigned in the thirteenth century A D a certain noble named Hashi no Nakatomo fell into disgrace and left the Court and having become a Ronin or masterless man he took up his abode on the Golden Dragon Hill with two retainers being brothers named Hinokuma Hamanari and Hinokuma Takenari These three men being reduced to great straits and without means of earning their living became fishermen Now it happened that on the sixth day of the third month of the thirty sixth year of the reign of the Emperor Suiko A D twelve forty one they went down in the morning to the Asakusa River to ply their trade and having cast their nets took no fish but at every throw they pulled up a figure of the Buddhist god Kwannon which they threw into the river again They sculled their boat away to another spot but the same luck followed them and nothing came to their nets save the figure of Kwannon Struck by the miracle they carried home the image and after fervent prayer built a temple on the Golden Dragon Hill in which they enshrined it The temple thus founded was enriched by the benefactions of wealthy and pious persons whose care raised its buildings to the dignity of the first temple in Yedo Tradition says that the figure of Kwannon which was fished up in the net was one inch and eight tenths in height The main hall of the temple is sixty feet square and is adorned with much curious workmanship of gilding and of silvering so that no place can be more excellently beautiful There are two gates in front of it The first is called the Gate of the Spirits of the Wind and of the Thunder and is adorned with figures of those two gods The Wind god whose likeness is that of a devil carries the wind bag and the Thunder god who is also shaped like a devil carries a drum and a drumstick thirty three The second gate is called the Gate of the gods Nio or the Two Princes whose colossal statues painted red and hideous to look upon stand on either side of it Between the gates is an approach four hundred yards in length which is occupied by the stalls of hucksters who sell toys and trifles for women and children and by foul and loathsome beggars Passing through the gate of the gods Nio the main hall of the temple strikes the eye Countless niches and shrines of the gods stand outside it and an old woman earns her livelihood at a tank filled with water to which the votaries of the gods come and wash themselves that they may pray with clean hands Inside are the images of the gods lanterns incense burners candlesticks a huge moneybox into which the offerings of the pious are thrown and votive tablets thirty four representing the famous gods and goddesses heroes and heroines of old Behind the chief building is a broad space called the okuyama where young and pretty waitresses well dressed and painted invite the weary pilgrims and holiday makers to refresh themselves with tea and sweetmeats Here too are all sorts of sights to be seen such as wild beasts performing monkeys automata conjurers wooden and paper figures which take the place of the waxworks of the West acrobats and jesters for the amusement of women and children Altogether it is a lively and a joyous scene there is not its equal in the city Footnote thirty three This gate was destroyed by fire a few years since Footnote thirty four Sir Rutherford Alcock in his book upon Japan states that the portraits of the most famous courtesans of Yedo are yearly hung up in the temple at Asakusa No such pictures are to be seen now and no Japanese of whom I have made inquiries have heard of such a custom The priests of the temple deny that their fane was ever so polluted and it is probable that the statement is but one of the many strange mistakes into which an imperfect knowledge of the language led the earlier travellers in Japan In spite of all that has been said by persons who have had no opportunity of associating and exchanging ideas with the educated men of Japan I maintain that in no country is the public harlot more abhorred and looked down upon At Asakusa as indeed all over Yedo are to be found fortunetellers who prey upon the folly of the superstitious With a treatise on physiognomy laid on a desk before them they call out to this man that he has an ill omened forehead and to that man that the space between his nose and his lips is unlucky Their tongues wag like flowing water until the passers by are attracted to their stalls If the seer finds a customer he closes his eyes and lifting the divining sticks reverently to his forehead mutters incantations between his teeth Then suddenly parting the sticks in two bundles he prophesies good or evil according to the number in each With a magnifying glass he examines his dupe s face and the palms of his hands By the fashion of his clothes and his general manner the prophet sees whether he is a countryman or from the city I am afraid sir says he you have not been altogether fortunate in life but I foresee that great luck awaits you in two or three months or like a clumsy doctor who makes his diagnosis according to his patient s fancies if he sees his customer frowning and anxious he adds Alas in seven or eight months you must beware of great misfortune But I cannot tell you all about it for a slight fee with a long sigh he lays down the divining sticks on the desk and the frightened boor pays a further fee to hear the sum of the misfortune which threatens him until with three feet of bamboo slips and three inches of tongue the clever rascal has made the poor fool turn his purse inside out The class of diviners called Ichiko profess to give tidings of the dead or of those who have gone to distant countries The Ichiko exactly corresponds to the spirit medium of the West The trade is followed by women of from fifteen or sixteen to some fifty years of age who walk about the streets carrying on their backs a divining box about a foot square they have no shop or stall but wander about and are invited into their customers houses The ceremony of divination is very simple A porcelain bowl filled with water is placed upon a tray and the customer having written the name of the person with whom he wishes to hold communion on a long slip of paper rolls it into a spill which he dips into the water and thrice sprinkles the Ichiko or medium She resting her elbow upon her divining box and leaning her head upon her hand mutters prayers and incantations until she has summoned the soul of the dead or absent person which takes possession of her and answers questions through her mouth The prophecies which the Ichiko utters during her trance are held in high esteem by the superstitious and vulgar Hard by Asakusa is the theatre street The theatres are called Shiba i thirty five turf places from the fact that the first theatrical performances were held on a turf plot The origin of the drama in Japan as elsewhere was religious In the reign of the Emperor Heijo A D eight hundred five there was a sudden volcanic depression of the earth close by a pond called Sarusawa or the Monkey s Marsh at Nara in the province of Yamato and a poisonous smoke issuing from the cavity struck down with sickness all those who came within its baneful influence so the people brought quantities of firewood which they burnt in order that the poisonous vapour might be dispelled The fire being the male influence would assimilate with and act as an antidote upon the mephitic smoke which was a female influence thirty six Besides this as a further charm to exorcise the portent the dance called Sambaso which is still performed as a prelude to theatrical exhibitions by an actor dressed up as a venerable old man emblematic of long life and felicity was danced on a plot of turf in front of the Temple Kofukuji By these means the smoke was dispelled and the drama was originated The story is to be found in the Zoku Nihon Ki or supplementary history of Japan Footnote thirty five In doctor Hepburn s Dictionary of the Japanese language the Chinese characters given for the word Shiba i are chi chang keih chang Morrison s Dictionary theatrical arena The characters which are usually written and which are etymologically correct are chih chue che keu Morrison the place of plants or turf plot Footnote thirty six This refers to the Chinese doctrine of the Yang and Yin the male and female influences pervading all creation Three centuries later during the reign of the Emperor Toba A D eleven oh eight there lived a woman called Iso no Zenji who is looked upon as the mother of the Japanese drama Her performances however seem only to have consisted in dancing or posturing dressed up in the costume of the nobles of the Court from which fact her dance was called Otoko mai or the man s dance Her name is only worth mentioning on account of the respect in which her memory is held by actors It was not until the year A D sixteen twenty four that a man named Saruwaka Kanzaburo at the command of the Shogun opened the first theatre in Yedo in the Nakabashi or Middle Bridge Street where it remained until eight years later when it was removed to the Ningiyo or Doll Street The company of this theatre was formed by two families named Miako and Ichimura who did not long enjoy their monopoly for in the year sixteen forty four we find a third family that of Yamamura setting up a rival theatre in the Kobiki or Sawyer Street In the year sixteen fifty one the Asiatic prejudice in favour of keeping persons of one calling in one place exhibited itself by the removal of the playhouses to their present site and the street was called the Saruwaka Street after Saruwaka Kanzaburo the founder of the drama in Yedo Theatrical performances go on from six in the morning until six in the evening Just as the day is about to dawn in the east the sound of the drum is heard and the dance Sambaso is danced as a prelude and after this follow the dances of the famous actors of old these are called the extra performances waki kiyogen The dance of Nakamura represents the demon Shudendoji an ogre who was destroyed by the hero Yorimitsu according to the following legend At the beginning of the eleventh century when Ichijo the Second was Emperor lived the hero Yorimitsu Now it came to pass that in those days the people of Kioto were sorely troubled by an evil spirit which took up its abode near the Rasho gate One night as Yorimitsu was making merry with his retainers he said Who dares go and defy the demon of the Rasho gate and set up a token that he has been there That dare I answered Tsuna who having donned his coat of mail mounted his horse and rode out through the dark bleak night to the Rasho gate Having written his name upon the gate he was about to turn homewards when his horse began to shiver with fear and a huge hand coming forth from the gate seized the back of the knight s helmet Tsuna nothing daunted struggled to get free but in vain so drawing his sword he cut off the demon s arm and the spirit with a howl fled into the night But Tsuna carried home the arm in triumph and locked it up in a box One night the demon having taken the shape of Tsuna s aunt came to him and said I pray thee show me the arm of the fiend Tsuna answered I have shown it to no man and yet to thee I will show it So he brought forth the box and opened it when suddenly a black cloud shrouded the figure of the supposed aunt and the demon having regained its arm disappeared From that time forth the people were more than ever troubled by the demon who carried off to the hills all the fairest virgins of Kioto whom he ravished and ate so that there was scarce a beautiful damsel left in the city Then was the Emperor very sorrowful and he commanded Yorimitsu to destroy the monster and the hero having made ready went forth with four trusty knights and another great captain to search among the hidden places of the mountains One day as they were journeying far from the haunts of men they fell in with an old man who having bidden them to enter his dwelling treated them kindly and set before them wine to drink and when they went away and took their leave of him he gave them a present of more wine to take away with them Now this old man was a mountain god As they went on their way they met a beautiful lady who was washing blood stained clothes in the waters of the valley weeping bitterly the while When they asked her why she shed tears she answered Sirs I am a woman from Kioto whom the demon has carried off he makes me wash his clothes and when he is weary of me he will kill and eat me I pray your lordships to save me Then the six heroes bade the woman lead them to the ogre s cave where a hundred devils were mounting guard and waiting upon him The woman having gone in first told the fiend of their coming and he thinking to slay and eat them called them to him so they entered the cave which reeked with the smell of the flesh and blood of men and they saw Shudendoji a huge monster with the face of a little child The six men offered him the wine which they had received from the mountain god and he laughing in his heart drank and made merry so that little by little the fumes of the wine got into his head and he fell asleep The heroes themselves feigning sleep watched for a moment when the devils were all off their guard to put on their armour and steal one by one into the demon s chamber Then Yorimitsu seeing that all was still drew his sword and cut off Shudendoji s head which sprung up and bit at his head luckily however Yorimitsu had put on two helmets the one over the other so he was not hurt When all the devils had been slain the heroes and the woman returned to Kioto carrying with them the head of Shudendoji which was laid before the Emperor and the fame of their action was spread abroad under heaven This Shudendoji is the ogre represented in the Nakamura dance The Ichimura dance represents the seven gods of wealth and the Morita dance represents a large ape and is emblematical of drinking wine As soon as the sun begins to rise in the heaven sign boards all glistening with paintings and gold are displayed and the playgoers flock in crowds to the theatre The farmers and country folk hurry over their breakfast and the women and children who have got up in the middle of the night to paint and adorn themselves come from all the points of the compass to throng the gallery which is hung with curtains as bright as the rainbow in the departing clouds The place soon becomes so crowded that the heads of the spectators are like the scales on a dragon s back When the play begins if the subject be tragic the spectators are so affected that they weep till they have to wring their sleeves dry If the piece be comic they laugh till their chins are out of joint The tricks and stratagems of the drama baffle description and the actors are as graceful as the flight of the swallow The triumph of persecuted virtue and the punishment of wickedness invariably crown the story When a favourite actor makes his appearance his entry is hailed with cheers Fun and diversion are the order of the day and rich and poor alike forget the cares which they have left behind them at home and yet it is not all idle amusement for there is a moral taught and a practical sermon preached in every play The subjects of the pieces are chiefly historical feigned names being substituted for those of the real heroes Indeed it is in the popular tragedies that we must seek for an account of many of the events of the last two hundred and fifty years for only one very bald history thirty seven of those times has been published of which but a limited number of copies were struck off from copper plates and its circulation was strictly forbidden by the Shogun s Government The stories are rendered with great minuteness and detail so much so that it sometimes takes a series of representations to act out one piece in its entirety The Japanese are far in advance of the Chinese in their scenery and properties and their pieces are sometimes capitally got up a revolving stage enables them to shift from one scene to another with great rapidity First rate actors receive as much as a thousand riyos about Lthree hundred as their yearly salary This however is a high rate of pay and many a man has to strut before the public for little more than his daily rice to a clever young actor it is almost enough reward to be allowed to enter a company in which there is a famous star The salary of the actor however may depend upon the success of the theatre for dramatic exhibitions are often undertaken as speculations by wealthy persons who pay their company in proportion to their own profit Besides his regular pay a popular Japanese actor has a small mine of wealth in his patrons who open their purses freely for the privilege of frequenting the greenroom The women s parts are all taken by men as they used to be with us in ancient days Touching the popularity of plays it is related that in the year eighteen thirty three when two actors called Bando Shuka and Segawa Roko both famous players of women s parts died at the same time the people of Yedo mourned to heaven and to earth and if a million riyos could have brought back their lives the money would have been forthcoming Thousands flocked to their funeral and the richness of their coffins and of the clothes laid upon them was admired by all Footnote thirty seven I allude to the Tai Hei Nem piyo or Annals of the Great Peace a very rare work only two or three copies of which have found their way into the libraries of foreigners When I heard this says Terakado Seiken the author of the Yedo Hanjoki I lifted my eyes to heaven and heaved a great sigh When my friend Saito Shimei a learned and good man died there was barely enough money to bury him his needy pupils and friends subscribed to give him a humble coffin Alas alas here was a teacher who from his youth up had honoured his parents and whose heart know no guile if his friends were in need he ministered to their wants he grudged no pains to teach his fellow men his good will and charity were beyond praise under the blue sky and bright day he never did a shameful deed His merits were as those of the sages of old but because he lacked the cunning of a fox or badger he received no patronage from the wealthy and remaining poor to the day of his death never had an opportunity of making his worth known Alas alas The drama is exclusively the amusement of the middle and lower classes Etiquette sternest of tyrants forbids the Japanese of high rank to be seen at any public exhibition wrestling matches alone excepted Actors are however occasionally engaged to play in private for the edification of my lord and his ladies and there is a kind of classical opera called No which is performed on stages specially built for the purpose in the palaces of the principal nobles These No represent the entertainments by which the Sun Goddess was lured out of the cave in which she had hidden a fable said to be based upon an eclipse In the reign of the Emperor Yomei A D five hundred eighty six five hundred ninety three Hada Kawakatsu a man born in Japan but of Chinese extraction was commanded by the Emperor to arrange an entertainment for the propitiation of the gods and the prosperity of the country Kawakatsu wrote thirty three plays introducing fragments of Japanese poetry with accompaniments of musical instruments Two performers named Taketa and Hattori having especially distinguished themselves in these entertainments were ordered to prepare other similar plays and their productions remain to the present day The pious intention of the No being to pray for the prosperity of the country they are held in the highest esteem by the nobles of the Court the Daimios and the military class in old days they alone performed in these plays but now ordinary actors take part in them The No are played in sets The first of the set is specially dedicated to the propitiation of the gods the second is performed in full armour and is designed to terrify evil spirits and to insure the punishment of malefactors the third is of a gentler intention and its special object is the representation of all that is beautiful and fragrant and delightful The performers wear hideous wigs and masks not unlike those of ancient Greece and gorgeous brocade dresses The masks which belong to what was the private company of the Shogun are many centuries old and have been carefully preserved as heirlooms from generation to generation being made of very thin wood lacquered over and kept each in a silken bag they have been uninjured by the lapse of time During the Duke of Edinburgh s stay in Yedo this company was engaged to give a performance in the Yashiki of the Prince of Kishiu which has the reputation of being the handsomest palace in all Yedo So far as I know such an exhibition had never before been witnessed by foreigners and it may be interesting to give an account of it Opposite the principal reception room where his Royal Highness sat and separated from it by a narrow courtyard was a covered stage approached from the greenroom by a long gallery at an angle of forty five degrees Half a dozen musicians clothed in dresses of ceremony marched slowly down the gallery and having squatted down on the stage bowed gravely The performances then began There was no scenery nor stage appliances the descriptions of the chorus or of the actors took their place The dialogue and choruses are given in a nasal recitative accompanied by the mouth organ flute drum and other classical instruments and are utterly unintelligible The ancient poetry is full of puns and plays upon words and it was with no little difficulty that with the assistance of a man of letters I prepared beforehand the arguments of the different pieces The first play was entitled Hachiman of the Bow Hachiman is the name under which the Emperor Ojin A C two hundred seventy three hundred twelve was deified as the God of War He is specially worshipped on account of his miraculous birth his mother the Empress Jingo having by the virtue of a magic stone which she wore at her girdle borne him in her womb for three years during which she made war upon and conquered the Coreans The time of the plot is laid in the reign of the Emperor Uda the Second A D twelve seventy five twelve eighty nine In the second month of the year pilgrims are flocking to the temple of Hachiman at Mount Otoko between Osaka and Kioto All this is explained by the chorus A worshipper steps forth sent by the Emperor and delivers a congratulatory oration upon the peace and prosperity of the land The chorus follows in the same strain they sing the praises of Hachiman and of the reigning Emperor An old man enters bearing something which appears to be a bow in a brocade bag On being asked who he is the old man answers that he is an aged servant of the shrine and that he wishes to present his mulberry wood bow to the Emperor being too humble to draw near to his Majesty he has waited for this festival hoping that an opportunity might present itself He explains that with this bow and with certain arrows made of the Artemisia the heavenly gods pacified the world On being asked to show his bow he refuses it is a mystic protector of the country which in old days was overshadowed by the mulberry tree The peace which prevails in the land is likened to a calm at sea The Emperor is the ship and his subjects the water The old man dwells upon the ancient worship of Hachiman and relates how his mother the Empress Jingo sacrificed to the gods before invading Corea and how the present prosperity of the country is to be attributed to the acceptance of those sacrifices After having revealed himself as the god Hachiman in disguise the old man disappears The worshipper awe struck declares that he must return to Kioto and tell the Emperor what he has seen The chorus announces that sweet music and fragrant perfumes issue from the mountain and the piece ends with felicitations upon the visible favour of the gods and especially of Hachiman The second piece was Tsunemasa Tsunemasa was a hero of the twelfth century who died in the civil wars he was famous for his skill in playing on the biwa a sort of four stringed lute A priest enters and announces that his name is Giyokei and that before he retired from the world he held high rank at Court He relates how Tsunemasa in his childhood the favourite of the Emperor died in the wars by the western seas During his lifetime the Emperor gave him a lute called Sei zan the Azure Mountain this lute at his death was placed in a shrine erected to his honour and at his funeral music and plays were performed during seven days within the palace by the special grace of the Emperor The scene is laid at the shrine The lonely and awesome appearance of the spot is described Although the sky is clear the wind rustles through the trees like the sound of falling rain and although it is now summer time the moonlight on the sand looks like hoar frost All nature is sad and downcast The ghost appears and sings that it is the spirit of Tsunemasa and has come to thank those who have piously celebrated his obsequies No one answers him and the spirit vanishes its voice becoming fainter and fainter an unreal and illusory vision haunting the scenes amid which its life was spent The priest muses on the portent Is it a dream or a reality Marvellous The ghost returning speaks of former days when it lived as a child in the palace and received the Azure Mountain lute from the Emperor that lute with the four strings of which its hand was once so familiar and the attraction of which now draws it from the grave The chorus recites the virtues of Tsunemasa his benevolence justice humanity talents and truth his love of poetry and music the trees the flowers the birds the breezes the moon all had a charm for him The ghost begins to play upon the Azure Mountain lute and the sounds produced from the magical instrument are so delicate that all think it is a shower falling from heaven The priest declares that it is not rain but the sound of the enchanted lute The sound of the first and second strings is as the sound of gentle rain or of the wind stirring the pine trees and the sound of the third and fourth strings is as the song of birds and pheasants calling to their young A rhapsody in praise of music follows Would that such strains could last for ever The ghost bewails its fate that it cannot remain to play on but must return whence it came The priest addresses the ghost and asks whether the vision is indeed the spirit of Tsunemasa Upon this the ghost calls out in an agony of sorrow and terror at having been seen by mortal eyes and bids that the lamps be put out on its return to the abode of the dead it will suffer for having shown itself it describes the fiery torments which will be its lot Poor fool it has been lured to its destruction like the insect of summer that flies into the flame Summoning the winds to its aid it puts out the lights and disappears The Suit of Feathers is the title of a very pretty conceit which followed A fisherman enters and in a long recitative describes the scenery at the sea shore of Miwo in the province of Suruga at the foot of Fuji Yama the Peerless Mountain The waves are still and there is a great calm the fishermen are all out plying their trade The speaker s name is Hakuriyo a fisherman living in the pine grove of Miwo The rains are now over and the sky is serene the sun rises bright and red over the pine trees and rippling sea while last night s moon is yet seen faintly in the heaven Even he humble fisher though he be is softened by the beauty of the nature which surrounds him A breeze springs up the weather will change clouds and waves will succeed sunshine and calm the fishermen must get them home again No it is but the gentle breath of spring after all it scarcely stirs the stout fir trees and the waves are hardly heard to break upon the shore The men may go forth in safety The fisherman then relates how while he was wondering at the view flowers began to rain from the sky and sweet music filled the air which was perfumed by a mystic fragrance Looking up he saw hanging on a pine tree a fairy s suit of feathers which he took home and showed to a friend intending to keep it as a relic in his house A heavenly fairy makes her appearance and claims the suit of feathers but the fisherman holds to his treasure trove She urges the impiety of his act a mortal has no right to take that which belongs to the fairies He declares that he will hand down the feather suit to posterity as one of the treasures of the country The fairy bewails her lot without her wings how can she return to heaven She recalls the familiar joys of heaven now closed to her she sees the wild geese and the gulls flying to the skies and longs for their power of flight the tide has its ebb and its flow and the sea breezes blow whither they list for her alone there is no power of motion she must remain on earth At last touched by her plaint the fisherman consents to return the feather suit on condition that the fairy shall dance and play heavenly music for him She consents but must first obtain the feather suit without which she cannot dance The fisherman refuses to give it up lest she should fly away to heaven without redeeming her pledge The fairy reproaches him for his want of faith how should a heavenly being be capable of falsehood He is ashamed and gives her the feather suit which she dons and begins to dance singing of the delights of heaven where she is one of the fifteen attendants who minister to the moon The fisherman is so transported with joy that he fancies himself in heaven and wishes to detain the fairy to dwell with him for ever A song follows in praise of the scenery and of the Peerless Mountain capped with the snows of spring When her dance is concluded the fairy wafted away by the sea breeze floats past the pine grove to Ukishima and Mount Ashidaka over Mount Fuji till she is seen dimly like a cloud in the distant sky and vanishes into thin air The last of the No was The Little Smith the scene of which is laid in the reign of the Emperor Ichijo A D nine hundred eighty seven ten eleven A noble of the court enters and proclaims himself to be Tachibana Michinari He has been commanded by the Emperor who has seen a dream of good omen on the previous night to order a sword of the smith Munechika of Sanjo He calls Munechika who comes out and after receiving the order expresses the difficulty he is in having at that time no fitting mate to help him he cannot forge a blade alone The excuse is not admitted the smith pleads hard to be saved from the shame of a failure Driven to a compliance there is nothing left for it but to appeal to the gods for aid He prays to the patron god of his family Inari Sama thirty eight A man suddenly appears and calls the smith this man is the god Inari Sama in disguise The smith asks who is his visitor and how does he know him by name The stranger answers Thou hast been ordered to make a blade for the Emperor This is passing strange says the smith I received the order but a moment since how comest thou to know of it Heaven has a voice which is heard upon the earth Walls have ears and stones tell tales thirty nine There are no secrets in the world The flash of the blade ordered by him who is above the clouds the Emperor is quickly seen By the grace of the Emperor the sword shall be quickly made Here follows the praise of certain famous blades and an account of the part they played in history with special reference to the sword which forms one of the regalia The sword which the Emperor has sent for shall be inferior to none of these the smith may set his heart at rest The smith awe struck expresses his wonder and asks again who is addressing him He is bidden to go and deck out his anvil and a supernatural power will help him The visitor disappears in a cloud The smith prepares his anvil at the four corners of which he places images of the gods while above it he stretches the straw rope and paper pendants hung up in temples to shut out foul or ill omened influences He prays for strength to make the blade not for his own glory but for the honour of the Emperor A young man a fox in disguise appears and helps Munechika to forge the steel The noise of the anvil resounds to heaven and over the earth The chorus announces that the blade is finished on one side is the mark of Munechika on the other is graven The Little Fox in clear characters Footnote thirty eight The note at the end of the Story of the Grateful Foxes contains an account of Inari Sama and explains how the foxes minister to him Footnote thirty nine This is a literal translation of a Japanese proverb The subjects of the No are all taken from old legends of the country a shrine at Miwo by the sea shore marks the spot where the suit of feathers was found and the miraculously forged sword is supposed to be in the armoury of the Emperor to this day The beauty of the poetry and it is very beautiful is marred by the want of scenery and by the grotesque dresses and make up In the Suit of Feathers for instance the fairy wears a hideous mask and a wig of scarlet elf locks the suit of feathers itself is left entirely to the imagination and the heavenly dance is a series of whirls stamps and jumps accompanied by unearthly yells and shrieks while the vanishing into thin air is represented by pirouettes something like the motion of a dancing dervish The intoning of the recitative is unnatural and unintelligible so much so that not even a highly educated Japanese could understand what is going on unless he were previously acquainted with the piece This however is supposing that which is not for the No are as familiarly known as the masterpieces of our own dramatists The classical severity of the No is relieved by the introduction between the pieces of light farces called Kiyogen The whole entertainment having a religious intention the Kiyogen stand to the No in the same relation as the small shrines to the main temple they too are played for the propitiation of the gods and for the softening of men s hearts The farces are acted without wigs or masks the dialogue is in the common spoken language and there being no musical accompaniment it is quite easy to follow The plots of the two farces which were played before the Duke of Edinburgh are as follows In the Ink Smearing the hero is a man from a distant part of the country who having a petition to prefer comes to the capital where he is detained for a long while His suit being at last successful he communicates the joyful news to his servant Tarokaja the conventional name of the Leporello of these farces The two congratulate one another To while away his idle hours during his sojourn at the capital the master has entered into a flirtation with a certain young lady master and servant now hold a consultation as to whether the former should not go and take leave of her Tarokaja is of opinion that as she is of a very jealous nature his master ought to go Accordingly the two set out to visit her the servant leading the way Arrived at her house the gentleman goes straight in without the knowledge of the lady who coming out and meeting Tarokaja asks after his master He replies that his master is inside the house She refuses to believe him and complains that for some time past his visits have been few and far between Why should he come now Surely Tarokaja is hoaxing her The servant protests that he is telling the truth and that his master really has entered the house She only half persuaded goes in and finds that my lord is indeed there She welcomes him and in the same breath upbraids him Some other lady has surely found favour in his eyes What fair wind has wafted him back to her He replies that business alone has kept him from her he hopes that all is well with her With her indeed all is well and there is no change but she fears that his heart is changed Surely surely he has found mountains upon mountains of joy elsewhere even now perhaps he is only calling on his way homeward from some haunt of pleasure What pleasure can there be away from her answers he Indeed his time has not been his own else he would have come sooner Why then did he not send his servant to explain Tarokaja here puts in his oar and protests that between running on errands and dancing attendance upon his lord he has not had a moment to himself At any rate says the master I must ask for your congratulations for my suit which was so important has prospered The lady expresses her happiness and the gentleman then bids his servant tell her the object of their visit Tarokaja objects to this his lord had better tell his own story While the two are disputing as to who shall speak the lady s curiosity is aroused What terrible tale is this that neither of you dare tell Pray let one or other of you speak At last the master explains that he has come to take leave of her as he must forthwith return to his own province The girl begins to weep and the gentleman following suit the two shed tears in concert She uses all her art to cajole him and secretly produces from her sleeve a cup of water with which she smears her eyes to imitate tears He deceived by the trick tries to console her and swears that as soon as he reaches his own country he will send a messenger to fetch her but she pretends to weep all the more and goes on rubbing her face with water Tarokaja in the meanwhile detects the trick and calling his master on one side tells him what she is doing The gentleman however refuses to believe him and scolds him right roundly for telling lies The lady calls my lord to her and weeping more bitterly than ever tries to coax him to remain Tarokaja slyly fills another cup with ink and water and substitutes it for the cup of clear water She all unconcerned goes on smearing her face At last she lifts her face and her lover seeing it all black and sooty gives a start What can be the matter with the girl s face Tarokaja in an aside explains what he has done They determine to put her to shame The lover producing from his bosom a box containing a mirror gives it to the girl who thinking that it is a parting gift at first declines to receive it It is pressed upon her she opens the box and sees the reflection of her dirty face Master and man burst out laughing Furious she smears Tarokaja s face with the ink he protests that he is not the author of the trick and the girl flies at her lover and rubs his face too Both master and servant run off pursued by the girl The second farce was shorter than the first and was called The Theft of the Sword A certain gentleman calls his servant Tarokaja and tells him that he is going out for a little diversion Bidding Tarokaja follow him he sets out On their way they meet another gentleman carrying a handsome sword in his hand and going to worship at the Kitano shrine at Kioto Tarokaja points out the beauty of the sword to his master and says what a fine thing it would be if they could manage to obtain possession of it Tarokaja borrows his master s sword and goes up to the stranger whose attention is taken up by looking at the wares set out for sale in a shop Tarokaja lays his hand on the guard of the stranger s sword and the latter drawing it turns round and tries to cut the thief down Tarokaja takes to his heels praying hard that his life may be spared The stranger takes away the sword which Tarokaja has borrowed from his master and goes on his way to the shrine carrying the two swords Tarokaja draws a long breath of relief when he sees that his life is not forfeited but what account is he to give of his master s sword which he has lost There is no help for it he must go back and make a clean breast of it His master is very angry and the two after consulting together await the stranger s return from the shrine The latter makes his appearance and announces that he is going home Tarokaja s master falls upon the stranger from behind and pinions him ordering Tarokaja to fetch a rope and bind him The knave brings the cord but while he is getting it ready the stranger knocks him over with his sword His master calls out to him to get up quickly and bind the gentleman from behind and not from before Tarokaja runs behind the struggling pair but is so clumsy that he slips the noose over his master s head by mistake and drags him down The stranger seeing this runs away laughing with the two swords Tarokaja frightened at his blunder runs off too his master pursuing him off the stage A general run off be it observed something like the spill and pelt scene in an English pantomime is the legitimate and invariable termination of the Kiyogen NOTE ON THE GAME OF FOOTBALL The game of football is in great favour at the Japanese Court The days on which it takes place are carefully noted in the Daijokwan Nishi or Government Gazette On the twenty fifth of February eighteen sixty nine for instance we find two entries The Emperor wrote characters of good omen and The game of football was played at the palace The game was first introduced from China in the year of the Empress Kokiyoku in the middle of the seventh century The Emperor Mommu who reigned at the end of the same century was the first emperor who took part in the sport His Majesty Toba the Second became very expert at it as also did the noble Asukai Chiujo and from that time a sort of football club was formed at the palace During the days of the extreme poverty of the Mikado and his Court the Asukai family notwithstanding their high rank were wont to eke out their scanty income by giving lessons in the art of playing football THE WONDERFUL ADVENTURES OF FUNAKOSHI JIUYEMON The doughty deeds and marvellous experiences of Funakoshi Jiuyemon are perhaps like those of Robin Hood and his Merry Men rather traditional than historical but even if all or part of the deeds which popular belief ascribes to him be false his story conveys a true picture of manners and customs Above all the manner of the vengeance which he wreaked upon the wife who had dishonoured him and upon her lover shows the high importance which the Japanese attach to the sanctity of the marriage tie The fiftieth and fifty first chapters of the Legacy of Iyeyasu already quoted say If a married woman of the agricultural artisan or commercial class shall secretly have intercourse with another man it is not necessary for the husband to enter a complaint against the persons thus confusing the great relation of mankind but he may put them both to death Nevertheless should he slay one of them and spare the other his guilt is the same as that of the unrighteous persons In the event however of advice being sought the parties not having been slain accede to the wishes of the complainant with regard to putting them to death or not Mankind in whose bodies the male and female elements induce a natural desire towards the same object do not look upon such practices with aversion and the adjudication of such cases is a matter of special deliberation and consultation Men and women of the military class are expected to know better than to occasion disturbance by violating existing regulations and such an one breaking the regulations by lewd trifling or illicit intercourse shall at once be punished without deliberation or consultation It is not the same in this case as in that of agriculturists artisans and traders As a criminal offence adultery was according to the ancient laws of Japan punished by crucifixion In more modern times it has been punished by decapitation and the disgraceful exposure of the head after death but if the murder of the injured husband accompany the crime of adultery then the guilty parties are crucified to this day At the present time the husband is no longer allowed to take the law into his own hands he must report the matter to the Government and trust to the State to avenge his honour Sacred as the marriage tie is so long as it lasts the law which cuts it is curiously facile or rather there is no law a man may turn his wife out of doors as it may suit his fancy An example of this practice was shown in the story of The Forty seven Ronins A husband has but to report the matter to his lord and the ceremony of divorce is completed Thus in the days of the Shoguns power a Hatamoto who had divorced his wife reported the matter to the Shogun A Daimio s retainer reports the matter to his Prince The facility of divorce however seems to be but rarely taken advantage of this is probably owing to the practice of keeping concubines It has often been asked Are the Japanese polygamists The answer is Yes and no They marry but one wife but a man may according to his station and means have one or more concubines in addition The Emperor has twelve concubines called Kisaki and Iyeyasu alluding forcibly to excess in this respect as teterrima belli causa laid down that the princes might have eight high officers five and ordinary Samurai two handmaids In the olden times he writes the downfall of castles and the overthrow of kingdoms all proceeded from this alone Why is not the indulgence of passions guarded against The difference between the position of the wife and that of the concubine is marked The legitimate wife is to the handmaid as a lord is to his vassal Concubinage being a legitimate institution the son of a handmaid is no bastard nor is he in any way the child of shame and yet as a general rule the son of the bondwoman is not heir with the son of the free for the son of the wife inherits before the son of a concubine even where the latter be the elder and it frequently happens that a noble having children by his concubines but none by his wife selects a younger brother of his own or even adopts the son of some relative to succeed him in the family honours The family line is considered to be thus more purely preserved The law of succession is however extremely lax Excellent personal merits will sometimes secure to the left handed son the inheritance of his ancestors and it often occurs that the son of a concubine who is debarred from succeeding to his own father is adopted as the heir of a relation or friend of even higher rank When the wife of a noble has a daughter but no son the practice is to adopt a youth of suitable family and age who marries the girl and inherits as a son The principle of adoption is universal among all classes from the Emperor down to his meanest subject nor is the family line considered to have been broken because an adopted son has succeeded to the estates Indeed should a noble die without heir male either begotten or adopted his lands are forfeited to the State It is a matter of care that the person adopted should be himself sprung from a stock of rank suited to that of the family into which he is to be received Sixteen and upwards being considered the marriageable age for a man it is not usual for persons below that age to adopt an heir yet an infant at the point of death may adopt a person older than himself that the family line may not become extinct An account of the marriage ceremony will be found in the Appendix upon the subject In the olden time in the island of Shikoku forty there lived one Funakoshi Jiuyemon a brave Samurai and accomplished man who was in great favour with the prince his master One day at a drinking bout a quarrel sprung up between him and a brother officer which resulted in a duel upon the spot in which Jiuyemon killed his adversary When Jiuyemon awoke to a sense of what he had done he was struck with remorse and he thought to disembowel himself but receiving a private summons from his lord he went to the castle and the prince said to him So it seems that you have been getting drunk and quarrelling and that you have killed one of your friends and now I suppose you will have determined to perform hara kiri It is a great pity and in the face of the laws I can do nothing for you openly Still if you will escape and fly from this part of the country for a while in two years time the affair will have blown over and I will allow you to return Footnote forty Shikoku one of the southern islands separated from the chief island of Japan by the beautiful Inland Sea it is called Shikoku or the Four Provinces because it is divided into the four provinces Awa Sanuki Iyo and Tosa And with these words the prince presented him with a fine sword made by Sukesada forty one and a hundred ounces of silver and having bade him farewell entered his private apartments and Jiuyemon prostrating himself wept tears of gratitude then taking the sword and the money he went home and prepared to fly from the province and secretly took leave of his relations each of whom made him some parting present These gifts together with his own money and what he had received from the prince made up a sum of two hundred and fifty ounces of silver with which and his Sukesada sword he escaped under cover of darkness and went to a sea port called Marugame in the province of Sanuki where he proposed to wait for an opportunity of setting sail for Osaka As ill luck would have it the wind being contrary he had to remain three days idle but at last the wind changed so he went down to the beach thinking that he should certainly find a junk about to sail and as he was looking about him a sailor came up and said If your honour is minded to take a trip to Osaka my ship is bound thither and I should be glad to take you with me as passenger That s exactly what I wanted I will gladly take a passage replied Jiuyemon who was delighted at the chance Footnote forty one Sukesada a famous family of swordsmiths belonging to the Bizen clan The Bizen men are notoriously good armourers and their blades fetch high prices The sword of Jiuyemon is said to have been made by one of the Sukesada who lived about two hundred ninety years ago Well then we must set sail at once so please come on board without delay So Jiuyemon went with him and embarked and as they left the harbour and struck into the open sea the moon was just rising above the eastern hills illumining the dark night like a noonday sun and Jiuyemon taking his place in the bows of the ship stood wrapt in contemplation of the beauty of the scene Illustration JIUYEMON ON BOARD THE PIRATE SHIP Now it happened that the captain of the ship whose name was Akagoshi Kuroyemon was a fierce pirate who attracted by Jiuyemon s well to do appearance had determined to decoy him on board that he might murder and rob him and while Jiuyemon was looking at the moon the pirate and his companions were collected in the stern of the ship taking counsel together in whispers as to how they might slay him He on the other hand having for some time past fancied their conduct somewhat strange bethought him that it was not prudent to lay aside his sword so he went towards the place where he had been sitting and had left his weapon lying to fetch it when he was stopped by three of the pirates who blocked up the gangway saying Stop Sir Samurai Unluckily for you this ship in which you have taken a passage belongs to the pirate Akagoshi Kuroyemon Come sir whatever money you may chance to have about you is our prize When Jiuyemon heard this he was greatly startled at first but soon recovered himself and being an expert wrestler kicked over two of the pirates and made for his sword but in the meanwhile Shichirohei the younger brother of the pirate captain had drawn the sword and brought it towards him saying If you want your sword here it is and with that he cut at him but Jiuyemon avoided the blow and closing with the ruffian got back his sword Ten of the pirates then attacked him with spear and sword but he putting his back against the bows of the ship showed such good fight that he killed three of his assailants and the others stood off not daring to approach him Then the pirate captain Akagoshi Kuroyemon who had been watching the fighting from the stern seeing that his men stood no chance against Jiuyemon s dexterity and that he was only losing them to no purpose thought to shoot him with a matchlock Even Jiuyemon brave as he was lost heart when he saw the captain s gun pointed at him and tried to jump into the sea but one of the pirates made a dash at him with a boat hook and caught him by the sleeve then Jiuyemon in despair took the fine Sukesada sword which he had received from his prince and throwing it at his captor pierced him through the breast so that he fell dead and himself plunging into the sea swam for his life The pirate captain shot at him and missed him and the rest of the crew made every endeavour to seize him with their boat hooks that they might avenge the death of their mates but it was all in vain and Jiuyemon having shaken off his clothes that he might swim the better made good his escape So the pirates threw the bodies of their dead comrades into the sea and the captain was partly consoled for their loss by the possession of the Sukesada sword with which one of them had been transfixed As soon as Jiuyemon jumped over the ship s side being a good swimmer he took a long dive which carried him well out of danger and struck out vigorously and although he was tired and distressed by his exertions he braced himself up to greater energy and faced the waves boldly At last in the far distance to his great joy he spied a light for which he made and found that it was a ship carrying lanterns marked with the badge of the governor of Osaka so he hailed her saying I have fallen into great trouble among pirates pray rescue me Who and what are you shouted an officer some forty years of age My name is Funakoshi Jiuyemon and I have unwittingly fallen in with pirates this night I have escaped so far I pray you save me lest I die Hold on to this and come up replied the other holding out the butt end of a spear to him which he caught hold of and clambered up the ship s side When the officer saw before him a handsome gentleman naked all but his loincloth and with his hair all in disorder he called to his servants to bring some of his own clothes and having dressed him in them said What clan do you belong to sir Sir I am a Ronin and was on my way to Osaka but the sailors of the ship on which I had embarked were pirates and so he told the whole story of the fight and of his escape Well done sir replied the other astonished at his prowess My name is Kajiki Tozayemon at your service I am an officer attached to the governor of Osaka Pray have you any friends in that city No sir I have no friends there but as in two years I shall be able to return to my own country and re enter my lord s service I thought during that time to engage in trade and live as a common wardsman Indeed that s a poor prospect However if you will allow me I will do all that is in my power to assist you Pray excuse the liberty I am taking in making such a proposal Jiuyemon warmly thanked Kajiki Tozayemon for his kindness and so they reached Osaka without further adventures Jiuyemon who had secreted in his girdle the two hundred and fifty ounces which he had brought with him from home bought a small house and started in trade as a vendor of perfumes tooth powder combs and other toilet articles and Kajiki Tozayemon who treated him with great kindness and rendered him many services prompted him as he was a single man to take to himself a wife Acting upon this advice he married a singing girl called O Hiyaku forty two Footnote forty two The O before women s names signifies Imperial and is simply an honorific Now this O Hiyaku although at first she seemed very affectionately disposed towards Jiuyemon had been during the time that she was a singer a woman of bad and profligate character and at this time there was in Osaka a certain wrestler named Takasegawa Kurobei a very handsome man with whom O Hiyaku fell desperately in love so that at last being by nature a passionate woman she became unfaithful to Jiuyemon The latter little suspecting that anything was amiss was in the habit of spending his evenings at the house of his patron Kajiki Tozayemon whose son a youth of eighteen named Tonoshin conceived a great friendship for Jiuyemon and used constantly to invite him to play a game at checkers and it was on these occasions that O Hiyaku profiting by her husband s absence used to arrange her meetings with the wrestler Takasegawa One evening when Jiuyemon as was his wont had gone out to play at checkers with Kajiki Tonoshin O Hiyaku took advantage of the occasion to go and fetch the wrestler and invite him to a little feast and as they were enjoying themselves over their wine O Hiyaku said to him Ah Master Takasegawa how wonderfully chance favours us and how pleasant these stolen interviews are How much nicer still it would be if we could only be married But as long as Jiuyemon is in the way it is impossible and that is my one cause of distress It s no use being in such a hurry If you only have patience we shall be able to marry sure enough What you have got to look out for now is that Jiuyemon does not find out what we are about I suppose there is no chance of his coming home to night is there Oh dear no You need not be afraid He is gone to Kajiki s house to play checkers so he is sure to spend the night there And so the guilty couple went on gossiping with their minds at ease until at last they dropped off asleep In the meanwhile Jiuyemon in the middle of his game at checkers was seized with a sudden pain in his stomach and said to Kajiki Tonoshin Young sir I feel an unaccountable pain in my stomach I think I had better go home before it gets worse That is a bad job Wait a little and I will give you some physic but at any rate you had better spend the night here Many thanks for your kindness replied Jiuyemon but I had rather go home So he took his leave and went off to his own house bearing the pain as best he might When he arrived in front of his own door he tried to open it but the lock was fastened and he could not get in so he rapped violently at the shutters to try and awaken his wife When O Hiyaku heard the noise she woke with a start and roused the wrestler saying to him in a whisper Get up get up Jiuyemon has come back You must hide as fast as possible Oh dear oh dear said the wrestler in a great fright here s a pretty mess Where on earth shall I hide myself and he stumbled about in every direction looking for a hiding place but found none Jiuyemon seeing that his wife did not come to open the door got impatient at last and forced it open by unfixing the sliding shutter and entering the house found himself face to face with his wife and her lover who were both in such confusion that they did not know what to do Jiuyemon however took no notice of them but lit his pipe and sat smoking and watching them in silence At last the wrestler Takasegawa broke the silence by saying I thought sir that I should be sure to have the pleasure of finding you at home this evening so I came out to call upon you When I got here the Lady O Hiyaku was so kind as to offer me some wine and I drank a little more than was good for me so that it got into my head and I fell asleep I must really apologize for having taken such a liberty in your absence but indeed although appearances are against us there has been nothing wrong Certainly said O Hiyaku coming to her lover s support Master Takasegawa is not at all to blame It was I who invited him to drink wine so I hope you will excuse him Jiuyemon sat pondering the matter over in his mind for a moment and then said to the wrestler You say that you are innocent but of course that is a lie It s no use trying to conceal your fault However next year I shall in all probability return to my own country and then you may take O Hiyaku and do what you will with her far be it from me to care what becomes of a woman with such a stinking heart When the wrestler and O Hiyaku heard Jiuyemon say this quite quietly they could not speak but held their peace for very shame Here you Takasegawa pursued he you may stop here to night if you like it and go home to morrow Thank you sir replied the wrestler I am much obliged to you but the fact is that I have some pressing business in another part of the town so with your permission I will take my leave and so he went out covered with confusion As for the faithless wife O Hiyaku she was in great agitation expecting to be severely reprimanded at least but Jiuyemon took no notice of her and showed no anger only from that day forth although she remained in his house as his wife he separated himself from her entirely Matters went on in this way for some time until at last one fine day O Hiyaku looking out of doors saw the wrestler Takasegawa passing in the street so she called out to him Dear me Master Takasegawa can that be you What a long time it is since we have met Pray come in and have a chat Thank you I am much obliged to you but as I do not like the sort of scene we had the other day I think I had rather not accept your invitation Pray do not talk in such a cowardly manner Next year when Jiuyemon goes back to his own country he is sure to give me this house and then you and I can marry and live as happily as possible I don t like being in too great a hurry to accept fair offers forty three Footnote forty three The original is a proverbial expression like Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes Nonsense There s no need for showing such delicacy about accepting what is given you And as she spoke she caught the wrestler by the hand and led him into the house After they had talked together for some time she said Listen to me Master Takasegawa I have been thinking over all this for some time and I see no help for it but to kill Jiuyemon and make an end of him What do you want to do that for As long as he is alive we cannot be married What I propose is that you should buy some poison and I will put it secretly into his food When he is dead we can be happy to our hearts content At first Takasegawa was startled and bewildered by the audacity of their scheme but forgetting the gratitude which he owed to Jiuyemon for sparing his life on the previous occasion he replied Well I think it can be managed I have a friend who is a physician so I will get him to compound some poison for me and will send it to you You must look out for a moment when your husband is not on his guard and get him to take it Having agreed upon this Takasegawa went away and having employed a physician to make up the poison sent it to O Hiyaku in a letter suggesting that the poison should be mixed up with a sort of macaroni of which Jiuyemon was very fond Having read the letter she put it carefully away in a drawer of her cupboard and waited until Jiuyemon should express a wish to eat some macaroni One day towards the time of the New Year when O Hiyaku had gone out to a party with a few of her friends it happened that Jiuyemon being alone in the house was in want of some little thing and failing to find it anywhere at last bethought himself to look for it in O Hiyaku s cupboard and as he was searching amongst the odds and ends which it contained he came upon the fatal letter When he read the scheme for putting poison in his macaroni he was taken aback and said to himself When I caught those two beasts in their wickedness I spared them because their blood would have defiled my sword and now they are not even grateful for my mercy Their crime is beyond all power of language to express and I will kill them together So he put back the letter in its place and waited for his wife to come home So soon as she made her appearance he said You have come home early O Hiyaku I feel very dull and lonely this evening let us have a little wine And as he spoke without any semblance of anger it never entered O Hiyaku s mind that he had seen the letter so she went about her household duties with a quiet mind The following evening as Jiuyemon was sitting in his shop casting up his accounts with his counting board forty four in his hand Takasegawa passed by and Jiuyemon called out to him saying Well met Takasegawa I was just thinking of drinking a cup of wine to night but I have no one to keep me company and it is dull work drinking alone Pray come in and drink a bout with me Footnote forty four The abacus or counting board is the means of calculation in use throughout the Continent from saint Petersburg to Peking in Corea Japan and the Liukiu Islands Thank you sir I shall have much pleasure replied the wrestler who little expected what the other was aiming at and so he went in and they began to drink and feast It s very cold to night said Jiuyemon after a while suppose we warm up a little macaroni and eat it nice and hot Perhaps however you do not like it Indeed I am very fond of it on the contrary That is well O Hiyaku please go and buy a little for us Directly replied his wife who hurried off to buy the paste delighted at the opportunity for carrying out her murderous design upon her husband As soon she had prepared it she poured it into bowls and set it before the two men but into her husband s bowl only she put poison Jiuyemon who well knew what she had done did not eat the mess at once but remained talking about this that and the other and the wrestler out of politeness was obliged to wait also All of a sudden Jiuyemon cried out Dear me whilst we have been gossiping the macaroni has been getting cold Let us put it all together and warm it up again As no one has put his lips to his bowl yet it will all be clean so none need be wasted And with these words he took the macaroni that was in the three bowls and pouring it altogether into an iron pot boiled it up again This time Jiuyemon served out the food himself and setting it before his wife and the wrestler said There make haste and eat it up before it gets cold Jiuyemon of course did not eat any of the mess and the would be murderers knowing that sufficient poison had been originally put into Jiuyemon s bowl to kill them all three and that now the macaroni having been well mixed up would all be poisoned were quite taken aback and did not know what to do Come make haste or it will be quite cold You said you liked it so I sent to buy it on purpose O Hiyaku come and make a hearty meal I will eat some presently At this the pair looked very foolish and knew not what to answer at last the wrestler got up and said I do not feel quite well I must beg to take my leave and if you will allow me I will come and accept your hospitality to morrow instead Dear me I am sorry to hear you are not well However O Hiyaku there will be all the more macaroni for you As for O Hiyaku she put a bold face upon the matter and replied that she had supped already and had no appetite for any more Then Jiuyemon looking at them both with a scornful smile said It seems that you neither of you care to eat this macaroni however as you Takasegawa are unwell I will give you some excellent medicine and going to the cupboard he drew out the letter and laid it before the wrestler When O Hiyaku and the wrestler saw that their wicked schemes had been brought to light they were struck dumb with shame Takasegawa seeing that denial was useless drew his dirk and cut at Jiuyemon but he being nimble and quick dived under the wrestler s arm and seizing his right hand from behind tightened his grasp upon it until it became numbed and the dirk fell to the ground for powerful man as the wrestler was he was no match for Jiuyemon who held him in so fast a grip that he could not move Then Jiuyemon took the dirk which had fallen to the ground and said Oh I thought that you being a wrestler would at least be a strong man and that there would be some pleasure in fighting you but I see that you are but a poor feckless creature after all It would have defiled my sword to have killed such an ungrateful hound with it but luckily here is your own dirk and I will slay you with that Takasegawa struggled to escape but in vain and O Hiyaku seizing a large kitchen knife attacked Jiuyemon but he furious kicked her in the loins so violently that she fell powerless then brandishing the dirk he cleft the wrestler from the shoulder down to the nipple of his breast and the big man fell in his agony O Hiyaku seeing this tried to fly but Jiuyemon seizing her by the hair of the head stabbed her in the bosom and placing her by her lover s side gave her the death blow Illustration JIUYEMON PUNISHES HIS WIFE AND THE WRESTLER On the following day he sent in a report of what he had done to the governor of Osaka and buried the corpses and from that time forth he remained a single man and pursued his trade as a seller of perfumery and such like wares and his leisure hours he continued to spend as before at the house of his patron Kajiki Tozayemon One day when Jiuyemon went to call upon Kajiki Tozayemon he was told by the servant maid who met him at the door that her master was out but that her young master Tonoshin was at home so saying that he would go in and pay his respects to the young gentleman he entered the house and as he suddenly pushed open the sliding door of the room in which Tonoshin was sitting the latter gave a great start and his face turned pale and ghastly How now young sir said Jiuyemon laughing at him surely you are not such a coward as to be afraid because the sliding doors are opened That is not the way in which a brave Samurai should behave Really I am quite ashamed of myself replied the other blushing at the reproof but the fact is that I had some reason for being startled Listen to me Sir Jiuyemon and I will tell you all about it To day when I went to the academy to study there were a great number of my fellow students gathered together and one of them said that a ruinous old shrine about two miles and a half to the east of this place was the nightly resort of all sorts of hobgoblins who have been playing pranks and bewitching the people for some time past and he proposed that we should all draw lots and that the one upon whom the lot fell should go to night and exorcise those evil beings and further that as a proof of his having gone he should write his name upon a pillar in the shrine All the rest agreed that this would be very good sport so I not liking to appear a coward consented to take my chance with the rest and as ill luck would have it the lot fell upon me I was thinking over this as you came in and so it was that when you suddenly opened the door I could not help giving a start If you only think for a moment said Jiuyemon you will see that there is nothing to fear How can beasts forty five and hobgoblins exercise any power over men However do not let the matter trouble you I will go in your place to night and see if I cannot get the better of these goblins if any there be having done which I will write your name upon the pillar so that everybody may think that you have been there Footnote forty five Foxes badgers and cats See the stories respecting their tricks Oh thank you that will indeed be a service You can dress yourself up in my clothes and nobody will be the wiser I shall be truly grateful to you So Jiuyemon having gladly undertaken the job as soon as the night set in made his preparations and went to the place indicated an uncanny looking tumble down lonely old shrine all overgrown with moss and rank vegetation However Jiuyemon who was afraid of nothing cared little for the appearance of the place and having made himself as comfortable as he could in so dreary a spot sat down on the floor lit his pipe and kept a sharp look out for the goblins He had not been waiting long before he saw a movement among the bushes and presently he was surrounded by a host of elfish looking creatures of all shapes and kinds who came and made hideous faces at him Jiuyemon quietly knocked the ashes out of his pipe and then jumping up kicked over first one and then another of the elves until several of them lay sprawling in the grass and the rest made off greatly astonished at this unexpected reception When Jiuyemon took his lantern and examined the fallen goblins attentively he saw that they were all Tonoshin s fellow students who had painted their faces and made themselves hideous to frighten their companion whom they knew to be a coward all they got for their pains however was a good kicking from Jiuyemon who left them groaning over their sore bones and went home chuckling to himself at the result of the adventure Illustration FUNAKOSHI JIUYEMON AND THE GOBLINS The fame of this exploit soon became noised about Osaka so that all men praised Jiuyemon s courage and shortly after this he was elected chief of the Otokodate forty six or friendly society of the wardsmen and busied himself no longer with his trade but lived on the contributions of his numerous apprentices Footnote forty six See the Introduction to the Story of Chobei of Bandzuin Now Kajiki Tonoshin was in love with a singing girl named Kashiku upon whom he was in the habit of spending a great deal of money She however cared nothing for him for she had a sweetheart named Hichirobei whom she used to contrive to meet secretly although in order to support her parents she was forced to become the mistress of Tonoshin One evening when the latter was on guard at the office of his chief the Governor of Osaka Kashiku sent word privately to Hichirobei summoning him to go to her house as the coast would be clear While the two were making merry over a little feast Tonoshin who had persuaded a friend to take his duty for him on the plea of urgent business knocked at the door and Kashiku in a great fright hid her lover in a long clothes box and went to let in Tonoshin who on entering the room and seeing the litter of the supper lying about looked more closely and perceived a man s sandals on which by the light of a candle he saw the figure seven forty seven Tonoshin had heard some ugly reports of Kashiku s proceedings with this man Hichirobei and when he saw this proof before his eyes he grew very angry but he suppressed his feelings and pointing to the wine cups and bowls said Whom have you been feasting with to night Oh replied Kashiku who notwithstanding her distress was obliged to invent an answer I felt so dull all alone here that I asked an old woman from next door to come in and drink a cup of wine with me and have a chat Footnote forty seven Hichi the first half of Hichirobei signifies seven All this while Tonoshin was looking for the hidden lover but as he could not see him he made up his mind that Kashiku must have let him out by the back door so he secreted one of the sandals in his sleeve as evidence and without seeming to suspect anything said Well I shall be very busy this evening so I must go home Oh won t you stay a little while It is very dull here when I am all alone without you Pray stop and keep me company But Tonoshin made no reply and went home Then Kashiku saw that one of the sandals was missing and felt certain that he must have carried it off as proof so she went in great trouble to open the lid of the box and let out Hichirobei When the two lovers talked over the matter they agreed that as they both were really in love let Tonoshin kill them if he would they would gladly die together they would enjoy the present let the future take care of itself The following morning Kashiku sent a messenger to Tonoshin to implore his pardon and he being infatuated by the girl s charms forgave her and sent a present of thirty ounces of silver to her lover Hichirobei on the condition that he was never to see her again but in spite of this Kashiku and Hichirobei still continued their secret meetings It happened that Hichirobei who was a gambler by profession had an elder brother called Chobei who kept a wine shop in the Ajikawa Street at Osaka so Tonoshin thought that he could not do better than depute Jiuyemon to go and seek out this man Chobei and urge him to persuade his younger brother to give up his relations with Kashiku acting upon this resolution he went to call upon Jiuyemon and said to him Sir Jiuyemon I have a favour to ask of you in connection with that girl Kashiku whom you know all about You are aware that I paid thirty ounces of silver to her lover Hichirobei to induce him to give up going to her house but in spite of this I cannot help suspecting that they still meet one another It seems that this Hichirobei has an elder brother one Chobei now if you would go to this man and tell him to reprove his brother for his conduct you would be doing me a great service You have so often stood my friend that I venture to pray you to oblige me in this matter although I feel that I am putting you to great inconvenience Jiuyemon out of gratitude for the kindness which he had received at the hands of Kajiki Tozayemon was always willing to serve Tonoshin so he went at once to find out Chobei and said to him My name sir is Jiuyemon at your service and I have come to beg your assistance in a matter of some delicacy What can I do to oblige you sir replied Chobei who felt bound to be more than usually civil as his visitor was the chief of the Otokodate It is a small matter sir said Jiuyemon Your younger brother Hichirobei is intimate with a woman named Kashiku whom he meets in secret Now this Kashiku is the mistress of the son of a gentleman to whom I am under great obligation he bought her of her parents for a large sum of money and besides this he paid your brother thirty ounces of silver some time since on condition of his separating himself from the girl in spite of this it appears that your brother continues to see her and I have come to beg that you will remonstrate with your brother on his conduct and make him give her up That I certainly will Pray do not be uneasy I will soon find means to put a stop to my brother s bad behaviour And so they went on talking of one thing and another until Jiuyemon whose eyes had been wandering about the room spied out a very long dirk lying on a cupboard and all at once it occurred to him that this was the very sword which had been a parting gift to him from his lord the hilt the mountings and the tip of the scabbard were all the same only the blade had been shortened and made into a long dirk Then he looked more attentively at Chobei s features and saw that he was no other than Akagoshi Kuroyemon the pirate chief Two years had passed by but he could not forget that face Jiuyemon would have liked to have arrested him at once but thinking that it would be a pity to give so vile a robber a chance of escape he constrained himself and taking his leave went straightway and reported the matter to the Governor of Osaka When the officers of justice heard of the prey that awaited them they made their preparations forthwith Three men of the secret police went to Chobei s wine shop and having called for wine pretended to get up a drunken brawl and as Chobei went up to them and tried to pacify them one of the policemen seized hold of him and another tried to pinion him It at once flashed across Chobei s mind that his old misdeeds had come to light at last so with a desperate effort he shook off the two policemen and knocked them down and rushing into the inner room seized the famous Sukesada sword and sprang upstairs The three policemen never thinking that he could escape mounted the stairs close after him but Chobei with a terrible cut cleft the front man s head in sunder and the other two fell back appalled at their comrade s fate Then Chobei climbed on to the roof and looking out perceived that the house was surrounded on all sides by armed men Seeing this he made up his mind that his last moment was come but at any rate he determined to sell his life dearly and to die fighting so he stood up bravely when one of the officers coming up from the roof of a neighbouring house attacked him with a spear and at the same time several other soldiers clambered up Chobei seeing that he was overmatched jumped down and before the soldiers below had recovered from their surprise he had dashed through their ranks laying about him right and left and cutting down three men At top speed he fled with his pursuers close behind him and seeing the broad river ahead of him jumped into a small boat that lay moored there of which the boatmen frightened at the sight of his bloody sword left him in undisputed possession Chobei pushed off and sculled vigorously into the middle of the river and the officers there being no other boat near were for a moment baffled One of them however rushing down the river bank hid himself on a bridge armed with a spear and lay in wait for Chobei to pass in his boat but when the little boat came up he missed his aim and only scratched Chobei s elbow and he seizing the spear dragged down his adversary into the river and killed him as he was struggling in the water then sculling for his life he gradually drew near to the sea The other officers in the mean time had secured ten boats and having come up with Chobei surrounded him but he having formerly been a pirate was far better skilled in the management of a boat than his pursuers and had no great difficulty in eluding them so at last he pushed out to sea to the great annoyance of the officers who followed him closely Then Jiuyemon who had come up said to one of the officers on the shore Have you caught him yet No the fellow is so brave and so cunning that our men can do nothing with him He s a determined ruffian certainly However as the fellow has got my sword I mean to get it back by fair means or foul will you allow me to undertake the job of seizing him Well you may try and you will have officers to assist you if you are in peril Jiuyemon having received this permission stripped off his clothes and jumped into the sea carrying with him a policeman s mace to the great astonishment of all the bystanders When he got near Chobei s boat he dived and came up alongside without the pirate perceiving him until he had clambered into the boat Chobei had the good Sukesada sword and Jiuyemon was armed with nothing but a mace but Chobei on the other hand was exhausted with his previous exertions and was taken by surprise at a moment when he was thinking of nothing but how he should scull away from the pursuing boats so it was not long before Jiuyemon mastered and secured him For this feat besides recovering his Sukesada sword Jiuyemon received many rewards and great praise from the Governor of Osaka But the pirate Chobei was cast into prison Hichirobei when he heard of his brother s capture was away from home but seeing that he too would be sought for he determined to escape to Yedo at once and travelled along the Tokaido the great highroad as far as Kuana But the secret police had got wind of his movements and one of them was at his heels disguised as a beggar and waiting for an opportunity to seize him Hichirobei in the meanwhile was congratulating himself on his escape and little suspecting that he would be in danger so far away from Osaka he went to a house of pleasure intending to divert himself at his ease The policeman seeing this went to the master of the house and said The guest who has just come in is a notorious thief and I am on his track waiting to arrest him Do you watch for the moment when he falls asleep and let me know Should he escape the blame will fall upon you The master of the house who was greatly taken aback consented of course so he told the woman of the house to hide Hichirobei s dirk and as soon as the latter wearied with his journey had fallen asleep he reported it to the policeman who went upstairs and having bound Hichirobei as he lay wrapped up in his quilt led him back to Osaka to be imprisoned with his brother When Kashiku became aware of her lover s arrest she felt certain that it was the handiwork of Jiuyemon so she determined to kill him were it only that she might die with Hichirobei So hiding a kitchen knife in the bosom of her dress she went at midnight to Jiuyemon s house and looked all round to see if there were no hole or cranny by which she might slip in unobserved but every door was carefully closed so she was obliged to knock at the door and feign an excuse Let me in let me in I am a servant maid in the house of Kajiki Tozayemon and am charged with a letter on most pressing business to Sir Jiuyemon Hearing this one of Jiuyemon s servants thinking her tale was true rose and opened the door and Kashiku stabbing him in the face ran past him into the house Inside she met another apprentice who had got up aroused by the noise him too she stabbed in the belly but as he fell he cried out to Jiuyemon saying Father father forty eight take care Some murderous villain has broken into the house Footnote forty eight The apprentice addresses his patron as father Illustration GOKUMON And Kashiku desperate stopped his further utterance by cutting his throat Jiuyemon hearing his apprentice cry out jumped up and lighting his night lamp looked about him in the half gloom and saw Kashiku with the bloody knife hunting for him that she might kill him Springing upon her before she saw him he clutched her right hand and having secured her bound her with cords so that she could not move As soon as he had recovered from his surprise he looked about him and searched the house when to his horror he found one of his apprentices dead and the other lying bleeding from a frightful gash across the face With the first dawn of day he reported the affair to the proper authorities and gave Kashiku in custody So after due examination the two pirate brothers and the girl Kashiku were executed and their heads were exposed together forty nine Footnote forty nine The exposure of the head called Gokumon is a disgraceful addition to the punishment of beheading A document placed on the execution ground sets forth the crime which has called forth the punishment Now the fame of all the valiant deeds of Jiuyemon having reached his own country his lord ordered that he should be pardoned for his former offence and return to his allegiance so after thanking Kajiki Tozayemon for the manifold favours which he had received at his hands he went home and became a Samurai as before The fat wrestlers of Japan whose heavy paunches and unwieldy puffy limbs however much they may be admired by their own country people form a striking contrast to our Western notions of training have attracted some attention from travellers and those who are interested in athletic sports may care to learn something about them The first historical record of wrestling occurs in the sixth year of the Emperor Suinin twenty four B C when one Taima no Kehaya a noble of great stature and strength boasting that there was not his match under heaven begged the Emperor that his strength might be put to the test The Emperor accordingly caused the challenge to be proclaimed and one Nomi no Shikune answered it and having wrestled with Kehaya kicked him in the ribs and broke his bones so that he died After this Shikune was promoted to high office and became further famous in Japanese history as having substituted earthen images for the living men who before his time used to be buried with the coffin of the Mikado In the year A D eight hundred fifty eight the throne of Japan was wrestled for The Emperor Buntoku had two sons called Koreshito and Koretaka both of whom aspired to the throne Their claims were decided in a wrestling match in which one Yoshiro was the champion of Koreshito and Natora the champion of Koretaka Natora having been defeated Koreshito ascended his father s throne under the style of Seiwa In the eighth century when Nara was the capital of Japan the Emperor Shomu instituted wrestling as part of the ceremonies of the autumn festival of the Five Grains or Harvest Home and as the year proved a fruitful one the custom was continued as auspicious The strong men of the various provinces were collected and one Kiyobayashi was proclaimed the champion of Japan Many a brave and stout man tried a throw with him but none could master him Rules of the ring were now drawn up and in order to prevent disputes Kiyobayashi was appointed by the Emperor to be the judge of wrestling matches and was presented as a badge of his office with a fan upon which were inscribed the words the Prince of Lions The wrestlers were divided into wrestlers of the eastern and of the western provinces Omi being taken as the centre province The eastern wrestlers wore in their hair the badge of the hollyhock the western wrestlers took for their sign the gourd flower Hence the passage leading up to the wrestling stage was called the Flower Path Forty eight various falls were fixed upon as fair twelve throws twelve lifts twelve twists and twelve throws over the back All other throws not included in these were foul and it was the duty of the umpire to see that no unlawful tricks were resorted to It was decided that the covered stage should be composed of sixteen rice bales in the shape of one huge bale supported by four pillars at the four points of the compass each pillar being painted a different colour thus together with certain paper pendants making up five colours to symbolize the Five Grains Illustration CHAMPION WRESTLER The civil wars by which the country was disturbed for a while put a stop to the practice of wrestling but when peace was restored it was proposed to re establish the athletic games and the umpire Kiyobayashi the Prince of Lions was sought for but he had died or disappeared and could not be found and there was no umpire forthcoming The various provinces were searched for a man who might fill his place and one Yoshida Iyetsugu a Ronin of the province of Echizen being reported to be well versed in the noble science was sent for to the capital and proved to be a pupil of Kiyobayashi The Emperor having approved him ordered that the fan of the Prince of Lions should be made over to him and gave him the title of Bungo no Kami and commanded that his name in the ring should be Oi Kaze the Driving Wind Further as a sign that there should not be two styles of wrestling a second fan was given to him bearing the inscription A single flavour is a beautiful custom The right of acting as umpire in wrestling matches was vested in his family that the Driving Wind might for future generations preside over athletic sports In ancient days the prizes for the three champion wrestlers were a bow a bowstring and an arrow these are still brought into the ring and at the end of the bout the successful competitors go through a variety of antics with them To the champion wrestlers to two or three men only in a generation the family of the Driving Wind awards the privilege of wearing a rope girdle In the time of the Shogunate these champions used to wrestle before the Shogun At the beginning of the seventeenth century A D sixteen oh six wrestling matches as forming a regular part of a religious ceremony were discontinued They are still held however at the shrines of Kamo at Kioto and of Kasuga in Yamato They are also held at Kamakura every year and at the shrines of the patron saints of the various provinces in imitation of the ancient customs In the year sixteen twenty three one Akashi Shiganosuke obtained leave from the Government to hold public wrestling matches in the streets of Yedo In the year sixteen forty four was held the first wrestling match for the purpose of raising a collection for building a temple This was done by the priests of Kofukuji in Yamashiro In the year sixteen sixty the same expedient was resorted to in Yedo and the custom of getting up wrestling matches for the benefit of temple funds holds good to this day The following graphic description of a Japanese wrestling match is translated from the Yedo Hanjoki From daybreak till eight in the morning a drum is beaten to announce that there will be wrestling The spectators rise early for the sight The adversaries having been settled the wrestlers enter the ring from the east and from the west Tall stalwart men are they with sinews and bones of iron Like the Gods Nio fifty they stand with their arms akimbo and facing one another they crouch in their strength The umpire watches until the two men draw their breath at the same time and with his fan gives the signal They jump up and close with one another like tigers springing on their prey or dragons playing with a ball Each is bent on throwing the other by twisting or by lifting him It is no mere trial of brute strength it is a tussle of skill against skill Each of the forty eight throws is tried in turn From left to right and from right to left the umpire hovers about watching for the victory to declare itself Some of the spectators back the east others back the west The patrons of the ring are so excited that they feel the strength tingling within them they clench their fists and watch their men without so much as blinking their eyes At last one man east or west gains the advantage and the umpire lifts his fan in token of victory The plaudits of the bystanders shake the neighbourhood and they throw their clothes or valuables into the ring to be redeemed afterwards in money nay in his excitement a man will even tear off his neighbour s jacket and throw it in Footnote fifty The Japanese Gog and Magog Illustration A WRESTLING MATCH Before beginning their tussle the wrestlers work up their strength by stamping their feet and slapping their huge thighs This custom is derived from the following tale of the heroic or mythological age After the seven ages of the heavenly gods came the reign of Tensho Daijin the Sun Goddess and first Empress of Japan Her younger brother Sosanoeo no Mikoto was a mighty and a brave hero but turbulent and delighted in hunting the deer and the boar After killing these beasts he would throw their dead bodies into the sacred hall of his sister and otherwise defile her dwelling When he had done this several times his sister was angry and hid in the cave called the Rock Gate of Heaven and when her face was not seen there was no difference between the night and the day The heroes who served her mourning over this went to seek her but she placed a huge stone in front of the cave and would not come forth The heroes seeing this consulted together and danced and played antics before the cave to lure her out Tempted by curiosity to see the sight she opened the gate a little and peeped out Then the hero Tajikarao or Great Strength clapping his hands and stamping his feet with a great effort grasped and threw down the stone door and the heroes fetched back the Sun Goddess fifty one As Tajikarao is the patron god of Strength wrestlers on entering the ring still commemorate his deed by clapping their hands and stamping their feet as a preparation for putting forth their strength Footnote fifty one The author of the history called Kokushi Riyaku explains this fable as being an account of the first eclipse The great Daimios are in the habit of attaching wrestlers to their persons and assigning to them a yearly portion of rice It is usual for these athletes to take part in funeral or wedding processions and to escort the princes on journeys The rich wardsmen or merchants give money to their favourite wrestlers and invite them to their houses to drink wine and feast Though low vulgar fellows they are allowed something of the same familiarity which is accorded to prize fighters jockeys and the like by their patrons in our own country The Japanese wrestlers appear to have no regular system of training they harden their naturally powerful limbs by much beating and by butting at wooden posts with their shoulders Their diet is stronger than that of the ordinary Japanese who rarely touch meat THE ETA MAIDEN AND THE HATAMOTO It will be long before those who were present at the newly opened port of Kobe on the fourth of February eighteen sixty eight will forget that day The civil war was raging and the foreign Legations warned by the flames of burning villages no less than by the flight of the Shogun and his ministers had left Osaka to take shelter at Kobe where they were not as at the former place separated from their ships by more than twenty miles of road occupied by armed troops in a high state of excitement with the alternative of crossing in tempestuous weather a dangerous bar which had already taken much valuable life It was a fine winter s day and the place was full of bustle and of the going and coming of men busy with the care of housing themselves and their goods and chattels All of a sudden a procession of armed men belonging to the Bizen clan was seen to leave the town and to advance along the high road leading to Osaka and without apparent reason it was said afterwards that two Frenchmen had crossed the line of march there was a halt a stir and a word of command given Then the little clouds of white smoke puffed up and the sharp ping of the rifle bullets came whizzing over the open space destined for a foreign settlement as fast as the repeating breech loaders could be discharged Happily the practice was very bad for had the men of Bizen been good shots almost all the principal foreign officials in the country besides many merchants and private gentlemen must have been killed as it was only two or three men were wounded If they were bad marksmen however they were mighty runners for they soon found that they had attacked a hornets nest In an incredibly short space of time the guards of the different Legations and the sailors and marines from the ships of war were in hot chase after the enemy who were scampering away over the hills as fast as their legs could carry them leaving their baggage ingloriously scattered over the road as many a cheap lacquered hat and flimsy paper cartridge box preserved by our Blue Jackets as trophies will testify So good was the stampede that the enemy s loss amounted only to one aged coolie who being too decrepit to run was taken prisoner after having had seventeen revolver shots fired at him without effect and the only injury that our men inflicted was upon a solitary old woman who was accidently shot through the leg If it had not been for the serious nature of the offence given which was an attack upon the flags of all the treaty Powers and for the terrible retribution which was of necessity exacted the whole affair would have been recollected chiefly for the ludicrous events which it gave rise to The mounted escort of the British Legation executed a brilliant charge of cavalry down an empty road a very pretty line of skirmishers along the fields fired away a great deal of ammunition with no result earthworks were raised and Kobe was held in military occupation for three days during which there were alarms cutting out expeditions with armed boats steamers seized and all kinds of martial effervescence In fact it was like fox hunting it had all the excitement of war with only ten per cent of the danger The first thought of the kind hearted doctor of the British Legation was for the poor old woman who had been wounded and was bemoaning herself piteously When she was carried in a great difficulty arose which I need hardly say was overcome for the poor old creature belonged to the Etas the Pariah race whose presence pollutes the house even of the poorest and humblest Japanese and the native servants strongly objected to her being treated as a human being saying that the Legation would be for ever defiled if she were admitted within its sacred precincts No account of Japanese society would be complete without a notice of the Etas and the following story shows well I think the position which they hold Their occupation is to slay beasts work leather attend upon criminals and do other degrading work Several accounts are given of their origin the most probable of which is that when Buddhism the tenets of which forbid the taking of life was introduced those who lived by the infliction of death became accursed in the land their trade being made hereditary as was the office of executioner in some European countries Another story is that they are the descendants of the Tartar invaders left behind by Kublai Khan Some further facts connected with the Etas are given in a note at the end of the tale Once upon a time some two hundred years ago there lived at a place called Honjo in Yedo a Hatamoto named Takoji Genzaburo his age was about twenty four or twenty five and he was of extraordinary personal beauty His official duties made it incumbent on him to go to the Castle by way of the Adzuma Bridge and here it was that a strange adventure befel him There was a certain Eta who used to earn his living by going out every day to the Adzuma Bridge and mending the sandals of the passers by Whenever Genzaburo crossed the bridge the Eta used always to bow to him This struck him as rather strange but one day when Genzaburo was out alone without any retainers following him and was passing the Adzuma Bridge the thong of his sandal suddenly broke this annoyed him very much however he recollected the Eta cobbler who always used to bow to him so regularly so he went to the place where he usually sat and ordered him to mend his sandal saying to him Tell me why it is that every time that I pass by this bridge you salute me so respectfully Illustration GENZABURO S MEETING WITH THE ETA MAIDEN When the Eta heard this he was put out of countenance and for a while he remained silent but at last taking courage he said to Genzaburo Sir having been honoured with your commands I am quite put to shame I was originally a gardener and used to go to your honour s house and lend a hand in trimming up the garden In those days your honour was very young and I myself little better than a child and so I used to play with your honour and received many kindnesses at your hands My name sir is Chokichi Since those days I have fallen by degrees info dissolute habits and little by little have sunk to be the vile thing that you now see me When Genzaburo heard this he was very much surprised and recollecting his old friendship for his playmate was filled with pity and said Surely surely you have fallen very low Now all you have to do is to presevere and use your utmost endeavours to find a means of escape from the class into which you have fallen and become a wardsman again Take this sum small as it is let it be a foundation for more to you And with these words he took ten riyos out of his pouch and handed them to Chokichi who at first refused to accept the present but when it was pressed upon him received it with thanks Genzaburo was leaving him to go home when two wandering singing girls came up and spoke to Chokichi so Genzaburo looked to see what the two women were like One was a woman of some twenty years of age and the other was a peerlessly beautiful girl of sixteen she was neither too fat nor too thin neither too tall nor too short her face was oval like a melon seed and her complexion fair and white her eyes were narrow and bright her teeth small and even her nose was aquiline and her mouth delicately formed with lovely red lips her eyebrows were long and fine she had a profusion of long black hair she spoke modestly with a soft sweet voice and when she smiled two lovely dimples appeared in her cheeks in all her movements she was gentle and refined Genzaburo fell in love with her at first sight and she seeing what a handsome man he was equally fell in love with him so that the woman that was with her perceiving that they were struck with one another led her away as fast as possible Genzaburo remained as one stupefied and turning to Chokichi said Are you acquainted with those two women who came up just now Sir replied Chokichi those are two women of our people The elder woman is called O Kuma and the girl who is only sixteen years old is named O Koyo She is the daughter of one Kihachi a chief of the Etas She is a very gentle girl besides being so exceedingly pretty and all our people are loud in her praise When he heard this Genzaburo remained lost in thought for a while and then said to Chokichi I want you to do something for me Are you prepared to serve me in whatever respect I may require you Chokichi answered that he was prepared to do anything in his power to oblige his honour Upon this Genzaburo smiled and said Well then I am willing to employ you in a certain matter but as there are a great number of passers by here I will go and wait for you in a tea house at Hanakawado and when you have finished your business here you can join me and I will speak to you With these words Genzaburo left him and went off to the tea house When Chokichi had finished his work he changed his clothes and hurrying to the tea house inquired for Genzaburo who was waiting for him upstairs Chokichi went up to him and began to thank him for the money which he had bestowed upon him Genzaburo smiled and handed him a wine cup inviting him to drink and said I will tell you the service upon which I wish to employ you I have set my heart upon that girl O Koyo whom I met to day upon the Adzuma Bridge and you must arrange a meeting between us When Chokichi heard these words he was amazed and frightened and for a while he made no answer At last he said Sir there is nothing that I would not do for you after the favours that I have received from you If this girl were the daughter of any ordinary man I would move heaven and earth to comply with your wishes but for your honour a handsome and noble Hatamoto to take for his concubine the daughter of an Eta is a great mistake By giving a little money you can get the handsomest woman in the town Pray sir abandon the idea Upon this Genzaburo was offended and said This is no matter for you to give advice in I have told you to get me the girl and you must obey Chokichi seeing that all that he could say would be of no avail thought over in his mind how to bring about a meeting between Genzaburo and O Koyo and replied Sir I am afraid when I think of the liberty that I have taken I will go to Kihachi s house and will use my best endeavours with him that I may bring the girl to you But for to day it is getting late and night is coming on so I will go and speak to her father to morrow Genzaburo was delighted to find Chokichi willing to serve him Well said he the day after to morrow I will await you at the tea house at Oji and you can bring O Koyo there Take this present small as it is and do your best for me With this he pulled out three riyos from his pocket and handed them to Chokichi who declined the money with thanks saying that he had already received too much and could accept no more but Genzaburo pressed him adding that if the wish of his heart were accomplished he would do still more for him So Chokichi in great glee at the good luck which had befallen him began to revolve all sorts of schemes in his mind and the two parted But O Koyo who had fallen in love at first sight with Genzaburo on the Adzuma Bridge went home and could think of nothing but him Sad and melancholy she sat and her friend O Kuma tried to comfort her in various ways but O Koyo yearned with all her heart for Genzaburo and the more she thought over the matter the better she perceived that she as the daughter of an Eta was no match for a noble Hatamoto And yet in spite of this she pined for him and bewailed her own vile condition Now it happened that her friend O Kuma was in love with Chokichi and only cared for thinking and speaking of him one day when Chokichi went to pay a visit at the house of Kihachi the Eta chief O Kuma seeing him come was highly delighted and received him very politely and Chokichi interrupting her said O Kuma I want you to answer me a question where has O Koyo gone to amuse herself to day Oh you know the gentleman who was talking with you the other day at the Adzuma Bridge Well O Koyo has fallen desperately in love with him and she says that she is too low spirited and out of sorts to get up yet Chokichi was greatly pleased to hear this and said to O Kuma How delightful Why O Koyo has fallen in love with the very gentleman who is burning with passion for her and who has employed me to help him in the matter However as he is a noble Hatamoto and his whole family would be ruined if the affair became known to the world we must endeavour to keep it as secret as possible Dear me replied O Kuma when O Koyo hears this how happy she will be to be sure I must go and tell her at once Stop said Chokichi detaining her if her father Master Kihachi is willing we will tell O Koyo directly You had better wait here a little until I have consulted him and with this he went into an inner chamber to see Kihachi and after talking over the news of the day told him how Genzaburo had fallen passionately in love with O Koyo and had employed him as a go between Then he described how he had received kindness at the hands of Genzaburo when he was in better circumstances dwelt on the wonderful personal beauty of his lordship and upon the lucky chance by which he and O Koyo had come to meet each other When Kihachi heard this story he was greatly flattered and said I am sure I am very much obliged to you For one of our daughters whom even the common people despise and shun as a pollution to be chosen as the concubine of a noble Hatamoto what could be a greater matter for congratulation So he prepared a feast for Chokichi and went off at once to tell O Koyo the news As for the maiden who had fallen over head and ears in love there was no difficulty in obtaining her consent to all that was asked of her Accordingly Chokichi having arranged to bring the lovers together on the following day at Oji was preparing to go and report the glad tidings to Genzaburo but O Koyo who knew that her friend O Kuma was in love with Chokichi and thought that if she could throw them into one another s arms they on their side would tell no tales about herself and Genzaburo worked to such good purpose that she gained her point At last Chokichi tearing himself from the embraces of O Kuma returned to Genzaburo and told him how he had laid his plans so as without fail to bring O Koyo to him the following day at Oji and Genzaburo beside himself with impatience waited for the morrow The next day Genzaburo having made his preparations and taking Chokichi with him went to the tea house at Oji and sat drinking wine waiting for his sweetheart to come As for O Koyo who was half in ecstasies and half shy at the idea of meeting on this day the man of her heart s desire she put on her holiday clothes and went with O Kuma to Oji and as they went out together her natural beauty being enhanced by her smart dress all the people turned round to look at her and praise her pretty face And so after a while they arrived at Oji and went into the tea house that had been agreed upon and Chokichi going out to meet them exclaimed Dear me Miss O Koyo his lordship has been all impatience waiting for you pray make haste and come in But in spite of what he said O Koyo on account of her virgin modesty would not go in O Kuma however who was not quite so particular cried out Why what is the meaning of this As you ve come here O Koyo it s a little late for you to be making a fuss about being shy Don t be a little fool but come in with me at once And with these words she caught fast hold of O Koyo s hand and pulling her by force into the room made her sit down by Genzaburo When Genzaburo saw how modest she was he reassured her saying Come what is there to be so shy about Come a little nearer to me pray Thank you sir How could I who am such a vile thing pollute your nobility by sitting by your side And as she spoke the blushes mantled over her face and the more Genzaburo looked at her the more beautiful she appeared in his eyes and the more deeply he became enamoured of her charms In the meanwhile he called for wine and fish and all four together made a feast of it When Chokichi and O Kuma saw how the land lay they retired discreetly into another chamber and Genzaburo and O Koyo were left alone together looking at one another Come said Genzaburo smiling hadn t you better sit a little closer to me Thank you sir really I m afraid But Genzaburo laughing at her for her idle fears said Don t behave as if you hated me Oh dear I m sure I don t hate you sir That would be very rude and indeed it s not the case I loved you when I first saw you at the Adzuma Bridge and longed for you with all my heart but I knew what a despised race I belonged to and that I was no fitting match for you and so I tried to be resigned But I am very young and inexperienced and so I could not help thinking of you and you alone and then Chokichi came and when I heard what you had said about me I thought in the joy of my heart that it must be a dream of happiness And as she spoke these words blushing timidly Genzaburo was dazzled with her beauty and said Well you re a clever child I m sure now you must have some handsome young lover of your own and that is why you don t care to come and drink wine and sit by me Am I not right eh Ah sir a nobleman like you is sure to have a beautiful wife at home and then you are so handsome that of course all the pretty young ladies are in love with you Nonsense Why how clever you are at flattering and paying compliments A pretty little creature like you was just made to turn all the men s heads a little witch Ah those are hard things to say of a poor girl Who could think of falling in love with such a wretch as I am Now pray tell me all about your own sweetheart I do so long to hear about her Silly child I m not the sort of man to put thoughts into the heads of fair ladies However it is quite true that there is some one whom I want to marry At this O Koyo began to feel jealous Ah said she how happy that some one must be Do pray tell me the whole story And a feeling of jealous spite came over her and made her quite unhappy Genzaburo laughed as he answered Well that some one is yourself and nobody else There and as he spoke he gently tapped the dimple on her cheek with his finger and O Koyo s heart beat so for very joy that for a little while she remained speechless At last she turned her face towards Genzaburo and said Alas your lordship is only trifling with me when you know that what you have just been pleased to propose is the darling wish of my heart Would that I could only go into your house as a maid servant in any capacity however mean that I might daily feast my eyes on your handsome face Ah I see that you think yourself very clever at hoaxing men and so you must needs tease me a little and as he spoke he took her hand and drew her close up to him and she blushing again cried Oh pray wait a moment while I shut the sliding doors Listen to me O Koyo I am not going to forget the promise which I made you just now nor need you be afraid of my harming you but take care that you do not deceive me Indeed sir the fear is rather that you should set your heart on others but although I am no fashionable lady take pity on me and love me well and long Of course I shall never care for another woman but you Pray pray never forget those words that you have just spoken And now replied Genzaburo the night is advancing and for to day we must part but we will arrange matters so as to meet again in this tea house But as people would make remarks if we left the tea house together I will go out first And so much against their will they tore themselves from one another Genzaburo returning to his house and O Koyo going home her heart filled with joy at having found the man for whom she had pined and from that day forth they used constantly to meet in secret at the tea house and Genzaburo in his infatuation never thought that the matter must surely become notorious after a while and that he himself would be banished and his family ruined he only took care for the pleasure of the moment Now Chokichi who had brought about the meeting between Genzaburo and his love used to go every day to the tea house at Oji taking with him O Koyo and Genzaburo neglected all his duties for the pleasure of these secret meetings Chokichi saw this with great regret and thought to himself that if Genzaburo gave himself up entirely to pleasure and laid aside his duties the secret would certainly be made public and Genzaburo would bring ruin on himself and his family so he began to devise some plan by which he might separate them and plotted as eagerly to estrange them as he had formerly done to introduce them to one another At last he hit upon a device which satisfied him Accordingly one day he went to O Koyo s house and meeting her father Kihachi said to him I ve got a sad piece of news to tell you The family of my lord Genzaburo have been complaining bitterly of his conduct in carrying on his relationship with your daughter and of the ruin which exposure would bring upon the whole house so they have been using their influence to persuade him to hear reason and give up the connection Now his lordship feels deeply for the damsel and yet he cannot sacrifice his family for her sake For the first time he has become alive to the folly of which he has been guilty and full of remorse he has commissioned me to devise some stratagem to break off the affair Of course this has taken me by surprise but as there is no gainsaying the right of the case I have had no option but to promise obedience this promise I have come to redeem and now pray advise your daughter to think no more of his lordship When Kihachi heard this he was surprised and distressed and told O Koyo immediately and she grieving over the sad news took no thought either of eating or drinking but remained gloomy and desolate In the meanwhile Chokichi went off to Genzaburo s house and told him that O Koyo had been taken suddenly ill and could not go to meet him and begged him to wait patiently until she should send to tell him of her recovery Genzaburo never suspecting the story to be false waited for thirty days and still Chokichi brought him no tidings of O Koyo At last he met Chokichi and besought him to arrange a meeting for him with O Koyo Sir replied Chokichi she is not yet recovered so it would be difficult to bring her to see your honour But I have been thinking much about this affair sir If it becomes public your honour s family will be plunged in ruin I pray you sir to forget all about O Koyo It s all very well for you to give me advice answered Genzaburo surprised but having once bound myself to O Koyo it would be a pitiful thing to desert her I therefore implore you once more to arrange that I may meet her However he would not consent upon any account so Genzaburo returned home and from that time forth daily entreated Chokichi to bring O Koyo to him and receiving nothing but advice from him in return was very sad and lonely 
6476_57446_000003_000000	train-clean-100	One day Genzaburo intent on ridding himself of the grief he felt at his separation from O Koyo went to the Yoshiwara and going into a house of entertainment ordered a feast to be prepared but in the midst of gaiety his heart yearned all the while for his lost love and his merriment was but mourning in disguise 
6476_57446_000003_000001	train-clean-100	At last the night wore on and as he was retiring along the corridor he saw a man of about forty years of age with long hair coming towards him who when he saw Genzaburo cried out Dear me why this must be my young lord Genzaburo who has come out to enjoy himself 
6476_57446_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Genzaburo thought this rather strange but looking at the man attentively recognized him as a retainer whom he had had in his employ the year before and said 
6476_57446_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 This is a curious meeting pray what have you been about since you left my service 
none	none	At any rate I may congratulate you on being well and strong Where are you living now
6476_57446_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Well sir since I parted from you I have been earning a living as a fortune teller at Kanda and have changed my name to Kaji Sazen 
6476_57446_000006_000001	train-clean-100	I am living in a poor and humble house but if your lordship at your leisure would honour me with a visit 
6476_57446_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Well it s a lucky chance that has brought us together and I certainly will go and see you besides I want you to do something for me 
6476_57446_000007_000001	train-clean-100	Shall you be at home the day after to morrow 
6476_57446_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Certainly sir I shall make a point of being at home 
6476_57446_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Very well then the day after to morrow I will go to your house 
none	none	I shall be at your service sir 
6476_57446_000010_000001	train-clean-100	And now as it is getting late I will take my leave for to night 
6476_57446_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Good night then 
6476_57446_000011_000001	train-clean-100	We shall meet the day after to morrow And so the two parted and went their several ways to rest 
6476_57446_000012_000000	train-clean-100	On the appointed day Genzaburo made his preparations and went in disguise without any retainers to call upon Sazen who met him at the porch of his house and said This is a great honour 
none	none	My lord Genzaburo is indeed welcome My house is very mean but let me invite your lordship to come into an inner chamber
6476_57446_000013_000000	train-clean-100	 Pray replied Genzaburo don t make any ceremony for me 
6476_57446_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Don t put yourself to any trouble on my account 
6476_57446_000014_000000	train-clean-100	And so he passed in and Sazen called to his wife to prepare wine and condiments and they began to feast 
none	none	At last Genzaburo looking Sazen in the face said There is a service which I want you to render me a very secret service but as if you were to refuse me I should be put to shame before I tell you what that service is I must know whether you are willing to assist me in anything that I may require of you Yes if it is anything that is within my power I am at your disposal Well then said Genzaburo greatly pleased and drawing ten riyos from his bosom this is but a small present to make to you on my first visit but pray accept it
6476_57446_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 No indeed 
6476_57446_000059_000001	train-clean-100	No indeed 
6476_57446_000017_000001	train-clean-100	I don t know what your lordship wishes of me but at any rate I cannot receive this money 
6476_57446_000017_000002	train-clean-100	I really must beg your lordship to take it back again 
6476_57446_000018_000000	train-clean-100	But Genzaburo pressed it upon him by force and at last he was obliged to accept the money 
none	none	Then Genzaburo told him the whole story of his loves with O Koyo how he had first met her and fallen in love with her at the Adzuma Bridge how Chokichi had introduced her to him at the tea house at Oji and then when she fell ill and he wanted to see her again instead of bringing her to him had only given him good advice and so Genzaburo drew a lamentable picture of his state of despair 
6476_57446_000019_000000	train-clean-100	Sazen listened patiently to his story and after reflecting for a while replied Well sir it s not a difficult matter to set right and yet it will require some little management 
none	none	However if your lordship will do me the honour of coming to see me again the day after to morrow I will cast about me in the meanwhile and will let you know then the result of my deliberations When Genzaburo heard this he felt greatly relieved and recommending Sazen to do his best in the matter took his leave and returned home That very night Sazen after thinking over all that Genzaburo had told him laid his plans accordingly and went off to the house of Kihachi the Eta chief and told him the commission with which he had been entrusted Kihachi was of course greatly astonished and said Some time ago sir Chokichi came here and said that my lord Genzaburo having been rebuked by his family for his profligate behaviour had determined to break off his connection with my daughter 
6476_57446_000021_000001	train-clean-100	Of course I knew that the daughter of an Eta was no fitting match for a nobleman so when Chokichi came and told me the errand upon which he had been sent I had no alternative but to announce to my daughter that she must give up all thought of his lordship 
6476_57446_000021_000002	train-clean-100	Since that time she has been fretting and pining and starving for love 
6476_57446_000021_000003	train-clean-100	But when I tell her what you have just said how glad and happy she will be 
none	none	Let me go and talk to her at once And with these words he went to O Koyo s room and when he looked upon her thin wasted face and saw how sad she was he felt more and more pity for her and said Well O Koyo are you in better spirits to day 
6476_57446_000021_000005	train-clean-100	Would you like something to eat 
6476_57446_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Thank you I have no appetite 
6476_57446_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Well at any rate I have some news for you that will make you happy A messenger has come from my lord Genzaburo for whom your heart yearns 
6476_57446_000024_000000	train-clean-100	At this O Koyo who had been crouching down like a drooping flower gave a great start and cried out Is that really true 
6476_57446_000024_000001	train-clean-100	Pray tell me all about it as quickly as possible 
6476_57446_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 The story which Chokichi came and told us that his lordship wished to break off the connection was all an invention 
6476_57446_000025_000001	train-clean-100	He has all along been wishing to meet you and constantly urged Chokichi to bring you a message from him 
6476_57446_000025_000002	train-clean-100	It is Chokichi who has been throwing obstacles in the way 
6476_57446_000025_000003	train-clean-100	At last his lordship has secretly sent a man called Kaji Sazen a fortune teller to arrange an interview between you 
6476_57446_000025_000004	train-clean-100	So now my child you may cheer up and go to meet your lover as soon as you please 
6476_57446_000026_000000	train-clean-100	When O Koyo heard this she was so happy that she thought it must all be a dream and doubted her own senses 
6476_57446_000027_000000	train-clean-100	Kihachi in the meanwhile rejoined Sazen in the other room and after telling him of the joy with which his daughter had heard the news put before him wine and other delicacies 
6476_57446_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 I think said Sazen that the best way would be for O Koyo to live secretly in my lord Genzaburo s house but as it will never do for all the world to know of it it must be managed very quietly and further when I get home I must think out some plan to lull the suspicions of that fellow Chokichi and let you know my idea by letter 
none	none	Meanwhile O Koyo had better come home with me to night although she is so terribly out of spirits now she shall meet Genzaburo the day after to morrow Kihachi reported this to O Koyo and as her pining for Genzaburo was the only cause of her sickness she recovered her spirits at once and saying that she would go with Sazen immediately joyfully made her preparations Then Sazen having once more warned Kihachi to keep the matter secret from Chokichi and to act upon the letter which he should send him returned home taking with him O Koyo and after O Koyo had bathed and dressed her hair and painted herself and put on beautiful clothes she came out looking so lovely that no princess in the land could vie with her and Sazen when he saw her said to himself that it was no wonder that Genzaburo had fallen in love with her then as it was getting late he advised her to go to rest and after showing her to her apartments went to his own room and wrote his letter to Kihachi containing the scheme which he had devised When Kihachi received his instructions he was filled with admiration at Sazen s ingenuity and putting on an appearance of great alarm and agitation went off immediately to call on Chokichi and said to him Oh Master Chokichi such a terrible thing has happened 
6476_57446_000029_000001	train-clean-100	Pray let me tell you all about it 
6476_57446_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 Indeed what can it be 
none	none	Oh sir answered Kihachi pretending to wipe away his tears my daughter O Koyo mourning over her separation from my lord Genzaburo at first refused all sustenance and remained nursing her sorrows until last night her woman s heart failing to bear up against her great grief she drowned herself in the river leaving behind her a paper on which she had written her intention 
6476_57446_000032_000000	train-clean-100	When Chokichi heard this he was thunderstruck and exclaimed Can this really be true 
6476_57446_000032_000001	train-clean-100	And when I think that it was I who first introduced her to my lord I am ashamed to look you in the face 
6476_57446_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh say not so misfortunes are the punishment due for our misdeeds in a former state of existence 
6476_57446_000033_000001	train-clean-100	I bear you no ill will 
none	none	This money which I hold in my hand was my daughter s and in her last instructions she wrote to beg that it might be given after her death to you through whose intervention she became allied with a nobleman so please accept it as my daughter s legacy to you and as he spoke he offered him three riyos
6476_57446_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 You amaze me replied the other 
none	none	How could I above all men who have so much to reproach myself with in my conduct towards you accept this money Nay it was my dead daughter s wish But since you reproach yourself in the matter when you think of her I will beg you to put up a prayer and to cause masses to be said for her 
6476_57446_000036_000000	train-clean-100	At last Chokichi after much persuasion and greatly to his own distress was obliged to accept the money and when Kihachi had carried out all Sazen s instructions he returned home laughing in his sleeve 
none	none	Chokichi was sorely grieved to hear of O Koyo s death and remained thinking over the sad news when all of a sudden looking about him he saw something like a letter lying on the spot where Kihachi had been sitting so he picked it up and read it and as luck would have it it was the very letter which contained Sazen s instructions to Kihachi and in which the whole story which had just affected him so much was made up When he perceived the trick that had been played upon him he was very angry and exclaimed To think that I should have been so hoaxed by that hateful old dotard and such a fellow as Sazen And Genzaburo too out of gratitude for the favours which I had received from him in old days I faithfully gave him good advice and all in vain Well they ve gulled me once but I ll be even with them yet and hinder their game before it is played out And so he worked himself up into a fury and went off secretly to prowl about Sazen s house to watch for O Koyo determined to pay off Genzaburo and Sazen for their conduct to him 
6476_57446_000038_000000	train-clean-100	In the meanwhile Sazen who did not for a moment suspect what had happened when the day which had been fixed upon by him and Genzaburo arrived made O Koyo put on her best clothes smartened up his house and got ready a feast against Genzaburo s arrival 
6476_57446_000038_000001	train-clean-100	The latter came punctually to his time and going in at once said to the fortune teller Well have you succeeded in the commission with which I entrusted you 
6476_57446_000039_000000	train-clean-100	At first Sazen pretended to be vexed at the question and said Well sir I ve done my best but it s not a matter which can be settled in a hurry 
none	none	However there s a young lady of high birth and wonderful beauty upstairs who has come here secretly to have her fortune told and if your lordship would like to come with me and see her you can do so 
6476_57446_000040_000000	train-clean-100	But Genzaburo when he heard that he was not to meet O Koyo lost heart entirely and made up his mind to go home again 
none	none	Sazen however pressed him so eagerly that at last he went upstairs to see this vaunted beauty and Sazen drawing aside a screen showed him O Koyo who was sitting there 
6476_57446_000040_000002	train-clean-100	Genzaburo gave a great start and turning to Sazen said Well you certainly are a first rate hand at keeping up a hoax 
6476_57446_000040_000003	train-clean-100	However I cannot sufficiently praise the way in which you have carried out my instructions 
none	none	Pray don t mention it sir 
6476_57446_000041_000001	train-clean-100	But as it is a long time since you have met the young lady you must have a great deal to say to one another so I will go downstairs and if you want anything pray call me And so he went downstairs and left them 
none	none	Then Genzaburo addressing O Koyo said Ah it is indeed a long time since we met 
6476_57446_000042_000001	train-clean-100	How happy it makes me to see you again 
none	none	Why your face has grown quite thin 
6476_57446_000042_000003	train-clean-100	Poor thing have you been unhappy And O Koyo with the tears starting from her eyes for joy hid her face and her heart was so full that she could not speak 
6476_57446_000042_000004	train-clean-100	But Genzaburo passing his hand gently over her head and back and comforting her said Come sweetheart there is no need to sob so 
6476_57446_000042_000005	train-clean-100	Talk to me a little and let me hear your voice 
none	none	At last O Koyo raised her head and said Ah when I was separated from you by the tricks of Chokichi and thought that I should never meet you again how tenderly I thought of you I thought I should have died and waited for my hour to come pining all the while for you And when at last as I lay between life and death Sazen came with a message from you I thought it was all a dream And as she spoke she bent her head and sobbed again and in Genzaburo s eyes she seemed more beautiful than ever with her pale delicate face and he loved her better than before Then she said If I were to tell you all I have suffered until to day I should never stop
6476_57446_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes replied Genzaburo I too have suffered much and so they told one another their mutual griefs and from that day forth they constantly met at Sazen s house 
6476_57446_000045_000000	train-clean-100	One day as they were feasting and enjoying themselves in an upper storey in Sazen s house Chokichi came to the house and said I beg pardon but does one Master Sazen live here 
6476_57446_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 Certainly sir I am Sazen at your service 
6476_57446_000046_000001	train-clean-100	Pray where are you from 
6476_57446_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Well sir I have a little business to transact with you 
none	none	May I make so bold as to go in And with these words he entered the house But who and what are you said Sazen Sir I am an Eta and my name is Chokichi I beg to bespeak your goodwill for myself I hope we may be friends 
6476_57446_000050_000000	train-clean-100	Sazen was not a little taken aback at this however he put on an innocent face as though he had never heard of Chokichi before and said I never heard of such a thing 
none	none	Why I thought you were some respectable person and you have the impudence to tell me that your name is Chokichi and that you re one of those accursed Etas 
6476_57446_000050_000002	train-clean-100	To think of such a shameless villain coming and asking to be friends with me forsooth 
none	none	Get you gone the quicker the better your presence pollutes the house Chokichi smiled contemptuously as he answered So you deem the presence of an Eta in your house a pollution eh 
6476_57446_000051_000001	train-clean-100	Why I thought you must be one of us 
6476_57446_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 Insolent knave 
6476_57446_000052_000001	train-clean-100	Begone as fast as possible 
6476_57446_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Well since you say that I defile your house you had better get rid of O Koyo as well 
6476_57446_000053_000001	train-clean-100	I suppose she must equally be a pollution to it 
6476_57446_000054_000000	train-clean-100	This put Sazen rather in a dilemma however he made up his mind not to show any hesitation and said What are you talking about 
6476_57446_000054_000001	train-clean-100	There is no O Koyo here and I never saw such a person in my life 
none	none	Chokichi quietly drew out of the bosom of his dress the letter from Sazen to Kihachi which he had picked up a few days before and showing it to Sazen replied If you wish to dispute the genuineness of this paper I will report the whole matter to the Governor of Yedo and Genzaburo s family will be ruined and the rest of you who are parties in this affair will come in for your share of trouble 
6476_57446_000055_000001	train-clean-100	Just wait a little 
6476_57446_000056_000000	train-clean-100	And as he pretended to leave the house Sazen at his wits end cried out Stop stop 
6476_57446_000056_000001	train-clean-100	I want to speak to you 
6476_57446_000056_000002	train-clean-100	Pray stop and listen quietly 
none	none	It is quite true as you said that O Koyo is in my house and really your indignation is perfectly just 
6476_57446_000056_000004	train-clean-100	Come let us talk over matters a little 
none	none	Now you yourself were originally a respectable man and although you have fallen in life there is no reason why your disgrace should last for ever All that you want in order to enable you to escape out of this fraternity of Etas is a little money Why should you not get this from Genzaburo who is very anxious to keep his intrigue with O Koyo secret 
6476_57446_000057_000000	train-clean-100	Chokichi laughed disdainfully 
6476_57446_000057_000001	train-clean-100	 I am ready to talk with you but I don t want any money 
none	none	All I want is to report the affair to the authorities in order that I may be revenged for the fraud that was put upon me Won t you accept twenty five riyos Twenty five riyos No indeed 
6476_57446_000059_000002	train-clean-100	I will not take a fraction less than a hundred and if I cannot get them I will report the whole matter at once 
none	none	Sazen after a moment s consideration hit upon a scheme and answered smiling Well Master Chokichi you re a fine fellow and I admire your spirit You shall have the hundred riyos you ask for but as I have not so much money by me at present I will go to Genzaburo s house and fetch it It s getting dark now but it s not very late so I ll trouble you to come with me and then I can give you the money to night 
6476_57446_000061_000000	train-clean-100	Chokichi consenting to this the pair left the house together 
6476_57446_000062_000000	train-clean-100	Now Sazen who as a Ronin wore a long dirk in his girdle kept looking out for a moment when Chokichi should be off his guard in order to kill him but Chokichi kept his eyes open and did not give Sazen a chance 
6476_57446_000062_000001	train-clean-100	At last Chokichi as ill luck would have it stumbled against a stone and fell and Sazen profiting by the chance drew his dirk and stabbed him in the side and as Chokichi taken by surprise tried to get up he cut him severely over the head until at last he fell dead 
none	none	Sazen then looking around him and seeing to his great delight that there was no one near returned home 
6476_57446_000062_000003	train-clean-100	The following day Chokichi s body was found by the police and when they examined it they found nothing upon it save a paper which they read and which proved to be the very letter which Sazen had sent to Kihachi and which Chokichi had picked up 
6476_57446_000062_000004	train-clean-100	The matter was immediately reported to the governor and Sazen having been summoned an investigation was held 
6476_57446_000062_000005	train-clean-100	Sazen cunning and bold murderer as he was lost his self possession when he saw what a fool he had been not to get back from Chokichi the letter which he had written and when he was put to a rigid examination under torture confessed that he had hidden O Koyo at Genzaburo s instigation and then killed Chokichi who had found out the secret 
none	none	Upon this the governor after consulting about Genzaburo s case decided that as he had disgraced his position as a Hatamoto by contracting an alliance with the daughter of an Eta his property should be confiscated his family blotted out and himself banished As for Kihachi the Eta chief and his daughter O Koyo they were handed over for punishment to the chief of the Etas and by him they too were banished while Sazen against whom the murder of Chokichi had been fully proved was executed according to law NOTE At Asakusa in Yedo there lives a man called Danzayemon the chief of the Etas This man traces his pedigree back to Minamoto no Yoritomo who founded the Shogunate in the year A D eleven ninety two The whole of the Etas in Japan are under his jurisdiction his subordinates are called Koyagashira or chiefs of the huts and he and they constitute the government of the Etas In the Legacy of Iyeyasu already quoted the thirty sixth Law provides as follows All wandering mendicants such as male sorcerers female diviners hermits blind people beggars and tanners Etas have had from of old their respective rulers 
6476_57446_000064_000004	train-clean-100	Be not disinclined however to punish any such who give rise to disputes or who overstep the boundaries of their own classes and are disobedient to existing laws 
none	none	The occupation of the Etas is to kill and flay horses oxen and other beasts to stretch drums and make shoes and if they are very poor they wander from house to house working as cobblers mending old shoes and leather and so earn a scanty livelihood Besides this their daughters and young married women gain a trifle as wandering minstrels called Torioi playing on the shamisen a sort of banjo and singing ballads 
6476_57446_000065_000002	train-clean-100	They never marry out of their own fraternity but remain apart a despised and shunned race 
none	none	At executions by crucifixion it is the duty of the Etas to transfix the victims with spears and besides this they have to perform all sorts of degrading offices about criminals such as carrying sick prisoners from their cells to the hall of justice and burying the bodies of those that have been executed 
6476_57446_000066_000001	train-clean-100	Thus their race is polluted and accursed and they are hated accordingly 
none	none	Now this is how the Etas came to be under the jurisdiction of Danzayemon 
6476_57446_000068_000000	train-clean-100	When Minamoto no Yoritomo was yet a child his father Minamoto no Yoshitomo fought with Taira no Kiyomori and was killed by treachery so his family was ruined and Yoshitomo s concubine whose name was Tokiwa took her children and fled from the house to save her own and their lives 
6476_57446_000068_000001	train-clean-100	But Kiyomori desiring to destroy the family of Yoshitomo root and branch ordered his retainers to divide themselves into bands and seek out the children 
6476_57446_000068_000002	train-clean-100	At last they were found but Tokiwa was so exceedingly beautiful that Kiyomori was inflamed with love for her and desired her to become his own concubine 
6476_57446_000068_000003	train-clean-100	Then Tokiwa told Kiyomori that if he would spare her little ones she would share his couch but that if he killed her children she would destroy herself rather than yield to his desire 
6476_57446_000068_000004	train-clean-100	When he heard this Kiyomori bewildered by the beauty of Tokiwa spared the lives of her children but banished them from the capital 
none	none	So Yoritomo was sent to Hirugakojima in the province of Idzu and when he grew up and became a man he married the daughter of a peasant After a while Yoritomo left the province and went to the wars leaving his wife pregnant and in due time she was delivered of a male child to the delight of her parents who rejoiced that their daughter should bear seed to a nobleman but she soon fell sick and died and the old people took charge of the babe 
6476_57446_000069_000002	train-clean-100	And when they also died the care of the child fell to his mother s kinsmen and he grew up to be a peasant 
none	none	Now Kiyomori the enemy of Yoritomo had been gathered to his fathers and Yoritomo had avenged the death of his father by slaying Munemori the son of Kiyomori and there was peace throughout the land 
6476_57446_000070_000001	train-clean-100	And Yoritomo became the chief of all the noble houses in Japan and first established the government of the country 
none	none	When Yoritomo had thus raised himself to power if the son that his peasant wife had born to him had proclaimed himself the son of the mighty prince he would have been made lord over a province but he took no thought of this and remained a tiller of the earth forfeiting a glorious inheritance and his descendants after him lived as peasants in the same village increasing in prosperity and in good repute among their neighbours 
6476_57446_000071_000000	train-clean-100	But the princely line of Yoritomo came to an end in three generations and the house of Hojo was all powerful in the land 
6476_57446_000072_000000	train-clean-100	Now it happened that the head of the house of Hojo heard that a descendant of Yoritomo was living as a peasant in the land so he summoned him and said 
none	none	It is a hard thing to see the son of an illustrious house live and die a peasant 
6476_57446_000073_000001	train-clean-100	I will promote you to the rank of Samurai 
none	none	Then the peasant answered My lord if I become a Samurai and the retainer of some noble I shall not be so happy as when I was my own master If I may not remain a husbandman let me be a chief over men however humble they may be 
6476_57446_000075_000000	train-clean-100	But my lord Hojo was angry at this and thinking to punish the peasant for his insolence said 
none	none	Since you wish to become a chief over men no matter how humble there is no means of gratifying your strange wish but by making you chief over the Etas of the whole country So now see that you rule them well When he heard this the peasant was afraid but because he had said that he wished to become a chief over men however humble he could not choose but become chief of the Etas he and his children after him for ever and Danzayemon who rules the Etas at the present time and lives at Asakusa is his lineal descendant FAIRY TALES FAIRY TALES I think that their quaintness is a sufficient apology for the following little children s stories With the exception of that of the Elves and the Envious Neighbour which comes out of a curious book on etymology and proverbial lore called the Kotowazagusa these stories are found printed in little separate pamphlets with illustrations the stereotype blocks of which have become so worn that the print is hardly legible These are the first tales which are put into a Japanese child s hands and it is with these and such as these that the Japanese mother hushes her little ones to sleep Knowing the interest which many children of a larger growth take in such Baby Stories I was anxious to have collected more of them I was disappointed however for those which I give here are the only ones which I could find in print and if I asked the Japanese to tell me others they only thought I was laughing at them and changed the subject The stories of the Tongue cut Sparrow and the Old Couple and their Dog have been paraphrased in other works upon Japan but I am not aware of their having been literally translated before THE TONGUE CUT SPARROW Once upon a time there lived an old man and an old woman The old man who had a kind heart kept a young sparrow which he tenderly nurtured But the dame was a cross grained old thing and one day when the sparrow had pecked at some paste with which she was going to starch her linen she flew into a great rage and cut the sparrow s tongue and let it loose When the old man came home from the hills and found that the bird had flown he asked what had become of it so the old woman answered that she had cut its tongue and let it go because it had stolen her starching paste Now the old man hearing this cruel tale was sorely grieved and thought to himself Alas where can my bird be gone Poor thing Poor little tongue cut sparrow where is your home now and he wandered far and wide seeking for his pet and crying mister Sparrow mister Sparrow where are you living One day at the foot of a certain mountain the old man fell in with the lost bird and when they had congratulated one another on their mutual safety the sparrow led the old man to his home and having introduced him to his wife and chicks set before him all sorts of dainties and entertained him hospitably Please partake of our humble fare said the sparrow poor as it is you are very welcome What a polite sparrow answered the old man who remained for a long time as the sparrow s guest and was daily feasted right royally At last the old man said that he must take his leave and return home and the bird offering him two wicker baskets begged him to carry them with him as a parting present One of the baskets was heavy and the other was light so the old man saying that as he was feeble and stricken in years he would only accept the light one shouldered it and trudged off home leaving the sparrow family disconsolate at parting from him When the old man got home the dame grew very angry and began to scold him saying Well and pray where have you been this many a day A pretty thing indeed to be gadding about at your time of life Oh replied he I have been on a visit to the sparrows and when I came away they gave me this wicker basket as a parting gift Then they opened the basket to see what was inside and lo and behold it was full of gold and silver and precious things When the old woman who was as greedy as she was cross saw all the riches displayed before her she changed her scolding strain and could not contain herself for joy Illustration THE TONGUE CUT SPARROW I ll go and call upon the sparrows too said she and get a pretty present So she asked the old man the way to the sparrows house and set forth on her journey Following his directions she at last met the tongue cut sparrow and exclaimed Well met well met mister Sparrow I have been looking forward to the pleasure of seeing you So she tried to flatter and cajole the sparrow by soft speeches The bird could not but invite the dame to its home but it took no pains to feast her and said nothing about a parting gift She however was not to be put off so she asked for something to carry away with her in remembrance of her visit The sparrow accordingly produced two baskets as before and the greedy old woman choosing the heavier of the two carried it off with her But when she opened the basket to see what was inside all sorts of hobgoblins and elves sprang out of it and began to torment her Illustration THE TONGUE CUT SPARROW two But the old man adopted a son and his family grew rich and prosperous What a happy old man THE ACCOMPLISHED AND LUCKY TEA KETTLE A long time ago at a temple called Morinji in the province of Joshiu there was an old tea kettle One day when the priest of the temple was about to hang it over the hearth to boil the water for his tea to his amazement the kettle all of a sudden put forth the head and tail of a badger What a wonderful kettle to come out all over fur The priest thunderstruck called in the novices of the temple to see the sight and whilst they were stupidly staring one suggesting one thing and another the kettle jumping up into the air began flying about the room More astonished than ever the priest and his pupils tried to pursue it but no thief or cat was ever half so sharp as this wonderful badger kettle At last however they managed to knock it down and secure it and holding it in with their united efforts they forced it into a box intending to carry it off and throw it away in some distant place so that they might be no more plagued by the goblin For this day their troubles were over but as luck would have it the tinker who was in the habit of working for the temple called in and the priest suddenly bethought him that it was a pity to throw the kettle away for nothing and that he might as well get a trifle for it no matter how small So he brought out the kettle which had resumed its former shape and had got rid of its head and tail and showed it to the tinker When the tinker saw the kettle he offered twenty copper coins for it and the priest was only too glad to close the bargain and be rid of his troublesome piece of furniture But the tinker trudged off home with his pack and his new purchase That night as he lay asleep he heard a strange noise near his pillow so he peeped out from under the bedclothes and there he saw the kettle that he had bought in the temple covered with fur and walking about on four legs The tinker started up in a fright to see what it could all mean when all of a sudden the kettle resumed its former shape This happened over and over again until at last the tinker showed the tea kettle to a friend of his who said This is certainly an accomplished and lucky tea kettle You should take it about as a show with songs and accompaniments of musical instruments and make it dance and walk on the tight rope Illustration THE ACCOMPLISHED AND LUCKY TEA KETTLE The tinker thinking this good advice made arrangements with a showman and set up an exhibition The noise of the kettle s performances soon spread abroad until even the princes of the land sent to order the tinker to come to them and he grew rich beyond all his expectations Even the princesses too and the great ladies of the court took great delight in the dancing kettle so that no sooner had it shown its tricks in one place than it was time for them to keep some other engagement At last the tinker grew so rich that he took the kettle back to the temple where it was laid up as a precious treasure and worshipped as a saint Illustration THE ACCOMPLISHED AND LUCKY TEA KETTLE two THE CRACKLING MOUNTAIN Once upon a time there lived an old man and an old woman who kept a pet white hare by which they set great store One day a badger that lived hard by came and ate up the food which had been put out for the hare so the old man flying into a great rage seized the badger and tying the beast up to a tree went off to the mountain to cut wood while the old woman stopped at home and ground the wheat for the evening porridge Then the badger with tears in his eyes said to the old woman Please dame please untie this rope The dame thinking that it was a cruel thing to see a poor beast in pain undid the rope but the ungrateful brute was no sooner loose than he cried out I ll be revenged for this and was off in a trice When the hare heard this he went off to the mountain to warn the old man and whilst the hare was away on this errand the badger came back and killed the dame Then the beast having assumed the old woman s form made her dead body into broth and waited for the old man to come home from the mountain When he returned tired and hungry the pretended old woman said Come come I ve made such a nice broth of the badger you hung up Sit down and make a good supper of it With these words she set out the broth and the old man made a hearty meal licking his lips over it and praising the savoury mess But as soon as he had finished eating the badger reassuming its natural shape cried out Nasty old man you ve eaten your own wife Look at her bones lying in the kitchen sink and laughing contemptuously the badger ran away and disappeared Then the old man horrified at what he had done set up a great lamentation and whilst he was bewailing his fate the hare came home and seeing how matters stood determined to avenge the death of his mistress So he went back to the mountain and falling in with the badger who was carrying a faggot of sticks on his back he struck a light and set fire to the sticks without letting the badger see him When the badger heard the crackling noise of the faggot burning on his back he called out Holloa what is that noise Oh answered the hare this is called the Crackling Mountain There s always this noise here And as the fire gathered strength and went pop pop pop the badger said again Oh dear what can this noise be This is called the Pop Pop Mountain answered the hare Illustration THE HARE AND THE BADGER All at once the fire began to singe the badger s back so that he fled howling with pain and jumped into a river hard by But although the water put out the fire his back was burnt as black as a cinder The hare seeing an opportunity for torturing the badger to his heart s content made a poultice of cayenne pepper which he carried to the badger s house and pretending to condole with him and to have a sovereign remedy for burns he applied his hot plaister to his enemy s sore back Oh how it smarted and pained and how the badger yelled and cried Illustration THE HARE AND THE BADGER two When at last the badger got well again he went to the hare s house thinking to reproach him for having caused him so much pain When he got there he found that the hare had built himself a boat What have you built that boat for mister Hare said the badger I m going to the capital of the moon fifty two answered the hare won t you come with me Footnote fifty two The mountains in the moon are supposed to resemble a hare in shape Hence there is a fanciful connection between the hare and the moon I had enough of your company on the Crackling Mountain where you played me such tricks I d rather make a boat for myself replied the badger who immediately began building himself a boat of clay The hare seeing this laughed in his sleeve and so the two launched their boats upon the river The waves came plashing against the two boats but the hare s boat was built of wood while that of the badger was made of clay and as they rowed down the river the clay boat began to crumble away then the hare seizing his paddle and brandishing it in the air struck savagely at the badger s boat until he had smashed it to pieces and killed his enemy When the old man heard that his wife s death had been avenged he was glad in his heart and more than ever petted and loved the hare whose brave deeds had caused him to welcome the returning spring THE STORY OF THE OLD MAN WHO MADE WITHERED TREES TO BLOSSOM In the old old days there lived an honest man with his wife who had a favourite dog which they used to feed with fish and titbits from their own kitchen One day as the old folks went out to work in their garden the dog went with them and began playing about All of a sudden the dog stopped short and began to bark Bow wow wow wagging his tail violently The old people thought that there must be something nice to eat under the ground so they brought a spade and began digging when lo and behold the place was full of gold pieces and silver and all sorts of precious things which had been buried there So they gathered the treasure together and after giving alms to the poor bought themselves rice fields and corn fields and became wealthy people Now in the next house there dwelt a covetous and stingy old man and woman who when they heard what had happened came and borrowed the dog and having taken him home prepared a great feast for him and said If you please mister Dog we should be much obliged to you if you would show us a place with plenty of money in it The dog however who up to that time had received nothing but cuffs and kicks from his hosts would not eat any of the dainties which they set before him so the old people began to get cross and putting a rope round the dog s neck led him out into the garden But it was all in vain let them lead him where they might not a sound would the dog utter he had no bow wow for them At last however the dog stopped at a certain spot and began to sniff so thinking that this must surely be the lucky place they dug and found nothing but a quantity of dirt and nasty offal over which they had to hold their noses Furious at being disappointed the wicked old couple seized the dog and killed him When the good old man saw that the dog whom he had lent did not come home he went next door to ask what had become of him and the wicked old man answered that he had killed the dog and buried him at the root of a pine tree so the good old fellow with a heavy heart went to the spot and having set out a tray with delicate food burnt incense and adorned the grave with flowers as he shed tears over his lost pet But there was more good luck in store yet for the old people the reward of their honesty and virtue How do you think that happened my children It is very wrong to be cruel to dogs and cats Illustration THE OLD MAN WHO CAUSED WITHERED TREES TO FLOWER That night when the good old man was fast asleep in bed the dog appeared to him and after thanking him for all his kindness said Cause the pine tree under which I am buried to be cut down and made into a mortar and use it thinking of it as if it were myself The old man did as the dog had told him to do and made a mortar out of the wood of the pine tree but when he ground his rice in it each grain of rice was turned into some rich treasure When the wicked old couple saw this they came to borrow the mortar but no sooner did they try to use it than all their rice was turned into filth so in a fit of rage they broke up the mortar and burnt it But the good old man little suspecting that his precious mortar had been broken and burnt wondered why his neighbours did not bring it back to him Illustration THE OLD MAN WHO CAUSED WITHERED TREES TO FLOWER two One night the dog appeared to him again in a dream and told him what had happened adding that if he would take the ashes of the burnt mortar and sprinkle them on withered trees the trees would revive and suddenly put out flowers After saying this the dream vanished and the old man who heard for the first time of the loss of his mortar ran off weeping to the neighbours house and begged them at any rate to give him back the ashes of his treasure Having obtained these he returned home and made a trial of their virtues upon a withered cherry tree which upon being touched by the ashes immediately began to sprout and blossom When he saw this wonderful effect he put the ashes into a basket and went about the country announcing himself as an old man who had the power of bringing dead trees to life again A certain prince hearing of this and thinking it a mighty strange thing sent for the old fellow who showed his power by causing all the withered plum and cherry trees to shoot out and put forth flowers So the prince gave him a rich reward of pieces of silk and cloth and other presents and sent him home rejoicing So soon as the neighbours heard of this they collected all the ashes that remained and having put them in a basket the wicked old man went out into the castle town and gave out that he was the old man who had the power of reviving dead trees and causing them to flower He had not to wait long before he was called into the prince s palace and ordered to exhibit his power But when he climbed up into a withered tree and began to scatter the ashes not a bud nor a flower appeared but the ashes all flew into the prince s eyes and mouth blinding and choking him When the prince s retainers saw this they seized the old man and beat him almost to death so that he crawled off home in a very sorry plight When he and his wife found out what a trap they had fallen into they stormed and scolded and put themselves into a passion but that did no good at all The good old man and woman so soon as they heard of their neighbours distress sent for them and after reproving them for their greed and cruelty gave them a share of their own riches which by repeated strokes of luck had now increased to a goodly sum So the wicked old people mended their ways and led good and virtuous lives ever after THE BATTLE OF THE APE AND THE CRAB If a man thinks only of his own profit and tries to benefit himself at the expense of others he will incur the hatred of Heaven Men should lay up in their hearts the story of the Battle of the Ape and Crab and teach it as a profitable lesson to their children Once upon a time there was a crab who lived in a marsh in a certain part of the country It fell out one day that the crab having picked up a rice cake an ape who had got a nasty hard persimmon seed came up and begged the crab to make an exchange with him The crab who was a simple minded creature agreed to this proposal and they each went their way the ape chuckling to himself at the good bargain which he had made When the crab got home he planted the persimmon seed in his garden and as time slipped by it sprouted and by degrees grew to be a big tree The crab watched the growth of his tree with great delight but when the fruit ripened and he was going to pluck it the ape came in and offered to gather it for him The crab consenting the ape climbed up into the tree and began eating all the ripe fruit himself while he only threw down the sour persimmons to the crab inviting him at the same time to eat heartily The crab however was not pleased at this arrangement and thought that it was his turn to play a trick upon the ape so he called out to him to come down head foremost The ape did as he was bid and as he crawled down head foremost the ripe fruit all came tumbling out of his pockets and the crab having picked up the persimmons ran off and hid himself in a hole The ape seeing this lay in ambush and as soon as the crab crept out of his hiding place gave him a sound drubbing and went home Just at this time a friendly egg and a bee who were the apprentices of a certain rice mortar happened to pass that way and seeing the crab s piteous condition tied up his wounds and having escorted him home began to lay plans to be revenged upon the cruel ape Illustration THE APE AND THE CRAB Having agreed upon a scheme they all went to the ape s house in his absence and each one having undertaken to play a certain part they waited in secret for their enemy to come home The ape little dreaming of the mischief that was brewing returned home and having a fancy to drink a cup of tea began lighting the fire in the hearth when all of a sudden the egg which was hidden in the ashes burst with the heat and bespattered the frightened ape s face so that he fled howling with pain and crying Oh what an unlucky beast I am Maddened with the heat of the burst egg he tried to go to the back of the house when the bee darted out of a cupboard and a piece of seaweed who had joined the party coming up at the same time the ape was surrounded by enemies In despair he seized the clothes rack and fought valiantly for awhile but he was no match for so many and was obliged to run away with the others in hot pursuit after him Just as he was making his escape by a back door however the piece of seaweed tripped him up and the rice mortar closing with him from behind made an end of him Illustration THE APE AND THE CRAB two So the crab having punished his enemy went home in triumph and lived ever after on terms of brotherly love with the seaweed and the mortar Was there ever such a fine piece of fun THE ADVENTURES OF LITTLE PEACHLING Many hundred years ago there lived an honest old wood cutter and his wife One fine morning the old man went off to the hills with his billhook to gather a faggot of sticks while his wife went down to the river to wash the dirty clothes When she came to the river she saw a peach floating down the stream so she picked it up and carried it home with her thinking to give it to her husband to eat when he should come in The old man soon came down from the hills and the good wife set the peach before him when just as she was inviting him to eat it the fruit split in two and a little puling baby was born into the world So the old couple took the babe and brought it up as their own and because it had been born in a peach they called it Momotaro fifty three or Little Peachling Footnote fifty three Momo means a peach and Taro is the termination of the names of eldest sons as Hikotaro Tokutaro c In modern times however the termination has been applied indifferently to any male child By degrees Little Peachling grew up to be strong and brave and at last one day he said to his old foster parents I am going to the ogres island to carry off the riches that they have stored up there Pray then make me some millet dumplings for my journey So the old folks ground the millet and made the dumplings for him and Little Peachling after taking an affectionate leave of them cheerfully set out on his travels As he was journeying on he fell in with an ape who gibbered at him and said Kia kia kia where are you off to Little Peachling I m going to the ogres island to carry off their treasure answered Little Peachling What are you carrying at your girdle I m carrying the very best millet dumplings in all Japan If you ll give me one I will go with you said the ape So Little Peachling gave one of his dumplings to the ape who received it and followed him When he had gone a little further he heard a pheasant calling Ken ken ken fifty four where are you off to Master Peachling Footnote fifty four The country folk in Japan pretend that the pheasant s call is a sign of an approaching earthquake Little Peachling answered as before and the pheasant having begged and obtained a millet dumpling entered his service and followed him A little while after this they met a dog who cried Bow wow wow whither away Master Peachling I m going off to the ogres island to carry off their treasure If you will give me one of those nice millet dumplings of yours I will go with you said the dog Illustration LITTLE PEACHLING With all my heart said Little Peachling So he went on his way with the ape the pheasant and the dog following after him When they got to the ogres island the pheasant flew over the castle gate and the ape clambered over the castle wall while Little Peachling leading the dog forced in the gate and got into the castle Then they did battle with the ogres and put them to flight and took their king prisoner So all the ogres did homage to Little Peachling and brought out the treasures which they had laid up There were caps and coats that made their wearers invisible jewels which governed the ebb and flow of the tide coral musk emeralds amber and tortoiseshell besides gold and silver All these were laid before Little Peachling by the conquered ogres Illustration LITTLE PEACHLING two So Little Peachling went home laden with riches and maintained his foster parents in peace and plenty for the remainder of their lives THE FOXES WEDDING Once upon a time there was a young white fox whose name was Fukuyemon When he had reached the fitting age he shaved off his forelock fifty five and began to think of taking to himself a beautiful bride The old fox his father resolved to give up his inheritance to his son fifty six and retired into private life so the young fox in gratitude for this laboured hard and earnestly to increase his patrimony Now it happened that in a famous old family of foxes there was a beautiful young lady fox with such lovely fur that the fame of her jewel like charms was spread far and wide The young white fox who had heard of this was bent on making her his wife and a meeting was arranged between them There was not a fault to be found on either side so the preliminaries were settled and the wedding presents sent from the bridegroom to the bride s house with congratulatory speeches from the messenger which were duly acknowledged by the person deputed to receive the gifts the bearers of course received the customary fee in copper cash Footnote fifty five See the Appendix on Ceremonies Footnote fifty six See the note on the word Inkiyo in the story of the Prince and the Badger When the ceremonies had been concluded an auspicious day was chosen for the bride to go to her husband s house and she was carried off in solemn procession during a shower of rain the sun shining all the while fifty seven After the ceremonies of drinking wine had been gone through the bride changed her dress and the wedding was concluded without let or hindrance amid singing and dancing and merry making Footnote fifty seven A shower during sunshine which we call the devil beating his wife is called in Japan the fox s bride going to her husband s house The bride and bridegroom lived lovingly together and a litter of little foxes were born to them to the great joy of the old grandsire who treated the little cubs as tenderly as if they had been butterflies or flowers They re the very image of their old grandfather said he as proud as possible As for medicine bless them they re so healthy that they ll never need a copper coin s worth As soon as they were old enough they were carried off to the temple of Inari Sama the patron saint of foxes and the old grand parents prayed that they might be delivered from dogs and all the other ills to which fox flesh is heir Illustration THE FOXES WEDDING In this way the white fox by degrees waxed old and prosperous and his children year by year became more and more numerous around him so that happy in his family and his business every recurring spring brought him fresh cause for joy Illustration THE FOXES WEDDING two THE HISTORY OF SAKATA KINTOKI A long time ago there was an officer of the Emperor s body guard called Sakata Kurando a young man who although he excelled in valour and in the arts of war was of a gentle and loving disposition This young officer was deeply enamoured of a fair young lady called Yaegiri who lived at Gojozaka at Kiyoto Now it came to pass that having incurred the jealousy of certain other persons Kurando fell into disgrace with the Court and became a Ronin so he was no longer able to keep up any communication with his love Yaegiri indeed he became so poor that it was a hard matter for him to live So he left the place and fled no one knew whither As for Yaegiri lovesick and lorn and pining for her lost darling she escaped from the house where she lived and wandered hither and thither through the country seeking everywhere for Kurando Now Kurando when he left the palace turned tobacco merchant and as he was travelling about hawking his goods it chanced that he fell in with Yaegiri so having communicated to her his last wishes he took leave of her and put an end to his life Poor Yaegiri having buried her lover went to the Ashigara Mountain a distant and lonely spot where she gave birth to a little boy who as soon as he was born was of such wonderful strength that he walked about and ran playing all over the mountain A woodcutter who chanced to see the marvel was greatly frightened at first and thought the thing altogether uncanny but after a while he got used to the child and became quite fond of him and called him Little Wonder and gave his mother the name of the Old Woman of the Mountain One day as Little Wonder was playing about he saw that on the top of a high cedar tree there was a tengu s nest fifty eight so he began shaking the tree with all his might until at last the tengu s nest came tumbling down Footnote fifty eight Tengu or the Heavenly Dog a hobgoblin who infests desert places and is invoked to frighten naughty little children As luck would have it the famous hero Minamoto no Yorimitsu with his retainers Watanabe Isuna Usui Sadamitsu and several others had come to the mountain to hunt and seeing the feat which Little Wonder had performed came to the conclusion that he could be no ordinary child Minamoto no Yorimitsu ordered Watanabe Isuna to find out the child s name and parentage The Old Woman of the Mountain on being asked about him answered that she was the wife of Kurando and that Little Wonder was the child of their marriage And she proceeded to relate all the adventures which had befallen her When Yorimitsu heard her story he said Certainly this child does not belie his lineage Give the brat to me and I will make him my retainer The Old Woman of the Mountain gladly consented and gave Little Wonder to Yorimitsu but she herself remained in her mountain home So Little Wonder went off with the hero Yorimitsu who named him Sakata Kintoki and in aftertimes he became famous and illustrious as a warrior and his deeds are recited to this day He is the favourite hero of little children who carry his portrait in their bosom and wish that they could emulate his bravery and strength THE ELVES AND THE ENVIOUS NEIGHBOUR Once upon a time there was a certain man who being overtaken by darkness among the mountains was driven to seek shelter in the trunk of a hollow tree In the middle of the night a large company of elves assembled at the place and the man peeping out from his hiding place was frightened out of his wits After a while however the elves began to feast and drink wine and to amuse themselves by singing and dancing until at last the man caught by the infection of the fun forgot all about his fright and crept out of his hollow tree to join in the revels When the day was about to dawn the elves said to the man You re a very jolly companion and must come out and have a dance with us again You must make us a promise and keep it So the elves thinking to bind the man over to return took a large wen that grew on his forehead and kept it in pawn upon this they all left the place and went home The man walked off to his own house in high glee at having passed a jovial night and got rid of his wen into the bargain So he told the story to all his friends who congratulated him warmly on being cured of his wen But there was a neighbour of his who was also troubled with a wen of long standing and when he heard of his friend s luck he was smitten with envy and went off to hunt for the hollow tree in which when he had found it he passed the night Towards midnight the elves came as he had expected and began feasting and drinking with songs and dances as before As soon as he saw this he came out of his hollow tree and began dancing and singing as his neighbour had done The elves mistaking him for their former boon companion were delighted to see him and said You re a good fellow to recollect your promise and we ll give you back your pledge so one of the elves pulling the pawned wen out of his pocket stuck it on to the man s forehead on the top of the other wen which he already bad So the envious neighbour went home weeping with two wens instead of one This is a good lesson to people who cannot see the good luck of others without coveting it for themselves THE GHOST OF SAKURA The misfortunes and death of the farmer Sogoro which although the preternatural appearances by which they are said to have been followed may raise a smile are matters of historic notoriety with which every Japanese is familiar furnish a forcible illustration of the relations which exist between the tenant and the lord of the soil and of the boundless power for good or for evil exercised by the latter It is rather remarkable that in a country where the peasant placed as he is next to the soldier and before the artisan and merchant in the four classes into which the people are divided enjoys no small consideration and where agriculture is protected by law from the inroads of wild vegetation even to the lopping of overshadowing branches and the cutting down of hedgerow timber the lord of the manor should be left practically without control in his dealings with his people The land tax or rather the yearly rent paid by the tenant is usually assessed at forty per cent of the produce but there is no principle clearly defining it and frequently the landowner and the cultivator divide the proceeds of the harvest in equal shapes Rice land is divided into three classes and according to these classes it is computed that one tan eighteen hundred square feet of the best land should yield to the owner a revenue of five bags of rice per annum each of these bags holds four to a to is rather less than half an imperial bushel and is worth at present eighteen sixty eight three riyos or about sixteen shillings land of the middle class should yield a revenue of three or four bags The rent is paid either in rice or in money according to the actual price of the grain which varies considerably It is due in the eleventh month of the year when the crops have all been gathered and their market value fixed The rent of land bearing crops other than rice such as cotton beans roots and so forth is payable in money during the twelfth month The choice of the nature of the crops to be grown appears to be left to the tenant The Japanese landlord when pressed by poverty does not confine himself to the raising of his legitimate rents he can always enforce from his needy tenantry the advancement of a year s rent or the loan of so much money as may be required to meet his immediate necessities Should the lord be just the peasant is repaid by instalments with interest extending over ten or twenty years But it too often happens that unjust and merciless lords do not repay such loans but on the contrary press for further advances Then it is that the farmers dressed in their grass rain coats and carrying sickles and bamboo poles in their hands assemble before the gate of their lord s palace at the capital and represent their grievances imploring the intercession of the retainers and even of the womankind who may chance to go forth Sometimes they pay for their temerity by their lives but at any rate they have the satisfaction of bringing shame upon their persecutor in the eyes of his neighbours and of the populace Illustration THE DEPUTATION OF PEASANTS AT THEIR LORD S GATE The official reports of recent travels in the interior of Japan have fully proved the hard lot with which the peasantry had to put up during the government of the Tycoons and especially under the Hatamotos the created nobility of the dynasty In one province where the village mayors appear to have seconded the extortions of their lord they have had to flee before an exasperated population who taking advantage of the revolution laid waste and pillaged their houses loudly praying for a new and just assessment of the land while throughout the country the farmers have hailed with acclamations the resumption of the sovereign power by the Mikado and the abolition of the petty nobility who exalted themselves upon the misery of their dependants Warming themselves in the sunshine of the court at Yedo the Hatamotos waxed fat and held high revel and little cared they who groaned or who starved Money must be found and it was found It is necessary here to add a word respecting the position of the village mayors who play so important a part in the tale The peasants of Japan are ruled by three classes of officials the Nanushi or mayor the Kumigashira or chiefs of companies and the Hiyakushodai or farmers representatives The village which is governed by the Nanushi or mayor is divided into companies which consisting of five families each are directed by a Kumigashira these companies again are subdivided into groups of five men each who choose one of their number to represent them in case of their having any petition to present or any affairs to settle with their superiors This functionary is the Hiyakushodai The mayor the chief of the company and the representative keep registers of the families and people under their control and are responsible for their good and orderly behaviour They pay taxes like the other farmers but receive a salary the amount of which depends upon the size and wealth of the village Five per cent of the yearly land tax forms the salary of the mayor and the other officials each receive five per cent of the tax paid by the little bodies over which they respectively rule The average amount of land for one family to cultivate is about one cho or nine thousand square yards but there are farmers who have inherited as much as five or even six cho from their ancestors There is also a class of farmers called from their poverty water drinking farmers who have no land of their own but hire that of those who have more than they can keep in their own hands The rent so paid varies but good rice land will bring in as high a rent as from Lone eighteens to Ltwo sixs per tan eighteen hundred square feet Farm labourers are paid from six or seven riyos a year to as much as thirty riyos the riyo being worth about fives fourd besides this they are clothed and fed not daintily indeed but amply The rice which they cultivate is to them an almost unknown luxury millet is their staple food and on high days and holidays they receive messes of barley or buckwheat Where the mulberry tree is grown and the silkworm is educated there the labourer receives the highest wage The rice crop on good land should yield twelve and a half fold and on ordinary land from six to seven fold only Ordinary arable land is only half as valuable as rice land which cannot be purchased for less than forty riyos per tan of eighteen hundred square feet Common hill or wood land is cheaper again than arable land but orchards and groves of the Pawlonia are worth from fifty to sixty riyos per tan With regard to the punishment of crucifixion by which Sogoro was put to death it is inflicted for the following offences parricide including the murder or striking of parents uncles aunts elder brothers masters or teachers coining counterfeit money and passing the barriers of the Tycoon s territory without a permit fifty nine The criminal is attached to an upright post with two cross bars to which his arms and feet are fastened by ropes He is then transfixed with spears by men belonging to the Eta or Pariah class I once passed the execution ground near Yedo when a body was attached to the cross The dead man had murdered his employer and having been condemned to death by crucifixion had died in prison before the sentence could be carried out He was accordingly packed in a squatting position in a huge red earthenware jar which having been tightly filled up with salt was hermetically sealed On the anniversary of the commission of the crime the jar was carried down to the execution ground and broken and the body was taken out and tied to the cross the joints of the knees and arms having been cut to allow of the extension of the stiffened and shrunken limbs it was then transfixed with spears and allowed to remain exposed for three days An open grave the upturned soil of which seemed almost entirely composed of dead men s remains waited to receive the dishonoured corpse over which three or four Etas squalid and degraded beings were mounting guard smoking their pipes by a scanty charcoal fire and bandying obscene jests It was a hideous and ghastly warning had any cared to read the lesson but the passers by on the high road took little or no notice of the sight and a group of chubby and happy children were playing not ten yards from the dead body as if no strange or uncanny thing were near them Footnote fifty nine This last crime is of course now obsolete THE GHOST OF SAKURA sixty Footnote sixty The story which also forms the subject of a play is published but with altered names in order that offence may not be given to the Hotta family The real names are preserved here The events related took place during the rule of the Shogun Iyemitsu in the first half of the seventeenth century How true is the principle laid down by Confucius that the benevolence of princes is reflected in their country while their wickedness causes sedition and confusion Illustration THE GHOST OF SAKURA In the province of Shimosa and the district of Soma Hotta Kaga no Kami was lord of the castle of Sakura and chief of a family which had for generations produced famous warriors When Kaga no Kami who had served in the Gorojiu the cabinet of the Shogun died at the castle of Sakura his eldest son Kotsuke no Suke Masanobu inherited his estates and honours and was appointed to a seat in the Gorojiu but he was a different man from the lords who had preceded him He treated the farmers and peasants unjustly imposing additional and grievous taxes so that the tenants on his estates were driven to the last extremity of poverty and although year after year and month after month they prayed for mercy and remonstrated against this injustice no heed was paid to them and the people throughout the villages were reduced to the utmost distress Accordingly the chiefs of the one hundred and thirty six villages producing a total revenue of forty thousand kokus of rice assembled together in council and determined unanimously to present a petition to the Government sealed with their seals stating that their repeated remonstrances had been taken no notice of by their local authorities Then they assembled in numbers before the house of one of the councillors of their lord named Ikeura Kazuye in order to show the petition to him first but even then no notice was taken of them so they returned home and resolved after consulting together to proceed to their lord s yashiki or palace at Yedo on the seventh day of the tenth month It was determined with one accord that one hundred and forty three village chiefs should go to Yedo and the chief of the village of Iwahashi one Sogoro a man forty eight years of age distinguished for his ability and judgment ruling a district which produced a thousand kokus stepped forward and said This is by no means an easy matter my masters It certainly is of great importance that we should forward our complaint to our lord s palace at Yedo but what are your plans Have you any fixed intentions It is indeed a most important matter rejoined the others but they had nothing further to say Then Sogoro went on to say We have appealed to the public office of our province but without avail we have petitioned the Prince s councillors also in vain I know that all that remains for us is to lay our case before our lord s palace at Yedo and if we go there it is equally certain that we shall not be listened to on the contrary we shall be cast into prison If we are not attended to here in our own province how much less will the officials at Yedo care for us We might hand our petition into the litter of one of the Gorojiu in the public streets but even in that case as our lord is a member of the Gorojiu none of his peers would care to examine into the rights and wrongs of our complaint for fear of offending him and the man who presented the petition in so desperate a manner would lose his life on a bootless errand If you have made up your minds to this and are determined at all hazards to start then go to Yedo by all means and bid a long farewell to parents children wives and relations This is my opinion The others all agreeing with what Sogoro said they determined that come what might they would go to Yedo and they settled to assemble at the village of Funabashi on the thirteenth day of the eleventh month On the appointed day all the village officers met at the place agreed upon Sogoro the chief of the village of Iwahashi alone being missing and as on the following day Sogoro had not yet arrived they deputed one of their number named Rokurobei to inquire the reason Rokurobei arrived at Sogoro s house towards four in the afternoon and found him warming himself quietly over his charcoal brazier as if nothing were the matter The messenger seeing this said rather testily The chiefs of the villages are all assembled at Funabashi according to covenant and as you Master Sogoro have not arrived I have come to inquire whether it is sickness or some other cause that prevents you Indeed replied Sogoro I am sorry that you should have had so much trouble My intention was to have set out yesterday but I was taken with a cholic with which I am often troubled and as you may see I am taking care of myself so for a day or two I shall not be able to start Pray be so good as to let the others know this Rokurobei seeing that there was no help for it went back to the village of Funabashi and communicated to the others what had occurred They were all indignant at what they looked upon as the cowardly defection of a man who had spoken so fairly but resolved that the conduct of one man should not influence the rest and talked themselves into the belief that the affair which they had in hand would be easily put through so they agreed with one accord to start and present the petition and having arrived at Yedo put up in the street called Bakurocho But although they tried to forward their complaint to the various officers of their lord no one would listen to them the doors were all shut in their faces and they had to go back to their inn crestfallen and without success On the following day being the eighteenth of the month they all met together at a tea house in an avenue in front of a shrine of Kwannon Sama sixty one and having held a consultation they determined that as they could hit upon no good expedient they would again send for Sogoro to see whether he could devise no plan Accordingly on the nineteenth Rokurobei and one Jiuyemon started for the village of Iwahashi at noon and arrived the same evening Footnote sixty one A Buddhist deity Now the village chief Sogoro who had made up his mind that the presentation of this memorial was not a matter to be lightly treated summoned his wife and children and his relations and said to them I am about to undertake a journey to Yedo for the following reasons Our present lord of the soil has increased the land tax in rice and the other imposts more than tenfold so that pen and paper would fail to convey an idea of the poverty to which the people are reduced and the peasants are undergoing the tortures of hell upon earth Seeing this the chiefs of the various villages have presented petitions but with what result is doubtful My earnest desire therefore is to devise some means of escape from this cruel persecution If my ambitious scheme does not succeed then shall I return home no more and even should I gain my end it is hard to say how I may be treated by those in power Let us drink a cup of wine together for it may be that you shall see my face no more I give my life to allay the misery of the people of this estate If I die mourn not over my fate weep not for me Having spoken thus he addressed his wife and his four children instructing them carefully as to what he desired to be done after his death and minutely stating every wish of his heart Then having drunk a parting cup with them he cheerfully took leave of all present and went to a tea house in the neighbouring village of Funabashi where the two messengers Rokurobei and Jiuyemon were anxiously awaiting his arrival in order that they might recount to him all that had taken place at Yedo In short said they it appears to us that we have failed completely and we have come to meet you in order to hear what you propose If you have any plan to suggest we would fain be made acquainted with it We have tried the officers of the district replied Sogoro and we have tried my lord s palace at Yedo However often we might assemble before my lord s gate no heed would be given to us There is nothing left for us but to appeal to the Shogun So they sat talking over their plans until the night was far advanced and then they went to rest The winter night was long but when the cawing of the crows was about to announce the morning the three friends started on their journey for the tea house at Asakusa at which upon their arrival they found the other village elders already assembled Welcome Master Sogoro said they How is it that you have come so late We have petitioned all the officers to no purpose and we have broken our bones in vain We are at our wits end and can think of no other scheme If there is any plan which seems good to you we pray you to act upon it Sirs replied Sogoro speaking very quietly although we have met with no better success here than in our own place there is no use in grieving In a day or two the Gorojiu will be going to the castle we must wait for this opportunity and following one of the litters thrust in our memorial This is my opinion what think you of it my masters One and all the assembled elders were agreed as to the excellence of this advice and having decided to act upon it they returned to their inn Then Sogoro held a secret consultation with Jiuyemon Hanzo Rokurobei Chinzo and Kinshiro five of the elders and with their assistance drew up the memorial and having heard that on the twenty sixth of the month when the Gorojiu should go to the castle Kuze Yamato no Kami would proceed to a palace under the western enclosure of the castle they kept watch in a place hard by As soon as they saw the litter of the Gorojiu approach they drew near to it and having humbly stated their grievances handed in the petition and as it was accepted the six elders were greatly elated and doubted not that their hearts desire would be attained so they went off to a tea house at Riyogoku and Jiuyemon said We may congratulate ourselves on our success We have handed in our petition to the Gorojiu and now we may set our minds at rest before many days have passed we shall hear good news from the rulers To Master Sogoro is due great praise for his exertions Sogoro stepping forward answered Although we have presented our memorial to the Gorojiu the matter will not be so quickly decided it is therefore useless that so many of us should remain here let eleven men stay with me and let the rest return home to their several villages If we who remain are accused of conspiracy and beheaded let the others agree to reclaim and bury our corpses As for the expenses which we shall incur until our suit is concluded let that be according to our original covenant For the sake of the hundred and thirty six villages we will lay down our lives if needs must and submit to the disgrace of having our heads exposed as those of common malefactors Then they had a parting feast together and after a sad leave taking the main body of the elders went home to their own country while the others wending their way to their quarters waited patiently to be summoned to the Supreme Court On the twod day of the twelfth month Sogoro having received a summons from the residence of the Gorojiu Kuze Yamato no Kami proceeded to obey it and was ushered to the porch of the house where two councillors named Aijima Gidaiyu and Yamaji Yori met him and said Some days since you had the audacity to thrust a memorial into the litter of our lord Yamato no Kami By an extraordinary exercise of clemency he is willing to pardon this heinous offence but should you ever again endeavour to force your petitions upon him you will be held guilty of riotous conduct and with this they gave back the memorial I humbly admit the justice of his lordship s censure But oh my lords this is no hasty nor ill considered action Year after year affliction upon affliction has been heaped upon us until at last the people are without even the necessaries of life and we seeing no end to the evil have humbly presented this petition I pray your lordships of your great mercy to consider our case and deign to receive our memorial Vouchsafe to take some measures that the people may live and our gratitude for your great kindness will know no bounds Your request is a just one replied the two councillors after hearing what he said but your memorial cannot be received so you must even take it back With this they gave back the document and wrote down the names of Sogoro and six of the elders who had accompanied him There was no help for it they must take back their petition and return to their inn The seven men dispirited and sorrowful sat with folded arms considering what was best to be done what plan should be devised until at last when they were at their wits end Sogoro said in a whisper So our petition which we gave in after so much pains has been returned after all With what f ace can we return to our villages after such a disgrace I for one do not propose to waste my labour for nothing accordingly I shall bide my time until some day when the Shogun shall go forth from the castle and lying in wait by the roadside I shall make known our grievances to him who is lord over our lord This is our last chance Illustration SOGORO THRUSTING THE PETITION INTO THE SHOGUN S LITTER The others all applauded this speech and having with one accord hardened their hearts waited for their opportunity Now it so happened that on the twentieth day of the twelfth month the then Shogun Prince Iyemitsu was pleased to worship at the tombs of his ancestors at Uyeno sixty two and Sogoro and the other elders hearing this looked upon it as a special favour from the gods and felt certain that this time they would not fail So they drew up a fresh memorial and at the appointed time Sogoro hid himself under the Sammaye Bridge in front of the black gate at Uyeno When Prince Iyemitsu passed in his litter Sogoro clambered up from under the bridge to the great surprise of the Shogun s attendants who called out Push the fellow on one side but profiting by the confusion Sogoro raising his voice and crying I wish to humbly present a petition to his Highness in person thrust forward his memorial which he had tied on to the end of a bamboo stick six feet long and tried to put it into the litter and although there were cries to arrest him and he was buffeted by the escort he crawled up to the side of the litter and the Shogun accepted the document But Sogoro was arrested by the escort and thrown into prison As for the memorial his Highness ordered that it should be handed in to the Gorojiu Hotta Kotsuke no Suke the lord of the petitioners Footnote sixty two Destroyed during the revolution in the summer of eighteen sixty eight by the troops of the Mikado See note on the tombs of the Shoguns at the end of the story When Hotta Kotsuke no Suke had returned home and read the memorial he summoned his councillor Kojima Shikibu and said The officials of my estate are mere bunglers When the peasants assembled and presented a petition they refused to receive it and have thus brought this trouble upon me Their folly has been beyond belief however it cannot be helped We must remit all the new taxes and you must inquire how much was paid to the former lord of the castle As for this Sogoro he is not the only one who is at the bottom of the conspiracy however as this heinous offence of his in going out to lie in wait for the Shogun s procession is unpardonable we must manage to get him given up to us by the Government and as an example for the rest of my people he shall be crucified he and his wife and his children and after his death all that he possesses shall be confiscated The other six men shall be banished and that will suffice My lord replied Shikibu prostrating himself your lordship s intentions are just Sogoro indeed deserves any punishment for his outrageous crime But I humbly venture to submit that his wife and children cannot be said to be guilty in the same degree I implore your lordship mercifully to be pleased to absolve them from so severe a punishment Where the sin of the father is great the wife and children cannot be spared replied Kotsuke no Suke and his councillor seeing that his heart was hardened was forced to obey his orders without further remonstrance So Kotsuke no Suke having obtained that Sogoro should be given up to him by the Government caused him to be brought to his estate of Sakura as a criminal in a litter covered with nets and confined him in prison When his case had been inquired into a decree was issued by the Lord Kotsuke no Suke that he should be punished for a heinous crime and on the ninth day of the twod month of the second year of the period styled Shoho A D sixteen forty four he was condemned to be crucified Accordingly Sogoro his wife and children and the elders of the hundred and thirty six villages were brought before the Court house of Sakura in which were assembled forty five chief officers The elders were then told that yielding to their petition their lord was graciously pleased to order that the oppressive taxes should be remitted and that the dues levied should not exceed those of the olden time As for Sogoro and his wife the following sentence was passed upon them Whereas you have set yourself up as the head of the villagers whereas secondly you have dared to make light of the Government by petitioning his Highness the Shogun directly thereby offering an insult to your lord and whereas thirdly you have presented a memorial to the Gorojiu and whereas fourthly you were privy to a conspiracy for these four heinous crimes you are sentenced to death by crucifixion Your wife is sentenced to die in like manner and your children will be decapitated This sentence is passed upon the following persons Sogoro chief of the village of Iwahashi aged forty eight His wife Man aged thirty eight His son Gennosuke aged thirteen His son Sohei aged ten His son Kihachi aged seven The eldest daughter of Sogoro named Hatsu nineteen years of age was married to a man named Jiuyemon in the village of Hakamura in Shitachi beyond the river in the territory of Matsudaira Matsu no Kami the Prince of Sendai His second daughter whose name was Saki sixteen years of age was married to one Tojiuro chief of a village on the property of my lord Naito Geki No punishment was decreed against these two women The six elders who had accompanied Sogoro were told that although by good rights they had merited death yet by the special clemency of their lord their lives would be spared but that they were condemned to banishment Their wives and children would not be attainted and their property would be spared The six men were banished to Oshima in the province of Idzu Sogoro heard his sentence with pure courage The six men were banished but three of them lived to be pardoned on the occasion of the death of the Shogun Prince Genyuin sixty three and returned to their country Footnote sixty three The name assigned after death to Iyetsuna the fourth of the dynasty of Tokugawa who died on the eighth day of the fifth month of the year A D sixteen eighty According to the above decision the taxes were remitted and men and women young and old rejoiced over the advantage that had been gained for them by Sogoro and by the six elders and there was not one that did not mourn for their fate When the officers of the several villages left the Court house one Zembei the chief of the village of Sakato told the others that he had some important subjects to speak to them upon and begged them to meet him in the temple called Fukushoin Every man having consented and the hundred and thirty six men having assembled at the temple Zembei addressed them as follows The success of our petition in obtaining the reduction of our taxes to the same amount as was levied by our former lord is owing to Master Sogoro who has thus thrown away his life for us He and his wife and children are now to suffer as criminals for the sake of the one hundred and thirty six villages That such a thing should take place before our very eyes seems to me not to be borne What say you my masters Ay ay what you say is just from top to bottom replied the others Then Hanzayemon the elder of the village of Katsuta stepped forward and said As Master Zembei has just said Sogoro is condemned to die for a matter in which all the village elders are concerned to a man We cannot look on unconcerned Full well I know that it is useless our pleading for Sogoro but we may at least petition that the lives of his wife and children may be spared The assembled elders having all applauded this speech they determined to draw up a memorial and they resolved should their petition not be accepted by the local authorities to present it at their lord s palace in Yedo and should that fail to appeal to the Government Accordingly before noon on the following day they all affixed their seals to the memorial which four of them including Zembei and Hanzayemon composed as follows With deep fear we humbly venture to present the following petition which the elders of the one hundred and thirty six villages of this estate have sealed with their seals In consequence of the humble petition which we lately offered up the taxes have graciously been reduced to the rates levied by the former lord of the estate and new laws have been vouchsafed to us With reverence and joy the peasants great and small have gratefully acknowledged these favours With regard to Sogoro the elder of the village of Iwahashi who ventured to petition his highness the Shogun in person thus being guilty of a heinous crime he has been sentenced to death in the castle town With fear and trembling we recognize the justice of his sentence But in the matter of his wife and children she is but a woman and they are so young and innocent that they cannot distinguish the east from the west we pray that in your great clemency you will remit their sin and give them up to the representatives of the one hundred and thirty six villages for which we shall be ever grateful We the elders of the villages know not to what extent we may be transgressing in presenting this memorial We were all guilty of affixing our seals to the former petition but Sogoro who was chief of a large district producing a thousand kokus of revenue and was therefore a man of experience acted for the others and we grieve that he alone should suffer for all Yet in his case we reverently admit that there can be no reprieve For his wife and children however we humbly implore your gracious mercy and consideration Signed by the elders of the villages of the estate the twod year of Shoho and the twod month Having drawn up this memorial the hundred and thirty six elders with Zembei at their head proceeded to the Court house to present the petition and found the various officers seated in solemn conclave Then the clerk took the petition and having opened it read it aloud and the councillor Ikeura Kazuye said The petition which you have addressed to us is worthy of all praise But you must know that this is a matter which is no longer within our control The affair has been reported to the Government and although the priests of my lord s ancestral temple have interceded for Sogoro my lord is so angry that he will not listen even to them saying that had he not been one of the Gorojiu he would have been in danger of being ruined by this man his high station alone saved him My lord spoke so severely that the priests themselves dare not recur to the subject You see therefore that it will be no use your attempting to take any steps in the matter for most certainly your petition will not be received You had better then think no more about it And with these words he gave back the memorial Zembei and the elders seeing to their infinite sorrow that their mission was fruitless left the Court house and most sorrowfully took counsel together grinding their teeth in their disappointment when they thought over what the councillor had said as to the futility of their attempt Out of grief for this Zembei with Hanzayemon and Heijiuro on the eleventh day of the twod month the day on which Sogoro and his wife and children suffered left Ewaradai the place of execution and went to the temple Zenkoji in the province of Shinshiu and from thence they ascended Mount Koya in Kishiu and on the first day of the eighth month shaved their heads and became priests Zembei changed his name to Kakushin and Hanzayemon changed his to Zensho as for Heijiuro he fell sick at the end of the seventh month and on the eleventh day of the eighth month died being forty seven years old that year These three men who had loved Sogoro as the fishes love water were true to him to the last Heijiuro was buried on Mount Koya Kakushin wandered through the country as a priest praying for the entry of Sogoro and his children into the perfection of paradise and after visiting all the shrines and temples came back at last to his own province of Shimosa and took up his abode at the temple Riukakuji in the village of Kano and in the district of Imban praying and making offerings on behalf of the souls of Sogoro his wife and children Hanzayemon now known as the priest Zensho remained at Shinagawa a suburb of Yedo and by the charity of good people collected enough money to erect six bronze Buddhas which remain standing to this day He fell sick and died at the age of seventy on the tenth day of the twod month of the thirteenth year of the period styled Kambun Zembei who as a priest had changed his name to Kakushin died at the age of seventy six on the seventeenth day of the tenth month of the twod year of the period styled Empo Thus did those men for the sake of Sogoro and his family give themselves up to works of devotion and the other villagers also brought food to soothe the spirits of the dead and prayed for their entry into paradise and as litanies were repeated without intermission there can be no doubt that Sogoro attained salvation In paradise where the blessings of God are distributed without favour the soul learns its faults by the measure of the rewards given The lusts of the flesh are abandoned and the soul purified attains to the glory of Buddha sixty four Footnote sixty four Buddhist text On the eleventh day of the twod month of the twod year of Shoho Sogoro having been convicted of a heinous crime a scaffold was erected at Ewaradai and the councillor who resided at Yedo and the councillor who resided on the estate with the other officers proceeded to the place in all solemnity Then the priests of Tokoji in the village of Sakenaga followed by coffin bearers took their places in front of the councillors and said We humbly beg leave to present a petition What have your reverences to say We are men who have forsaken the world and entered the priesthood answered the monks respectfully and we would fain if it be possible receive the bodies of those who are to die that we may bury them decently It will be a great joy to us if our humble petition be graciously heard and granted Your request shall be granted but as the crime of Sogoro was great his body must be exposed for three days and three nights after which the corpse shall be given to you At the hour of the snake ten A M the hour appointed for the execution the people from the neighbouring villages and the castle town old and young men and women flocked to see the sight numbers there were too who came to bid a last farewell to Sogoro his wife and children and to put up a prayer for them When the hour had arrived the condemned were dragged forth bound and made to sit upon coarse mats Sogoro and his wife closed their eyes for the sight was more than they could bear and the spectators with heaving breasts and streaming eyes cried Cruel and Pitiless and taking sweetmeats and cakes from the bosoms of their dresses threw them to the children At noon precisely Sogoro and his wife were bound to the crosses which were then set upright and fixed in the ground When this had been done their eldest son Gennosuke was led forward to the scaffold in front of the two parents Then Sogoro cried out Oh cruel cruel what crime has this poor child committed that he is treated thus As for me it matters not what becomes of me And the tears trickled down his face The spectators prayed aloud and shut their eyes and the executioner himself standing behind the boy and saying that it was a pitiless thing that the child should suffer for the father s fault prayed silently Then Gennosuke who had remained with his eyes closed said to his parents Oh my father and mother I am going before you to paradise that happy country to wait for you My little brothers and I will be on the banks of the river Sandzu sixty five and stretch out our hands and help you across Farewell all you who have come to see us die and now please cut off my head at once Footnote sixty five The Buddhist Styx which separates paradise from hell across which the dead are ferried by an old woman for whom a small piece of money is buried with them With this he stretched out his neck murmuring a last prayer and not only Sogoro and his wife but even the executioner and the spectators could not repress their tears but the headsman unnerved as he was and touched to the very heart was forced on account of his office to cut off the child s head and a piteous wail arose from the parents and the spectators Then the younger child Sohei said to the headsman Sir I have a sore on my right shoulder please cut my head off from the left shoulder lest you should hurt me Alas I know not how to die nor what I should do When the headsman and the officers present heard the child s artless speech they wept again for very pity but there was no help for it and the head fell off more swiftly than water is drunk up by sand Then little Kihachi the third son who on account of his tender years should have been spared was butchered as he was in his simplicity eating the sweetmeats which had been thrown to him by the spectators When the execution of the children was over the priests of Tokoji took their corpses and having placed them in their coffins carried them away amidst the lamentations of the bystanders and buried them with great solemnity Then Shigayemon one of the servants of Danzayemon the chief of the Etas who had been engaged for the purpose was just about to thrust his spear when O Man Sogoro s wife raising her voice said Remember my husband that from the first you had made up your mind to this fate What though our bodies be disgracefully exposed on these crosses we have the promises of the gods before us therefore mourn not Let us fix our minds upon death we are drawing near to paradise and shall soon be with the saints Be calm my husband Let us cheerfully lay down our single lives for the good of many Man lives but for one generation his name for many A good name is more to be prized than life So she spoke and Sogoro on the cross laughing gaily answered Well said wife What though we are punished for the many Our petition was successful and there is nothing left to wish for Now I am happy for I have attained my heart s desire The changes and chances of life are manifold But if I had five hundred lives and could five hundred times assume this shape of mine I would die five hundred times to avenge this iniquity For myself I care not but that my wife and children should be punished also is too much Pitiless and cruel Let my lord fence himself in with iron walls yet shall my spirit burst through them and crush his bones as a return for this deed And as he spoke his eyes became vermilion red and flashed like the sun or the moon and he looked like the demon Razetsu sixty six Footnote sixty six A Buddhist fiend Come shouted he make haste and pierce me with the spear Your wishes shall be obeyed said the Eta Shigayemon and thrust in a spear at his right side until it came out at his left shoulder and the blood streamed out like a fountain Then he pierced the wife from the left side and she opening her eyes said in a dying voice Farewell all you who are present May harm keep far from you Farewell farewell and as her voice waxed faint the second spear was thrust in from her right side and she breathed out her spirit Sogoro the colour of his face not even changing showed no sign of fear but opening his eyes wide said Listen my masters all you who have come to see this sight Recollect that I shall pay my thanks to my lord Kotsuke no Suke for this day s work You shall see it for yourselves so that it shall be talked of for generations to come As a sign when I am dead my head shall turn and face towards the castle When you see this doubt not that my words shall come true When he had spoken thus the officer directing the execution gave a sign to the Eta Shigayemon and ordered him to finish the execution so that Sogoro should speak no more So Shigayemon pierced him twelve or thirteen times until he died And when he was dead his head turned and faced the castle When the two councillors beheld this miracle they came down from their raised platform and knelt down before Sogoro s dead body and said Although you were but a peasant on this estate you conceived a noble plan to succour the other farmers in their distress You bruised your bones and crushed your heart for their sakes Still in that you appealed to the Shogun in person you committed a grievous crime and made light of your superiors and for this it was impossible not to punish you Still we admit that to include your wife and children in your crime and kill them before your eyes was a cruel deed What is done is done and regret is of no avail However honours shall be paid to your spirit you shall be canonized as the Saint Daimiyo and you shall be placed among the tutelar deities of my lord s family With these words the two councillors made repeated reverences before the corpse and in this they showed their faithfulness to their lord But he when the matter was reported to him only laughed scornfully at the idea that the hatred of a peasant could affect his feudal lord and said that a vassal who had dared to hatch a plot which had it not been for his high office would have been sufficient to ruin him had only met with his deserts As for causing him to be canonized let him be as he was Seeing their lord s anger his councillors could only obey But it was not long before he had cause to know that though Sogoro was dead his vengeance was yet alive The relations of Sogoro and the elders of the villages having been summoned to the Court house the following document was issued Although the property of Sogoro the elder of the village of Iwahashi is confiscated his household furniture shall be made over to his two married daughters and the village officials will look to it that these few poor things be not stolen by lawless and unprincipled men His rice fields and corn fields his mountain land and forest land will be sold by auction His house and grounds will be given over to the elder of the village The price fetched by his property will be paid over to the lord of the estate The above decree will be published in full to the peasants of the village and it is strictly forbidden to find fault with this decision The twelfth day of the twod month of the twod year of the period Shoho The peasants having heard this degree with all humility left the Court house Then the following punishments were awarded to the officers of the castle who by rejecting the petition of the peasants in the first instance had brought trouble upon their lord Dismissed from their office the resident councillors at Yedo and at the castle town Banished from the province four district governors and three bailiffs and nineteen petty officers Dismissed from office three metsukes or censors and seven magistrates Condemned to hara kiri one district governor and one Yedo bailiff The severity of this sentence is owing to the injustice of the officials in raising new and unprecedented taxes and bringing affliction upon the people and in refusing to receive the petitions of the peasants without consulting their lord thus driving them to appeal to the Shogun in person In their avarice they looked not to the future but laid too heavy a burden on the peasants so that they made an appeal to a higher power endangering the honour of their lord s house For this bad government the various officials are to be punished as above In this wise was justice carried out at the palace at Yedo and at the Court house at home But in the history of the world from the dark ages down to the present time there are few instances of one man laying down his life for the many as Sogoro did noble and peasant praise him alike As month after month passed away towards the fourth year of the period Shoho the wife of my lord Kotsuke no Suke being with child was seized with violent pains and retainers were sent to all the different temples and shrines to pray by proxy but all to no purpose she continued to suffer as before Towards the end of the seventh month of the year there appeared every night a preternatural light above the lady s chamber this was accompanied by hideous sounds as of many people laughing fiendishly and sometimes by piteous wailings as though myriads of persons were lamenting The profound distress caused by this added to her sufferings so her own privy councillor an old man took his place in the adjoining chamber and kept watch All of a sudden he heard a noise as if a number of people were walking on the boards of the roof of my lady s room then there was a sound of men and women weeping and when thunderstruck the councillor was wondering what it could all be there came a wild burst of laughter and all was silent Early the following morning the old women who had charge of my lady s household presented themselves before my lord Kotsuke no Suke and said Since the middle of last month the waiting women have been complaining to us of the ghostly noises by which my lady is nightly disturbed and they say that they cannot continue to serve her We have tried to soothe them by saying that the devils should be exorcised at once and that there was nothing to be afraid of Still we feel that their fears are not without reason and that they really cannot do their work so we beg that your lordship will take the matter into your consideration This is a passing strange story of yours however I will go myself to night to my lady s apartments and keep watch You can come with me Accordingly that night my lord Kotsuke no Suke sat up in person At the hour of the rat midnight a fearful noise of voices was heard and Sogoro and his wife bound to the fatal crosses suddenly appeared and the ghosts seizing the lady by the hand said We have come to meet you The pains you are suffering are terrible but they are nothing in comparison with those of the hell to which we are about to lead you At these words Kotsuke no Suke seizing his sword tried to sweep the ghosts away with a terrific cut but a loud peal of laughter was heard and the visions faded away Kotsuke no Suke terrified sent his retainers to the temples and shrines to pray that the demons might be cast out but the noises were heard nightly as before When the eleventh month of the year came round the apparitions of human forms in my lady s apartments became more and more frequent and terrible all the spirits railing at her and howling out that they had come to fetch her The women would all scream and faint and then the ghosts would disappear amid yells of laughter Night after night this happened and even in the daytime the visions would manifest themselves and my lady s sickness grew worse daily until in the last month of the year she died of grief and terror Then the ghost of Sogoro and his wife crucified would appear day and night in the chamber of Kotsuke no Suke floating round the room and glaring at him with red and flaming eyes The hair of the attendants would stand on end with terror and if they tried to cut at the spirits their limbs would be cramped and their feet and hands would not obey their bidding Kotsuke no Suke would draw the sword that lay by his bedside but as often as he did so the ghosts faded away only to appear again in a more hideous shape than before until at last having exhausted his strength and spirits even he became terror stricken The whole household was thrown into confusion and day after day mystic rites and incantations were performed by the priests over braziers of charcoal while prayers were recited without ceasing but the visions only became more frequent and there was no sign of their ceasing After the fifth year of Shoho the style of the years was changed to Keian and during the first year of Keian the spirits continued to haunt the palace and now they appeared in the chamber of Kotsuke no Suke s eldest son surrounding themselves with even more terrors than before and when Kotsuke no Suke was about to go to the Shogun s castle they were seen howling out their cries of vengeance in the porch of the house At last the relations of the family and the members of the household took counsel together and told Kotsuke no Suke that without doubt no ordinary means would suffice to lay the ghosts a shrine must be erected to Sogoro and divine honours paid to him after which the apparitions would assuredly cease Kotsuke no Suke having carefully considered the matter and given his consent Sogoro was canonized under the name of Sogo Daimiyo and a shrine was erected in his honour After divine honours had been paid to him the awful visions were no more seen and the ghost of Sogoro was laid for ever In the twod year of the period Keian on the eleventh day of the tenth month on the occasion of the festival of first lighting the fire on the hearth the various Daimios and Hatamotos of distinction went to the castle of the Shogun at Yedo to offer their congratulations on this occasion During the ceremonies my lord Hotta Kotsuke no Suke and Sakai Iwami no Kami lord of the castle of Matsumoto in the province of Shinshiu had a quarrel the origin of which was not made public and Sakai Iwami no Kami although he came of a brave and noble family received so severe a wound that he died on the following day at the age of forty three and in consequence of this his family was ruined and disgraced sixty seven My lord Kotsuke no Suke by great good fortune contrived to escape from the castle and took refuge in his own house whence mounting a famous horse called Hira Abumi sixty eight he fled to his castle of Sakura in Shimosa accomplishing the distance which is about sixty miles in six hours When he arrived in front of the castle he called out in a loud voice to the guard within to open the gate answering in reply to their challenge that he was Kotsuke no Suke the lord of the castle The guard not believing their ears sent word to the councillor in charge of the castle who rushed out to see if the person demanding admittance were really their lord When he saw Kotsuke no Suke he caused the gates to be opened and thinking it more than strange said Is this indeed you my lord What strange chance brings your lordship hither thus late at night on horseback and alone without a single follower Footnote sixty seven In the old days if a noble was murdered and died outside his own house he was disgraced and his estates were forfeited When the Regent of the Shogun was murdered some years since outside the castle of Yedo by a legal fiction it was given out that he had died in his own palace in order that his son might succeed to his estates Footnote sixty eight Level stirrups With these words he ushered in Kotsuke no Suke who in reply to the anxious inquiries of his people as to the cause of his sudden appearance said You may well be astonished I had a quarrel to day in the castle at Yedo with Sakai Iwami no Kami the lord of the castle of Matsumoto and I cut him down I shall soon be pursued so we must strengthen the fortress and prepare for an attack The household hearing this were greatly alarmed and the whole castle was thrown into confusion In the meanwhile the people of Kotsuke no Suke s palace at Yedo not knowing whether their lord had fled were in the greatest anxiety until a messenger came from Sakura and reported his arrival there When the quarrel inside the castle of Yedo and Kotsuke no Suke s flight had been taken cognizance of he was attainted of treason and soldiers were sent to seize him dead or alive Midzuno Setsu no Kami and Goto Yamato no Kami were charged with the execution of the order and sallied forth on the thirteenth day of the tenth month to carry it out When they arrived at the town of Sasai they sent a herald with the following message Whereas Kotsuke no Suke killed Sakai Iwami no Kami inside the castle of Yedo and has fled to his own castle without leave he is attainted of treason and we being connected with him by ties of blood and of friendship have been charged to seize him The herald delivered this message to the councillor of Kotsuke no Suke who pleading as an excuse that his lord was mad begged the two nobles to intercede for him Goto Yamato no Kami upon this called the councillor to him and spoke privately to him after which the latter took his leave and returned to the castle of Sakura In the meanwhile after consultation at Yedo it was decided that as Goto Yamato no Kami and Midzuno Setsu no Kami were related to Kotsuke no Suke and might meet with difficulties for that very reason two other nobles Ogasawara Iki no Kami and Nagai Hida no Kami should be sent to assist them with orders that should any trouble arise they should send a report immediately to Yedo In consequence of this order the two nobles with five thousand men were about to march for Sakura on the fifteenth of the month when a messenger arrived from that place bearing the following despatch for the Gorojiu from the two nobles who had preceded them In obedience to the orders of His Highness the Shogun we proceeded on the thirteenth day of this month to the castle of Sakura and conducted a thorough investigation of the affair It is true that Kotsuke no Suke has been guilty of treason but he is out of his mind his retainers have called in physicians and he is undergoing treatment by which his senses are being gradually restored and his mind is being awakened from its sleep At the time when he slew Sakai Iwami no Kami he was not accountable for his actions and will be sincerely penitent when he is aware of his crime We have taken him prisoner and have the honour to await your instructions in the meanwhile we beg by these present to let you know what we have done Signed GOTO YAMATO NO KAMI MIDZUNO SETSU NO KAMI To the Gorojiu twod year of Keian twod month fourteenth day This despatch reached Yedo on the sixteenth of the month and was read by the Gorojiu after they had left the castle and in consequence of the report of Kotsuke no Suke s madness the second expedition was put a stop to and the following instructions were sent to Goto Yamato no Kami and Midzuno Setsu no Kami With reference to the affair of Hotta Kotsuke no Suke lord of the castle of Sakura in Shimosa whose quarrel with Sakai Iwami no Kami within the castle of Yedo ended in bloodshed For this heinous crime and disregard of the sanctity of the castle it is ordered that Kotsuke no Suke be brought as a prisoner to Yedo in a litter covered with nets that his case may be judged twod year of Keian twod month Signed by the Gorojiu INABA MINO NO KAMI INOUYE KAWACHI NOKAMI KATO ECCHIU NO KAMI Upon the receipt of this despatch Hotta Kotsuke no Suke was immediately placed in a litter covered with a net of green silk and conveyed to Yedo strictly guarded by the retainers of the two nobles and having arrived at the capital was handed over to the charge of Akimoto Tajima no Kami All his retainers were quietly dispersed and his empty castle was ordered to be thrown open and given in charge to Midzuno Iki no Kami At last Kotsuke no Suke began to feel that the death of his wife and his own present misfortunes were a just retribution for the death of Sogoro and his wife and children and he was as one awakened from a dream Then night and morning in his repentance he offered up prayers to the sainted spirit of the dead farmer and acknowledged and bewailed his crime vowing that if his family were spared from ruin and re established intercession should be made at the court of the Mikado sixty nine at Kiyoto on behalf of the spirit of Sogoro so that being worshipped with even greater honours than before his name should be handed down to all generations Footnote sixty nine In the days of Shogun s power the Mikado remained the Fountain of Honour and as chief of the national religion and the direct descendant of the gods dispensed divine honours In consequence of this it happened that the spirit of Sogoro having relaxed in its vindictiveness and having ceased to persecute the house of Hotta in the first month of the fourth year of Keian Kotsuke no Suke received a summons from the Shogun and having been forgiven was made lord of the castle of Matsuyama in the province of Dewa with a revenue of twenty thousand kokus In the same year on the twentieth day of the fourth month the Shogun Prince Iyemitsu was pleased to depart this life at the age of forty eight and whether by the forgiving spirit of the prince or by the divine interposition of the sainted Sogoro Kotsuke no Suke was promoted to the castle of Utsu no Miya in the province of Shimotsuke with a revenue of eighty thousand kokus and his name was changed to Hotta Hida no Kami He also received again his original castle of Sakura with a revenue of twenty thousand kokus so that there can be no doubt that the saint was befriending him In return for these favours the shrine of Sogoro was made as beautiful as a gem It is needless to say how many of the peasants of the estate flocked to the shrine any good luck that might befall the people was ascribed to it and night and day the devout worshipped at it Here follows a copy of the petition which Sogoro presented to the Shogun We the elders of the hundred and thirty six villages of the district of Chiba in the province of Shimosa and of the district of Buji in the province of Kadzusa most reverently offer up this our humble petition When our former lord Doi Shosho was transferred to another castle in the ninth year of the period Kanye Hotta Kaga no Kami became lord of the castle of Sakura and in the seventeenth year of the same period my lord Kotsuke no Suke succeeded him Since that time the taxes laid upon us have been raised in the proportion of one to and two sho to each koku seventy Footnote seventy ten Sho one To ten To one Koku Item At the present time taxes are raised on nineteen of our articles of produce whereas our former lord only required that we should furnish him with pulse and sesamum for which he paid in rice Item Not only are we not paid now for our produce but if it is not given in to the day we are driven and goaded by the officials and if there be any further delay we are manacled and severely reprimanded so that if our own crops fail we have to buy produce from other districts and are pushed to the utmost extremity of affliction Item We have over and over again prayed to be relieved from these burthens but our petitions are not received The people are reduced to poverty so that it is hard for them to live under such grievous taxation Often they have tried to sell the land which they till but none can be found to buy so they have sometimes given over their land to the village authorities and fled with their wives to other provinces and seven hundred and thirty men or more have been reduced to begging one hundred and eighty five houses have fallen into ruins land producing seven thousand kokus has been given up and remains untilled and eleven temples have fallen into decay in consequence of the ruin of those upon whom they depended Besides this the poverty stricken farmers and women having been obliged to take refuge in other provinces and having no abiding place have been driven to evil courses and bring men to speak ill of their lord and the village officials being unable to keep order are blamed and reproved No attention has been paid to our repeated representations upon this point so we were driven to petition the Gorojiu Kuze Yamato no Kami as he was on his way to the castle but our petition was returned to us And now as a last resource we tremblingly venture to approach his Highness the Shogun in person The first year of the period Shoho twelfth month twentieth day Illustration Seal The seals of the elders of the one hundred thirty six villages The Shogun at that time was Prince Iyemitsu the grandson of Iyeyasu He received the name of Dai yu In after his death The Gorojiu at that time were Hotta Kotsuke no Suke Sakai Iwami no Kami Inaba Mino no Kami Kato Ecchiu no Kami Inouye Kawachi no Kami The Wakadoshiyori or twod council were Torii Wakasa no Kami Tsuchiya Dewa no Kami and Itakura Naizen no Sho The belief in ghosts appears to be as universal as that in the immortality of the soul upon which it depends Both in China and Japan the departed spirit is invested with the power of revisiting the earth and in a visible form tormenting its enemies and haunting those places where the perishable part of it mourned and suffered Haunted houses are slow to find tenants for ghosts almost always come with revengeful intent indeed the owners of such houses will almost pay men to live in them such is the dread which they inspire and the anxiety to blot out the stigma One cold winter s night at Yedo as I was sitting with a few Japanese friends huddled round the imperfect heat of a brazier of charcoal the conversation turned upon the story of Sogoro and upon ghostly apparitions in general Many a weird tale was told that evening and I noted down the three or four which follow for the truth of which the narrators vouched with the utmost confidence About ten years ago there lived a fishmonger named Zenroku in the Mikawa street at Kanda in Yedo He was a poor man living with his wife and one little boy His wife fell sick and died so he engaged an old woman to look after his boy while he himself went out to sell his fish It happened one day that he and the other hucksters of his guild were gambling and this coming to the ears of the authorities they were all thrown into prison Although their offence was in itself a light one still they were kept for some time in durance while the matter was being investigated and Zenroku owing to the damp and foul air of the prison fell sick with fever His little child in the meantime had been handed over by the authorities to the charge of the petty officers of the ward to which his father belonged and was being well cared for for Zenroku was known to be an honest fellow and his fate excited much compassion One night Zenroku pale and emaciated entered the house in which his boy was living and all the people joyfully congratulated him on his escape from jail Why we heard that you were sick in prison This is indeed a joyful return Then Zenroku thanked those who had taken care of the child saying that he had returned secretly by the favour of his jailers that night but that on the following day his offence would be remitted and he should be able to take possession of his house again publicly For that night he must return to the prison With this he begged those present to continue their good offices to his babe and with a sad and reluctant expression of countenance he left the house On the following day the officers of that ward were sent for by the prison authorities They thought that they were summoned that Zenroku might be handed back to them a free man as he himself had said to them but to their surprise they were told that he had died the night before in prison and were ordered to carry away his dead body for burial Then they knew that they had seen Zenroku s ghost and that when he said that he should be returned to them on the morrow he had alluded to his corpse So they buried him decently and brought up his son who is alive to this day The next story was told by a professor in the college at Yedo and although it is not of so modern a date as the last he stated it to be well authenticated and one of general notoriety About two hundred years ago there was a chief of the police named Aoyama Shuzen who lived in the street called Bancho at Yedo His duty was to detect thieves and incendiaries He was a cruel and violent man without heart or compassion and thought nothing of killing or torturing a man to gratify spite or revenge This man Shuzen had in his house a servant maid called O Kiku the Chrysanthemum who had lived in the family since her childhood and was well acquainted with her master s temper One day O Kiku accidentally broke one of a set of ten porcelain plates upon which he set a high value She knew that she would suffer for her carelessness but she thought that if she concealed the matter her punishment would be still more severe so she went at once to her master s wife and in fear and trembling confessed what she had done When Shuzen came home and heard that one of his favourite plates was broken he flew into a violent rage and took the girl to a cupboard where he left her bound with cords and every day cut off one of her fingers O Kiku tightly bound and in agony could not move but at last she contrived to bite or cut the ropes asunder and escaping into the garden threw herself into a well and was drowned From that time forth every night a voice was heard coming from the well counting one two three and so on up to nine the number of the plates that remained unbroken and then when the tenth plate should have been counted would come a burst of lamentation The servants of the house terrified at this all left their master s service until Shuzen not having a single retainer left was unable to perform his public duties and when the officers of the government heard of this he was dismissed from his office At this time there was a famous priest called Mikadzuki Shonin of the temple Denzuin who having been told of the affair came one night to the house and when the ghost began to count the plates reproved the spirit and by his prayers and admonitions caused it to cease from troubling the living The laying of disturbed spirits appears to form one of the regular functions of the Buddhist priests at least we find them playing a conspicuous part in almost every ghost story About thirty years ago there stood a house at Mitsume in the Honjo of Yedo which was said to be nightly visited by ghosts so that no man dared to live in it and it remained untenanted on that account However a man called Miura Takeshi a native of the province of Oshiu who came to Yedo to set up in business as a fencing master but was too poor to hire a house hearing that there was a haunted house for which no tenant could be found and that the owner would let any man live in it rent free said that he feared neither man nor devil and obtained leave to occupy the house So he hired a fencing room in which he gave his lessons by day and after midnight returned to the haunted house One night his wife who took charge of the house in his absence was frightened by a fearful noise proceeding from a pond in the garden and thinking that this certainly must be the ghost that she had heard so much about she covered her head with the bed clothes and remained breathless with terror When her husband came home she told him what had happened and on the following night he returned earlier than usual and waited for the ghostly noise At the same time as before a little after midnight the same sound was heard as though a gun had been fired inside the pond Opening the shutters he looked out and saw something like a black cloud floating on the water and in the cloud was the form of a bald man Thinking that there must be some cause for this he instituted careful inquiries and learned that the former tenant some ten years previously had borrowed money from a blind shampooer seventy one and being unable to pay the debt had murdered his creditor who began to press him for his money and had thrown his head into the pond The fencing master accordingly collected his pupils and emptied the pond and found a skull at the bottom of it so he called in a priest and buried the skull in a temple causing prayers to be offered up for the repose of the murdered man s soul Thus the ghost was laid and appeared no more Footnote seventy one The apparently poor shaven pated and blind shampooers of Japan drive a thriving trade as money lenders They give out small sums at an interest of twenty per cent per month two hundred ten per cent per annum and woe betide the luckless wight who falls into their clutches The belief in curses hanging over families for generations is as common as that in ghosts and supernatural apparitions There is a strange story of this nature in the house of Asai belonging to the Hatamoto class The ancestor of the present representative six generations ago had a certain concubine who was in love with a man who frequented the house and wished in her heart to marry him but being a virtuous woman she never thought of doing any evil deed But the wife of my lord Asai was jealous of the girl and persuaded her husband that her rival in his affections had gone astray when he heard this he was very angry and beat her with a candlestick so that he put out her left eye The girl who had indignantly protested her innocence finding herself so cruelly handled pronounced a curse against the house upon which her master seizing the candlestick again dashed out her brains and killed her Shortly afterwards my lord Asai lost his left eye and fell sick and died and from that time forth to this day it is said that the representatives of the house have all lost their left eyes after the age of forty and shortly afterwards they have fallen sick and died at the same age as the cruel lord who killed his concubine NOTE Of the many fair scenes of Yedo none is better worth visiting than the temple of Zojoji one of

BY A DEVIL OF HIS OWN CREATION Once upon a time a certain Ronin Tajima Shume by name an able and well read man being on his travels to see the world went up to Kiyoto by the Tokaido seventy two One day in the neighbourhood of Nagoya in the province of Owari he fell in with a wandering priest with whom he entered into conversation Finding that they were bound for the same place they agreed to travel together beguiling their weary way by pleasant talk on divers matters and so by degrees as they became more intimate they began to speak without restraint about their private affairs and the priest trusting thoroughly in the honour of his companion told him the object of his journey Footnote seventy two The road of the Eastern Sea the famous high road leading from Kiyoto to Yedo The name is also used to indicate the provinces through which it runs For some time past said he I have nourished a wish that has engrossed all my thoughts for I am bent on setting up a molten image in honour of Buddha with this object I have wandered through various provinces collecting alms and who knows by what weary toil we have succeeded in amassing two hundred ounces of silver enough I trust to erect a handsome bronze figure What says the proverb He who bears a jewel in his bosom bears poison Hardly had the Ronin heard these words of the priest than an evil heart arose within him and he thought to himself Man s life from the womb to the grave is made up of good and of ill luck Here am I nearly forty years old a wanderer without a calling or even a hope of advancement in the world To be sure it seems a shame yet if I could steal the money this priest is boasting about I could live at ease for the rest of my days and so he began casting about how best he might compass his purpose But the priest far from guessing the drift of his comrade s thoughts journeyed cheerfully on till they reached the town of Kuana Here there is an arm of the sea which is crossed in ferry boats that start as soon as some twenty or thirty passengers are gathered together and in one of these boats the two travellers embarked About half way across the priest was taken with a sudden necessity to go to the side of the boat and the Ronin following him tripped him up whilst no one was looking and flung him into the sea When the boatmen and passengers heard the splash and saw the priest struggling in the water they were afraid and made every effort to save him but the wind was fair and the boat running swiftly under the bellying sails so they were soon a few hundred yards off from the drowning man who sank before the boat could be turned to rescue him When he saw this the Ronin feigned the utmost grief and dismay and said to his fellow passengers This priest whom we have just lost was my cousin he was going to Kiyoto to visit the shrine of his patron and as I happened to have business there as well we settled to travel together Now alas by this misfortune my cousin is dead and I am left alone He spoke so feelingly and wept so freely that the passengers believed his story and pitied and tried to comfort him Then the Ronin said to the boatmen We ought by rights to report this matter to the authorities but as I am pressed for time and the business might bring trouble on yourselves as well perhaps we had better hush it up for the present and I will at once go on to Kiyoto and tell my cousin s patron besides writing home about it What think you gentlemen added he turning to the other travellers They of course were only too glad to avoid any hindrance to their onward journey and all with one voice agreed to what the Ronin had proposed and so the matter was settled When at length they reached the shore they left the boat and every man went his way but the Ronin overjoyed in his heart took the wandering priest s luggage and putting it with his own pursued his journey to Kiyoto On reaching the capital the Ronin changed his name from Shume to Tokubei and giving up his position as a Samurai turned merchant and traded with the dead man s money Fortune favouring his speculations he began to amass great wealth and lived at his ease denying himself nothing and in course of time he married a wife who bore him a child Thus the days and months wore on till one fine summer s night some three years after the priest s death Tokubei stepped out on to the verandah of his house to enjoy the cool air and the beauty of the moonlight Feeling dull and lonely he began musing over all kinds of things when on a sudden the deed of murder and theft done so long ago vividly recurred to his memory and he thought to himself Here am I grown rich and fat on the money I wantonly stole Since then all has gone well with me yet had I not been poor I had never turned assassin nor thief Woe betide me what a pity it was and as he was revolving the matter in his mind a feeling of remorse came over him in spite of all he could do While his conscience thus smote him he suddenly to his utter amazement beheld the faint outline of a man standing near a fir tree in the garden on looking more attentively he perceived that the man s whole body was thin and worn and the eyes sunken and dim and in the poor ghost that was before him he recognized the very priest whom he had thrown into the sea at Kuana Chilled with horror he looked again and saw that the priest was smiling in scorn He would have fled into the house but the ghost stretched forth its withered arm and clutching the back of his neck scowled at him with a vindictive glare and a hideous ghastliness of mien so unspeakably awful that any ordinary man would have swooned with fear But Tokubei tradesman though he was had once been a soldier and was not easily matched for daring so he shook off the ghost and leaping into the room for his dirk laid about him boldly enough but strike as he would the spirit fading into the air eluded his blows and suddenly reappeared only to vanish again and from that time forth Tokubei knew no rest and was haunted night and day At length undone by such ceaseless vexation Tokubei fell ill and kept muttering Oh misery misery the wandering priest is coming to torture me Hearing his moans and the disturbance he made the people in the house fancied he was mad and called in a physician who prescribed for him But neither pill nor potion could cure Tokubei whose strange frenzy soon became the talk of the whole neighbourhood Now it chanced that the story reached the ears of a certain wandering priest who lodged in the next street When he heard the particulars this priest gravely shook his head as though he knew all about it and sent a friend to Tokubei s house to say that a wandering priest dwelling hard by had heard of his illness and were it never so grievous would undertake to heal it by means of his prayers and Tokubei s wife driven half wild by her husband s sickness lost not a moment in sending for the priest and taking him into the sick man s room But no sooner did Tokubei see the priest than he yelled out Help help Here is the wandering priest come to torment me again Forgive forgive and hiding his head under the coverlet he lay quivering all over Then the priest turned all present out of the room put his mouth to the affrighted man s ear and whispered Three years ago at the Kuana ferry you flung me into the water and well you remember it But Tokubei was speechless and could only quake with fear Happily continued the priest I had learned to swim and to dive as a boy so I reached the shore and after wandering through many provinces succeeded in setting up a bronze figure to Buddha thus fulfilling the wish of my heart On my journey homewards I took a lodging in the next street and there heard of your marvellous ailment Thinking I could divine its cause I came to see you and am glad to find I was not mistaken You have done a hateful deed but am I not a priest and have I not forsaken the things of this world and would it not ill become me to bear malice Repent therefore and abandon your evil ways To see you do so I should esteem the height of happiness Be of good cheer now and look me in the face and you will see that I am really a living man and no vengeful goblin come to torment you Seeing he had no ghost to deal with and overwhelmed by the priest s kindness Tokubei burst into tears and answered Indeed indeed I don t know what to say In a fit of madness I was tempted to kill and rob you Fortune befriended me ever after but the richer I grew the more keenly I felt how wicked I had been and the more I foresaw that my victim s vengeance would some day overtake me Haunted by this thought I lost my nerve till one night I beheld your spirit and from that time forth fell ill But how you managed to escape and are still alive is more than I can understand A guilty man said the priest with a smile shudders at the rustling of the wind or the chattering of a stork s beak a murderer s conscience preys upon his mind till he sees what is not Poverty drives a man to crimes which he repents of in his wealth How true is the doctrine of Moshi seventy three that the heart of man pure by nature is corrupted by circumstances Footnote seventy three Mencius Thus he held forth and Tokubei who had long since repented of his crime implored forgiveness and gave him a large sum of money saying Half of this is the amount I stole from you three years since the other half I entreat you to accept as interest or as a gift The priest at first refused the money but Tokubei insisted on his accepting it and did all he could to detain him but in vain for the priest went his way and bestowed the money on the poor and needy As for Tokubei himself he soon shook off his disorder and thenceforward lived at peace with all men revered both at home and abroad and ever intent on good and charitable deeds CONCERNING CERTAIN SUPERSTITIONS CONCERNING CERTAIN SUPERSTITIONS Cats foxes and badgers are regarded with superstitious awe by the Japanese who attribute to them the power of assuming the human shape in order to bewitch mankind Like the fairies of our Western tales however they work for good as well as for evil ends To do them a good turn is to secure powerful allies but woe betide him who injures them he and his will assuredly suffer for it Cats and foxes seem to have been looked upon as uncanny beasts all the world over but it is new to me that badgers should have a place in fairy land The island of Shikoku the southernmost of the great Japanese islands appears to be the part of the country in which the badger is regarded with the greatest veneration Among the many tricks which he plays upon the human race is one of which I have a clever representation carved in ivory Lying in wait in lonely places after dusk the badger watches for benighted wayfarers should one appear the beast drawing a long breath distends his belly and drums delicately upon it with his clenched fist producing such entrancing tones that the traveller cannot resist turning aside to follow the sound which Will o the wisp like recedes as he advances until it lures him on to his destruction Love is however the most powerful engine which the cat the fox and the badger alike put forth for the ruin of man No German poet ever imagined a more captivating water nymph than the fair virgins by whom the knight of Japanese romance is assailed the true hero recognizes and slays the beast the weaker mortal yields and perishes The Japanese story books abound with tales about the pranks of these creatures which like ghosts even play a part in the histories of ancient and noble families I have collected a few of these and now beg a hearing for a distinguished and two tailed seventy four connection of Puss in Boots and the Chatte Blanche Footnote seventy four Cats are found in Japan as in the Isle of Man with stumps where they should have tails Sometimes this is the result of art sometimes of a natural shortcoming The cats of Yedo are of bad repute as mousers their energies being relaxed by much petting at the hands of ladies The Cat of Nabeshima so says tradition was a monster with two tails THE VAMPIRE CAT OF NABESHIMA There is a tradition in the Nabeshima seventy five family that many years ago the Prince of Hizen was bewitched and cursed by a cat that had been kept by one of his retainers This prince had in his house a lady of rare beauty called O Toyo amongst all his ladies she was the favourite and there was none who could rival her charms and accomplishments One day the Prince went out into the garden with O Toyo and remained enjoying the fragrance of the flowers until sunset when they returned to the palace never noticing that they were being followed by a large cat Having parted with her lord O Toyo retired to her own room and went to bed At midnight she awoke with a start and became aware of a huge cat that crouched watching her and when she cried out the beast sprang on her and fixing its cruel teeth in her delicate throat throttled her to death What a piteous end for so fair a dame the darling of her prince s heart to die suddenly bitten to death by a cat Then the cat having scratched out a grave under the verandah buried the corpse of O Toyo and assuming her form began to bewitch the Prince Footnote seventy five The family of the Prince of Hizen one of the eighteen chief Daimios of Japan But my lord the Prince knew nothing of all this and little thought that the beautiful creature who caressed and fondled him was an impish and foul beast that had slain his mistress and assumed her shape in order to drain out his life s blood Day by day as time went on the Prince s strength dwindled away the colour of his face was changed and became pale and livid and he was as a man suffering from a deadly sickness Seeing this his councillors and his wife became greatly alarmed so they summoned the physicians who prescribed various remedies for him but the more medicine he took the more serious did his illness appear and no treatment was of any avail But most of all did he suffer in the night time when his sleep would be troubled and disturbed by hideous dreams In consequence of this his councillors nightly appointed a hundred of his retainers to sit up and watch over him but strange to say towards ten o clock on the very first night that the watch was set the guard were seized with a sudden and unaccountable drowsiness which they could not resist until one by one every man had fallen asleep Then the false O Toyo came in and harassed the Prince until morning The following night the same thing occurred and the Prince was subjected to the imp s tyranny while his guards slept helplessly around him Night after night this was repeated until at last three of the Prince s councillors determined themselves to sit up on guard and see whether they could overcome this mysterious drowsiness but they fared no better than the others and by ten o clock were fast asleep The next day the three councillors held a solemn conclave and their chief one Isahaya Buzen said This is a marvellous thing that a guard of a hundred men should thus be overcome by sleep Of a surety the spell that is upon my lord and upon his guard must be the work of witchcraft Now as all our efforts are of no avail let us seek out Ruiten the chief priest of the temple called Miyo In and beseech him to put up prayers for the recovery of my lord Illustration THE CAT OF NABESHIMA And the other councillors approving what Isahaya Buzen had said they went to the priest Ruiten and engaged him to recite litanies that the Prince might be restored to health So it came to pass that Ruiten the chief priest of Miyo In offered up prayers nightly for the Prince One night at the ninth hour midnight when he had finished his religious exercises and was preparing to lie down to sleep he fancied that he heard a noise outside in the garden as if some one were washing himself at the well Deeming this passing strange he looked down from the window and there in the moonlight he saw a handsome young soldier some twenty four years of age washing himself who when he had finished cleaning himself and had put on his clothes stood before the figure of Buddha and prayed fervently for the recovery of my lord the Prince Ruiten looked on with admiration and the young man when he had made an end of his prayer was going away but the priest stopped him calling out to him Sir I pray you to tarry a little I have something to say to you At your reverence s service What may you please to want Pray be so good as to step up here and have a little talk By your reverence s leave and with this he went upstairs Then Ruiten said Sir I cannot conceal my admiration that you being so young a man should have so loyal a spirit I am Ruiten the chief priest of this temple who am engaged in praying for the recovery of my lord Pray what is your name My name sir is Ito Soda and I am serving in the infantry of Nabeshima Since my lord has been sick my one desire has been to assist in nursing him but being only a simple soldier I am not of sufficient rank to come into his presence so I have no resource but to pray to the gods of the country and to Buddha that my lord may regain his health When Ruiten heard this he shed tears in admiration of the fidelity of Ito Soda and said Your purpose is indeed a good one but what a strange sickness this is that my lord is afflicted with Every night he suffers from horrible dreams and the retainers who sit up with him are all seized with a mysterious sleep so that not one can keep awake It is very wonderful Yes replied Soda after a moment s reflection this certainly must be witchcraft If I could but obtain leave to sit up one night with the Prince I would fain see whether I could not resist this drowsiness and detect the goblin At last the priest said I am in relations of friendship with Isahaya Buzen the chief councillor of the Prince I will speak to him of you and of your loyalty and will intercede with him that you may attain your wish Indeed sir I am most thankful I am not prompted by any vain thought of self advancement should I succeed all I wish for is the recovery of my lord I commend myself to your kind favour Well then to morrow night I will take you with me to the councillor s house Thank you sir and farewell And so they parted On the following evening Ito Soda returned to the temple Miyo In and having found Ruiten accompanied him to the house of Isahaya Buzen then the priest leaving Soda outside went in to converse with the councillor and inquire after the Prince s health And pray sir how is my lord Is he in any better condition since I have been offering up prayers for him Indeed no his illness is very severe We are certain that he must be the victim of some foul sorcery but as there are no means of keeping a guard awake after ten o clock we cannot catch a sight of the goblin so we are in the greatest trouble I feel deeply for you it must be most distressing However I have something to tell you I think that I have found a man who will detect the goblin and I have brought him with me Indeed who is the man Well he is one of my lord s foot soldiers named Ito Soda a faithful fellow and I trust that you will grant his request to be permitted to sit up with my lord Certainly it is wonderful to find so much loyalty and zeal in a common soldier replied Isahaya Buzen after a moment s reflection still it is impossible to allow a man of such low rank to perform the office of watching over my lord It is true that he is but a common soldier urged the priest but why not raise his rank in consideration of his fidelity and then let him mount guard It would be time enough to promote him after my lord s recovery But come let me see this Ito Soda that I may know what manner of man he is if he pleases me I will consult with the other councillors and perhaps we may grant his request I will bring him in forthwith replied Ruiten who thereupon went out to fetch the young man When he returned the priest presented Ito Soda to the councillor who looked at him attentively and being pleased with his comely and gentle appearance said So I hear that you are anxious to be permitted to mount guard in my lord s room at night Well I must consult with the other councillors and we will see what can be done for you When the young soldier heard this he was greatly elated and took his leave after warmly thanking Buiten who had helped him to gain his object The next day the councillors held a meeting and sent for Ito Soda and told him that he might keep watch with the other retainers that very night So he went his way in high spirits and at nightfall having made all his preparations took his place among the hundred gentlemen who were on duty in the prince s bed room Now the Prince slept in the centre of the room and the hundred guards around him sat keeping themselves awake with entertaining conversation and pleasant conceits But as ten o clock approached they began to doze off as they sat and in spite of all their endeavours to keep one another awake by degrees they all fell asleep Ito Soda all this while felt an irresistible desire to sleep creeping over him and though he tried by all sorts of ways to rouse himself he saw that there was no help for it but by resorting to an extreme measure for which he had already made his preparations Drawing out a piece of oil paper which he had brought with him and spreading it over the mats he sat down upon it then he took the small knife which he carried in the sheath of his dirk and stuck it into his own thigh For awhile the pain of the wound kept him awake but as the slumber by which he was assailed was the work of sorcery little by little he became drowsy again Then he twisted the knife round and round in his thigh so that the pain becoming very violent he was proof against the feeling of sleepiness and kept a faithful watch Now the oil paper which he had spread under his legs was in order to prevent the blood which might spurt from his wound from defiling the mats So Ito Soda remained awake but the rest of the guard slept and as he watched suddenly the sliding doors of the Prince s room were drawn open and he saw a figure coming in stealthily and as it drew nearer the form was that of a marvellously beautiful woman some twenty three years of age Cautiously she looked around her and when she saw that all the guard were asleep she smiled an ominous smile and was going up to the Prince s bedside when she perceived that in one corner of the room there was a man yet awake This seemed to startle her but she went up to Soda and said I am not used to seeing you here Who are you My name is Ito Soda and this is the first night that I have been on guard A troublesome office truly Why here are all the rest of the guard asleep How is it that you alone are awake You are a trusty watchman There is nothing to boast about I m asleep myself fast and sound What is that wound on your knee It is all red with blood Oh I felt very sleepy so I stuck my knife into my thigh and the pain of it has kept me awake What wondrous loyalty said the lady Is it not the duty of a retainer to lay down his life for his master Is such a scratch as this worth thinking about Then the lady went up to the sleeping prince and said How fares it with my lord to night But the Prince worn out with sickness made no reply But Soda was watching her eagerly and guessed that it was O Toyo and made up his mind that if she attempted to harass the Prince he would kill her on the spot The goblin however which in the form of O Toyo had been tormenting the Prince every night and had come again that night for no other purpose was defeated by the watchfulness of Ito Soda for whenever she drew near to the sick man thinking to put her spells upon him she would turn and look behind her and there she saw Ito Soda glaring at her so she had no help for it but to go away again and leave the Prince undisturbed At last the day broke and the other officers when they awoke and opened their eyes saw that Ito Soda had kept awake by stabbing himself in the thigh and they were greatly ashamed and went home crestfallen That morning Ito Soda went to the house of Isahaya Buzen and told him all that had occurred the previous night The councillors were all loud in their praises of Ito Soda s behaviour and ordered him to keep watch again that night At the same hour the false O Toyo came and looked all round the room and all the guard were asleep excepting Ito Soda who was wide awake and so being again frustrated she returned to her own apartments Now as since Soda had been on guard the Prince had passed quiet nights his sickness began to get better and there was great joy in the palace and Soda was promoted and rewarded with an estate In the meanwhile O Toyo seeing that her nightly visits bore no fruits kept away and from that time forth the night guard were no longer subject to fits of drowsiness This coincidence struck Soda as very strange so he went to Isahaya Buzen and told him that of a certainty this O Toyo was no other than a goblin Isahaya Buzen reflected for a while and said Well then how shall we kill the foul thing I will go to the creature s room as if nothing were the matter and try to kill her but in case she should try to escape I will beg you to order eight men to stop outside and lie in wait for her Having agreed upon this plan Soda went at nightfall to O Toyo s apartment pretending to have been sent with a message from the Prince When she saw him arrive she said What message have you brought me from my lord Oh nothing in particular Be so look as to look at this letter and as he spoke he drew near to her and suddenly drawing his dirk cut at her but the goblin springing back seized a halberd and glaring fiercely at Soda said How dare you behave like this to one of your lord s ladies I will have you dismissed and she tried to strike Soda with the halberd But Soda fought desperately with his dirk and the goblin seeing that she was no match for him threw away the halberd and from a beautiful woman became suddenly transformed into a cat which springing up the sides of the room jumped on to the roof Isahaya Buzen and his eight men who were watching outside shot at the cat but missed it and the beast made good its escape So the cat fled to the mountains and did much mischief among the surrounding people until at last the Prince of Hizen ordered a great hunt and the beast was killed But the Prince recovered from his sickness and Ito Soda was richly rewarded THE STORY OF THE FAITHFUL CAT About sixty years ago in the summertime a man went to pay a visit at a certain house at Osaka and in the course of conversation said I have eaten some very extraordinary cakes to day and on being asked what he meant he told the following story I received the cakes from the relatives of a family who were celebrating the hundredth anniversary of the death of a cat that had belonged to their ancestors When I asked the history of the affair I was told that in former days a young girl of the family when she was about sixteen years old used always to be followed about by a tom cat who was reared in the house so much so that the two were never separated for an instant When her father perceived this he was very angry thinking that the tom cat forgetting the kindness with which he had been treated for years in the house had fallen in love with his daughter and intended to cast a spell upon her so he determined that he must kill the beast As he was planning this in secret the cat overheard him and that night went to his pillow and assuming a human voice said to him You suspect me of being in love with your daughter and although you might well be justified in so thinking your suspicions are groundless The fact is this There is a very large old rat who has been living for many years in your granary Now it is this old rat who is in love with my young mistress and this is why I dare not leave her side for a moment for fear the old rat should carry her off Therefore I pray you to dispel your suspicions But as I by myself am no match for the rat there is a famous cat named Buchi at the house of mister So and so at Ajikawa if you will borrow that cat we will soon make an end of the old rat When the father awoke from his dream he thought it so wonderful that he told the household of it and the following day he got up very early and went off to Ajikawa to inquire for the house which the cat had indicated and had no difficulty in finding it so he called upon the master of the house and told him what his own cat had said and how he wished to borrow the cat Buchi for a little while That s a very easy matter to settle said the other pray take him with you at once and accordingly the father went home with the cat Buchi in charge That night he put the two cats into the granary and after a little while a frightful clatter was heard and then all was still again so the people of the house opened the door and crowded out to see what had happened and there they beheld the two cats and the rat all locked together and panting for breath so they cut the throat of the rat which was as big as either of the cats then they attended to the two cats but although they gave them ginseng seventy six and other restoratives they both got weaker and weaker until at last they died So the rat was thrown into the river but the two cats were buried with all honours in a neighbouring temple Footnote seventy six A restorative in high repute The best sorts are brought from Corea HOW A MAN WAS BEWITCHED AND HAD HIS HEAD SHAVED BY THE FOXES In the village of Iwahara in the province of Shinshiu there dwelt a family which had acquired considerable wealth in the wine trade On some auspicious occasion it happened that a number of guests were gathered together at their house feasting on wine and fish and as the wine cup went round the conversation turned upon foxes Among the guests was a certain carpenter Tokutaro by name a man about thirty years of age of a stubborn and obstinate turn who said Well sirs you ve been talking for some time of men being bewitched by foxes surely you must be under their influence yourselves to say such things How on earth can foxes have such power over men At any rate men must be great fools to be so deluded Let s have no more of this nonsense Upon this a man who was sitting by him answered Tokutaro little knows what goes on in the world or he would not speak so How many myriads of men are there who have been bewitched by foxes Why there have been at least twenty or thirty men tricked by the brutes on the Maki Moor alone It s hard to disprove facts that have happened before our eyes You re no better than a pack of born idiots said Tokutaro I will engage to go out to the Maki Moor this very night and prove it There is not a fox in all Japan that can make a fool of Tokutaro Thus he spoke in his pride but the others were all angry with him for boasting and said If you return without anything having happened we will pay for five measures of wine and a thousand copper cash worth of fish and if you are bewitched you shall do as much for us Tokutaro took the bet and at nightfall set forth for the Maki Moor by himself As he neared the moor he saw before him a small bamboo grove into which a fox ran and it instantly occurred to him that the foxes of the moor would try to bewitch him As he was yet looking he suddenly saw the daughter of the headman of the village of Upper Horikane who was married to the headman of the village of Maki Pray where are you going to Master Tokutaro said she I am going to the village hard by Then as you will have to pass my native place if you will allow me I will accompany you so far Tokutaro thought this very odd and made up his mind that it was a fox trying to make a fool of him he accordingly determined to turn the tables on the fox and answered It is a long time since I have had the pleasure of seeing you and as it seems that your house is on my road I shall be glad to escort you so far With this he walked behind her thinking he should certainly see the end of a fox s tail peeping out but look as he might there was nothing to be seen At last they came to the village of Upper Horikane and when they reached the cottage of the girl s father the family all came out surprised to see her Oh dear oh dear here is our daughter come I hope there is nothing the matter And so they went on for some time asking a string of questions In the meanwhile Tokutaro went round to the kitchen door at the back of the house and beckoning out the master of the house said The girl who has come with me is not really your daughter As I was going to the Maki Moor when I arrived at the bamboo grove a fox jumped up in front of me and when it had dashed into the grove it immediately took the shape of your daughter and offered to accompany me to the village so I pretended to be taken in by the brute and came with it so far On hearing this the master of the house put his head on one side and mused a while then calling his wife he repeated the story to her in a whisper But she flew into a great rage with Tokutaro and said This is a pretty way of insulting people s daughters The girl is our daughter and there s no mistake about it How dare you invent such lies Well said Tokutaro you are quite right to say so but still there is no doubt that this is a case of witchcraft Seeing how obstinately he held to his opinion the old folks were sorely perplexed and said What do you think of doing Pray leave the matter to me I ll soon strip the false skin off and show the beast to you in its true colours Do you two go into the store closet and wait there With this he went into the kitchen and seizing the girl by the back of the neck forced her down by the hearth Oh Master Tokutaro what means this brutal violence Mother father help So the girl cried and screamed but Tokutaro only laughed and said So you thought to bewitch me did you From the moment you jumped into the wood I was on the look out for you to play me some trick I ll soon make you show what you really are and as he said this he twisted her two hands behind her back and trod upon her and tortured her but she only wept and cried Oh it hurts it hurts If this is not enough to make you show your true form I ll roast you to death and he piled firewood on the hearth and tucking up her dress scorched her severely Oh oh this is more than I can bear and with this she expired The two old people then came running in from the rear of the house and pushing aside Tokutaro folded their daughter in their arms and put their hands to her mouth to feel whether she still breathed but life was extinct and not the sign of a fox s tail was to be seen about her Then they seized Tokutaro by the collar and cried On pretence that our true daughter was a fox you have roasted her to death Murderer Here you there bring ropes and cords and secure this Tokutaro So the servants obeyed and several of them seized Tokutaro and bound him to a pillar Then the master of the house turning to Tokutaro said You have murdered our daughter before our very eyes I shall report the matter to the lord of the manor and you will assuredly pay for this with your head Be prepared for the worst And as he said this glaring fiercely at Tokutaro they carried the corpse of his daughter into the store closet As they were sending to make the matter known in the village of Maki and taking other measures who should come up but the priest of the temple called Anrakuji in the village of Iwahara with an acolyte and a servant who called out in a loud voice from the front door Is all well with the honourable master of this house I have been to say prayers to day in a neighbouring village and on my way back I could not pass the door without at least inquiring after your welfare If you are at home I would fain pay my respects to you As he spoke thus in a loud voice he was heard from the back of the house and the master got up and went out and after the usual compliments on meeting had been exchanged said I ought to have the honour of inviting you to step inside this evening but really we are all in the greatest trouble and I must beg you to excuse my impoliteness Indeed Pray what may be the matter replied the priest And when the master of the house had told the whole story from beginning to end he was thunderstruck and said Truly this must be a terrible distress to you Then the priest looked on one side and saw Tokutaro bound and exclaimed Is not that Tokutaro that I see there Oh your reverence replied Tokutaro piteously it was this that and the other and I took it into my head that the young lady was a fox and so I killed her But I pray your reverence to intercede for me and save my life and as he spoke the tears started from his eyes To be sure said the priest you may well bewail yourself however if I save your life will you consent to become my disciple and enter the priesthood Only save my life and I ll become your disciple with all my heart When the priest heard this he called out the parents and said to them It would seem that though I am but a foolish old priest my coming here to day has been unusually well timed I have a request to make of you Your putting Tokutaro to death won t bring your daughter to life again I have heard his story and there certainly was no malice prepense on his part to kill your daughter What he did he did thinking to do a service to your family and it would surely be better to hush the matter up He wishes moreover to give himself over to me and to become my disciple It is as you say replied the father and mother speaking together Revenge will not recall our daughter Please dispel our grief by shaving his head and making a priest of him on the spot I ll shave him at once before your eyes answered the priest who immediately caused the cords which bound Tokutaro to be untied and putting on his priest s scarf made him join his hands together in a posture of prayer Then the reverend man stood up behind him razor in hand and intoning a hymn gave two or three strokes of the razor which he then handed to his acolyte who made a clean shave of Tokutaro s hair When the latter had finished his obeisance to the priest and the ceremony was over there was a loud burst of laughter and at the same moment the day broke and Tokutaro found himself alone in the middle of a large moor At first in his surprise he thought that it was all a dream and was much annoyed at having been tricked by the foxes He then passed his hand over his head and found that he was shaved quite bald There was nothing for it but to get up wrap a handkerchief round his head and go back to the place where his friends were assembled Hallo Tokutaro so you ve come back Well how about the foxes Really gentlemen replied he bowing I am quite ashamed to appear before you Then he told them the whole story and when he had finished pulled off the kerchief and showed his bald pate What a capital joke shouted his listeners and amid roars of laughter claimed the bet of fish and wine It was duly paid but Tokutaro never allowed his hair to grow again and renounced the world and became a priest under the name of Sainen There are a great many stories told of men being shaved by the foxes but this story came under the personal observation of mister Shominsai a teacher of the city of Yedo during a holiday trip which he took to the country where the event occurred and I seventy seven have recorded it in the very selfsame words in which he told it to me Footnote seventy seven The author of the Kanzen Yawa the book from which the story is taken THE GRATEFUL FOXES One fine spring day two friends went out to a moor to gather fern attended by a boy with a bottle of wine and a box of provisions As they were straying about they saw at the foot of a hill a fox that had brought out its cub to play and whilst they looked on struck by the strangeness of the sight three children came up from a neighbouring village with baskets in their hands on the same errand as themselves As soon as the children saw the foxes they picked up a bamboo stick and took the creatures stealthily in the rear and when the old foxes took to flight they surrounded them and beat them with the stick so that they ran away as fast as their legs could carry them but two of the boys held down the cub and seizing it by the scruff of the neck went off in high glee The two friends were looking on all the while and one of them raising his voice shouted out Hallo you boys what are you doing with that fox The eldest of the boys replied We re going to take him home and sell him to a young man in our village He ll buy him and then he ll boil him in a pot and eat him Well replied the other after considering the matter attentively I suppose it s all the same to you whom you sell him to You d better let me have him Oh but the young man from our village promised us a good round sum if we could find a fox and got us to come out to the hills and catch one and so we can t sell him to you at any price Well I suppose it cannot be helped then but how much would the young man give you for the cub Oh he ll give us three hundred cash at least Then I ll give you half a bu seventy eight and so you ll gain five hundred cash by the transaction Footnote seventy eight Bu This coin is generally called by foreigners ichibu which means one bu To talk of a hundred ichibus is as though a Japanese were to say a hundred one shillings Four bus make a riyo or ounce and any sum above three bus is spoken of as so many riyos and bus as one hundred one riyos and three bus equal four hundred seven bus The bu is worth about ones fourd Oh we ll sell him for that sir How shall we hand him over to you Just tie him up here said the other and so he made fast the cub round the neck with the string of the napkin in which the luncheon box was wrapped and gave half a bu to the three boys who ran away delighted The man s friend upon this said to him Well certainly you have got queer tastes What on earth are you going to keep the fox for How very unkind of you to speak of my tastes like that If we had not interfered just now the fox s cub would have lost its life If we had not seen the affair there would have been no help for it How could I stand by and see life taken It was but a little I spent only half a bu to save the cub but had it cost a fortune I should not have grudged it I thought you were intimate enough with me to know my heart but to day you have accused me of being eccentric and I see how mistaken I have been in you However our friendship shall cease from this day forth And when he had said this with a great deal of firmness the other retiring backwards and bowing with his hands on his knees replied Indeed indeed I am filled with admiration at the goodness of your heart When I hear you speak thus I feel more than ever how great is the love I bear you I thought that you might wish to use the cub as a sort of decoy to lead the old ones to you that you might pray them to bring prosperity and virtue to your house When I called you eccentric just now I was but trying your heart because I had some suspicions of you and now I am truly ashamed of myself And as he spoke still bowing the other replied Really was that indeed your thought Then I pray you to forgive me for my violent language When the two friends had thus become reconciled they examined the cub and saw that it had a slight wound in its foot and could not walk and while they were thinking what they should do they spied out the herb called Doctor s Nakase which was just sprouting so they rolled up a little of it in their fingers and applied it to the part Then they pulled out some boiled rice from their luncheon box and offered it to the cub but it showed no sign of wanting to eat so they stroked it gently on the back and petted it and as the pain of the wound seemed to have subsided they were admiring the properties of the herb when opposite to them they saw the old foxes sitting watching them by the side of some stacks of rice straw Look there the old foxes have come back out of fear for their cub s safety Come we will set it free And with these words they untied the string round the cub s neck and turned its head towards the spot where the old foxes sat and as the wounded foot was no longer painful with one bound it dashed to its parents side and licked them all over for joy while they seemed to bow their thanks looking towards the two friends So with peace in their hearts the latter went off to another place and choosing a pretty spot produced the wine bottle and ate their noon day meal and after a pleasant day they returned to their homes and became firmer friends than ever Now the man who had rescued the fox s cub was a tradesman in good circumstances he had three or four agents and two maid servants besides men servants and altogether he lived in a liberal manner He was married and this union had brought him one son who had reached his tenth year but had been attacked by a strange disease which defied all the physician s skill and drugs At last a famous physician prescribed the liver taken from a live fox which as he said would certainly effect a cure If that were not forthcoming the most expensive medicine in the world would not restore the boy to health When the parents heard this they were at their wits end However they told the state of the case to a man who lived on the mountains Even though our child should die for it they said we will not ourselves deprive other creatures of their lives but you who live among the hills are sure to hear when your neighbours go out fox hunting We don t care what price we might have to pay for a fox s liver pray buy one for us at any expense So they pressed him to exert himself on their behalf and he having promised faithfully to execute the commission went his way In the night of the following day there came a messenger who announced himself as coming from the person who had undertaken to procure the fox s liver so the master of the house went out to see him I have come from mister So and so Last night the fox s liver that you required fell into his hands so he sent me to bring it to you With these words the messenger produced a small jar adding In a few days he will let you know the price When he had delivered his message the master of the house was greatly pleased and said Indeed I am deeply grateful for this kindness which will save my son s life Then the goodwife came out and received the jar with every mark of politeness We must make a present to the messenger Indeed sir I ve already been paid for my trouble Well at any rate you must stop the night here Thank you sir I ve a relation in the next village whom I have not seen for a long while and I will pass the night with him and so he took his leave and went away The parents lost no time in sending to let the physician know that they had procured the fox s liver The next day the doctor came and compounded a medicine for the patient which at once produced a good effect and there was no little joy in the household As luck would have it three days after this the man whom they had commissioned to buy the fox s liver came to the house so the goodwife hurried out to meet him and welcome him How quickly you fulfilled our wishes and how kind of you to send at once The doctor prepared the medicine and now our boy can get up and walk about the room and it s all owing to your goodness Wait a bit cried the guest who did not know what to make of the joy of the two parents The commission with which you entrusted me about the fox s liver turned out to be a matter of impossibility so I came to day to make my excuses and now I really can t understand what you are so grateful to me for We are thanking you sir replied the master of the house bowing with his hands on the ground for the fox s liver which we asked you to procure for us I really am perfectly unaware of having sent you a fox s liver there must be some mistake here Pray inquire carefully into the matter Well this is very strange Four nights ago a man of some five or six and thirty years of age came with a verbal message from you to the effect that you had sent him with a fox s liver which you had just procured and said that he would come and tell us the price another day When we asked him to spend the night here he answered that he would lodge with a relation in the next village and went away The visitor was more and more lost in amazement and leaning his head on one side in deep thought confessed that he could make nothing of it As for the husband and wife they felt quite out of countenance at having thanked a man so warmly for favours of which he denied all knowledge and so the visitor took his leave and went home That night there appeared at the pillow of the master of the house a woman of about one or two and thirty years of age who said I am the fox that lives at such and such a mountain Last spring when I was taking out my cub to play it was carried off by some boys and only saved by your goodness The desire to requite this kindness pierced me to the quick At last when calamity attacked your house I thought that I might be of use to you Your son s illness could not be cured without a liver taken from a live fox so to repay your kindness I killed my cub and took out its liver then its sire disguising himself as a messenger brought it to your house And as she spoke the fox shed tears and the master of the house wishing to thank her moved in bed upon which his wife awoke and asked him what was the matter but he too to her great astonishment was biting the pillow and weeping bitterly Why are you weeping thus asked she At last he sat up in bed and said Last spring when I was out on a pleasure excursion I was the means of saving the life of a fox s cub as I told you at the time The other day I told mister So and so that although my son were to die before my eyes I would not be the means of killing a fox on purpose but asked him in case he heard of any hunter killing a fox to buy it for me How the foxes came to hear of this I don t know but the foxes to whom I had shown kindness killed their own cub and took out the liver and the old dog fox disguising himself as a messenger from the person to whom we had confided the commission came here with it His mate has just been at my pillow side and told me all about it hence it was that in spite of myself I was moved to tears Illustration THE FEAST OF INARI SAMA When she heard this the goodwife likewise was blinded by her tears and for a while they lay lost in thought but at last coming to themselves they lighted the lamp on the shelf on which the family idol stood and spent the night in reciting prayers and praises and the next day they published the matter to the household and to their relations and friends Now although there are instances of men killing their own children to requite a favour there is no other example of foxes having done such a thing so the story became the talk of the whole country Now the boy who had recovered through the efficacy of this medicine selected the prettiest spot on the premises to erect a shrine to Inari Sama seventy nine the Fox God and offered sacrifice to the two old foxes for whom he purchased the highest rank at the court of the Mikado Footnote seventy nine Inari Sama is the title under which was deified a certain mythical personage called Uga to whom tradition attributes the honour of having first discovered and cultivated the rice plant He is represented carrying a few ears of rice and is symbolized by a snake guarding a bale of rice grain The foxes wait upon him and do his bidding Inasmuch as rice is the most important and necessary product of Japan the honours which Inari Sama receives are extraordinary Almost every house in the country contains somewhere about the grounds a pretty little shrine in his honour and on a certain day of the second month of the year his feast is celebrated with much beating of drums and other noises in which the children take a special delight On this day says the O Satsuyo a Japanese cyclopaedia at Yedo where there are myriads upon myriads of shrines to Inari Sama there are all sorts of ceremonies Long banners with inscriptions are erected lamps and lanterns are hung up and the houses are decked with various dolls and figures the sound of flutes and drums is heard the people dance and make holiday according to their fancy In short it is the most bustling festival of the Yedo year The passage in the tale which speaks of rank being purchased for the foxes at the court of the Mikado is of course a piece of nonsense The saints who are worshipped in Japan writes a native authority are men who in the remote ages when the country was developing itself were sages and by their great and virtuous deeds having earned the gratitude of future generations received divine honours after their death How can the Son of Heaven who is the father and mother of his people turn dealer in ranks and honours If rank were a matter of barter it would cease to be a reward to the virtuous All matters connected with the shrines of the Shinto or indigenous religion are confided to the superintendence of the families of Yoshida and Fushimi Kuges or nobles of the Mikado s court at Kiyoto The affairs of the Buddhist or imported religion are under the care of the family of Kanjuji As it is necessary that those who as priests perform the honourable office of serving the gods should be persons of some standing a certain small rank is procured for them through the intervention of the representatives of the above noble families who on the issuing of the required patent receive as their perquisite a fee which although insignificant in itself is yet of importance to the poor Kuges whose penniless condition forms a great contrast to the wealth of their inferiors in rank the Daimios I believe that this is the only case in which rank can be bought or sold in Japan In China on the contrary in spite of what has been written by Meadows and other admirers of the examination system a man can be what he pleases by paying for it and the coveted button which is nominally the reward of learning and ability is more often the prize of wealthy ignorance The saints who are alluded to above are the saints of the whole country as distinct from those who for special deeds are locally worshipped To this innumerable class frequent allusion is made in these Tales Touching the remedy of the fox s liver prescribed in the tale I may add that there would be nothing strange in this to a person acquainted with the Chinese pharmacopoeia which the Japanese long exclusively followed although they are now successfully studying the art of healing as practised in the West When I was at Peking I saw a Chinese physician prescribe a decoction of three scorpions for a child struck down with fever and on another occasion a groom of mine suffering from dysentery was treated with acupuncture of the tongue The art of medicine would appear to be at the present time in China much in the state in which it existed in Europe in the sixteenth century when the excretions and secretions of all manner of animals saurians and venomous snakes and insects and even live bugs were administered to patients Some physicians says Matthiolus use the ashes of scorpions burnt alive for retention caused by either renal or vesical calculi But I have myself thoroughly experienced the utility of an oil I make myself whereof scorpions form a very large portion of the ingredients If only the region of the heart and all the pulses of the body be anointed with it it will free the patients from the effects of all kinds of poisons taken by the mouth corrosive ones excepted Decoctions of Egyptian mummies were much commended and often prescribed with due academical solemnity and the bones of the human skull pulverized and administered with oil were used as a specific in cases of renal calculus See Petri Andreae Matthioli Opera fifteen seventy four These remarks were made to me by a medical gentleman to whom I mentioned the Chinese doctor s prescription of scorpion tea and they seem to me so curious that I insert them for comparison s sake THE BADGER S MONEY It is a common saying among men that to forget favours received is the part of a bird or a beast an ungrateful man will be ill spoken of by all the world And yet even birds and beasts will show gratitude so that a man who does not requite a favour is worse even than dumb brutes Is not this a disgrace Once upon a time in a hut at a place called Namekata in Hitachi there lived an old priest famous neither for learning nor wisdom but bent only on passing his days in prayer and meditation He had not even a child to wait upon him but prepared his food with his own hands Night and morning he recited the prayer Namu Amida Butsu eighty intent upon that alone Although the fame of his virtue did not reach far yet his neighbours respected and revered him and often brought him food and raiment and when his roof or his walls fell out of repair they would mend them for him so for the things of this world he took no thought Footnote eighty A Buddhist prayer in which something approaching to the sounds of the original Sanscrit has been preserved The meaning of the prayer is explained as Save us eternal Buddha Many even of the priests who repeat it know it only as a formula without understanding it One very cold night when he little thought any one was outside he heard a voice calling Your reverence your reverence So he rose and went out to see who it was and there he beheld an old badger standing Any ordinary man would have been greatly alarmed at the apparition but the priest being such as he has been described above showed no sign of fear but asked the creature its business Upon this the badger respectfully bent its knees and said Hitherto sir my lair has been in the mountains and of snow or frost I have taken no heed but now I am growing old and this severe cold is more than I can bear I pray you to let me enter and warm myself at the fire of your cottage that I may live through this bitter night When the priest heard what a helpless state the beast was reduced to he was filled with pity and said That s a very slight matter make haste and come in and warm yourself The badger delighted with so good a reception went into the hut and squatting down by the fire began to warm itself and the priest with renewed fervour recited his prayers and struck his bell before the image of Buddha looking straight before him After two hours the badger took its leave with profuse expressions of thanks and went out and from that time forth it came every night to the hut As the badger would collect and bring with it dried branches and dead leaves from the hills for firewood the priest at last became very friendly with it and got used to its company so that if ever as the night wore on the badger did not arrive he used to miss it and wonder why it did not come When the winter was over and the spring time came at the end of the second month the Badger gave up its visits and was no more seen but on the return of the winter the beast resumed its old habit of coming to the hut When this practice had gone on for ten years one day the badger said to the priest Through your reverence s kindness for all these years I have been able to pass the winter nights in comfort Your favours are such that during all my life and even after my death I must remember them What can I do to requite them If there is anything that you wish for pray tell me The priest smiling at this speech answered Being such as I am I have no desire and no wishes Glad as I am to hear your kind intentions there is nothing that I can ask you to do for me You need feel no anxiety on my account As long as I live when the winter comes you shall be welcome here The badger on hearing this could not conceal its admiration of the depth of the old man s benevolence but having so much to be grateful for it felt hurt at not being able to requite it As this subject was often renewed between them the priest at last touched by the goodness of the badger s heart said Since I have shaven my head renounced the world and forsaken the pleasures of this life I have no desire to gratify yet I own I should like to possess three riyos in gold Food and raiment I receive by the favour of the villagers so I take no heed for those things Were I to die to morrow and attain my wish of being born again into the next world the same kind folk have promised to meet and bury my body Thus although I have no other reason to wish for money still if I had three riyos I would offer them up at some holy shrine that masses and prayers might be said for me whereby I might enter into salvation Yet I would not get this money by violent or unlawful means I only think of what might be if I had it So you see since you have expressed such kind feelings towards me I have told you what is on my mind When the priest had done speaking the badger leant its head on one side with a puzzled and anxious look so much so that the old man was sorry he had expressed a wish which seemed to give the beast trouble and tried to retract what he had said Posthumous honours after all are the wish of ordinary men I who am a priest ought not to entertain such thoughts or to want money so pray pay no attention to what I have said and the badger feigning assent to what the priest had impressed upon it returned to the hills as usual From that time forth the badger came no more to the hut The priest thought this very strange but imagined either that the badger stayed away because it did not like to come without the money or that it had been killed in an attempt to steal it and he blamed himself for having added to his sins for no purpose repenting when it was too late persuaded however that the badger must have been killed he passed his time in putting up prayers upon prayers for it After three years had gone by one night the old man heard a voice near his door calling out Your reverence your reverence As the voice was like that of the badger he jumped up as soon as he heard it and ran out to open the door and there sure enough was the badger The priest in great delight cried out And so you are safe and sound after all Why have you been so long without coming here I have been expecting you anxiously this long while So the badger came into the hut and said If the money which you required had been for unlawful purposes I could easily have procured as much as ever you might have wanted but when I heard that it was to be offered to a temple for masses for your soul I thought that if I were to steal the hidden treasure of some other man you could not apply to a sacred purpose money which had been obtained at the expense of his sorrow So I went to the island of Sado eighty one and gathering the sand and earth which had been cast away as worthless by the miners fused it afresh in the fire and at this work I spent months and days As the badger finished speaking the priest looked at the money which it had produced and sure enough he saw that it was bright and new and clean so he took the money and received it respectfully raising it to his head Footnote eighty one An island on the west coast of Japan famous for its gold mines And so you have had all this toil and labour on account of a foolish speech of mine I have obtained my heart s desire and am truly thankful As he was thanking the badger with great politeness and ceremony the beast said In doing this I have but fulfilled my own wish still I hope that you will tell this thing to no man Indeed replied the priest I cannot choose but tell this story For if I keep this money in my poor hut it will be stolen by thieves I must either give it to some one to keep for me or else at once offer it up at the temple And when I do this when people see a poor old priest with a sum of money quite unsuited to his station they will think it very suspicious and I shall have to tell the tale as it occurred but as I shall say that the badger that gave me the money has ceased coming to my hut you need not fear being waylaid but can come as of old and shelter yourself from the cold To this the badger nodded assent and as long as the old priest lived it came and spent the winter nights with him From this story it is plain that even beasts have a sense of gratitude in this quality dogs excel all other beasts Is not the story of the dog of Totoribe Yorodzu written in the Annals of Japan I eighty two have heard that many anecdotes of this nature have been collected and printed in a book which I have not yet seen but as the facts which I have recorded relate to a badger they appear to me to be passing strange Footnote eighty two The author of the tale THE PRINCE AND THE BADGER In days of yore there lived a forefather of the Prince of Tosa who went by the name of Yamanouchi Kadzutoyo At the age of fourteen this prince was amazingly fond of fishing and would often go down to the river for sport And it came to pass one day that he had gone thither with but one retainer and had made a great haul that a violent shower suddenly came on Now the prince had no rain coat with him and was in so sorry a plight that he took shelter under a willow tree and waited for the weather to clear but the storm showed no sign of abating and there was no help for it so he turned to the retainer and said This rain is not likely to stop for some time so we had better hurry home As they trudged homeward night fell and it grew very dark and their road lay over a long bank by the side of which they found a girl about sixteen years old weeping bitterly Struck with wonder they looked steadfastly at her and perceived that she was exceedingly comely While Kadzutoyo stood doubting what so strange a sight could portend his retainer smitten with the girl s charms stepped up to her and said Little sister tell us whose daughter you are and how it comes that you are out by yourself at night in such a storm of rain Surely it is passing strange Sir replied she looking up through her tears I am the daughter of a poor man in the castle town My mother died when I was seven years old and my father has now wedded a shrew who loathes and ill uses me and in the midst of my grief he is gone far away on his business so I was left alone with my stepmother and this very night she spited and beat me till I could bear it no longer and was on my way to my aunt s who dwells in yonder village when the shower came on but as I lay waiting for the rain to stop I was seized with a spasm to which I am subject and was in great pain when I had the good luck to fall in with your worships As she spoke the retainer fell deeply in love with her matchless beauty whilst his lord Kadzutoyo who from the outset had not uttered a word but stood brooding over the matter straightway drew his sword and cut off her head But the retainer stood aghast and cried out Oh my young lord what wicked deed is this that you ve done The murder of a man s daughter will bring trouble upon us for you may rely on the business not ending here You don t know what you re talking about answered Kadzutoyo only don t tell any one about it that is all I ask and so they went home in silence As Kadzutoyo was very tired he went to bed and slept undisturbed by any sense of guilt for he was brave and fearless But the retainer grew very uneasy and went to his young lord s parents and said I had the honour of attending my young lord out fishing to day and we were driven home by the rain And as we came back by the bank we descried a girl with a spasm in her stomach and her my young lord straightway slew and although he has bidden me tell it to no one I cannot conceal it from my lord and my lady Kadzutoyo s parents were sore amazed bewailing their son s wickedness and went at once to his room and woke him his father shed tears and said Oh dastardly cut throat that you are how dare you kill another man s daughter without provocation Such unspeakable villany is unworthy a Samurai s son Know that the duty of every Samurai is to keep watch over the country and to protect the people and such is his daily task For sword and dirk are given to men that they may slay rebels and faithfully serve their prince and not that they may go about committing sin and killing the daughters of innocent men Whoever is fool enough not to understand this will repeat his misdeed and will assuredly bring shame on his kindred Grieved as I am that I should take away the life which I gave you I cannot suffer you to bring dishonour on our house so prepare to meet your fate With these words he drew his sword but Kadzutoyo without a sign of fear said to his father Your anger sir is most just but remember that I have studied the classics and understand the laws of right and wrong and be sure I would never kill another man without good cause The girl whom I slew was certainly no human being but some foul goblin feeling certain of this I cut her down To morrow I beg you will send your retainers to look for the corpse and if it really be that of a human being I shall give you no further trouble but shall disembowel myself Upon this the father sheathed his sword and awaited daybreak When the morning came the old prince in sad distress bade his retainers lead him to the bank and there he saw a huge badger with his head cut off lying dead by the roadside and the prince was lost in wonder at his son s shrewdness But the retainer did not know what to make of it and still had his doubts The prince however returned home and sending for his son said to him It s very strange that the creature which appeared to your retainer to be a girl should have seemed to you to be a badger My lord s wonder is just replied Kadzutoyo smiling she appeared as a girl to me as well But here was a young girl at night far from any inhabited place Stranger still was her wondrous beauty and strangest of all that though it was pouring with rain there was not a sign of wet on her clothes and when my retainer asked how long she had been there she said she had been on the bank in pain for some time so I had no further doubt but that she was a goblin and I killed her But what made you think she must be a goblin because her clothes were dry The beast evidently thought that if she could bewitch us with her beauty she might get at the fish my retainer was carrying but she forgot that as it was raining it would not do for her clothes not to be wet so I detected and killed her When the old prince heard his son speak thus he was filled with admiration for the youth s sagacity so conceiving that Kadzutoyo had given reliable proof of wisdom and prudence he resolved to abdicate eighty three and Kadzutoyo was proclaimed Prince of Tosa in his stead Footnote eighty three Inkiyo abdication The custom of abdication is common among all classes from the Emperor down to his meanest subject The Emperor abdicates after consultation with his ministers the Shogun has to obtain the permission of the Emperor the Daimios that of the Shogun The abdication of the Emperor was called Sento that of the Shogun Oyosho in all other ranks it is called Inkiyo It must be remembered that the princes of Japan in becoming Inkiyo resign the semblance and the name but not the reality of power Both in their own provinces and in the country at large they play a most important part The ex Princes of Tosa Uwajima and Owari are far more notable men in Japan than the actual holders of the titles JAPANESE SERMONS Illustration A JAPANESE SERMON JAPANESE SERMONS Sermons preached here on eighth eighteenth and twenty eighth days of every month Such was the purport of a placard which used to tempt me daily as I passed the temple Cho o ji Having ascertained that neither the preacher nor his congregation would have any objection to my hearing one of these sermons I made arrangements to attend the service accompanied by two friends my artist and a scribe to take notes We were shown into an apartment adjoining a small chapel a room opening on to a tastily arranged garden wealthy in stone lanterns and dwarfed trees In the portion of the room reserved for the priest stood a high table covered with a cloth of white and scarlet silk richly embroidered with flowers and arabesques upon this stood a bell a tray containing the rolls of the sacred books and a small incense burner of ancient Chinese porcelain Before the table was a hanging drum and behind it was one of those high back breaking arm chairs which adorn every Buddhist temple In one corner of the space destined for the accommodation of the faithful was a low writing desk at which sat or rather squatted a lay clerk armed with a huge pair of horn spectacles through which he glared goblin like at the people as they came to have their names and the amount of their offerings to the temple registered These latter must have been small things for the congregation seemed poor enough It was principally composed of old women nuns with bald shiny pates and grotesque faces a few petty tradesmen and half a dozen chubby children perfect little models of decorum and devoutness One lady there was indeed who seemed a little better to do in the world than the rest she was nicely dressed and attended by a female servant she came in with a certain little consequential rustle and displayed some coquetry and a very pretty bare foot as she took her place and pulling out a dandy little pipe and tobacco pouch began to smoke Fire boxes and spittoons I should mention were freely handed about so that half an hour which passed before the sermon began was agreeably spent In the meanwhile mass was being celebrated in the main hall of the temple and the monotonous nasal drone of the plain chant was faintly heard in the distance So soon as this was over the lay clerk sat himself down by the hanging drum and to its accompaniment began intoning the prayer Na Mu Miyo Ho Ren Go Kiyo the congregation fervently joining in unison with him These words repeated over and over again are the distinctive prayer of the Buddhist sect of Nichiren to which the temple Cho o ji is dedicated They are approximations to Sanscrit sounds and have no meaning in Japanese nor do the worshippers in using them know their precise value Soon the preacher gorgeous in red and white robes made his appearance following an acolyte who carried the sacred book called Hokke upon which the sect of Nichiren is founded on a tray covered with scarlet and gold brocade Having bowed to the sacred picture which hung over the tokonoma that portion of the Japanese room which is raised a few inches above the rest of the floor and which is regarded as the place of honour his reverence took his seat at the table and adjusted his robes then tying up the muscles of his face into a knot expressive of utter abstraction he struck the bell upon the table thrice burnt a little incense and read a passage from the sacred book which he reverently lifted to his head The congregation joined in chorus devout but unintelligent for the Word written in ancient Chinese is as obscure to the ordinary Japanese worshipper as are the Latin liturgies to a high capped Norman peasant woman While his flock wrapped up copper cash in paper and threw them before the table as offerings the priest next recited a passage alone and the lay clerk irreverently entered into a loud dispute with one of the congregation touching some payment or other The preliminary ceremonies ended a small shaven pated boy brought in a cup of tea thrice afterwards to be replenished for his reverence s refreshment and he having untied his face gave a broad grin cleared his throat swallowed his tea and beamed down upon us as jolly rosy a priest as ever donned stole or scarf His discourse which was delivered in the most familiar and easy manner was an extempore dissertation on certain passages from the sacred books Whenever he paused or made a point the congregation broke in with a cry of Nammiyo a corruption of the first three words of the prayer cited above to which they always contrived to give an expression or intonation in harmony with the preacher s meaning It is a matter of profound satisfaction to me began his reverence Nichirin smiling blandly at his audience to see so many gentlemen and ladies gathered together here this day in the fidelity of their hearts to do honour to the feast of Kishimojin eighty four Footnote eighty four Kishimojin a female deity of the Buddhists Nammiyo nammiyo self depreciatory from the congregation I feel certain that your piety cannot fail to find favour with Kishimojin Kishimojin ever mourns over the tortures of mankind who are dwelling in a house of fire and she ever earnestly strives to find some means of delivering them Nammiyo nammiyo grateful and reverential Notwithstanding this it is useless your worshipping Kishimojin and professing to believe in her unless you have truth in your hearts for she will not receive your offerings Man from his very birth is a creature of requirements he is for ever seeking and praying Both you who listen and I who preach have all of us our wants and wishes If there be any person here who flatters himself that he has no wishes and no wants let him reflect Does not every one wish and pray that heaven and earth may stand for ever that his country and family may prosper that there may be plenty in the land and that the people may be healthy and happy The wishes of men however are various and many and these wishes numberless as they are are all known to the gods from the beginning It is no use praying unless you have truth in your heart For instance the prayer Na Mu is a prayer committing your bodies to the care of the gods if when you utter it your hearts are true and single of a surety your request will be granted Now this is not a mere statement made by Nichiren the holy founder of this sect it is the sacred teaching of Buddha himself and may not be doubted Nammiyo nammiyo with profound conviction The heart of man is by nature upright and true but there are seven passions eighty five by which it is corrupted Buddha is alarmed when he sees the fires by which the world is being consumed These fires are the five lusts of this sinful world and the five lusts are the desire for fair sights sweet sounds fragrant smells dainty meats and rich trappings Man is no sooner endowed with a body than he is possessed by these lusts which become his very heart and it being a law that every man follows the dictates of his heart in this way the body the lusts of the flesh the heart and the dictates of the heart blaze up in the consuming fire Alas for this miserable world said the divine Buddha Footnote eighty five The seven passions are joy anger sadness fear love hatred and desire Nammiyo nammiyo mournful and with much head shaking There is not so foul thing under heaven as the human body The body exudes grease the eyes distil gums the nose is full of mucus the mouth of slobbering spittle nor are these the most impure secretions of the body What a mistake it is to look upon this impure body as clean and perfect Unless we listen to the teachings of Buddha how shall we be washed and purified Nammiyo nammiyo from an impure and very miserable sinner under ten years of age The lot of man is uncertain and for ever running out of the beaten track Why go to look at the flowers and take delight in their beauty When you return home you will see the vanity of your pleasure Why purchase fleeting joys of loose women How long do you retain the delicious taste of the dainties you feast upon For ever wishing to do this wishing to see that wishing to eat rare dishes wishing to wear fine clothes you pass a lifetime in fanning the flames which consume you What terrible matter for thought is this In the poems of the priest Saigiyo it is written Verily I have been familiar with the flowers yet are they withered and scattered and we are parted How sad The beauty of the convolvulus how bright it is and yet in one short morning it closes its petals and fades In the book called Rin Jo Bo Satsu eighty six we are told how a certain king once went to take his pleasure in his garden and gladden his eyes with the beauty of his flowers After a while he fell asleep and as he slumbered the women of his train began pulling the flowers to pieces When the king awoke of all the glory of his flowers there remained but a few torn and faded petals Seeing this the king said The flowers pass away and die so is it with mankind we are born we grow old we sicken and die we are as fleeting as the lightning s flash as evanescent as the morning dew I know not whether any of you here present ever fix your thoughts upon death yet it is a rare thing for a man to live for a hundred years How piteous a thing it is that in this short and transient life men should consume themselves in a fire of lust and if we think to escape from this fire how shall we succeed save only by the teaching of the divine Buddha Footnote eighty six One of the Buddhist classics Nammiyo nammiyo meekly and entreatingly Since Buddha himself escaped from the burning flames of the lusts of the flesh his only thought has been for the salvation of mankind Once upon a time there was a certain heretic called Rokutsuponji a reader of auguries cunning in astrology and in the healing art It happened one day that this heretic being in company with Buddha entered a forest which was full of dead men s skulls Buddha taking up one of the skulls and tapping it thus here the preacher tapped the reading desk with his fan said What manner of man was this bone when alive and now that he is dead in what part of the world has he been born again The heretic auguring from the sound which the skull when struck gave forth began to tell its past history and to prophesy the future Then Buddha tapping another skull again asked the same question The heretic answered Verily as to this skull whether it belonged to a man or a woman whence its owner came or whither he has gone I know not What think you of it Ask me not answered Buddha But the heretic pressed him and entreated him to answer then Buddha said Verily this is the skull of one of my disciples who forsook the lusts of the flesh Then the heretic wondered and said Of a truth this is a thing the like of which no man has yet seen Here am I who know the manner of the life and of the death even of the ants that creep Verily I thought that no thing could escape my ken yet here lies one of your disciples than whom there lives no nobler thing and I am at fault From this day forth I will enter your sect praying only that I may receive your teaching Thus did this learned heretic become a disciple of Buddha If such an one as he was converted how much the more should after ages of ordinary men feel that it is through Buddha alone that they can hope to overcome the sinful lusts of the flesh These lusts are the desires which agitate our hearts if we are free from these desires our hearts will be bright and pure and there is nothing save the teaching of Buddha which can ensure us this freedom Following the commands of Buddha and delivered by him from our desires we may pass our lives in peace and happiness Nammiyo nammiyo with triumphant exultation In the sacred books we read of conversion from a state of sin to a state of salvation Now this salvation is not a million miles removed from us nor need we die and be born again into another world in order to reach it He who lays aside his carnal lusts and affections at once and of a certainty becomes equal to Buddha When we recite the prayer Na Mu Miyo Ho Ren Go Kiyo we are praying to enter this state of peace and happiness By what instruction other than that of Nichiren the holy founder of this sect can we expect to attain this end If we do attain it there will be no difference between our state and that of Buddha and of Nichiren With this view we have learnt from the pious founder of our sect that we must continually and thankfully repeat the prayer Na Mu Miyo Ho Ren Go Kiyo turning our hearts away from lies and embracing the truth Such were the heads of the sermon as they were taken down by my scribe At its conclusion the priest looking about him smiling as if the solemn truths he had been inculcating were nothing but a very good joke was greeted by long and loud cries of Nammiyo nammiyo by all the congregation Then the lay clerk sat himself down again by the hanging drum and the service ended as it had begun by prayer in chorus during which the priest retired the sacred book being carried out before him by his acolyte Although occasionally as in the above instance sermons are delivered as part of a service on special days of the month they are more frequently preached in courses the delivery occupying about a fortnight during which two sermons are given each day Frequently the preachers are itinerant priests who go about the towns and villages lecturing in the main hall of some temple or in the guest room of the resident priest There are many books of sermons published in Japan all of which have some merit and much quaintness none that I have seen are however to my taste to be compared to the Kiu o Do wa of which the following three sermons compose the first volume They are written by a priest belonging to the Shingaku sect a sect professing to combine all that is excellent in the Buddhist Confucian and Shin To teaching It maintains the original goodness of the human heart and teaches that we have only to follow the dictates of the conscience implanted in us at our birth in order to steer in the right path The texts are taken from the Chinese classical books in the same way as our preachers take theirs from the Bible Jokes stories which are sometimes untranslatable into our more fastidious tongue and pointed applications to members of the congregation enliven the discourses it being a principle with the Japanese preacher that it is not necessary to bore his audience into virtue SERMON I THE SERMONS OF KIU O VOL I Moshi eighty seven says Benevolence is the heart of man righteousness is the path of man How lamentable a thing is it to leave the path and go astray to cast away the heart and not know where to seek for it Footnote eighty seven Moshi the Japanese pronunciation of the name of the Chinese philosopher Meng Tse whom Europeans call Mencius The text is taken from the first chapter of Koshi the commentator on Moshi Now this quality which we call benevolence has been the subject of commentaries by many teachers but as these commentaries have been difficult of comprehension they are too hard to enter the ears of women and children It is of this benevolence that using examples and illustrations I propose to treat A long time ago there lived at Kioto a great physician called Imaoji I forget his other name he was a very famous man Once upon a time a man from a place called Kuramaguchi advertised for sale a medicine which he had compounded against the cholera and got Imaoji to write a puff for him Imaoji instead of calling the medicine in the puff a specific against the cholera misspelt the word cholera so as to make it simpler When the man who had employed him went and taxed him with this and asked him why he had done so he answered with a smile As Kuramaguchi is an approach to the capital from the country the passers by are but poor peasants and woodmen from the hills if I had written cholera at length they would have been puzzled by it so I wrote it in a simple way that should pass current with every one Truth itself loses its value if people don t understand it What does it signify how I spelt the word cholera so long as the efficacy of the medicine is unimpaired Now was not that delightful In the same way the doctrines of the sages are mere gibberish to women and children who cannot understand them Now my sermons are not written for the learned I address myself to farmers and tradesmen who hard pressed by their daily business have no time for study with the wish to make known to them the teachings of the sages and carrying out the ideas of my teacher I will make my meaning pretty plain by bringing forward examples and quaint stories Thus by blending together the doctrines of the Shinto Buddhist and other schools we shall arrive at something near the true principle of things Now positively you must not laugh if I introduce a light story now and then Levity is not my object I only want to put things in a plain and easy manner Well then the quality which we call benevolence is in fact a perfection and it is this perfection which Moshi spoke of as the heart of man With this perfect heart men by serving their parents attain to filial piety by serving their masters they attain to fidelity and if they treat their wives their brethren and their friends in the same spirit then the principles of the five relations of life will harmonize without difficulty As for putting perfection into practice parents have the special duties of parents children have the special duties of children husbands have the special duties of husbands wives have the special duties of wives It is when all these special duties are performed without a fault that true benevolence is reached and that again is the true heart of man For example take this fan any one who sees it knows it to be a fan and knowing it to be a fan no one would think of using it to blow his nose in The special use of a fan is for visits of ceremony or else it is opened in order to raise a cooling breeze it serves no other purpose In the same way this reading desk will not do as a substitute for a shelf again it will not do instead of a pillow so you see that a reading desk also has its special functions for which you must use it So if you look at your parents in the light of your parents and treat them with filial piety that is the special duty of children that is true benevolence that is the heart of man Now although you may think that when I speak in this way I am speaking of others and not of yourselves believe me that the heart of every one of you is by nature pure benevolence I am just taking down your hearts as a shopman does goods from his shelves and pointing out the good and bad qualities of each but if you will not lay what I say to your own accounts but persist in thinking that it is all anybody s business but yours all my labour will be lost Listen You who answer your parents rudely and cause them to weep you who bring grief and trouble on your masters you who cause your husbands to fly into passions you who cause your wives to mourn you who hate your younger brothers and treat your elder brothers with contempt you who sow sorrow broadcast over the world what are you doing but blowing your noses in fans and using reading desks as pillows I don t mean to say that there are any such persons here still there are plenty of them to be found say in the back streets in India for instance Be so good as to mind what I have said Consider carefully if a man is born with a naturally bad disposition what a dreadful thing that is Happily you and I were born with perfect hearts which we would not change for a thousand no not for ten thousand pieces of gold is not this something to be thankful for This perfect heart is called in my discourses the original heart of man It is true that benevolence is also called the original heart of man still there is a slight difference between the two However as the inquiry into this difference would be tedious it is sufficient for you to look upon this original heart of man as a perfect thing and you will fall into no error It is true that I have not the honour of the personal acquaintance of every one of you who are present still I know that your hearts are perfect The proof of this that if you say that which you ought not to say or do that which you ought not to do your hearts within you are in some mysterious way immediately conscious of wrong When the man that has a perfect heart does that which is imperfect it is because his heart has become warped and turned to evil This law holds good for all mankind What says the old song When the roaring waterfall is shivered by the night storm the moonlight is reflected in each scattered drop eighty eight Although there is but one moon she suffices to illuminate each little scattered drop Wonderful are the laws of Heaven So the principle of benevolence which is but one illumines all the particles that make up mankind Well then the perfection of the human heart can be calculated to a nicety So if we follow the impulses of our perfect heart in whatever we undertake we shall perform our special duties and filial piety and fidelity will come to us spontaneously You see the doctrines of this school of philosophy are quickly learnt If you once thoroughly understand this there will be no difference between your conduct and that of a man who has studied a hundred years Therefore I pray you to follow the impulses of your natural heart place it before you as a teacher and study its precepts Your heart is a convenient teacher to employ too for there is no question of paying fees and no need to go out in the heat of summer or the cold of winter to pay visits of ceremony to your master to inquire after his health What admirable teaching this is by means of which you can learn filial piety and fidelity so easily Still suspicions are apt to arise in men s minds about things that are seen to be acquired too cheaply but here you can buy a good thing cheap and spare yourselves the vexation of having paid an extravagant price for it I repeat follow the impulses of your hearts with all your might In the Chin yo the second of the books of Confucius it is certified beyond a doubt that the impulses of nature are the true path to follow therefore you may set to work in this direction with your minds at ease Footnote eighty eight The moon looks on many brooks The brooks see but one moon T MOORE Righteousness then is the true path and righteousness is the avoidance of all that is imperfect If a man avoids that which is imperfect there is no need to point out how dearly he will be beloved by all his fellows Hence it is that the ancients have defined righteousness as that which ought to be that which is fitting If a man be a retainer it is good that he should perform his service to his lord with all his might If a woman be married it is good that she should treat her parents in law with filial piety and her husband with reverence For the rest whatever is good that is righteousness and the true path of man The duty of man has been compared by the wise men of old to a high road If you want to go to Yedo or to Nagasaki if you want to go out to the front of the house or to the back of the house if you wish to go into the next room or into some closet or other there is a right road to each of these places if you do not follow the right road scrambling over the roofs of houses and through ditches crossing mountains and desert places you will be utterly lost and bewildered In the same way if a man does that which is not good he is going astray from the high road Filial piety in children virtue in wives truth among friends but why enumerate all these things which are patent all these are the right road and good but to grieve parents to anger husbands to hate and to breed hatred in others these are all bad things these are all the wrong road To follow these is to plunge into rivers to run on to thorns to jump into ditches and brings thousands upon ten thousands of disasters It is true that if we do not pay great attention we shall not be able to follow the right road Fortunately we have heard by tradition the words of the learned Nakazawa Doni I will tell you about that all in good time It happened that once the learned Nakazawa went to preach at Ikeda in the province of Sesshiu and lodged with a rich family of the lower class The master of the house who was particularly fond of sermons entertained the preacher hospitably and summoned his daughter a girl some fourteen or fifteen years old to wait upon him at dinner This young lady was not only extremely pretty but also had charming manners so she arranged bouquets of flowers and made tea and played upon the harp and laid herself out to please the learned man by singing songs The preacher thanked her parents for all this and said Really it must be a very difficult thing to educate a young lady up to such a pitch as this The parents carried away by their feelings replied Yes when she is married she will hardly bring shame upon her husband s family Besides what she did just now she can weave garlands of flowers round torches and we had her taught to paint a little and as they began to show a little conceit the preacher said I am sure this is something quite out of the common run Of course she knows how to rub the shoulders and loins and has learnt the art of shampooing The master of the house bristled up at this and answered I may be very poor but I ve not fallen so low as to let my daughter learn shampooing The learned man smiling replied I think you are making a mistake when you put yourself in a rage No matter whether her family be rich or poor when a woman is performing her duties in her husband s house she must look upon her husband s parents as her own If her honoured father in law or mother in law fall ill her being able to plait flowers and paint pictures and make tea will be of no use in the sick room To shampoo her parents in law and nurse them affectionately without employing either shampooer or servant maid is the right path of a daughter in law Do you mean to say that your daughter has not yet learnt shampooing an art which is essential to her following the right path of a wife That is what I meant to ask just now So useful a study is very important At this the master of the house was ashamed and blushing made many apologies as I have heard Certainly the harp and guitar are very good things in their way but to attend to nursing their parents is the right road of children Lay this story to heart and consider attentively where the right road lies People who live near haunts of pleasure become at last so fond of pleasure that they teach their daughters nothing but how to play on the harp and guitar and train them up in the manners and ways of singing girls but teach them next to nothing of their duties as daughters and then very often they escape from their parents watchfulness and elope Nor is this the fault of the girls themselves but the fault of the education which they have received from their parents I do not mean to say that the harp and guitar and songs and dramas are useless things If you consider them attentively all our songs incite to virtue and condemn vice In the song called The Four Sleeves for instance there is the passage If people knew beforehand all the misery that it brings there would be less going out with young ladies to look at the flowers at night Please give your attention to this piece of poetry This is the meaning of it When a young man and a young lady set up a flirtation without the consent of their parents they think that it will all be very delightful and find themselves very much deceived If they knew what a sad and cruel world this is they would not act as they do The quotation is from a song of remorse This sort of thing but too often happens in the world When a man marries a wife he thinks how happy he will be and how pleasant it will be keeping house on his own account but before the bottom of the family kettle has been scorched black he will be like a man learning to swim in a field with his ideas all turned topsy turvy and contrary to all his expectations he will find the pleasures of housekeeping to be all a delusion Look at that woman there Haunted by her cares she takes no heed of her hair nor of her personal appearance With her head all untidy her apron tied round her as a girdle with a baby twisted into the bosom of her dress she carries some wretched bean sauce which she has been out to buy What sort of creature is this This all comes of not listening to the warnings of parents and of not waiting for the proper time but rushing suddenly into housekeeping And who is to blame in the matter Passion which does not pause to reflect A child of five or six years will never think of learning to play the guitar for its own pleasure What a ten million times miserable thing it is when parents making their little girls hug a great guitar listen with pleasure to the poor little things playing on instruments big enough for them to climb upon and squeaking out songs in their shrill treble voices Now I must beg you to listen to me carefully If you get confused and don t keep a sharp look out your children brought up upon harp and guitar playing will be abandoning their parents and running away secretly Depend upon it from all that is licentious and meretricious something monstrous will come forth The poet who wrote the Four Sleeves regarded it as the right path of instruction to convey a warning against vice But the theatre and dramas and fashionable songs if the moral that they convey is missed are a very great mistake Although you may think it very right and proper that a young lady should practise nothing but the harp and guitar until her marriage I tell you that it is not so for if she misses the moral of her songs and music there is the danger of her falling in love with some man and eloping While on this subject I have an amusing story to tell you Once upon a time a frog who lived at Kioto had long been desirous of going to see Osaka One spring having made up his mind he started off to see Osaka and all its famous places By a series of hops on all fours he reached a temple opposite Nishi no oka and thence by the western road he arrived at Yamazaki and began to ascend the mountain called Tenozan Now it so happened that a frog from Osaka had determined to visit Kioto and had also ascended Tenozan and on the summit the two frogs met made acquaintance and told one another their intentions So they began to complain about all the trouble they had gone through and had only arrived half way after all if they went on to Osaka and Kioto their legs and loins would certainly not hold out Here was the famous mountain of Tenozan from the top of which the whole of Kioto and Osaka could be seen if they stood on tiptoe and stretched their backs and looked at the view they would save themselves from stiff legs Having come to this conclusion they both stood up on tiptoe and looked about them when the Kioto frog said Really looking at the famous places of Osaka which I have heard so much about they don t seem to me to differ a bit from Kioto Instead of giving myself any further trouble to go on I shall just return home The Osaka frog blinking with his eyes said with a contemptuous smile Well I have heard a great deal of talk about this Kioto being as beautiful as the flowers but it is just Osaka over again We had better go home And so the two frogs politely bowing to one another hopped off home with an important swagger Now although this is a very funny little story you will not understand the drift of it at once The frogs thought that they were looking in front of them but as when they stood up their eyes were in the back of their heads each was looking at his native place all the while that he believed himself to be looking at the place he wished to go to The frogs stared to any amount it is true but then they did not take care that the object looked at was the right object and so it was that they fell into error Please listen attentively A certain poet says Wonderful are the frogs Though they go on all fours in an attitude of humility their eyes are always turned ambitiously upwards A delightful poem Men although they say with their mouths Yes yes your wishes shall be obeyed certainly certainly you are perfectly right are like frogs with their eyes turned upwards Vain fools meddlers ready to undertake any job however much above their powers This is what is called in the text casting away your heart and not knowing where to seek for it Although these men profess to undertake any earthly thing when it comes to the point leave them to themselves and they are unequal to the task and if you tell them this they answer By the labour of our own bodies we earn our money and the food of our mouths is of our own getting We are under obligation to no man If we did not depend upon ourselves how could we live in the world There are plenty of people who use these words myself and my own thoughtlessly and at random How false is this belief that they profess If there were no system of government by superiors but an anarchy these people who vaunt themselves and their own powers would not stand for a day In the old days at the time of the war at Ichi no tani Minamoto no Yoshitsune eighty nine left Mikusa in the province of Tamba and attacked Settsu Overtaken by the night among the mountains he knew not what road to follow so he sent for his retainer Benkei of the Temple called Musashi and told him to light the big torches which they had agreed upon Benkei received his orders and transmitted them to the troops who immediately dispersed through all the valleys and set fire to the houses of the inhabitants so that one and all blazed up and thanks to the light of this fire they reached Ichi no tani as the story goes If you think attentively you will see the allusion Those who boast about my warehouse my house my farm my daughter my wife hawking about this my of theirs like pedlers let there once come trouble and war in the world and for all their vain gloriousness they will be as helpless as turtles Let them be thankful that peace is established throughout the world The humane Government reaches to every frontier the officials of every department keep watch night and day When a man sleeps under his roof at night how can he say that it is thanks to himself that he stretches his limbs in slumber You go your rounds to see whether the shutters are closed and the front door fast and having taken every precaution you lay yourself down to rest in peace and what a precaution after all A board four tenths of an inch thick planed down front and rear until it is only two tenths of an inch thick A fine precaution in very truth a precaution which may be blown down with a breath Do you suppose such a thing as that would frighten a thief from breaking in This is the state of the case Here are men who by the benevolence and virtue of their rulers live in a delightful world and yet forgetting the mysterious providence that watches over them keep on singing their own praises Selfish egotists Footnote eighty nine The younger brother of Minamoto no Yoritomo who first established the government of the Shoguns The battle of Ichi no tani took place in the year A D eleven eighty four My property amounts to five thousand ounces of silver I may sleep with my eyes turned up and eat and take my pleasure if I live for five hundred or for seven hundred years I have five warehouses and twenty five houses I hold other people s bills for fifteen hundred ounces of silver So he dances a fling ninety for joy and has no fear lest poverty should come upon him for fifty or a hundred years Minds like frogs with eyes in the middle of their backs Foolhardy thoughts A trusty castle of defence indeed How little can it be depended upon And when such men are sleeping quietly how can they tell that they may not be turned into those big torches we were talking about just now or that a great earthquake will not be upheaved These are the chances of this fitful world With regard to the danger of too great reliance I have a little tale to tell you Be so good as to wake up from your drowsiness and listen attentively Footnote ninety Literally a dance of the Province of Tosa There is a certain powerful shell fish called the Sazaye with a very strong operculum Now this creature if it hears that there is any danger astir shuts up its shell from within with a loud noise and thinks itself perfectly safe One day a Tai and another fish lost in envy at this said What a strong castle this is of yours mister Sazaye When you shut up your lid from within nobody can so much as point a finger at you A capital figure you make sir When he heard this the Sazaye stroking his beard replied Well gentlemen although you are so good as to say so it s nothing to boast of in the way of safety yet I must admit that when I shut myself up thus I do not feel much anxiety And as he was speaking thus with the pride that apes humility there came the noise of a great splash and the shell fish shutting up his lid as quickly as possible kept quite still and thought to himself what in the world the noise could be Could it be a net Could it be a fish hook What a bore it was always having to keep such a sharp look out Were the Tai and the other fish caught he wondered and he felt quite anxious about them however at any rate he was safe And so the time passed and when he thought all was safe he stealthily opened his shell and slipped out his head and looked all round him and there seemed to be something wrong something with which he was not familiar As he looked a little more carefully lo and behold there he was in a fishmonger s shop and with a card marked sixteen cash on his back Isn t that a funny story And so at one fell swoop all your boasted wealth of houses and warehouses and cleverness and talent and rank and power are taken away Poor shell fish I think there are some people not unlike them to be found in China and India How little self is to be depended upon There is a moral poem which says It is easier to ascend to the cloudy heaven without a ladder than to depend entirely on oneself This is what is meant by the text If a man casts his heart from him he knows not where to seek for it Think twice upon everything that you do To take no care for the examination of that which relates to yourself but to look only at that which concerns others is to cast your heart from you Casting your heart from you does not mean that your heart actually leaves you what is meant is that you do not examine your own conscience Nor must you think that what I have said upon this point of self confidences applies only to wealth and riches To rely on your talents to rely on the services you have rendered to rely on your cleverness to rely on your judgment to rely on your strength to rely on your rank and to think yourself secure in the possession of these is to place yourselves in the same category with the shell fish in the story In all things examine your own consciences the examination of your own hearts is above all things essential The preacher leaves his place SERMON II THE SERMONS OF KIU O VOL I If a man loses a fowl or a dog he knows how to reclaim it If he loses his soul he knows not how to reclaim it The true path of learning has no other function than to teach us how to reclaim lost souls This parable has been declared to us by Moshi If a dog or a chicken or a pet cat does not come home at the proper time its master makes a great fuss about hunting for it and wonders can it have been killed by a dog or by a snake or can some man have stolen it and ransacking the three houses opposite and his two next door neighbours houses as if he were seeking for a lost child cries Pray sir has my tortoiseshell cat been with you Has my pet chicken been here That is the way in which men run about under such circumstances It s a matter of the utmost importance And yet to lose a dog or a tame chicken is no such terrible loss after all But the soul which is called the lord of the body is the master of our whole selves If men part with this soul for the sake of other things then they become deaf to the admonitions of their parents and the instructions of their superiors are to them as the winds of heaven Teaching is to them like pouring water over a frog s face they blink their eyes and that is all they say Yes yes with their mouths but their hearts are gone and seeing they are blind hearing they are deaf Born whole and sound by their own doing they enter the fraternity of cripples Such are all those who lose their souls Nor do they think of inquiring or looking for their lost soul It is my parents fault it is my master s fault it is my husband s fault it is my elder brother s fault it is Hachibei who is a rogue it is Matsu who is a bad woman They content themselves with looking at the faults of others and do not examine their own consciences nor search their own hearts Is not this a cruel state of things They set up a hue and cry for a lost dog or a pet chicken but for this all important soul of theirs they make no search What mistaken people For this reason the sages mourning over such a state of things have taught us what is the right path of man and it is the receiving of this teaching that is called learning The main object of learning is the examination and searching of our own hearts therefore the text says The true path of learning has no other function than to teach us how to reclaim lost souls This is an exhaustive exposition of the functions of learning That learning has no other object we have this gracious pledge and guarantee from the sage As for the mere study of the antiquities and annals of China and Japan and investigation into literature these cannot be called learning which is above all things an affair of the soul All the commentaries and all the books of all the teachers in the world are but so many directories by which to find out the whereabouts of our own souls This search after our own souls is that which I alluded to just now as the examination of our consciences To disregard the examination of our consciences is a terrible thing of which it is impossible to foresee the end on the other hand to practise it is most admirable for by this means we can on the spot attain filial piety and fidelity to our masters Virtue and vice are the goals to which the examination and non examination of our consciences lead As it has been rightly said benevolence and malice are the two roads which man follows Upon this subject I have a terrible and yet a very admirable story to tell you Although I dare say you are very drowsy I must beg you to listen to me In a certain part of the country there was a well to do farmer whose marriage had brought him one son whom he petted beyond all measure as a cow licks her calf So by degrees the child became very sly he used to pull the horses tails and blow smoke into the bulls nostrils and bully the neighbours children in petty ways and make them cry From a peevish child he grew to be a man and unbearably undutiful to his parents Priding himself on a little superior strength he became a drunkard and a gambler and learned to wrestle at fairs He would fight and quarrel for a trifle and spent his time in debauchery and riotous living If his parents remonstrated with him he would raise his voice and abuse them using scurrilous language It s all very well your abusing me for being dissolute and disobedient But pray who asked you to bring me into the world You brought me into the world and I have to thank you for its miseries so now if you hate dissolute people you had better put me back where I came from and I shall be all right again This was the sort of insolent answer he would give his parents who at their wits end began to grow old in years And as he by degrees grew more and more of a bully unhappy as he made them still he was their darling and they could not find it in their hearts to turn him out of the house and disinherit him So they let him pursue his selfish course and he went on from worse to worse knocking people down breaking their arms and getting up great disturbances It is unnecessary to speak of his parents feelings Even his relations and friends felt as if nails were being hammered into their breasts He was a thoroughly wicked man Now no one is from his mother s womb so wicked as this but those who persist in selfishness lose their senses and gradually reach this pitch of wickedness What a terrible thing is this throwing away of our hearts Well this man s relations and friends very properly urged his parents to disown him but he was an only child and so his parents although they said To day we really will disinherit him or To morrow we really will break off all relations with him still it was all empty talk and the years and months passed by until the scapegrace reached his twenty sixth year having heaped wickedness upon wickedness and who can tell how much trouble he brought upon his family who were always afraid of hearing of some new enormity At last they held a family council and told the parents that matters had come to such a pass that if they did not disown their son the rest of the family must needs break off all communication with them if he were allowed to go on in his evil courses the whole village not to speak of his relations would be disgraced so either the parents against whom however there was no ill will felt must be cut by the family or they must disinherit their son to this appeal they begged to have a distinct answer The parents reflecting that to separate themselves from their relations even for the sake of their own son would be an act of disrespect to their ancestors determined to invite their relations to assemble and draw up a petition to the Government for leave to disinherit their son to which petition the family would all affix their seals according to form so they begged them to come in the evening and bring their seals with them This was their answer There is an old saw which says The old cow licks her calf and the tigress carries her cub in her mouth If the instinct of beasts and birds prompt them to love their young how much the more must it be a bitter thing for a man to have to disown his own son All this trouble was the consequence of this youth casting his heart from him Had he examined his own conscience the storm of waves and of wind would not have arisen and all would have been calm But as he refused to listen to his conscience his parents much against their will were forced to visit him with the punishment of disinheritance which he had brought upon himself A sad thing indeed In the poems of his Reverence Tokuhon a modern poet there is the following passage Since Buddha thus winds himself round our hearts let the man who dares to disregard him fear for his life The allusion is to the great mercy and love of the gods The gods wish to make men examine their consciences and day and night help men to discern that which is evil but although they point out our desires and pleasures our lusts and passions as things to be avoided men turn their backs upon their own consciences The love of the gods is like the love of parents for their children and men treat the gods as undutiful children treat their parents Men who dare to disregard the gods let them fear for their lives I pray you who hear me one and all to examine your own consciences and be saved To return to the story of the vagabond son As it happened that day he was gambling in a neighbouring village when a friend from his own place came up and told him that his relations had met together to disinherit him and that fine fellow as he was he would find it a terrible thing to be disowned Before he had heard him half out the other replied in a loud voice What do you mean to say that they are holding a family council to night to disinherit me What a good joke I m sure I don t want to be always seeing my father s and mother s blubbering faces it makes me quite sick to think of them it s quite unbearable I m able to take care of myself and if I choose to go over to China or to live in India I should like to know who is to prevent me This is the very thing above all others for me I ll go off to the room where they are all assembled and ask them why they want to disinherit me I ll just swagger like Danjuro ninety one the actor and frighten them into giving me fifty or seventy ounces of silver to get rid of me and put the money in my purse and be off to Kioto or Osaka where I ll set up a tea house on my own account and enjoy myself to my heart s content I hope this will be a great night for me so I ll just drink a cup of wine for luck beforehand Footnote ninety one A famous actor of Yedo who lived one hundred ninety five years ago He was born at Sakura in Shimosa And so with a lot of young devils of his own sort be fell to drinking wine in teacups ninety two so that before nightfall they were all as drunk as mud Well then on the strength of this wine as he was setting out for his father s house he said Now then to try my luck and stuck a long dirk in his girdle He reached his own village just before nightfall thinking to burst into the place where he imagined his relations to be gathered together turning their wisdom pockets inside out to shake out their small provision of intelligence in consultation and he fancied that if he blustered and bullied he would certainly get a hundred ounces of silver out of them Just as he was about to enter the house he reflected Footnote ninety two The ordinary wine cup holding only a thimbleful to drink wine out of teacups is a great piece of debauchery like drinking brandy in tumblers If I show my face in the room where my relations are gathered together they will all look down on the ground and remain silent so if I go in shouting and raging it will be quite out of harmony but if they abuse me then I shall be in the right if I jump in on them and frighten them well The best plan will be for me to step out of the bamboo grove which is behind the house and to creep round the verandah and I can listen to these fellows holding their consultation they will certainly be raking up all sorts of scandal about me It will be all in harmony then if I kick down the shutters and sliding doors with a noise like thunder And what fun it will be As he thought thus to himself he pulled off his iron heeled sandals and stuck them in his girdle and girding up his dress round his waist left the bamboo grove at the back of the house and jumping over the garden wicket went round the verandah and looked in Peeping through a chink in the shutters he could see his relations gathered together in council speaking in whispers The family were sitting in a circle and one and all were affixing their seals to the petition of disinheritance At last having passed from hand to hand the document came round to where the two parents were sitting Their son seeing this said Come now it s win or lose My parents signing the paper shall be the sign for me to kick open the door and jump into the middle of them So getting ready for a good kick he held his breath and looked on What terrible perversion man can allow his heart to come to Moshi has said that man by nature is good but although not a particle of fault can be found with what he has said when the evil we have learned becomes a second nature men reach this fearful degree of wickedness When men come to this pass Koshi ninety three and Moshi themselves might preach to them for a thousand days and they would not have strength to reform Such hardened sinners deserve to be roasted in iron pots in the nethermost hell Now I am going to tell you how it came about that the vagabond son turned over a new leaf and became dutiful and finally entered paradise The poet says Although the hearts of parents are not surrounded by dark night how often they stray from the right road in their affection for their children Footnote ninety three Koshi is the Japanese pronunciation of the name of the Chinese philosopher Kung Ts u or Kung Fu Ts u whom we call Confucius When the petition of disinheritance came round to the place where the two parents were sitting the mother lifted up her voice and wept aloud and the father clenching his toothless gums to conceal his emotion remained with his head bent down presently in a husky voice he said Wife give me the seal But she returned no answer and with tears in her eyes took a leather purse containing the seal out of a drawer of the cupboard and placed it before her husband All this time the vagabond son holding his breath was peeping in from outside the shutters In the meanwhile the old man slowly untied the strings of the purse and took out the seal and smeared on the colouring matter Just as he was about to seal the document his wife clutched at his hand and said Oh pray wait a little The father replied Now that all our relations are looking on you must not speak in this weak manner But she would not listen to what he said but went on Pray listen to what I have to say It is true that if we were to give over our house to our undutiful son in less than three years the grass would be growing in its place for he would be ruined Still if we disinherit our child the only child that we have either in heaven or upon earth we shall have to adopt another in his place Although if the adopted son turned out honest and dutiful and inherited our property all would be well still what certainty is there of his doing so If on the other hand the adopted son turned out to be a prodigal and laid waste our house what unlucky parents we should be And who can say that this would not be the case If we are to be ruined for the sake of an equally wicked adopted son I had rather lose our home for the sake of our own son and leaving out old familiar village as beggars seek for our lost boy on foot This is my fervent wish During fifty years that we have lived together this has been the only favour that I have ever asked of you Pray listen to my prayer and put a stop to this act of disinheritance Even though I should become a beggar for my son s sake I could feel no resentment against him So she spoke sobbing aloud The relations who heard this looked round at one another and watched the father to see what he would do and he who knows with what thoughts in his head put back the seal into the leather purse and quickly drew the strings together and pushed back the petition to the relations Certainly said he I have lost countenance and am disgraced before all my family however I think that what the good wife has just said is right and proper and from henceforth I renounce all thoughts of disinheriting my son Of course you will all see a weakness of purpose in what I say and laugh at me as the cause of my son s undutiful conduct But laugh away it won t hurt me Certainly if I don t disinherit this son of mine my house will be ruined before three years are over our heads To lay waste the house of generations upon generations of my ancestors is a sin against those ancestors of this I am well aware Further if I don t disinherit my son you gentlemen will all shun me I know that I am cutting myself off from my relations Of course you think that when I leave this place I shall be dunning you to bestow your charity upon me and that is why you want to break off relations with me Pray don t make yourselves uneasy I care no more for my duties to the world for my impiety to my ancestors or for my separation from my family Our son is our only darling and we mean to go after him following him as beggars on foot This is our desire We shall trouble you for no alms and for no charity However we may die we have but one life to lose For our darling son s sake we will lay ourselves down and die by the roadside There our bodies shall be manure for the trees of the avenue And all this we will endure cheerfully and not utter a complaint Make haste and return home therefore all of you From to morrow we are no longer on speaking terms As for what you may say to me on my son s account I do not care And as his wife had done he lifted up his voice and wept shedding manly tears As for her when she heard that the act of disinheritance was not to be drawn up her tears were changed to tears of joy The rest of the family remained in mute astonishment at so unheard of a thing and could only stare at the faces of the two old people You see how bewildered parents must be by their love for their children to be so merciful towards them As a cat carrying her young in her mouth screens it from the sun at one time and brings it under the light at another so parents act by their children screening their bad points and bringing out in relief their good qualities They care neither for the abuse of others nor for their duties to their ancestors nor for the wretched future in store for themselves Carried away by their infatuation for their children and intoxicated upon intoxication the hearts of parents are to be pitied for their pitifulness It is not only the two parents in my story who are in this plight the hearts of all parents of children all over the world are the same In the poems of the late learned Ishida it is written When I look round me and see the hearts of parents bewildered by their love for their children I reflect that my own father and mother must be like them This is certainly a true saying To return to the story the halo of his parents great kindness and pity penetrated the very bowels of the prodigal son What an admirable thing When he heard it terrible and sly devil as he had been he felt as if his whole body had been squeezed in a press and somehow or other although the tears rose in his breast he could not for shame lift up his voice and weep Biting the sleeve of his dress he lay down on the ground and shed tears in silence What says the verse of the reverend priest Eni To shed tears of gratitude one knows not why A very pretty poem indeed So then the vagabond son in his gratitude to his parents could neither stand nor sit You see the original heart of man is by nature bright virtue but by our selfish pursuit of our own inclinations the brilliancy of our original virtue is hidden To continue the prodigal was pierced to the core by the great mercy shown by his parents and the brilliancy of his own original good heart was enticed back to him The sunlight came forth and what became of all the clouds of self will and selfishness The clouds were all dispelled and from the bottom of his soul there sprang the desire to thank his parents for their goodness We all know the story of the rush cutter who saw the moon rising between the trees on a moorland hill so brightly that he fancied it must have been scoured with the scouring rush which grew near the spot When a man who has been especially wicked repents and returns to his original heart he becomes all the more excellent and his brightness is as that of the rising moon scoured What an admirable thing this is So the son thought to enter the room at once and beg his parents forgiveness but he thought to himself Wait a bit If I burst suddenly into the room like this the relations will all be frightened and not know what to make of it and this will be a trouble to my parents I will put on an innocent face as if I did not know what has been going on and I ll go in by the front door and beg the relations to intercede for me with my parents With stealthy step he left the back of the house and went round to the front When he arrived there he purposely made a great noise with his iron heeled sandals and gave a loud cough to clear his throat and entered the room The relations were all greatly alarmed and his parents when they saw the face of their wicked son both shed tears As for the son he said not a word but remained weeping with his head bent down After a while he addressed the relations and said Although I have frequently been threatened with disinheritance and although in those days I made light of it to night when I heard that this family council had assembled I somehow or other felt my heart beset by anxiety and grief However I may have heaped wickedness upon wickedness up to the present moment as I shall certainly now mend my ways I pray you to delay for a while to night s act of disinheritance I do not venture to ask for a long delay I ask but for thirty days and if within that time I shall not have given proofs of repentance disinherit me I shall not have a word to say I pray you gentlemen to intercede with my parents that they may grant this delay of thirty days and to present them my humble apologies With this he rubbed his head on the mat as a humble suppliant in a manner most foreign to his nature The relations after hearing the firm and resolute answer of the parents had shifted about in their places but although they were on the point of leaving the house had remained behind sadly out of harmony when the son came in and happily with a word set all in tune again So the relations addressed the parents and said Pray defer to night s affair and laid the son s apologies at their feet As for the parents who would not have disinherited their son even had he not repented how much the more when they heard what he said did they weep for joy and the relations delighted at the happy event exhorted the son to become really dutiful and so that night s council broke up So this son in the turn of a hand became a pious son and the way in which he served his parents was that of a tender and loving child His former evil ways he extinguished utterly The fame of this story rose high in the world and before half a year had passed it reached the ears of the lord of the manor who when he had put on his noble spectacles and investigated the case appointed the son to be the head man of his village You may judge by this what this son s filial piety effected Three years after these events his mother who was on her death bed very sick called for him and said When some time since the consultation was being held about disinheriting you by some means or other your heart was turned and since then you have been a dutiful son above all others If at that time you had not repented and I had died in the meanwhile my soul would have gone to hell without fail because of my foolish conduct towards you But now that you have repented there is nothing that weighs upon me and there can be no mistake about my going to paradise So the fact of my becoming one of the saints will all be the work of your filial piety And the story goes that with these words the mother lifting up her hands in prayer died To be sure by the deeds of the present life we may obtain a glimpse into the future If a man s heart is troubled by his misdeeds in this life it will again be tortured in the next The troubled heart is hell The heart at rest is paradise The trouble or peace of parents depends upon their children If their children are virtuous parents are as the saints if their children are wicked parents suffer the tortures of the damned If once your youthful spirits in a fit of heedlessness have led you to bring trouble upon your parents and cause them to weep just consider the line of argument which I have been following From this time forth repent and examine your own hearts If you will become dutiful your parents from this day will live happy as the saints But if you will not repent but persist in your evil ways your parents will suffer the pains of hell Heaven and hell are matters of repentance or non repentance Repentance is the finding of the lost heart and is also the object of learning I shall speak to you further upon this point to morrow evening SERMON III THE SERMONS OF KIU O VOL one Moshi has said There is the third finger If a man s third or nameless finger be bent so that he cannot straighten it although his bent finger may cause him no pain still if he hears of some one who can cure it he will think nothing of undertaking a long journey from Shin to So ninety four to consult him upon this deformed finger for he knows it is to be hateful to have a finger unlike those of other men But he cares not a jot if his heart be different to that of other men and this is how men disregard the true order of things Footnote ninety four Ancient divisions of China Now this is the next chapter to the one about benevolence being the true heart of man which I expounded to you the other night True learning has no other aim than that of reclaiming lost souls and in connection with this Moshi has thus again declared in a parable the all importance of the human heart The nameless finger is that which is next to the little finger The thumb is called the parent finger the first finger is called the index the long is called the middle finger but the third finger has no name It is true that it is sometimes called the finger for applying rouge but that is only a name given it by ladies and is not in general use So having no name it is called the nameless finger And how comes it to have no name Why because it is of all the fingers the least useful When we clutch at or grasp things we do so by the strength of the thumb and little finger If a man scratches his head he does it with the forefinger if he wishes to test the heat of the wine ninety five in the kettle he uses the little finger Thus although each finger has its uses and duties the nameless finger alone is of no use it is not in our way if we have it and we do not miss it if we lose it Of the whole body it is the meanest member if it be crooked so that we cannot straighten it it neither hurts nor itches as Moshi says in the text it causes no pain even if we were without it we should be none the worse off Hence what though it should be bent it would be better since it causes no pain to leave it as it is Yet if a person having such a crooked finger hears of a clever doctor who can set it straight no matter at how great a distance he may be he will be off to consult this doctor And pray why Because he feels ashamed of having a finger a little different from the rest of the world and so he wants to be cured and will think nothing of travelling from Shin to So a distance of a thousand miles for the purpose To be sure men are very susceptible and keenly alive to a sense of shame and in this they are quite right The feeling of shame at what is wrong is the commencement of virtue The perception of shame is inborn in men but there are two ways of perceiving shame There are some men who are sensible of shame for what regards their bodies but who are ignorant of shame for what concerns their hearts and a terrible mistake they make There is nothing which can be compared in importance to the heart The heart is said to be the lord of the body which it rules as a master rules his house Shall the lord who is the heart be ailing and his sickness be neglected while his servants who are the members only are cared for If the knee be lacerated apply tinder to stop the bleeding if the moxa should suppurate spread a plaster if a cold be caught prepare medicine and garlic and gruel and ginger wine For a trifle you will doctor and care for your bodies and yet for your hearts you will take no care Although you are born of mankind if your hearts resemble those of devils of foxes of snakes or of crows rather than the hearts of men you take no heed caring for your bodies alone Whence can you have fallen into such a mistake It is a folly of old standing too for it was to that that Moshi pointed when he said that to be cognizant of a deformed finger and ignore the deformities of the soul was to disregard the true order of things This is what it is not to distinguish between that which is important and that which is unimportant to pick up a trifle and pass by something of value The instinct of man prompts him to prefer the great to the small the important to the unimportant Footnote ninety five Wine is almost always drunk hot If a man is invited out to a feast by his relations or acquaintances when the guests are assembled and the principal part of the feast has disappeared he looks all round him with the eyeballs starting out of his head and glares at his neighbours and comparing the little titbits of roast fowl or fish put before them sees that they are about half an inch bigger than those set before him then blowing out his belly with rage he thinks What on earth can the host be about Master Tarubei is a guest but so am I what does the fellow mean by helping me so meanly There must be some malice or ill will here And so his mind is prejudiced against the host Just be so good as to reflect upon this Does a man show his spite by grudging a bit of roast fowl or meat And yet even in such trifles as these do men show how they try to obtain what is great and show their dislike of what is small How can men be conscious of shame for a deformed finger and count it as no misfortune that their hearts are crooked That is how they abandon the substance for the shadow Moshi severely censures the disregard of the true order of things What mistaken and bewildered creatures men are What says the old song Hidden far among the mountains the tree which seems to be rotten if its core be yet alive may be made to bear flowers What signifies it if the hand or the foot be deformed The heart is the important thing If the heart be awry what though your skin be fair your nose aquiline your hair beautiful All these strike the eye alone and are utterly useless It is as if you were to put horse dung into a gold lacquer luncheon box This is what is called a fair outside deceptive in appearance There s the scullery maid been washing out the pots at the kitchen sink and the scullion Chokichi comes up and says to her You ve got a lot of charcoal smut sticking to your nose and points out to her the ugly spot The scullery maid is delighted to be told of this and answers Really whereabouts is it Then she twists a towel round her finger and bending her head till mouth and forehead are almost on a level she squints at her nose and twiddles away with her fingers as if she were the famous Goto ninety six at work carving the ornaments of a sword handle I say Master Chokichi is it off yet Not a bit of it You ve smeared it all over your cheeks now Oh dear oh dear where can it be And so she uses the water basin as a looking glass and washes her face clean then she says to herself What a dear boy Chokichi is and thinks it necessary out of gratitude to give him relishes with his supper by the ladleful and thanks him over and over again But if this same Chokichi were to come up to her and say Now really how lazy you are I wish you could manage to be rather less of a shrew what do you think the scullery maid would answer then Reflect for a moment Drat the boy s impudence If I were of a bad heart or an angular disposition should I be here helping him You go and be hung You see if I take the trouble to wash your dirty bedclothes for you any more And she gets to be a perfect devil less only the horns Footnote ninety six A famous gold and silver smith of the olden time A Benvenuto Cellini among the Japanese His mark on a piece of metal work enhances its value tenfold There are other people besides the poor scullery maid who are in the same way Excuse me mister Gundabei but the embroidered crest on your dress of ceremony seems to be a little on one side mister Gundabei proceeds to adjust his dress with great precision Thank you sir I am ten million times obliged to you for your care If ever there should be any matter in which I can be of service to you I beg that you will do me the favour of letting me know and with a beaming face he expresses his gratitude Now for the other side of the picture Really mister Gundabei you are very foolish you don t seem to understand at all I beg you to be of a frank and honest heart it really makes me quite sad to see a man s heart warped in this way What is his answer He turns his sword in his girdle ready to draw and plays the devil s tattoo upon the hilt it looks as if it must end in a fight soon In fact if you help a man in anything which has to do with a fault of the body he takes it very kindly and sets about mending matters If any one helps another to rectify a fault of the heart he has to deal with a man in the dark who flies in a rage and does not care to amend How out of tune all this is And yet there are men who are bewildered up to this point Nor is this a special and extraordinary failing This mistaken perception of the great and the small of colour and of substance is common to us all to you and to me Please give me your attention The form strikes the eye but the heart strikes not the eye Therefore that the heart should be distorted and turned awry causes no pain This all results from the want of sound judgment and that is why we cannot afford to be careless The master of a certain house calls his servant Chokichi who sits dozing in the kitchen Here Chokichi The guests are all gone come and clear away the wine and fish in the back room Chokichi rubs his eyes and with a sulky answer goes into the back room and looking about him sees all the nice things paraded on the trays and in the bowls It s wonderful how his drowsiness passes away no need for any one to hurry him now His eyes glare with greed as he says Hullo here s a lot of tempting things There s only just one help of that omelette left in the tray What a hungry lot of guests What s this It looks like fish rissoles and with this he picks out one and crams his mouth full when on one side a mess of young cuttlefish in a Chinese ninety seven porcelain bowl catches his eyes There the little beauties sit in a circle like Buddhist priests in religious meditation Oh goodness how nice and just as he is dipping his finger and thumb in he hears his master s footstep and knowing that he is doing wrong he crams his prize into the pocket of his sleeve and stoops down to take away the wine kettle and cups and as he does this out tumble the cuttlefish from his sleeve The master sees it Footnote ninety seven Curiosities such as porcelain or enamel or carved jade from China are highly esteemed by the Japanese A great quantity of the porcelain of Japan is stamped with counterfeit Chinese marks of the Ming dynasty What s that Chokichi pretending not to know what has happened beats the mats and keeps on saying Come again the day before yesterday come again the day before yesterday ninety eight Footnote ninety eight An incantation used to invite spiders which are considered unlucky by the superstitious to come again at the Greek Kalends But it s no use his trying to persuade his master that the little cuttlefish are spiders for they are not the least like them It s no use hiding things they are sure to come to light and so it is with the heart its purposes will out If the heart is enraged the dark veins stand out on the forehead if the heart is grieved tears rise to the eyes if the heart is joyous dimples appear in the cheeks if the heart is merry the face smiles thus it is that the face reflects the emotions of the heart It is not because the eyes are filled with tears that the heart is sad nor because the veins stand out on the forehead that the heart is enraged It is the heart which leads the way in everything All the important sensations of the heart are apparent in the outward appearance In the Great Learning of Koshi it is written The truth of what is within appears upon the surface How then is the heart a thing which can be hidden To answer when reproved to hum tunes when scolded show a diseased heart and if this disease is not quickly taken in hand it will become chronic and the remedy become difficult perhaps the disease may be so virulent that even Giba and Henjaku ninety nine in consultation could not effect a cure So before the disease has gained strength I invite you to the study of the moral essays entitled Shin gaku the Learning of the Heart If you once arrive at the possession of your heart as it was originally by nature what an admirable thing that will be In that case your conscience will point out to you even the slightest wrong bias or selfishness Footnote ninety nine Two famous Indian and Chinese physicians While upon this subject I may tell you a story which was related to me by a friend of mine It is a story which the master of a certain money changer s shop used to be very fond of telling An important part of a money changer s business is to distinguish between good and bad gold and silver In the different establishments the ways of teaching the apprentices this art vary however the plan adopted by the money changer was as follows At first he would show them no bad silver but would daily put before them good money only when they had become thoroughly familiar with the sight of good money if he stealthily put a little base coin among the good he found that they would detect it immediately they saw it as plainly as you see things when you throw light on a mirror This faculty of detecting base money at a glance was the result of having learned thoroughly to understand good money Having once been taught in this way the apprentices would not make a mistake about a piece of base coin during their whole lives as I have heard I can t vouch for the truth of this but it is very certain that the principle applied to moral instruction is an excellent one it is a most safe mode of study However I was further told that if after having thus learned to distinguish good money a man followed some other trade for six months or a year and gave up handling money he would become just like any other inexperienced person unable to distinguish the good from the base Please reflect upon this attentively If you once render yourself familiar with the nature of the uncorrupted heart from that time forth you will be immediately conscious of the slightest inclination towards bias or selfishness And why Because the natural heart is illumined When a man has once learned that which is perfect he will never consent to accept that which is imperfect but if after having acquired this knowledge he again keeps his natural heart at a distance and gradually forgets to recognize that which is perfect he finds himself in the dark again and that he can no longer distinguish base money from good I beg you to take care If a man falls into bad habits he is no longer able to perceive the difference between the good impulses of his natural heart and the evil impulses of his corrupt heart With this benighted heart as a starting point he can carry out none of his intentions and he has to lift his shoulders sighing and sighing again A creature much to be pitied indeed Then he loses all self reliance so that although it would be better for him to hold his tongue and say nothing about it if he is in the slightest trouble or distress he goes and confesses the crookedness of his heart to every man he meets What a wretched state for a man to be in For this reason I beg you to learn thoroughly the true silver of the heart in order that you may make no mistake about the base coin I pray that you and I during our whole lives may never leave the path of true principles I have an amusing story to tell you in connection with this if you will be so good as to listen Once upon a time when the autumn nights were beginning to grow chilly five or six tradesmen in easy circumstances had assembled together to have a chat and having got ready their picnic box and wine flask went off to a temple on the hills where a friendly priest lived that they might listen to the stags roaring With this intention they went to call upon the priest and borrowed the guests apartments one hundred of the monastery and as they were waiting to hear the deer roar some of the party began to compose poetry One would write a verse of Chinese poetry and another would write a verse of seventeen syllables and as they were passing the wine cup the hour of sunset came but not a deer had uttered a call eight o clock came and ten o clock came still not a sound from the deer Footnote one hundred All the temples in China and Japan have guests apartments which may be secured for a trifle either for a long or short period It is false to suppose that there is any desecration of a sacred shrine in the act of using it as a hostelry it is the custom of the country What can this mean said one The deer surely ought to be roaring But in spite of their waiting the deer would not roar At last the friends got sleepy and bored with writing songs and verses began to yawn and gave up twaddling about the woes and troubles of life and as they were all silent one of them a man fifty years of age stopping the circulation of the wine cup said Well certainly gentlemen thanks to you we have spent the evening in very pleasant conversation However although I am enjoying myself mightily in this way my people at home must be getting anxious and so I begin to think that we ought to leave off drinking Why so said the others Well I ll tell you You know that my only son is twenty two years of age this year and a troublesome fellow be is too When I m at home he lends a hand sulkily enough in the shop but as soon as he no longer sees the shadow of me he hoists sail and is off to some bad haunt Although our relations and connections are always preaching to him not a word has any more effect that wind blowing into a horse s ear When I think that I shall have to leave my property to such a fellow as that it makes my heart grow small indeed Although thanks to those to whom I have succeeded I want for nothing still when I think of my son I shed tears of blood night and day And as he said this with a sigh a man of some forty five or forty six years said No no although you make so much of your misfortunes your son is but a little extravagant after all There s no such great cause for grief there I ve got a very different story to tell Of late years my shopmen for one reason or another have been running me into debt thinking nothing of a debt of fifty or seventy ounces and so the ledgers get all wrong Just think of that Here have I been keeping these fellows ever since they were little children unable to blow their own noses and now as soon as they come to be a little useful in the shop they begin running up debts and are no good whatever to their master You see you only have to spend your money upon your own son Then another gentleman said Well I think that to spend money upon your shop people is no such great hardship after all Now I ve been in something like trouble lately I can t get a penny out of my customers One man owes me fifteen ounces another owes me twenty five ounces Really that is enough to make a man feel as if his heart was worn away When he had finished speaking an old gentleman who was sitting opposite playing with his fan said Certainly gentlemen your grievances are not without cause still to be perpetually asked for a little money or to back a bill by one s relations or friends and to have a lot of hangers on dependent on one as I have is a worse case still But before the old gentleman had half finished speaking his neighbour called out No no all you gentlemen are in luxury compared to me Please listen to what I have to suffer My wife and my mother can t hit it off anyhow All day long they re like a couple of cows butting at one another with their horns The house is as unendurable as if it were full of smoke I often think it would be better to send my wife back to her village but then I ve got two little children If I interfere and take my wife s part my mother gets low spirited If I scold my wife she says that I treat her so brutally because she s not of the same flesh and blood and then she hates me The trouble and anxiety are beyond description I m like a post stuck up between them And so they all twaddled away in chorus each about his own troubles At last one of the gentlemen recollecting himself said Well gentlemen certainly the deer ought to be roaring but we ve been so engrossed with our conversation that we don t know whether we have missed hearing them or not With this he pulled aside the sliding door of the verandah and looked out and lo and behold a great big stag was standing perfectly silent in front of the garden Hullo said the man to the deer what s this Since you ve been there all the time why did you not roar Then the stag answered with an innocent face Oh I came here to listen to the lamentations of you gentlemen Isn t that a funny story Old and young men and women rich and poor never cease grumbling from morning till night All this is the result of a diseased heart In short for the sake of a very trifling inclination or selfish pursuit they will do any wrong in order to effect that which is impossible This is want of judgment and this brings all sorts of trouble upon the world If once you gain possession of a perfect heart knowing that which is impossible to be impossible and recognizing that that which is difficult is difficult you will not attempt to spare yourself trouble unduly What says the Chin Yo one hundred one The wise man whether his lot be cast amongst rich or poor amongst barbarians or in sorrow understands his position by his own instinct If men do not understand this they think that the causes of pain and pleasure are in the body Putting the heart on one side they earnestly strive after the comforts of the body and launch into extravagance the end of which is miserly parsimony Instead of pleasure they meet with grief of the heart and pass their lives in weeping and wailing In one way or another everything in this world depends upon the heart I implore every one of you to take heed that tears fall not to your lot Footnote one hundred one The second book of Confucius APPENDICES APPENDIX A AN ACCOUNT OF THE HARA KIRI FROM A RARE JAPANESE MS Seppuku hara kiri is the mode of suicide adopted amongst Samurai when they have no alternative but to die Some there are who thus commit suicide of their own free will others there are who having committed some crime which does not put them outside the pale of the privileges of the Samurai class are ordered by their superiors to put an end to their own lives It is needless to say that it is absolutely necessary that the principal the witnesses and the seconds who take part in the affair should be acquainted with all the ceremonies to be observed A long time ago a certain Daimio invited a number of persons versed in the various ceremonies to call upon him to explain the different forms to be observed by the official witnesses who inspect and verify the head c and then to instruct him in the ceremonies to be observed in the act of suicide then he showed all these rites to his son and to all his retainers Another person has said that as the ceremonies to be gone through by principal witnesses and seconds are all very important matters men should familiarize themselves with a thing which is so terrible in order that should the time come for them to take part in it they may not be taken by surprise The witnesses go to see and certify the suicide For seconds men are wanted who have distinguished themselves in the military arts In old days men used to bear these things in mind but now a days the fashion is to be ignorant of such ceremonies and if upon rare occasions a criminal is handed over to a Daimio s charge that he may perform hara kiri it often happens at the time of execution that there is no one among all the prince s retainers who is competent to act as second in which case a man has to be engaged in a hurry from some other quarter to cut off the head of the criminal and for that day he changes his name and becomes a retainer of the prince either of the middle or lowest class and the affair is entrusted to him and so the difficulty is got over nor is this considered to be a disgrace It is a great breach of decorum if the second who is a most important officer commits any mistake such as not striking off the head at a blow in the presence of the witnesses sent by the Government On this account a skilful person must be employed and to hide the unmanliness of his own people a prince must perform the ceremony in this imperfect manner Every Samurai should be able to cut off a man s head therefore to have to employ a stranger to act as second is to incur the charge of ignorance of the arts of war and is a bitter mortification However young men trusting to their youthful ardour are apt to be careless and are certain to make a mistake Some people there are who not lacking in skill on ordinary occasions lose their presence of mind in public and cannot do themselves justice It is all the more important therefore as the act occurs but rarely that men who are liable to be called upon to be either principals or seconds or witnesses in the hara kiri should constantly be examined in their skill as swordsmen and should be familiar with all the rites in order that when the time comes they may not lose their presence of mind According to one authority capital punishment may be divided into two kinds beheading and strangulation The ceremony of hara kiri was added afterwards in the case of persons belonging to the military class being condemned to death This was first instituted in the days of the Ashikaga one hundred two dynasty At that time the country was in a state of utter confusion and there were men who although fighting were neither guilty of high treason nor of infidelity to their feudal lords but who by the chances of war were taken prisoners To drag out such men as these bound as criminals and cut their heads off was intolerably cruel accordingly men hit upon a ceremonious mode of suicide by disembowelling in order to comfort the departed spirit Even at present where it becomes necessary to put to death a man who has been guilty of some act not unworthy of a Samurai at the time of the execution witnesses are sent to the house and the criminal having bathed and put on new clothes in obedience to the commands of his superiors puts an end to himself but does not on that account forfeit his rank as a Samurai This is a law for which in all truth men should be grateful Footnote one hundred two Ashikaga third dynasty of Shoguns flourished from A D thirteen thirty six to fifteen sixty eight The practice of suicide by disembowelling is of great antiquity This is the time when the ceremonies attending it were invented ON THE PREPARATION OF THE PLACE OF EXECUTION In old days the ceremony of hara kiri used to be performed in a temple In the third year of the period called Kan yei A D sixteen twenty six a certain person having been guilty of treason was ordered to disembowel himself on the fourteenth day of the first month in the temple of Kichijoji at Komagome in Yedo Eighteen years later the retainer of a certain Daimio having had a dispute with a sailor belonging to an Osaka coasting ship killed the sailor and an investigation having been made into the matter by the Governor of Osaka the retainer was ordered to perform hara kiri on the twentieth day of the sixth month in the temple called Sokusanji in Osaka During the period Shoho middle of seventeenth century a certain man having been guilty of heinous misconduct performed hara kiri in the temple called Shimpukuji in the Koji street of Yedo On the fourth day of the fifth month of the second year of the period Meireki A D sixteen fifty six a certain man for having avenged the death of his cousin s husband at a place called Shimidzudani in the Koji street disembowelled himself in the temple called Honseiji On the twenty sixth day of the sixth month of the eighth year of the period Yempo A D sixteen eighty at the funeral ceremonies in honour of the anniversary of the death of Genyuin Sama a former Shogun Naito Idzumi no Kami having a cause of hatred against Nagai Shinano no Kami killed him at one blow with a short sword in the main hall of the temple called Zojoji the burial place of the Shoguns in Yedo Idzumi no Kami was arrested by the officers present and on the following day performed hara kiri at Kiridoshi in the temple called Seiriuji In modern times the ceremony has taken place at night either in the palace or in the garden of a Daimio to whom the condemned man has been given in charge Whether it takes place in the palace or in the garden depends upon the rank of the individual Daimios and Hatamotos as a matter of course and the higher retainers of the Shogun disembowel themselves in the palace retainers of lower rank should do so in the garden In the case of vassals of feudatories according to the rank of their families those who being above the grade of captains carry the baton one hundred three should perform hara kiri in the palace all others in the garden If when the time comes the persons engaged in the ceremony are in any doubt as to the proper rules to be followed they should inquire of competent persons and settle the question At the beginning of the eighteenth century during the period Genroku when Asano Takumi no Kami one hundred four disembowelled himself in the palace of a Daimio called Tamura as the whole thing was sudden and unexpected the garden was covered with matting and on the top of this thick mats were laid and a carpet and the affair was concluded so but there are people who say that it was wrong to treat a Daimio thus as if he had been an ordinary Samurai But it is said that in old times it was the custom that the ceremony should take place upon a leather carpet spread in the garden and further that the proper place is inside a picket fence tied together in the garden so it is wrong for persons who are only acquainted with one form of the ceremony to accuse Tamura of having acted improperly If however the object was to save the house from the pollution of blood then the accusation of ill will may well be brought for the preparation of the place is of great importance Footnote one hundred three A baton with a tassel of paper strips used for giving directions in war time Footnote one hundred four See the story of the Forty seven Ronins Formerly it was the custom that for personages of importance the enclosure within the picket fence should be of thirty six feet square An entrance was made to the south and another to the north the door to the south was called Shugiyomon the door of the practice of virtue that to the north was called Umbanmon the door of the warm basin one hundred five Two mats with white binding were arranged in the shape of a hammer the one at right angles to the other six feet of white silk four feet broad were stretched on the mat which was placed lengthwise at the four corners were erected four posts for curtains In front of the two mats was erected a portal eight feet high by six feet broad in the shape of the portals in front of temples made of a fine sort of bamboo wrapped in white one hundred six silk White curtains four feet broad were hung at the four corners and four flags six feet long on which should be inscribed four quotations from the sacred books These flags it is said were immediately after the ceremony carried away to the grave At night two lights were placed one upon either side of the two mats The candles were placed in saucers upon stands of bamboo four feet high wrapped in white silk The person who was to disembowel himself entering the picket fence by the north entrance took his place upon the white silk upon the mat facing the north Some there were however who said that he should sit facing the west in that case the whole place must be prepared accordingly The seconds enter the enclosure by the south entrance at the same time as the principal enters by the north and take their places on the mat that is placed crosswise Footnote one hundred five No Japanese authority that I have been able to consult gives any explanation of this singular name Footnote one hundred six White in China and Japan is the colour of mourning Nowadays when the hara kiri is performed inside the palace a temporary place is made on purpose either in the garden or in some unoccupied spot but if the criminal is to die on the day on which he is given in charge or on the next day the ceremony having to take place so quickly is performed in the reception room Still even if there is a lapse of time between the period of giving the prisoner in charge and the execution it is better that the ceremony should take place in a decent room in the house than in a place made on purpose If it is heard that for fear of dirtying his house a man has made a place expressly he will be blamed for it It surely can be no disgrace to the house of a soldier that he was ordered to perform the last offices towards a Samurai who died by hara kiri To slay his enemy against whom he has cause of hatred and then to kill himself is the part of a noble Samurai and it is sheer nonsense to look upon the place where he has disembowelled himself as polluted In the beginning of the eighteenth century seventeen of the retainers of Asano Takumi no Kami performed hara kiri in the garden of a palace at Shirokane in Yedo When it was over the people of the palace called upon the priests of a sect named Shugenja to come and purify the place but when the lord of the palace heard this he ordered the place to be left as it was for what need was there to purify a place where faithful Samurai had died by their own hand But in other palaces to which the remainder of the retainers of Takumi no Kami were entrusted it is said that the places of execution were purified But the people of that day praised Kumamoto Ko the Prince of Higo to whom the palace at Shirokane belonged It is a currish thing to look upon death in battle or by hara kiri as a pollution this is a thing to bear in mind In modern times the place of hara kiri is eighteen feet square in all cases in the centre is a place to sit upon and the condemned man is made to sit facing the witnesses at other times he is placed with his side to the witnesses this is according to the nature of the spot In some cases the seconds turn their backs to the witnesses It is open to question however whether this is not a breach of etiquette The witnesses should be consulted upon these arrangements If the witnesses have no objection the condemned man should be placed directly opposite to them The place where the witnesses are seated should be removed more than twelve or eighteen feet from the condemned man The place from which the sentence is read should also be close by The writer has been furnished with a plan of the hara kiri as it is performed at present Although the ceremony is gone through in other ways also still it is more convenient to follow the manner indicated If the execution takes place in a room a kerchief of five breadths of white cotton cloth or a quilt should be laid down and it is also said that two mats should be prepared however as there are already mats in the room there is no need for special mats two red rugs should be spread over all sewed together one on the top of the other for if the white cotton cloth be used alone the blood will soak through on to the mats therefore it is right the rugs should be spread On the twenty third day of the eighth month of the fourth year of the period Yenkiyo A D seventeen forty at the hara kiri of a certain person there were laid down a white cloth eight feet square and on that a quilt of light green cotton six feet square and on that a cloth of white hemp six feet square and on that two rugs On the third day of the ninth month of the ninth year of the period Tempo A D eighteen thirty eight at the hara kiri of a certain person it is said that there were spread a large double cloth of white cotton and on that two rugs But of these two occasions the first must be commended for its careful preparation If the execution be at night candlesticks of white wood should be placed at each of the four corners lest the seconds be hindered in their work In the place where the witnesses are to sit ordinary candlesticks should be placed according to etiquette but an excessive illumination is not decorous Two screens covered with white paper should be set up behind the shadow of which are concealed the dirk upon a tray a bucket to hold the head after it has been cut off an incense burner a pail of water and a basin The above rules apply equally to the ceremonies observed when the hara kiri takes place in a garden In the latter case the place is hung round with a white curtain which need not be new for the occasion Two mats a white cloth and a rug are spread If the execution is at night lanterns of white paper are placed on bamboo poles at the four corners The sentence having been read inside the house the persons engaged in the ceremony proceed to the place of execution but according to circumstances the sentence may be read at the place itself In the case of Asano Takumi no Kami the sentence was read out in the house and he afterwards performed hara kiri in the garden On the third day of the fourth month of the fourth year of the period Tenmei A D seventeen eighty four a Hatamoto named Sano having received his sentence in the supreme court house disembowelled himself in the garden in front of the prison When the ceremony takes place in the garden matting must be spread all the way to the place so that sandals need not be worn The reason for this is that some men in that position suffer from a rush of blood to the head from nervousness so their sandals might slip off their feet without their being aware of their loss and as this would have a very bad appearance it is better to spread matting Care must be taken lest in spreading the matting a place be left where two mats join against which the foot might trip The white screens and other things are prepared as has been directed above If any curtailment is made it must be done as well as circumstances will permit According to the crime of which a man who is handed over to any Daimio s charge is guilty it is known whether he will have to perform hara kiri and the preparations should be made accordingly Asano Takumi no Kami was taken to the palace of Tamura Sama at the hour of the monkey between three and five in the afternoon took off his dress of ceremony partook of a bowl of soup and five dishes and drank two cups of warm water and at the hour of the cock between five and seven in the evening disembowelled himself A case of this kind requires much attention for great care should be taken that the preparations be carried on without the knowledge of the principal If a temporary room has been built expressly for the occasion to avoid pollution to the house it should be kept a secret It once happened that a criminal was received in charge at the palace of a certain nobleman and when his people were about to erect a temporary building for the ceremony they wrote to consult some of the parties concerned the letter ran as follows The house in which we live is very small and inconvenient in all respects We have ordered the guard to treat our prisoner with all respect but our retainers who are placed on guard are much inconvenienced for want of space besides in the event of fire breaking out or any extraordinary event taking place the place is so small that it would be difficult to get out We are thinking therefore of adding an apartment to the original building so that the guard may be able at all times to go in and out freely and that if in case of fire or otherwise we should have to leave the house we may do so easily We beg to consult you upon this point When a Samurai has to perform hara kiri by the command of his own feudal lord the ceremony should take place in one of the lesser palaces of the clan Once upon a time a certain prince of the Inouye clan having a just cause of offence against his steward who was called Ishikawa Tozayemon and wishing to punish him caused him to be killed in his principal palace at Kandabashi in Yedo When this matter was reported to the Shogun having been convicted of disrespect of the privileges of the city he was ordered to remove to his lesser palace at Asakusa Now although the hara kiri cannot be called properly an execution still as it only differs from an ordinary execution in that by it the honour of the Samurai is not affected it is only a question of degree it is a matter of ceremonial If the principal palace one hundred seven is a long distance from the Shogun s castle then the hara kiri may take place there but there can be no objection whatever to its taking place in a minor palace Nowadays when a man is condemned to hara kiri by a Daimio the ceremony usually takes place in one of the lesser palaces the place commonly selected is an open space near the horse exercising ground and the preparations which I have described above are often shortened according to circumstances Footnote one hundred seven The principal yashikis palaces of the nobles are for the most part immediately round the Shogun s castle in the enclosure known as the official quarter Their proximity to the palace forbids their being made the scenes of executions When a retainer is suddenly ordered to perform hara kiri during a journey a temple or shrine should be hired for the occasion On these hurried occasions coarse mats faced with finer matting or common mats may be used If the criminal is of rank to have an armour bearer a carpet of skin should be spread should one be easily procurable The straps of the skin which are at the head should according to old custom be to the front so that the fur may point backwards In old days when the ceremony took place in a garden a carpet of skin was spread To hire a temple for the purpose of causing a man to perform hara kiri was of frequent occurrence it is doubtful whether it may be done at the present time This sort of question should be referred beforehand to some competent person that the course to be adopted may be clearly understood In the period Kambun A D sixteen sixty one sixteen seventy three a Prince Sakai travelling through the Bishiu territory hired a temple or shrine for one of his retainers to disembowel himself in and so the affair was concluded ON THE CEREMONIES OBSERVED AT THE HARA KIRI OF A PERSON GIVEN IN CHARGE TO A DAIMIO When a man has been ordered by the Government to disembowel himself the public censors who have been appointed to act as witnesses write to the prince who has the criminal in charge to inform them that they will go to his palace on public business This message is written directly to the chief and is sent by an assistant censor and a suitable answer is returned to it Before the ceremony the witnesses send an assistant censor to see the place and look at a plan of the house and to take a list of the names of the persons who are to be present he also has an interview with the kaishaku or seconds and examines them upon the way of performing the ceremonies When all the preparations have been made he goes to fetch the censors and they all proceed together to the place of execution dressed in their hempen cloth dress of ceremony The retainers of the palace are collected to do obeisance in the entrance yard and the lord to whom the criminal has been entrusted goes as far as the front porch to meet the censors and conducts them to the front reception room The chief censor then announces to the lord of the palace that he has come to read out the sentence of such an one who has been condemned to perform hara kiri and that the second censor has come to witness the execution of the sentence The lord of the palace then inquires whether he is expected to attend the execution in person and if any of the relations or family of the criminal should beg to receive his remains whether their request should be complied with after this he announces that he will order everything to be made ready and leaves the room Tea a fire box for smoking and sweetmeats are set before the censors but they decline to accept any hospitality until their business shall have been concluded The minor officials follow the same rule If the censors express a wish to see the place of execution the retainers of the palace show the way and their lord accompanies them in this however he may be replaced by one of his karo or councillors They then return and take their seats in the reception room After this when all the preparations have been made the master of the house leads the censors to the place where the sentence is to be read and it is etiquette that they should wear both sword and dirk one hundred eight The lord of the palace takes his place on one side the inferior censors sit on either side in a lower place The councillors and other officers of the palace also take their places One of the councillors present addressing the censors without moving from his place asks whether he shall bring forth the prisoner Footnote one hundred eight A Japanese removes his sword on entering a house retaining only his dirk Previously to this the retainers of the palace going to the room where the prisoner is confined inform him that as the censors have arrived he should change his dress and the attendants bring out a change of clothes upon a large tray it is when he has finished his toilet that the witnesses go forth and take their places in the appointed order and the principal is then introduced He is preceded by one man who should be of the rank of Mono gashira retainer of the fourth rank who wears a dirk but no sword Six men act as attendants they should be of the fifth or sixth rank they walk on either side of the principal They are followed by one man who should be of the rank of Yonin councillor of the second class When they reach the place the leading man draws on one side and sits down and the six attendants sit down on either side of the principal The officer who follows him sits down behind him and the chief censor reads the sentence When the reading of the sentence is finished the principal leaves the room and again changes his clothes and the chief censor immediately leaves the palace but the lord of the palace does not conduct him to the door The second censor returns to the reception room until the principal has changed his clothes When the principal has taken his seat at the place of execution the councillors of the palace announce to the second censor that all is ready he then proceeds to the place wearing his sword and dirk The lord of the palace also wearing his sword and dirk takes his seat on one side The inferior censors and councillors sit in front of the censor they wear the dirk only The assistant second brings a dirk upon a tray and having placed it in front of the principal withdraws on one side when the principal leans his head forward his chief second strikes off his head which is immediately shown to the censor who identifies it and tells the master of the palace that he is satisfied and thanks him for all his trouble The corpse as it lies is hidden by a white screen which is set up around it and incense is brought out The witnesses leave the place The lord of the palace accompanies them as far as the porch and the retainers prostrate themselves in the yard as before The retainers who should be present at the place of execution are one or two councillors Karo two or three second councillors Yonin two or three Mono gashira one chief of the palace Rusui six attendants one chief second two assistant seconds one man to carry incense who need not be a person of rank any Samurai will do They attend to the setting up of the white screen The duty of burying the corpse and of setting the place in order again devolves upon four men these are selected from Samurai of the middle or lower class during the performance of their duties they hitch up their trousers and wear neither sword nor dirk Their names are previously sent in to the censor who acts as witness and to the junior censors should they desire it Before the arrival of the chief censor the requisite utensils for extinguishing a fire are prepared firemen are engaged one hundred nine and officers constantly go the rounds to watch against fire From the time when the chief censor comes into the house until he leaves it no one is allowed to enter the premises The servants on guard at the entrance porch should wear their hempen dresses of ceremony Everything in the palace should be conducted with decorum and the strictest attention paid in all things Footnote one hundred nine In Japan where fires are of daily occurrence the fire buckets and other utensils form part of the gala dress of the house of a person of rank When any one is condemned to hara kiri it would be well that people should go to the palace of the Prince of Higo and learn what transpired at the execution of the Ronins of Asano Takumi no Kami A curtain was hung round the garden in front of the reception room three mats were laid down and upon these was placed a white cloth The condemned men were kept in the reception room and summoned one by one two men one on each side accompanied them the second followed behind and they proceeded together to the place of execution When the execution was concluded in each case the corpse was hidden from the sight of the chief witness by a white screen folded up in white cloth placed on a mat and carried off to the rear by two foot soldiers it was then placed in a coffin The blood stained ground was sprinkled with sand and swept clean fresh mats were laid down and the place prepared anew after which the next man was summoned to come forth ON CERTAIN THINGS TO BE BORNE IN MIND BY THE WITNESSES When a clansman is ordered by his feudal lord to perform hara kiri the sentence must be read out by the censor of the clan who also acts as witness He should take his place in front of the criminal at a distance of twelve feet according to some books the distance should be eighteen feet and he should sit obliquely not facing the criminal he should lay his sword down by his side but if he pleases he may wear it in his girdle he must read out the sentence distinctly If the sentence be a long document to begin reading in a very loud voice and afterwards drop into a whisper has an appearance of faint heartedness but to read it throughout in a low voice is worse still it should be delivered clearly from beginning to end It is the duty of the chief witness to set an example of fortitude to the other persons who are to take part in the execution When the second has finished his work he carries the head to the chief witness who after inspecting it must declare that he has identified it he then should take his sword and leave his place It is sufficient however that the head should be struck off without being carried to the chief witness in that case the second receives his instructions beforehand On rising the chief witness should step out with his left foot and turn to the left If the ceremony takes place out of doors the chief witness wearing his sword and dirk should sit upon a box he must wear his hempen dress of ceremony he may hitch his trousers up slightly according to his rank he may wear his full dress that is wings over his full dress It is the part of the chief witness to instruct the seconds and others in the duties which they have to perform and also to preconcert measures in the event of any mishap occurring If whilst the various persons to be engaged in the ceremony are rubbing up their military lore and preparing themselves for the event any other person should come in they should immediately turn the conversation Persons of the rank of Samurai should be familiar with all the details of the hara kiri and to be seen discussing what should be done in case anything went wrong and so forth would have an appearance of ignorance If however an intimate friend should go to the place rather than have any painful concealment he may be consulted upon the whole affair When the sentence has been read it is probable that the condemned man will have some last words to say to the chief witness It must depend on the nature of what he has to say whether it will be received or not If he speaks in a confused or bewildered manner no attention is paid to it his second should lead him away of his own accord or at a sign from the chief witness If the condemned man be a person who has been given in charge to a prince by the Government the prince after the reading of the sentence should send his retainers to the prisoner with a message to say that the decrees of the Government are not to be eluded but that if he has any last wishes to express they are ordered by their lord to receive them If the prisoner is a man of high rank the lord of the palace should go in person to hear his last wishes The condemned man should answer in the following way Sir I thank you for your careful consideration but I have nothing that I wish to say I am greatly indebted to you for the great kindness which I have received since I have been under your charge I beg you to take my respects to your lord and to the gentlemen of your clan who have treated me so well Or he may say Sirs I have nothing to say yet since you are so kind as to think of me I should be obliged if you would deliver such and such a message to such an one This is the proper and becoming sort of speech for the occasion If the prisoner entrusts them with any message the retainers should receive it in such a manner as to set his mind at rest Should he ask for writing materials in order to write a letter as this is forbidden by the law they should tell him so and not grant his request Still they must feel that it is painful to refuse the request of a dying man and must do their best to assist him They must exhaust every available kindness and civility as was done in the period Genroku in the case of the Ronins of Asano Takumi no Kami The Prince of Higo after the sentence had been read caused paper and writing materials to be taken to their room If the prisoner is light headed from excitement it is no use furnishing him with writing materials It must depend upon circumstances but when a man has murdered another having made up his mind to abide by the consequences then that man s execution should be carried through with all honour When a man kills another on the spot in a fit of ungovernable passion and then is bewildered and dazed by his own act the same pains need not be taken to conduct matters punctiliously If the prisoner be a careful man he will take an early opportunity after he has been given in charge to express his wishes To carry kindness so far as to supply writing materials and the like is not obligatory If any doubt exists upon the point the chief witness may be consulted After the Ronins of Asano Takumi no Kami had heard their sentence in the palace of Matsudaira Oki no Kami that Daimio in person went and took leave of them and calling Oishi Chikara one hundred ten the son of their chief to him said I have heard that your mother is at home in your own country how she will grieve when she hears of your death and that of your father I can well imagine If you have any message that you wish to leave for her tell me without standing upon ceremony and I will transmit it without delay For a while Chikara kept his head bent down towards the ground at last he drew back a little and lifting his head said I humbly thank your lordship for what you have been pleased to say My father warned me from the first that our crime was so great that even were we to be pardoned by a gracious judgment upon one count I must not forget that there would be a hundred million counts against us for which we must commit suicide and that if I disregarded his words his hatred would pursue me after death My father impressed this upon me at the temple called Sengakuji and again when I was separated from him to be taken to the palace of Prince Sengoku Now my father and myself have been condemned to perform hara kiri according to the wish of our hearts Still I cannot forget to think of my mother When we parted at Kiyoto she told me that our separation would be for long and she bade me not to play the coward when I thought of her As I took a long leave of her then I have no message to send to her now When he spoke thus Oki no Kami and all his retainers who were drawn up around him were moved to tears in admiration of his heroism Footnote one hundred ten Oishi Chikara was separated from his father who was one of the seventeen delivered over to the charge of the Prince of Higo Although it is right that the condemned man should bathe and partake of wine and food these details should be curtailed Even should he desire these favours it must depend upon his conduct whether they be granted or refused He should be caused to die as quickly as possible Should he wish for some water to drink it should be given to him If in his talk he should express himself like a noble Samurai all pains should be exhausted in carrying out his execution Yet however careful a man he may be as he nears his death his usual demeanour will undergo a change If the execution is delayed in all probability it will cause the prisoner s courage to fail him therefore as soon as the sentence shall have been passed the execution should be brought to a conclusion This again is a point for the chief witness to remember CONCERNING SECONDS KAISHAKU When the condemned man is one who has been given in charge for execution six attendants are employed when the execution is within the clan then two or three attendants will suffice the number however must depend upon the rank of the principal Men of great nerve and strength must be selected for the office they must wear their hempen dress of ceremony and tuck up their trousers they must on no account wear either sword or dirk but have a small poniard hidden in their bosom these are the officers who attend upon the condemned man when he changes his dress and who sit by him on the right hand and on the left hand to guard him whilst the sentence is being read In the event of any mistake occurring such as the prisoner attempting to escape they knock him down and should he be unable to stand or to walk they help to support him The attendants accompanying the principal to the place of execution if they are six in number four of them take their seats some way off and mount guard while the other two should sit close behind the principal They must understand that should there be any mistake they must throw the condemned man and holding him down cut off his head with their poniard or stab him to death If the second bungles in cutting off the head and the principal attempts to rise it is the duty of the attendants to kill him They must help him to take off his upper garments and bare his body In recent times however there have been cases where the upper garments have not been removed this depends upon circumstances The setting up of the white screen and the laying the corpse in the coffin are duties which although they may be performed by other officers originally devolved upon the six attendants When a common man is executed he is bound with cords and so made to take his place but a Samurai wears his dress of ceremony is presented with a dagger and dies thus There ought to be no anxiety lest such a man should attempt to escape still as there is no knowing what these six attendants may be called upon to do men should be selected who thoroughly understand their business The seconds are three in number the chief second the assistant second and the inferior second When the execution is carried out with proper solemnity three men are employed still a second and assistant second are sufficient If three men serve as seconds their several duties are as follows The chief second strikes off the head that is his duty he is the most important officer in the execution by hara kiri The assistant second brings forward the tray on which is placed the dirk that is his duty he must perform his part in such a manner that the principal second is not hindered in his work The assistant second is the officer of second importance in the execution The third or inferior second carries the head to the chief witness for identification and in the event of something suddenly occurring to hinder either of the other two seconds he should bear in mind that he must be ready to act as his substitute his is an office of great importance and a proper person must be selected to fill it Although there can be no such thing as a kaishaku second in any case except in one of hara kiri still in old times guardians and persons who assisted others were also called kaishaku the reason for this is because the kaishaku or second comes to the assistance of the principal If the principal were to make any mistake at the fatal moment it would be a disgrace to his dead body it is in order to prevent such mistakes that the kaishaku or second is employed It is the duty of the kaishaku to consider this as his first duty When a man is appointed to act as second to another what shall be said of him if he accepts the office with a smiling face Yet must he not put on a face of distress It is as well to attempt to excuse oneself from performing the duty There is no heroism in cutting a man s head off well and it is a disgrace to do it in a bungling manner yet must not a man allege lack of skill as a pretext for evading the office for it is an unworthy thing that a Samurai should want the skill required to behead a man If there are any that advocate employing young men as seconds it should rather be said that their hands are inexpert To play the coward and yield up the office to another man is out of the question When a man is called upon to perform the office he should express his readiness to use his sword the dirk may be employed but the sword is the proper weapon As regards the sword the second should borrow that of the principal if there is any objection to this he should receive a sword from his lord he should not use his own sword When the assistant seconds have been appointed the three should take counsel together about the details of the place of execution when they have been carefully instructed by their superiors in all the ceremonies and having made careful inquiry should there be anything wrong they should appeal to their superiors for instruction The seconds wear their dresses of ceremony when the criminal is a man given in charge by the Government when he is one of their own clan they need only wear the trousers of the Samurai In old days it is said that they were dressed in the same way as the principal and some authorities assert that at the hara kiri of a nobleman of high rank the seconds should wear white clothes and that the handle of the sword should be wrapped in white silk If the execution takes place in the house they should partially tuck up their trousers if in the garden they should tuck them up entirely The seconds should address the principal and say Sir we have been appointed to act as your seconds we pray you to set your mind at rest and so forth but this must depend upon the rank of the criminal At this time too if the principal has any last wish to express the second should receive it and should treat him with every consideration in order to relieve his anxiety If the second has been selected by the principal on account of old friendship between them or if the latter during the time that he has been in charge has begged some special retainer of the palace to act as his second in the event of his being condemned to death the person so selected should thank the principal for choosing so unworthy a person and promise to beg his lord to allow him to act as second so he should answer and comfort him and having reported the matter to his lord should act as second He should take that opportunity to borrow his principal s sword in some such terms as the following As I am to have the honour of being your second I would fain borrow your sword for the occasion It may be a consolation to you to perish by your own sword with which you are familiar If however the principal declines and prefers to be executed with the second s sword his wish must be complied with If the second should make an awkward cut with his own sword it is a disgrace to him therefore he should borrow some one else s sword so that the blame may rest with the sword and not with the swordsman Although this is the rule and although every Samurai should wear a sword fit to cut off a man s head still if the principal has begged to be executed with the second s own sword it must be done as he desires It is probable that the condemned man will inquire of his second about the arrangements which have been made he must attend therefore to rendering himself capable of answering all such questions Once upon a time when the condemned man inquired of his second whether his head would be cut off at the moment when he received the tray with the dirk upon it No replied the second at the moment when you stab yourself with the dirk your head will be cut off At the execution of one Sano he told his second that when he had stabbed himself in the belly he would utter a cry and begged him to be cool when he cut off his head The second replied that he would do as he wished but begged him in the meantime to take the tray with the dirk according to proper form When Sano reached out his hand to take the tray the second cut off his head immediately Now although this was not exactly right still as the second acted so in order to save a Samurai from the disgrace of performing the hara kiri improperly by crying out it can never be wrong for a second to act kindly If the principal urgently requests to be allowed really to disembowel himself his wish may according to circumstances be granted but in this case care must be taken that no time be lost in striking off the head The custom of striking off the head the prisoner only going through the semblance of disembowelling himself dates from the period Yempo about one hundred ninety years ago When the principal has taken his place the second strips his right shoulder of the dress of ceremony which he allows to fall behind his sleeve and drawing his sword lays down the scabbard taking care that his weapon is not seen by the principal then he takes his place on the left of the principal and close behind him The principal should sit facing the west and the second facing the north and in that position should he strike the blow When the second perceives the assistant second bring out the tray on which is laid the dirk he must brace up his nerves and settle his heart beneath his navel when the tray is laid down he must put himself in position to strike the blow He should step out first with the left foot and then change so as to bring his right foot forward this is the position which he should assume to strike he may however reverse the position of his feet When the principal removes his upper garments the second must poise his sword when the principal reaches out his hand to draw the tray towards him as he leans his head forward a little is the exact moment for the second to strike There are all sorts of traditions about this Some say that the principal should take the tray and raise it respectfully to his head and set it down and that this is the moment to strike There are three rules for the time of cutting off the head the first is when the dirk is laid on the tray the second is when the principal looks at the left side of his belly before inserting the dirk the third is when he inserts the dirk If these three moments are allowed to pass it becomes a difficult matter to cut off the head so says tradition However four moments for cutting are also recorded first when the assistant second retires after having laid down the stand on which is the dirk second when the principal draws the stand towards him third when he takes the dirk in his hand fourth when he makes the incision into the belly Although all four ways are approved still the first is too soon the last three are right and proper In short the blow should be struck without delay If he has struck off the head at a blow without failure the second taking care not to raise his sword but holding it point downwards should retire backward a little and wipe his weapon kneeling he should have plenty of white paper ready in his girdle or in his bosom to wipe away the blood and rub up his sword having replaced his sword in its scabbard he should readjust his upper garments and take his seat to the rear When the head has fallen the junior second should enter and taking up the head present it to the witness for inspection When he has identified it the ceremony is concluded If there is no assistant or junior second the second as soon as he has cut off the head carrying his sword reversed in his left hand should take the head in his right hand holding it by the top knot of hair should advance towards the witness passing on the right side of the corpse and show the right profile of the head to the witness resting the chin of the head upon the hilt of his sword and kneeling on his left knee then returning again round by the left of the corpse kneeling on his left knee and carrying the head in his left hand and resting it on the edge of his sword he should again show the left profile to the witness It is also laid down as another rule that the second laying down his sword should take out paper from the bosom of his dress and placing the head in the palm of his left hand and taking the top knot of hair in his right hand should lay the head upon the paper and so submit it for inspection Either way may be said to be right NOTE To lay down thick paper and place the head on it shows a disposition to pay respect to the head to place it on the edge of the sword is insulting the course pursued must depend upon the rank of the person If the ceremony is to be curtailed it may end with the cutting off of the head that must be settled beforehand in consultation with the witness In the event of the second making a false cut so as not to strike off the head at a blow the second must take the head by the top knot and pressing it down cut it off Should he take bad aim and cut the shoulder by mistake and should the principal rise and cry out before he has time to writhe he should hold him down and stab him to death and then cut off his head or the assistant seconds who are sitting behind should come forward and hold him down while the chief second cuts off his head It may be necessary for the second after he has cut off the head to push down the body and then take up the head for inspection If the body does not fall at once which is said to be sometimes the case the second should pull the feet to make it fall There are some who say that the perfect way for the second to cut off the head is not to cut right through the neck at a blow but to leave a little uncut and as the head hangs by the skin to seize the top knot and slice it off and then submit it for inspection The reason of this is lest the head being struck off at a blow the ceremony should be confounded with an ordinary execution According to the old authorities this is the proper and respectful manner After the head is cut off the eyes are apt to blink and the mouth to move and to bite the pebbles and sand This being hateful to see at what amongst Samurai is so important an occasion and being a shameful thing it is held to be best not to let the head fall but to hold back a little in delivering the blow Perhaps this may be right yet it is a very difficult matter to cut so as to leave the head hanging by a little flesh and there is the danger of missing the cut and as any mistake in the cut is most horrible to see it is better to strike a fair blow at once Others say that even when the head is struck off at a blow the semblance of slicing it off should be gone through afterwards yet be it borne in mind that this is unnecessary Three methods of carrying the sword are recognized amongst those skilled in swordsmanship If the rank of the principal be high the sword is raised aloft if the principal and second are of equal rank the sword is carried at the centre of the body if the principal be of inferior rank the sword is allowed to hang downwards The proper position for the second to strike from is kneeling on one knee but there is no harm in his standing up others say that if the execution takes place inside the house the second should kneel if in the garden he should stand These are not points upon which to insist obstinately a man should strike in whatever position is most convenient to him The chief duty for the assistant second to bear in mind is the bringing in of the tray with the dirk which should be produced very quietly when the principal takes his place it should be placed so that the condemned man may have to stretch his hand well out in order to reach it one hundred eleven The assistant second then returns to his own place but if the condemned man shows any signs of agitation the assistant second must lend his assistance so that the head may be properly cut off It once happened that the condemned man having received the tray from the assistant second held it up for a long time without putting it down until those near him had over and over again urged him to set it down It also happens that after the tray has been set down and the assistant second has retired the condemned man does not put out his hand to take it then must the assistant second press him to take it Also the principal may ask that the tray be placed a little nearer to him in which case his wish must be granted The tray may also be placed in such a way that the assistant second holding it in his left hand may reach the dirk to the condemned man who leans forward to take it Which is the best of all these ways is uncertain The object to aim at is that the condemned man should lean forward to receive the blow Whether the assistant second retires or not must depend upon the attitude assumed by the condemned man Footnote one hundred eleven It should be placed about three feet away from him If the prisoner be an unruly violent man a fan instead of a dirk should be placed upon the tray and should he object to this he should be told in answer that the substitution of the fan is an ancient custom This may occur sometimes It is said that once upon a time in one of the palaces of the Daimios a certain brave matron murdered a man and having been allowed to die with all the honours of the hara kiri a fan was placed upon the tray and her head was cut off This may be considered right and proper If the condemned man appears inclined to be turbulent the seconds without showing any sign of alarm should hurry to his side and urging him to get ready quickly cause him to make all his preparations with speed and to sit down in his place the chief second then drawing his sword should get ready to strike and ordering him to proceed as fast as possible with the ceremony of receiving the tray should perform his duty without appearing to be afraid A certain Prince Kato having condemned one of his councillors to death assisted at the ceremony behind a curtain of slips of bamboo The councillor whose name was Katayama was bound and during that time glared fiercely at the curtain and showed no signs of fear The chief second was a man named Jihei who had always been used to treat Katayama with great respect So Jihei sword in hand said to Katayama Sir your last moment has arrived be so good as to turn your cheek so that your head may be straight When Katayama heard this he replied Fellow you are insolent and as he was looking round Jihei struck the fatal blow The lord Kato afterwards inquired of Jihei what was the reason of this and he replied that as he saw that the prisoner was meditating treason he determined to kill him at once and put a stop to this rebellious spirit This is a pattern for other seconds to bear in mind When the head has been struck off it becomes the duty of the junior second to take it up by the top knot and placing it upon some thick paper laid over the palm of his hand to carry it for inspection by the witness This ceremony has been explained above If the head be bald he should pierce the left ear with the stiletto carried in the scabbard of his dirk and so carry it to be identified He must carry thick paper in the bosom of his dress Inside the paper he shall place a bag with rice bran and ashes in order that he may carry the head without being sullied by the blood When the identification of the head is concluded the junior second s duty is to place it in a bucket If anything should occur to hinder the chief second the assistant second must take his place It happened on one occasion that before the execution took place the chief second lost his nerve yet he cut off the head without any difficulty but when it came to taking up the head for inspection his nervousness so far got the better of him as to be extremely inconvenient This is a thing against which persons acting as seconds have to guard As a corollary to the above elaborate statement of the ceremonies proper to be observed at the hara kiri I may here describe an instance of such an execution which I was sent officially to witness The condemned man was Taki Zenzaburo an officer of the Prince of Bizen who gave the order to fire upon the foreign settlement at Hiogo in the month of February eighteen sixty eight an attack to which I have alluded in the preamble to the story of the Eta Maiden and the Hatamoto Up to that time no foreigner had witnessed such an execution which was rather looked upon as a traveller s fable The ceremony which was ordered by the Mikado himself took place at ten point thirty at night in the temple of Seifukuji the headquarters of the Satsuma troops at Hiogo A witness was sent from each of the foreign legations We were seven foreigners in all We were conducted to the temple by officers of the Princes of Satsuma and Choshiu Although the ceremony was to be conducted in the most private manner the casual remarks which we overheard in the streets and a crowd lining the principal entrance to the temple showed that it was a matter of no little interest to the public The courtyard of the temple presented a most picturesque sight it was crowded with soldiers standing about in knots round large fires which threw a dim flickering light over the heavy eaves and quaint gable ends of the sacred buildings We were shown into an inner room where we were to wait until the preparation for the ceremony was completed in the next room to us were the high Japanese officers After a long interval which seemed doubly long from the silence which prevailed Ito Shunske the provisional Governor of Hiogo came and took down our names and informed us that seven kenshi sheriffs or witnesses would attend on the part of the Japanese He and another officer represented the Mikado two captains of Satsuma s infantry and two of Choshiu s with a representative of the Prince of Bizen the clan of the condemned man completed the number which was probably arranged in order to tally with that of the foreigners Ito Shunske further inquired whether we wished to put any questions to the prisoner We replied in the negative A further delay then ensued after which we were invited to follow the Japanese witnesses into the hondo or main hall of the temple where the ceremony was to be performed It was an imposing scene A large hall with a high roof supported by dark pillars of wood From the ceiling hung a profusion of those huge gilt lamps and ornaments peculiar to Buddhist temples In front of the high altar where the floor covered with beautiful white mats is raised some three or four inches from the ground was laid a rug of scarlet felt Tall candles placed at regular intervals gave out a dim mysterious light just sufficient to let all the proceedings be seen The seven Japanese took their places on the left of the raised floor the seven foreigners on the right No other person was present After an interval of a few minutes of anxious suspense Taki Zenzaburo a stalwart man thirty two years of age with a noble air walked into the hall attired in his dress of ceremony with the peculiar hempen cloth wings which are worn on great occasions He was accompanied by a kaishaku and three officers who wore the jimbaori or war surcoat with gold tissue facings The word kaishaku it should be observed is one to which our word executioner is no equivalent term The office is that of a gentleman in many cases it is performed by a kinsman or friend of the condemned and the relation between them is rather that of principal and second than that of victim and executioner In this instance the kaishaku was a pupil of Taki Zenzaburo and was selected by the friends of the latter from among their own number for his skill in swordsmanship With the kaishaku on his left hand Taki Zenzaburo advanced slowly towards the Japanese witnesses and the two bowed before them then drawing near to the foreigners they saluted us in the same way perhaps even with more deference in each case the salutation was ceremoniously returned Slowly and with great dignity the condemned man mounted on to the raised floor prostrated himself before the high altar twice and seated one hundred twelve himself on the felt carpet with his back to the high altar the kaishaku crouching on his left hand side One of the three attendant officers then came forward bearing a stand of the kind used in temples for offerings on which wrapped in paper lay the wakizashi the short sword or dirk of the Japanese nine inches and a half in length with a point and an edge as sharp as a razor s This he handed prostrating himself to the condemned man who received it reverently raising it to his head with both hands and placed it in front of himself Footnote one hundred twelve Seated himself that is in the Japanese fashion his knees and toes touching the ground and his body resting on his heels In this position which is one of respect he remained until his death After another profound obeisance Taki Zenzaburo in a voice which betrayed just so much emotion and hesitation as might be expected from a man who is making a painful confession but with no sign of either in his face or manner spoke as follows I and I alone unwarrantably gave the order to fire on the foreigners at Kobe and again as they tried to escape For this crime I disembowel myself and I beg you who are present to do me the honour of witnessing the act Bowing once more the speaker allowed his upper garments to slip down to his girdle and remained naked to the waist Carefully according to custom he tucked his sleeves under his knees to prevent himself from falling backwards for a noble Japanese gentleman should die falling forwards Deliberately with a steady hand he took the dirk that lay before him he looked at it wistfully almost affectionately for a moment he seemed to collect his thoughts for the last time and then stabbing himself deeply below the waist on the left hand side he drew the dirk slowly across to the right side and turning it in the wound gave a slight cut upwards During this sickeningly painful operation he never moved a muscle of his face When he drew out the dirk he leaned forward and stretched out his neck an expression of pain for the first time crossed his face but he uttered no sound At that moment the kaishaku who still crouching by his side had been keenly watching his every movement sprang to his feet poised his sword for a second in the air there was a flash a heavy ugly thud a crashing fall with one blow the head had been severed from the body A dead silence followed broken only by the hideous noise of the blood throbbing out of the inert heap before us which but a moment before had been a brave and chivalrous man It was horrible The kaishaku made a low bow wiped his sword with a piece of paper which he had ready for the purpose and retired from the raised floor and the stained dirk was solemnly borne away a bloody proof of the execution The two representatives of the Mikado then left their places and crossing over to where the foreign witnesses sat called us to witness that the sentence of death upon Taki Zenzaburo had been faithfully carried out The ceremony being at an end we left the temple The ceremony to which the place and the hour gave an additional solemnity was characterized throughout by that extreme dignity and punctiliousness which are the distinctive marks of the proceedings of Japanese gentlemen of rank and it is important to note this fact because it carries with it the conviction that the dead man was indeed the officer who had committed the crime and no substitute While profoundly impressed by the terrible scene it was impossible at the same time not to be filled with admiration of the firm and manly bearing of the sufferer and of the nerve with which the kaishaku performed his last duty to his master Nothing could more strongly show the force of education The Samurai or gentleman of the military class from his earliest years learns to look upon the hara kiri as a ceremony in which some day he may be called upon to play a part as principal or second In old fashioned families which hold to the traditions of ancient chivalry the child is instructed in the rite and familiarized with the idea as an honourable expiation of crime or blotting out of disgrace If the hour comes he is prepared for it and gravely faces an ordeal which early training has robbed of half its horrors In what other country in the world does a man learn that the last tribute of affection which he may have to pay to his best friend may be to act as his executioner Since I wrote the above we have heard that before his entry into the fatal hall Taki Zenzaburo called round him all those of his own clan who were present many of whom had carried out his order to fire and addressing them in a short speech acknowledged the heinousness of his crime and the justice of his sentence and warned them solemnly to avoid any repetition of attacks upon foreigners They were also addressed by the officers of the Mikado who urged them to bear no ill will against us on account of the fate of their fellow clansman They declared that they entertained no such feeling The opinion has been expressed that it would have been politic for the foreign representatives at the last moment to have interceded for the life of Taki Zenzaburo The question is believed to have been debated among the representatives themselves My own belief is that mercy although it might have produced the desired effect among the more civilized clans would have been mistaken for weakness and fear by those wilder people who have not yet a personal knowledge of foreigners The offence an attack upon the flags and subjects of all the Treaty Powers which lack of skill not of will alone prevented from ending in a universal massacre was the gravest that has been committed upon foreigners since their residence in Japan Death was undoubtedly deserved and the form chosen was in Japanese eyes merciful and yet judicial The crime might have involved a war and cost hundreds of lives it was wiped out by one death I believe that in the interest of Japan as well as in our own the course pursued was wise and it was very satisfactory to me to find that one of the ablest Japanese ministers with whom I had a discussion upon the subject was quite of my opinion The ceremonies observed at the hara kiri appear to vary slightly in detail in different parts of Japan but the following memorandum upon the subject of the rite as it used to be practised at Yedo during the rule of the Tycoon clearly establishes its judicial character I translated it from a paper drawn up for me by a Japanese who was able to speak of what he had seen himself Three different ceremonies are described first Ceremonies observed at the hara kiri of a Hatamoto petty noble of the Tycoon s court in prison This is conducted with great secrecy Six mats are spread in a large courtyard of the prison an ometsuke officer whose duties appear to consist in the surveillance of other officers assisted by two other ometsukes of the second and third class acts as kenshi sheriff or witness and sits in front of the mats The condemned man attired in his dress of ceremony and wearing his wings of hempen cloth sits in the centre of the mats At each of the four corners of the mats sits a prison official Two officers of the Governor of the city act as kaishaku executioners or seconds and take their place one on the right hand and the other on the left hand of the condemned The kaishaku on the left side announcing his name and surname says bowing I have the honour to act as kaishaku to you have you any last wishes to confide to me The condemned man thanks him and accepts the offer or not as the case may be He then bows to the sheriff and a wooden dirk nine and a half inches long is placed before him at a distance of three feet wrapped in paper and lying on a stand such as is used for offerings in temples As he reaches forward to take the wooden sword and stretches out his neck the kaifihaku on his left hand side draws his sword and strikes off his head The kaishaku on the right hand side takes up the head and shows it to the sheriff The body is given to the relations of the deceased for burial His property is confiscated second The ceremonies observed at the hara kiri of a Daimio s retainer When the retainer of a Daimio is condemned to perform the hara kiri four mats are placed in the yard of the yashiki or palace The condemned man dressed in his robes of ceremony and wearing his wings of hempen cloth sits in the centre An officer acts as chief witness with a second witness under him Two officers who act as kaishaku are on the right and left of the condemned man four officers are placed at the corners of the mats The kaishaku as in the former case offers to execute the last wishes of the condemned A dirk nine and a half inches long is placed before him on a stand In this case the dirk is a real dirk which the man takes and stabs himself with on the left side below the navel drawing it across to the right side At this moment when he leans forward in pain the kaishaku on the left hand side cuts off the head The kaishaku on the right hand side takes up the head and shows it to the sheriff The body is given to the relations for burial In most cases the property of the deceased is confiscated third Self immolation of a Daimio on account of disgrace When a Daimio had been guilty of treason or offended against the Tycoon inasmuch as the family was disgraced and an apology could neither be offered nor accepted the offending Daimio was condemned to hara kiri Calling his councillors around him he confided to them his last will and testament for transmission to the Tycoon Then clothing himself in his court dress he disembowelled himself and cut his own throat His councillors then reported the matter to the Government and a coroner was sent to investigate it To him the retainers handed the last will and testament of their lord and be took it to the Gorojiu first council who transmitted it to the Tycoon If the offence was heinous such as would involve the ruin of the whole family by the clemency of the Tycoon half the property might be confiscated and half returned to the heir if the offence was trivial the property was inherited intact by the heir and the family did not suffer In all cases where the criminal disembowels himself of his own accord without condemnation and without investigation inasmuch as he is no longer able to defend himself the offence is considered as non proven and the property is not confiscated In the year eighteen sixty nine a motion was brought forward in the Japanese parliament by one Ono Seigoro clerk of the house advocating the abolition of the practice of hara kiri Two hundred members out of a house of two hundred nine voted against the motion which was supported by only three speakers six members not voting on either side In this debate the seppuku or hara kiri was called the very shrine of the Japanese national spirit and the embodiment in practice of devotion to principle a great ornament to the empire a pillar of the constitution a valuable institution tending to the honour of the nobles and based on a compassionate feeling towards the official caste a pillar of religion and a spur to virtue The whole debate which is well worth reading and an able translation of which by mister Aston has appeared in a recent Blue Book shows the affection with which the Japanese cling to the traditions of a chivalrous past It is worthy of notice that the proposer Ono Seigoro who on more than one occasion rendered himself conspicuous by introducing motions based upon an admiration of our Western civilization was murdered not long after this debate took place There are many stories on record of extraordinary heroism being displayed in the hara kiri The case of a young fellow only twenty years old of the Choshiu clan which was told me the other day by an eye witness deserves mention as a marvellous instance of determination Not content with giving himself the one necessary cut he slashed himself thrice horizontally and twice vertically Then he stabbed himself in the throat until the dirk protruded on the other side with its sharp edge to the front setting his teeth in one supreme effort he drove the knife forward with both hands through his throat and fell dead One more story and I have done During the revolution when the Tycoon beaten on every side fled ignominiously to Yedo he is said to have determined to fight no more but to yield everything A member of his second council went to him and said Sir the only way for you now to retrieve the honour of the family of Tokugawa is to disembowel yourself and to prove to you that I am sincere and disinterested in what I say I am here ready to disembowel myself with you The Tycoon flew into a great rage saying that he would listen to no such nonsense and left the room His faithful retainer to prove his honesty retired to another part of the castle and solemnly performed the hara kiri APPENDIX B THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY FROM THE SHO REI HIKKI RECORD OF CEREMONIES The ceremonies observed at marriages are various and it is not right for a man exceeding the bounds of his condition in life to transgress against the rules which are laid down When the middle man has arranged the preliminaries of the marriage between the two parties he carries the complimentary present which is made at the time of betrothal from the future bridegroom to his destined bride and if this present is accepted the lady s family can no longer retract their promise This is the beginning of the contract The usual betrothal presents are as follows Persons of the higher classes send a robe of white silk a piece of gold embroidery for a girdle a piece of silk stuff a piece of white silk with a lozenge pattern and other silk stuffs these are made up into a pile of three layers fourteen barrels of wine and seven sorts of condiments Persons of the middle class send a piece of white silk stuff a piece of gold embroidery for a girdle a piece of white silk with a lozenge pattern and other silk stuffs these are made up into a pile of two layers ten barrels of wine and five sorts of condiments The lower classes send a robe of white silk a robe of coloured silk in a pile of one layer together with six barrels of wine and three sorts of condiments To the future father in law is sent a sword with a scabbard for slinging such as is worn in war time together with a list of the presents to the mother in law a silk robe with wine and condiments Although all these presents are right and proper for the occasion still they must be regulated according to the means of the persons concerned The future father in law sends a present of equal value in return to his son in law but the bride elect sends no return present to her future husband the present from the father in law must by no means be omitted but according to his position if he be poor he need only send wine and condiments In sending the presents care must be taken not to fold the silk robe The two silk robes that are sent on the marriage night must be placed with the collars stitched together in a peculiar fashion The ceremonies of sending the litter to fetch the bride on the wedding night are as follows In families of good position one of the principal retainers on either side is deputed to accompany the bride and to receive her Matting is spread before the entrance door upon which the bride s litter is placed while the two principal retainers congratulate one another and the officers of the bridegroom receive the litter If a bucket containing clams to make the wedding broth has been sent with the bride it is carried and received by a person of distinction Close by the entrance door a fire is lighted on the right hand and on the left These fires are called garden torches In front of the corridor along which the litter passes on the right hand and on the left two men and two women in pairs place two mortars right and left in which they pound rice as the litter passes the pounded rice from the left hand side is moved across to the right and the two are mixed together into one This is called the blending of the rice meal one hundred thirteen Two candles are lighted the one on the right hand and the other on the left of the corridor and after the litter has passed the candle on the left is passed over to the right and the two wicks being brought together the candles are extinguished These last three ceremonies are only performed at the weddings of persons of high rank they are not observed at the weddings of ordinary persons The bride takes with her to her husband s house as presents two silken robes sewed together in a peculiar manner a dress of ceremony with wings of hempen cloth an upper girdle and an under girdle a fan either five or seven pocket books and a sword these seven presents are placed on a long tray and their value must depend upon the means of the family Footnote one hundred thirteen Cf Gibbon on Roman Marriages Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire vol iv p three hundred forty five The contracting parties were seated on the same sheepskin they tasted a salt cake of far or rice and this confarreation which denoted the ancient food of Italy served as an emblem of their mystic union of mind and body The dress of the bride is a white silk robe with a lozenge pattern over an under robe also of white silk Over her head she wears a veil of white silk which when she sits down she allows to fall about her as a mantle The bride s furniture and effects are all arranged for her by female attendants from her own house on a day previous to the wedding and the bridegroom s effects are in like manner arranged by the women of his own house When the bride meets her husband in the room where the relations are assembled she takes her seat for this once in the place of honour her husband sitting in a lower place not directly opposite to her but diagonally and discreetly avoiding her glance On the raised part of the floor are laid out beforehand two trays the preparations for a feast a table on which are two wagtails one hundred fourteen a second table with a representation of Elysium fowls fish two wine bottles three wine cups and two sorts of kettles for warming wine The ladies go out to meet the bride and invite her into a dressing room and when she has smoothed her dress bring her into the room and she and the bridegroom take their seats in the places appointed for them The two trays are then brought out and the ladies in waiting with complimentary speeches hand dried fish and seaweed such as accompany presents and dried chestnuts to the couple Two married ladies then each take one of the wine bottles which have been prepared and place them in the lower part of the room Then two handmaids who act as wine pourers bring the kettles and place them in the lower part of the room The two wine bottles have respectively a male and female butterfly made of paper attached to them The female butterfly is laid on its back and the wine is poured from the bottle into the kettle The male butterfly is then taken and laid on the female butterfly and the wine from the bottle is poured into the same kettle and the whole is transferred with due ceremony to another kettle of different shape which the wine pourers place in front of themselves Little low dining tables are laid one for each person before the bride and bridegroom and before the bride s ladies in waiting the woman deputed to pour the wine takes the three wine cups and places them one on the top of the other before the bridegroom who drinks two cups one hundred fifteen from the upper cup and pours a little wine from the full kettle into the empty kettle The pouring together of the wine on the wedding night is symbolical of the union that is being contracted The bridegroom next pours out a third cup of wine and drinks it and the cup is carried by the ladies to the bride who drinks three cups and pours a little wine from one kettle into the other as the bridegroom did A cup is then set down and put on the other two and they are carried back to the raised floor and arranged as before After this condiments are set out on the right hand side of a little table and the wine pourers place the three cups before the bride who drinks three cups from the second cup which is passed to the bridegroom he also drinks three cups as before and the cups are piled up and arranged in their original place by the wine pourers A different sort of condiment is next served on the left hand side and the three cups are again placed before the bridegroom who drinks three cups from the third cup and the bride does the same When the cups and tables have been put back in their places the bridegroom rising from his seat rests himself for a while During this time soup of fishes fins and wine are served to the bride s ladies in waiting and to the serving women They are served with a single wine cup of earthenware placed upon a small square tray and this again is set upon a long tray and a wine kettle with all sorts of condiments is brought from the kitchen When this part of the feast is over the room is put in order and the bride and bridegroom take their seats again Soups and a preparation of rice are now served and two earthenware cups gilt and silvered are placed on a tray on which there is a representation of the island of Takasago one hundred sixteen This time butterflies of gold and silver paper are attached to the wine kettles The bridegroom drinks a cup or two and the ladies in waiting offer more condiments to the couple Rice with hot water poured over it according to custom and carp soup are brought in and the wine having been heated cups of lacquer ware are produced and it is at this time that the feast commences Up to now the eating and drinking has been merely a form Twelve plates of sweetmeats and tea are served and the dinner consists of three courses one course of seven dishes one of five dishes and one of three dishes or else two courses of five dishes and one of three dishes according to the means of the family The above ceremonies are those which are proper only in families of the highest rank and are by no means fitting for the lower classes who must not step out of the proper bounds of their position Footnote one hundred fourteen The god who created Japan is called Kunitokodachi no Mikoto Seven generations of gods after his time existed Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto the first a god the second a goddess As these two divine beings were standing upon the floating bridge of heaven two wagtails came and the gods watching the amorous dalliance of the two birds invented the art of love From their union thus inaugurated sprang the mountains the rivers the grass the trees the remainder of the gods and mankind Another fable is that as the two gods were standing on the floating bridge of heaven Izanagi no Mikoto taking the heavenly jewelled spear stirred up the sea and the drops which fell from the point of it congealed and became an island which was called Onokoro jima on which the two gods descending from heaven took up their abode Footnote one hundred fifteen Each cup contains but a sip Footnote one hundred sixteen In the island of Takasago in the province of Harima stands a pine tree called the pine of mutual old age At the root the tree is single but towards the centre it springs into two stems an old old pine models of which are used at weddings as a symbol that the happy pair shall reach old age together Its evergreen leaves are an emblem of the unchanging constancy of the heart Figures of an old man and woman under the tree are the spirits of the old pine There is a popular tradition that in the ceremony of drinking wine on the wedding night the bride should drink first and then hand the cup to the bridegroom but although there are some authorities upon ceremonies who are in favour of this course it is undoubtedly a very great mistake In the Record of Rites by Confucius it is written The man stands in importance before the woman it is the right of the strong over the weak Heaven ranks before earth the prince ranks before his minister This law of honour is one Again in the Book of History by Confucius it is written The hen that crows in the morning brings misfortune In our own literature in the Jusho Book of the Gods When the goddesses saw the gods for the first time they were the first to cry cut Oh what beautiful males But the gods were greatly displeased and said We who are so strong and powerful should by rights have been the first to speak how is it that on the contrary these females speak first This is indeed vulgar Again it is written When the gods brought forth the cripple Hiruko the Lord of Heaven answering said that his misfortune was a punishment upon the goddesses who had presumed to speak first The same rule therefore exists in China and in Japan and it is held to be unlucky that the wife should take precedence with this warning people should be careful how they commit a breach of etiquette although it may be sanctioned by the vulgar At the wedding of the lower classes the bride and her ladies and friends have a feast but the bridegroom has no feast and when the bride s feast is over the bridegroom is called in and is presented with the bride s wine cup but as the forms observed are very vulgar it is not worth while to point out the rules which guide them As this night is essentially of importance to the married couple only there are some writers on ceremonies who have laid down that no feast need be prepared for the bride s ladies and in my opinion they are right for the husband and wife at the beginning of their intercourse to be separated and for the bride alone to be feasted like an ordinary guest appears to be an inauspicious opening I have thus pointed out two ill omened customs which are to be avoided The ceremonies observed at the weddings of persons of ordinary rank are as follows The feast which is prepared is in proportion to the means of the individuals There must be three wine cups set out upon a tray The ceremony of drinking wine three times is gone through as described above after which the bride changes her dress and a feast of three courses is produced two courses of five dishes and one of three dishes or one course of five dishes one of three and one of two according to the means of the family A tray with a representation of the island of Takasago is brought out and the wine is heated sweetmeats of five or seven sorts are also served in boxes or trays and when the tea comes in the bridegroom gets up and goes to rest himself If the wine kettles are of tin they must not be set out in the room they must be brought in from the kitchen and in that case the paper butterflies are not attached to them In old times the bride and bridegroom used to change their dress three or five times during the ceremony but at the present time after the nine cups of wine have been drunk in the manner recorded above the change of dress takes place once The bride puts on the silk robe which she has received from the bridegroom while he dons the dress of ceremony which has been brought by the bride When these ceremonies have been observed the bride s ladies conduct her to the apartments of her parents in law The bride carries with her silk robes as presents for her parents and brothers and sister in law A tray is brought out with three wine cups which are set before the parents in law and the bride The father in law drinks three cups and hands the cup to the bride who after she has drunk two cups receives a present from her father in law she then drinks a third cup and returns the cup to her father in law who again drinks three cups Fish is then brought in and in the houses of ordinary persons a preparation of rice Upon this the mother in law taking the second cup drinks three cups and passes the cup to the bride who drinks two cups and receives a present from her mother in law she then drinks a third cup and gives back the cup to the mother in law who drinks three cups again Condiments are served and in ordinary houses soup after which the bride drinks once from the third cup and hands it to her father in law who drinks thrice from it the bride again drinks twice from it and after her the mother in law drinks thrice The parents in law and the bride thus have drunk in all nine times If there are any brothers or sisters in law soup and condiments are served and a single porcelain wine cup is placed before them on a tray and they drink at the word of command of the father in law It is not indispensable that soup should be served upon this occasion If the parents of the bridegroom are dead instead of the above ceremony he leads his bride to make her obeisances before the tablets on which their names are inscribed In old days after the ceremonies recorded above had been gone through the bridegroom used to pay a visit of ceremony to the bride s parents but at the present time the visit is paid before the wedding and although the forms observed on the occasion resemble those of the ancient times still they are different and it would be well that we should resume the old fashion The two trays which had been used at the wedding feast loaded with fowl and fish and condiments neatly arranged used to be put into a long box and sent to the father in law s house Five hundred and eighty cakes of rice in lacquer boxes were also sent The modern practice of sending the rice cakes in a bucket is quite contrary to etiquette no matter how many lacquer boxes may be required for the purpose they are the proper utensils for sending the cakes in Three five seven or ten men s loads of presents according to the means of the family are also offered The son in law gives a sword and a silk robe to his father in law and a silk robe to his mother in law and also gives presents to his brothers and sisters in law The ceremony of drinking wine is the same as that which takes place between the bride and her parents in law with a very slight deviation the bridegroom receives no presents from his mother in law and when the third cup is drunk the son in law drinks before the father in law A return visit is paid by the bride s parents to the bridegroom at which similar forms are observed At the weddings of the great the bridal chamber is composed of three rooms thrown into one one hundred seventeen and newly decorated If there are only two rooms available a third room is built for the occasion The presents which have been mentioned above are set out on two trays Besides these the bridegroom s clothes are hung up upon clothes racks The mattress and bedclothes are placed in a closet The bride s effects must all be arranged by the women who are sent on a previous day for the purpose or it may be done whilst the bride is changing her clothes The shrine for the image of the family god is placed on a shelf adjoining the sleeping place There is a proper place for the various articles of furniture The kaioke one hundred eighteen is placed on the raised floor but if there be no raised floor it is placed in a closet with the door open so that it may be conspicuously seen The books are arranged on a book shelf or on a cabinet if there be neither shelf nor cabinet they are placed on the raised floor The bride s clothes are set out on a clothes rack in families of high rank seven robes are hung up on the rack five of these are taken away and replaced by others and again three are taken away and replaced by others and there are either two or three clothes racks the towel rack is set up in a place of more honour than the clothes racks If there is no dressing room the bride s bedclothes and dressing furniture are placed in the sleeping room No screens are put up on the bridal night but a fitting place is chosen for them on the following day All these ceremonies must be in proportion to the means of the family Footnote one hundred seventeen The partitions of a Japanese suite of apartments being merely composed of paper sliding screens any number of rooms according to the size of the house can be thrown into one at a moment s notice Footnote one hundred eighteen A kaioke is a kind of lacquer basin for washing the hands and face NOTE The author of the Sho rei Hikki makes no allusion to the custom of shaving the eyebrows and blackening the teeth of married women in token of fidelity to their lords In the upper classes young ladies usually blacken their teeth before leaving their father s house to enter that of their husbands and complete the ceremony by shaving their eyebrows immediately after the wedding or at any rate not later than upon the occasion of their first pregnancy The origin of the fashion is lost in antiquity As a proof that it existed before the eleventh century A D a curious book called Teijo Zakki or the Miscellaneous Writings of Teijo cites the diary of Murasaki Shikibu the daughter of one Tamesoki a retainer of the house of Echizen a lady of the court and famous poetess the authoress of a book called Genji mono gatari and other works In her diary it is written that on the last night of the fifth year of the period Kanko A D ten oh eight in order that she might appear to advantage on New Year s Day she retired to the privacy of her own apartment and repaired the deficiencies of her personal appearance by re blackening her teeth and otherwise adorning herself Allusion is also made to the custom in the Yeiga mono gatari an ancient book by the same authoress The Emperor and nobles of his court are also in the habit of blackening their teeth but the custom is gradually dying out in their case It is said to have originated with one Hanazono Arishito who held the high rank of Sa Daijin or minister of the left at the commencement of the twelfth century in the reign of the Emperor Toba Being a man of refined and sensual tastes this minister plucked out his eyebrows shaved his beard blackened his teeth powdered his face white and rouged his lips in order to render himself as like a woman as possible In the middle of the twelfth century the nobles of the court who went to the wars all blackened their teeth and from this time forth the practice became a fashion of the court The followers of the chiefs of the Hojo dynasty also blackened their teeth as an emblem of their fidelity and this was called the Odawara fashion after the castle town of the family Thus a custom which had its origin in a love of sensuality and pleasure became mistaken for the sign of a good and faithful spirit The fashion of blackening the teeth entails no little trouble upon its followers for the colour must be renewed every day or at least every other day Strange and repelling as the custom appears at first the eye soon learns to look without aversion upon a well blacked and polished set of teeth but when the colour begins to wear away and turns to a dullish grey streaked with black the mouth certainly becomes most hideous Although no one who reads this is likely to put a recipe for blackening the teeth to a practical test I append one furnished to me by a fashionable chemist and druggist in Yedo Take three pints of water and having warmed it add half a teacupful of wine Put into this mixture a quantity of red hot iron allow it to stand for five or six days when there will be a scum on the top of the mixture which should then be poured into a small teacup and placed near a fire When it is warm powdered gallnuts and iron filings should be added to it and the whole should be warmed again The liquid is then painted on to the teeth by means of a soft feather brush with more powdered gallnuts and iron and after several applications the desired colour will be obtained The process is said to be a preservative of the teeth and I have known men who were habitual sufferers from toothache to prefer the martyrdom of ugliness to that of pain and apply the black colouring when the paroxysms were severe One man told me that he experienced immediate relief by the application and that so long as he blackened his teeth he was quite free from pain ON THE BIRTH AND BEARING OF CHILDREN FROM THE SHO REI HIKKI In the fifth month of a woman s pregnancy a very lucky day is selected for the ceremony of putting on a girdle which is of white and red silk folded and eight feet in length The husband produces it from the left sleeve of his dress and the wife receives it in the right sleeve of her dress and girds it on for the first time This ceremony is only performed once 
5636-57477-0000	train-other-500	When the child is born the white part of the girdle is dyed sky blue with a peculiar mark on it and is made into clothes for the child These however are not the first clothes which it wears The dyer is presented with wine and condiments when the girdle is entrusted to him
5636-57477-0001	train-other-500	It is also customary to beg some matron who has herself had an easy confinement for the girdle which she wore during her pregnancy and this lady is called the girdle mother The borrowed girdle is tied on with that given by the husband
5636-57477-0002	train-other-500	and the girdle mother at this time gives and receives a present The furniture of the lying in chamber is as follows Two tubs for placing under petticoats in two tubs to hold the placenta a piece of furniture like an arm chair without legs
none	none	 for the mother to lean against one hundred nineteen a stool which is used by the lady who embraces the loins of the woman in labour to support her and which is afterwards used by the midwife in washing the child several pillows of various sizes that the woman in child bed may ease her head at her pleasure new buckets basins and ladles of various sizes Twenty four baby robes 
5636-57477-0003	train-other-500	twelve of silk and twelve of cotton must be prepared the hems must be dyed saffron colour There must be an apron for the midwife if the infant is of high rank in order that when she washes it she may not place it immediately on her own knees
none	none	 this apron should be made of a kerchief of cotton When the child is taken out of the warm water its body must be dried with a kerchief of fine cotton unhemmed Footnote one hundred nineteen Women in Japan are delivered in a kneeling position and after the birth of the child they remain night and day in a squatting position leaning back against a support for twenty one days after which they are allowed to recline Up to that time the recumbent position is supposed to produce a dangerous rush of blood to the head On the seventy fifth or hundred and twentieth day after its birth the baby leaves off its baby linen and this day is kept as a holiday Although it is the practice generally to dress up children in various kinds of silk 
5636-57477-0004	train-other-500	this is very wrong as the two principles of life being thereby injured the child contracts disease and on this account the ancients strictly forbade the practice In modern times the child is dressed up in beautiful clothes
5636-57477-0005	train-other-500	but to put a cap on its head thinking to make much of it when on the contrary it is hurtful to the child should be avoided
none	none	 It would be an excellent thing if rich people out of care for the health of their children would put a stop to a practice to which fashion clings On the hundred and twentieth day after their birth children whether male or female are weaned one hundred twenty This day is fixed and there is no need to choose a lucky day 
5636-57477-0006	train-other-500	If the child be a boy it is fed by a gentleman of the family if a girl by a lady The ceremony is as follows The child is brought out and given to the weaning father or sponsor He takes it on his left knee A small table is prepared
none	none	 The sponsor who is to feed the child taking some rice which has been offered to the gods places it on the corner of the little table which is by him He dips his chop sticks thrice in this rice and very quietly places them in the mouth of the child pretending to give it some of the juice of the rice Five cakes of rice meal are also placed on the left side of the little table 
5636-57477-0007	train-other-500	and with these he again pretends to feed the child three times When this ceremony is over the child is handed back to its guardian and three wine cups are produced on a tray The sponsor drinks three cups and presents the cup to the child
5636-57477-0008	train-other-500	When the child has been made to pretend to drink two cups it receives a present from its sponsor after which the child is supposed to drink a third time Dried fish is then brought in and the baby having drunk thrice
none	none	 passes the cup to its sponsor who drinks thrice More fish of a different kind is brought in The drinking is repeated and the weaning father receives a present from the child The guardian according to rules of propriety should be near the child 
5636-57477-0009	train-other-500	A feast should be prepared according to the means of the family If the child be a girl a weaning mother performs this ceremony
none	none	 and suitable presents must be offered on either side The wine drinking is gone through as above Footnote one hundred twenty This is only a nominal weaning Japanese children are not really weaned until far later than is ordinary in Europe and it is by no means uncommon to see a mother in the poorer classes suckling a hulking child of from five to seven years old One reason given for this practice is that by this means the danger of having to provide for large families is lessened On the fifteenth day of the eleventh month of the child s third year be the child boy or girl its hair is allowed to grow Up to this time the whole head has been shaven 
5636-57477-0010	train-other-500	now three patches are allowed to grow one on each side and one at the back of the head On this occasion also a sponsor is selected A large tray on which are a comb scissors paper string
none	none	 a piece of string for tying the hair in a knot cotton wool and the bit of dried fish or seaweed which accompanies presents one of each and seven rice straws these seven articles must be prepared one hundred twenty one Footnote one hundred twenty one For a few days previous to the ceremony the child s head is not shaved The child is placed facing the point of the compass which is auspicious for that year and the sponsor if the child be a boy takes the scissors and gives three snips at the hair on the left temple three on the right and three in the centre He then takes the piece of cotton wool and spreads it over the child s head from the forehead so as to make it hang down behind his neck 
5636-57477-0011	train-other-500	and he places the bit of dried fish or seaweed and the seven straws at the bottom of the piece of cotton wool
none	none	 attaching them to the wool 
5636-57477-0012	train-other-500	and ties them in two loops like a man s hair with a piece of paper string he then makes a woman s knot with two pieces of string
none	none	 The ceremony of drinking wine is the same as that gone through at the weaning 
5636-57477-0013	train-other-500	If the child is a girl a lady acts as sponsor the hair cutting is begun from the right temple instead of from the left There is no difference in the rest of the ceremony
none	none	 On the fifth day of the eleventh month of the child s fourth year he is invested with the hakama 
5636-57477-0014	train-other-500	or loose trousers worn by the Samurai On this occasion again a sponsor is called in The child receives from the sponsor a dress of ceremony on which are embroidered storks and tortoises emblems of longevity
5636-57477-0015	train-other-500	the stork is said to live a thousand years the tortoise ten thousand fir trees
none	none	 which being evergreen and not changing their colour 
5636-57477-0016	train-other-500	are emblematic of an unchangingly virtuous heart and bamboos emblematic of an upright and straight mind The child is placed upright on a chequer board facing the auspicious point of the compass
none	none	 and invested with the dress of ceremony 
5636-57477-0017	train-other-500	It also receives a sham sword and dirk The usual ceremony of drinking wine is observed NOTE In order to understand the following ceremony it is necessary to recollect that the child at three years of age
5636-57477-0018	train-other-500	is allowed to grow its hair in three patches By degrees the hair is allowed to grow the crown alone being shaved and a forelock left At ten or eleven years of age the boy s head is dressed like a man s with the exception of this forelock
5636-57477-0019	train-other-500	The ceremony of cutting off the forelock used in old days to include the ceremony of putting on the noble s cap but as this has gone out of fashion there is no need to treat of it Any time after the youth has reached the age of fifteen
5636-57477-0020	train-other-500	according to the cleverness and ability which he shows a lucky day is chosen for this most important ceremony after which the boy takes his place amongst full grown men A person of virtuous character is chosen as sponsor or cap father
none	none	 Although the man s real name that name which is only known to his intimate relations and friends 
5636-57477-0021	train-other-500	not the one by which he usually goes in society
none	none	 is usually determined before this date if it be not so 
5636-57477-0022	train-other-500	he receives his real name from his sponsor on this day In old days there used to be a previous ceremony of cutting the hair off the forehead in a straight line so as to make two angles up to this time the youth wore long sleeves like a woman
none	none	 and from that day he wore short sleeves This was called the half cutting The poorer classes have a habit of shortening the sleeves before this period but that is contrary to all rule and is an evil custom A common tray is produced 
5636-57477-0023	train-other-500	on which is placed an earthenware wine cup The sponsor drinks thrice and hands the cup to the young man who having also drunk thrice
none	none	 gives back the cup to the sponsor 
5636-57477-0024	train-other-500	who again drinks thrice and then proceeds to tie up the young man s hair There are three ways of tying the hair and there is also a particular fashion of letting the forelock grow long and when this is the case the forelock is only clipped
none	none	 This is especially the fashion among the nobles of the Mikado s court This applies only to persons who wear the court cap and not to gentlemen of lower grade 
5636-57477-0025	train-other-500	Still these latter persons if they wish to go through the ceremony in its entirety may do so without impropriety Gentlemen of the Samurai or military class cut off the whole of the forelock The sponsor
none	none	 either ties up the hair of the young man or else placing the forelock on a willow board cuts it off with a knife or else amongst persons of very high rank he only pretends to do so and goes into another room whilst the real cutting is going on 
5636-57477-0026	train-other-500	and then returns to the same room The sponsor then without letting the young man see what he is doing places the lock which has been cut into the pocket of his left sleeve and leaving the room gives it to the young man s guardians
5636-57477-0027	train-other-500	who wrap it in paper and offer it up at the shrine of the family gods But this is wrong The locks should be well wrapped up in paper and kept in the house until the man s death
none	none	 to serve as a reminder of the favours which a man receives from his father and mother in his childhood when he dies it should be placed in his coffin and buried with him The wine drinking and presents are as before In the Sho rei Hikki 
5636-57477-0028	train-other-500	the book from which the above is translated there is no notice of the ceremony of naming the child the following is a translation
none	none	 from a Japanese MS 
5636-57477-0029	train-other-500	On the seventh day after its birth the child receives its name the ceremony is called the congratulations of the seventh night On this day some one of the relations of the family who holds an exalted position either from his rank or virtues
5636-57477-0030	train-other-500	selects a name for the child which name he keeps
none	none	 until the time of the cutting of the forelock when he takes the name which he is to bear as a man This second name is called Yeboshina one hundred twenty two the cap name which is compounded of syllables taken from an old name of the family and from the name of the sponsor If the sponsor afterwards change his name his name child must also change his name For instance Minamoto no Yoshitsune the famous warrior as a child was called Ushiwakamaru when he grew up to be a man he was called Kuro and his real name was Yoshitsune Footnote one hundred twenty two From Yeboshi a court cap and Na a name FUNERAL RITES FROM THE SHO REI HIKKI On the death of a parent the mourning clothes worn are made of coarse hempen cloth and during the whole period of mourning these must be worn night and day As the burial of his parents is the most important ceremony which a man has to go through during his whole life when the occasion comes in order that there be no confusion he must employ some person to teach him the usual and proper rites Above all things to be reprehended is the burning of the dead they should be interred without burning one hundred twenty three The ceremonies to be observed at a funeral should by rights have been learned before there is occasion to put them in practice If a man have no father or mother he is sure to have to bury other relations and so he should not disregard this study There are some authorities who select lucky days and hours and lucky places for burying the dead but this is wrong and when they talk about curses being brought upon posterity by not observing these auspicious seasons and places they make a great mistake It is a matter of course that an auspicious day must be chosen so far as avoiding wind and rain is concerned that men may bury their dead without their minds being distracted and it is important to choose a fitting cemetery lest in after days the tomb should be damaged by rain or by men walking over it or by the place being turned into a field or built upon When invited to a friend s or neighbour s funeral a man should avoid putting on smart clothes and dresses of ceremony and when he follows the coffin he should not speak in a loud voice to the person next him for that is very rude and even should he have occasion to do so he should avoid entering wine shops or tea houses on his return from the funeral Footnote one hundred twenty three On the subject of burning the dead see a note to the story of Chobei of Bandzuin The list of persons present at a funeral should be written on slips of paper and firmly bound together It may be written as any other list only it must not be written beginning at the right hand as is usually the case but from the left hand as is the case in European books On the day of burial during the funeral service incense is burned in the temple before the tablet on which is inscribed the name under which the dead person enters salvation one hundred twenty four The incense burners having washed their hands one by one enter the room where the tablet is exposed and advance half way up to the tablet facing it producing incense wrapped in paper from their bosoms they hold it in their left hands and taking a pinch with the right hand they place the packet in their left sleeve If the table on which the tablet is placed be high the person offering incense half raises himself from his crouching position if the table be low he remains crouching to burn the incense after which he takes three steps backwards with bows and reverences and retires six feet when he again crouches down to watch the incense burning and bows to the priests who are sitting in a row with their chief at their head after which he rises and leaves the room Up to the time of burning the incense no notice is taken of the priest At the ceremony of burning incense before the grave the priests are not saluted The packet of incense is made of fine paper folded in three both ways Footnote one hundred twenty four After death a person receives a new name For instance the famous Prince Tokugawa Iyeyasu entered salvation as Gongen Sama This name is called okurina or the accompanying name NOTE The reason why the author of the Sho rei Hikki has treated so briefly of the funeral ceremonies is probably that these rites being invariably entrusted to the Buddhist priesthood vary according to the sect of the latter and as there are no less than fifteen sects of Buddhism in Japan it would be a long matter to enter into the ceremonies practised by each Should Buddhism be swept out of Japan as seems likely to be the case men will probably return to the old rites which obtained before its introduction in the sixth century of our era What those rites were I have been unable to learn
