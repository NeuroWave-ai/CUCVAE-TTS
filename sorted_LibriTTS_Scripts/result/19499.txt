none	none	ook on this subject which would satisfy everyone in either the selection or actual definition of terms In formulating the definitions themselves an attempt has been made to use such words as note tone et cetera with at least a fair degree of accuracy and while the attitude of the author on this point may be criticized as being puristic and pedantic it is nevertheless his opinion that the next generation of music students and teachers will be profited by a more accurate use of certain terms that have been inaccurately used for so long that the present generation has to a large extent lost sight of the fact that the use is inaccurate The author is well aware of the fact that reform is a matter of growth rather than of edict but he is also of the belief that before reform can actually begin to come the need of reform must be felt by a fairly large number of actively interested persons It is precisely because so few musicians realize the need of any change in music terminology that the changes recommended by committees who have given the matter careful thought are so slow in being adopted It is hoped that some few points at which reform in the terminology of music is necessary may be brought to the attention of a few additional musicians thru this volume and that the cause may thus be helped in some slight degree It is suggested that in using the book for class room purposes the teacher emphasize not only the definition and derivation of all terms studied but the spelling and pronunciation as well For this latter purpose a pronouncing index has been appended It is impossible to give credit to all sources from which ideas have been drawn but especial mention should be made of the eminently clear and beautifully worded definitions compiled by Professor Waldo S Pratt or the Century Dictionary and the exceedingly valuable articles on an almost all inclusive range of topics found in the new edition of Grove s Dictionary Especial thanks for valuable suggestions as to the arrangement of the material et cetera are also due to doctor Raymond H Stetson Professor of Psychology Oberlin College Arthur E Heacox Professor of Theory Oberlin Conservatory of Music and Charles I Rice Supervisor of Music Worcester Mass as well as to various members of the Music Teachers National Association who have offered valuable advice along certain specific lines K W G OBERLIN CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC June nineteen

thirty one No three one hundred forty nine PRONOUNCING INDEX one hundred fifty nine CHAPTER I SOME PRINCIPLES OF CORRECT NOTATION one The note from nota Latin a mark or sign consists of either one two or three parts Illustration these being referred to respectively as head stem and hook The hook is often called tail or cross stroke The stem appears on the right side of the head when turned up but on the left side when turned down one Illustration The hook is always on the right side two Illustration Footnote one It should be noted at the outset that this statement regarding the down turned stem on the left side of the note head and also a number of similar principles here cited refer more specifically to music as it appears on the printed page In the case of hand copied music the down turned stem appears on the right side of the note thus note symbol This is done because of greater facility in writing and for the same reason other slight modifications of the notation here recommended may sometimes be encountered In dealing with children it is best usually to follow as closely as possible the principles according to which printed music is notated in order to avoid those non satisfying and often embarrassing explanations of differences which will otherwise be unavoidable Footnote two An exception to this rule occurs in the case of notes of unequal value stroked together when the hook appears on the left side thus Illustration In writing music with pen the head and hook are best made with a heavy pressure on the pen point but in writing at the board they are most easily made by using a piece of chalk about an inch long turned on its side two When only one part or voice is written on the staff the following rules for turning stems apply one If the note head is below the third line the stem must turn up two If the note head is above the third line the stem must turn down three If the note head is on the third line the stem is turned either up or down with due regard to the symmetrical appearance of the measure in which the note occurs The following examples will illustrate these points Illustration Fig one three When two parts are written on the same staff the stems of the upper part all turn up and those of the lower part turn down in order that the parts may be clearly distinguished Fig two But in music for piano and other instruments on which complete chords can be sounded by one performer and also in simple four part vocal music in which all voices have approximately the same rhythm several notes often have one stem in common as in Fig three Illustration Fig two Illustration Fig three four Notes of small denomination eighths and smaller are often written in groups of two or more all stems in the group being then connected by one cross stroke In such a case all the stems must of course be turned the same way the direction being determined by the position of the majority of note heads in the group Notes thus stroked may be of the same or of different denomination See Fig four Illustration Fig four In vocal music notes are never thus stroked when a syllable is given to each note See p nineteen Sec fifty five C five Rests like notes are best made with a heavy pen stroke or by using a piece of chalk on its side See note under Sec one The double whole rest whole rest and half rest occupy the third space unless for the sake of clearness in writing two parts on the same staff they are written higher or lower The rests of smaller denomination may be placed at any point on the staff the hooks being always placed on the spaces The hook of the eighth rest is usually placed on the third space Rests are sometimes dotted but are never tied six The G clef should be begun at the second line rather than below the staff Experiments have shown clearly that beginners learn to make it most easily in this way and the process may be further simplified by dividing it into two parts thus Illustration The descending stroke crosses the ascending curve at or near the fourth line The circular part of the curve occupies approximately the first and second spaces seven The F clef is made either thus bass clef symbol or thus old bass clef symbol the dots being placed one on either side of the fourth line of the staff which is the particular point that the clef marks The C clef has also two forms C clef symbol and tenor clef symbol eight The sharp is made with two light vertical strokes and two heavy slanting ones the slant of the latter being upward from left to right sharp The sharp should never be made thus Illustration The double sharp is made either thus double sharp symbol or old double sharp symbol the first form being at present the more common nine The flat is best made by a down stroke retraced part way up the curve being made without lifting pen from paper The double flat consists of two flats three flat flat The natural or cancel is made in two strokes down right and right down thus Illustration Footnote three It is to be hoped that the figure for the double flat suggested by Mattheson who also suggested the saint Andrew s cross symbol for the double sharp may some time be readopted This figure was the Greek letter B made thus Greek b and its use would make our notation one degree more uniform than it is at present ten The tie usually connects the heads of notes thus tie symbol eleven The dot after a note always appears on a space whether the note head is on a line or space See Fig five In the case of a dot after a note on a line the dot usually appears on the space above that line if the next note is higher in position and on the space below it if the following note is lower Illustration Fig five Note Correct notation must be made a habit rather than a theory and in order to form the habit of writing correctly drill is necessary This may perhaps be best secured by asking students to write at the board or on ruled paper from verbal dictation thus Teacher says Key of B flat three quarter measure First measure DO a quarter note RE a quarter and MI a quarter Second measure SOL a quarter LA a quarter and SOL a quarter Third measure LA TI DO RE MI eighths stroked in pairs Fourth measure high DO a dotted half Pupils respond by writing the exercise dictated after which mistakes in the turning of stems et cetera are corrected The pitch names may be dictated instead of the syllables if desired and still further practice may be provided by asking that the exercise be transposed to other keys CHAPTER II SYMBOLS OF MUSIC DEFINED twelve A staff is a collection of parallel lines together with the spaces belonging to them The modern staff has five lines and six spaces 
4443-11591-0001	train-other-500	these being ordinarily referred to as first line second line third line fourth line and fifth line beginning with the lowest and space below
none	none	 i e 
4443-11591-0002	train-other-500	space below the first line first space second space third space fourth space and space above The definition and discussion above refer more specifically to one of the portions of the great staff
none	none	 the latter term being often applied to the combination of treble and bass staffs with one leger line between so commonly used in piano music et cetera thirteen The extent of the staff may be increased either above or below by the addition of short lines called leger lines four and notes may be written on either these lines or on the spaces above and below them Footnote four The word leger is derived from the French word LEGER meaning light and this use of the word refers to the fact that the leger lines being added by hand are lighter i e less solid in color than the printed lines of the staff itself fourteen The lines and spaces constituting the staff including leger lines if any are often referred to as staff degrees i e each separate line and space is considered to be a degree of the staff The tones of a scale are also sometimes referred to as degrees of the scale fifteen A clef five is a sign placed on the staff to designate what pitches are to be represented by its lines and spaces Thus e g the G clef shows us not only that the second line of the staff represents G but that the first line represents E the first space F et cetera The F clef similarly shows us that the fifth line of the bass staff represents the first A below middle C the fourth line the first F below middle C et cetera Footnote five The word clef is derived from CLAVIS a key the reference being to the fact that the clef unlocks or makes clear the meaning of the staff as a key to a puzzle enables us to solve the puzzle The student should note that these clefs are merely modified forms of the letters G and F which among others were used to designate the pitches represented by certain lines when staff notation was first inaugurated For a fuller discussion of this matter see Appendix A p one hundred one Transcriber s Note Corrected error Appendix I in original sixteen When the G clef is used the staff is usually referred to as the treble staff and when the F clef is used as the bass staff Such expressions as singing from the treble clef or singing in the treble clef 
4443-11591-0003	train-other-500	and singing in the bass clef are still frequently heard but are preferably replaced by singing from the treble staff and singing from the bass staff

none	none	 six Footnote six The Germans use the same pitch designations as we do with two exceptions viz 
4443-11591-0005	train-other-500	our B is called by them H and our B flat is called B The scale of C therefore reads C D E F G
4443-11591-0006	train-other-500	A H C the scale of F reads F G A B C D E F
4443-11591-0007	train-other-500	The signatures are in all cases written exactly as we write them In France and Italy where the fixed DO system is in vogue pitches are usually referred to by the syllable names
none	none	 e g C is referred to as DO or UT D as RE et cetera Illustration Fig six seventeen The movable C clef C clef symbol or tenor clef symbol formerly in very common use is now utilized for only two purposes viz one in music written for certain orchestral instruments 
4443-11591-0008	train-other-500	cello viola et cetera of extended range in order to avoid having to use too many leger lines and two for indicating the tenor part in vocal music
4443-11591-0009	train-other-500	This latter usage seems also to be disappearing however and the tenor part is commonly written on the treble staff it being understood
none	none	 that the tones are to be sung an octave lower than the notes would indicate The C clef as used in its various positions is shown in Figs seven eight and nine It will be noted that in each case the line on which the clef is placed represents middle C Illustration Fig seven Soprano clef Illustration Fig eight Alto clef Illustration Fig nine Tenor clef eighteen A sharp is a character which causes the degree of the staff with which it is associated to represent a pitch one half step higher than it otherwise would Thus in Fig ten a 
4443-11591-0010	train-other-500	the fifth line and first space represent the pitch F but in Fig ten b these same staff degrees represent an entirely different tone F sharp The student should note that the sharp does not then raise anything
none	none	 it merely causes a staff degree to represent a higher tone than it otherwise would 
4443-11591-0011	train-other-500	There is just as much difference between F and F sharp as between B and C and yet one would never think of referring to C
none	none	 as B raised Illustration Fig ten nineteen 
4443-11591-0012	train-other-500	A flat is a character that causes the degree of the staff with which it is associated to represent a tone one half step lower than it otherwise would
none	none	 See note under Sec eighteen 
4443-11591-0013	train-other-500	and apply the same discussion here twenty A double sharp causes the staff degree on which it is placed to represent a pitch one whole step higher than it would without any sharp
none	none	 Similarly a double flat causes the staff degree on which it is placed to represent a pitch one whole step lower than it would without any flat Double sharps and double flats are generally used on staff degrees that have already been sharped or flatted therefore their practical effect is to cause staff degrees to represent pitches respectively a half step higher and a half step lower than would be represented by those same degrees in their diatonic condition Thus in Fig ten b the first space in its diatonic condition seven represents F sharp and the double sharp on this degree would cause it to represent a pitch one half step higher than F sharp i e F double sharp Footnote seven The expression diatonic condition as here used refers to the staff after the signature has been placed upon it in other words after the staff has been prepared to represent the pitches of the diatonic scale CHAPTER III SYMBOLS OF MUSIC DEFINED Continued twenty one The natural eight sometimes called cancel annuls the effect of previous sharps flats double sharps and double flats within the measure in which it occurs After a double sharp or double flat the combination of a natural with a sharp or a natural with a flat is often found in this case only one sharp or flat is annulled Sometimes also the single sharp or flat will be found by itself cancelling the double sharp or double flat The natural is often used when a composition changes key as in Fig eleven where a change from E to G is shown Footnote eight It has already been noted p six Note that in the German scale our b flat is called b and our b is called H From this difference in terminology has grown up the custom of using the H now made natural to show that any staff degree is in natural condition i e not sharped or flatted Illustration Fig eleven twenty two The group of sharps or flats or absence of them at the beginning of a staff partially indicates the key in which the composition is written They are called collectively the key signature twenty three The same key signature may stand for either one of two keys the major key or its relative minor hence in order to determine in what key a melody is one must note whether the tones are grouped about the major tonic DO or the minor tonic LA In a harmonized composition it is almost always possible to determine the key by referring to the last bass note if the final chord is clearly the DO chord the composition is in the major key but if this final chord is clearly the LA chord then it is almost certain that the entire composition is in the minor key Thus if a final chord appears as that in Fig twelve the composition is clearly in G major while if it appears as in Fig thirteen it is just as surely in E minor Illustration Fig twelve Illustration Fig thirteen twenty four Sharps flats naturals double sharps and double flats occurring in the course of the composition i e after the key signature are called accidentals whether they actually cause a staff degree to represent a different pitch as in Fig fourteen or simply make clear a notation about which there might otherwise be some doubt as in Fig fifteen measure two The effect of such accidentals terminates at the bar Illustration Fig fourteen Illustration Fig fifteen twenty five In the case of a tie across a bar an accidental remains in force until the combined value of the tied notes expires In Fig sixteen first measure third beat an accidental sharp makes the third space represent the pitch C sharp By virtue of the tie across the bar the third space continues to represent C sharp thru the first beat of the second measure but for the remainder of the measure the third space will represent C unless the sharp is repeated as in Fig seventeen Illustration Fig sixteen Illustration Fig seventeen twenty six The following rules for making staff degrees represent pitches different from those of the diatonic scale will be found useful by the beginner in the study of music notation These rules are quoted from The Worcester Musical Manual by Charles I Rice one To sharp a natural degree use a sharp Fig eighteen two To sharp a sharped degree use a double sharp Fig nineteen three To sharp a flatted degree use a natural Fig twenty four To flat a natural degree use a flat Fig twenty one five To flat a flatted degree use a double flat Fig twenty two six To flat a sharped degree use a natural Fig twenty three Illustration Fig eighteen Illustration Fig nineteen Illustration Fig twenty Illustration Fig twenty one Illustration Fig twenty two Illustration Fig twenty three twenty seven When two different notations represent the same pitch the word enharmonic is applied Thus we may say that F sharp and G flat on keyboard instruments at least are enharmonically the same This word enharmonic is used in such expressions as enharmonic change enharmonic keys enharmonic interval enharmonic modulation enharmonic relation et cetera and in all such combinations it has the same meaning viz a change in notation but no change in the pitch represented twenty eight A note is a character expressing relative duration which when placed on a staff indicates that a certain tone is to be sounded for a certain relative length of time The pitch of the tone to be sounded is shown by the position of the note on the staff while the length of time it is to be prolonged is shown by the shape of the note Thus e g a half note on the second line of the treble staff indicates that a specific pitch g is to be played or sung for a period of time twice as long as would be indicated by a quarter note in the same composition twenty nine A rest is a character which indicates a rhythmic silence of a certain relative length thirty The notes and rests in common use are as follows symbol Whole note An open note head without stem symbol Half note An open note head with stem symbol Quarter note A closed note head with stem symbol Eighth note A closed note head with stem and one hook symbol Sixteenth note A closed note head with stem and two hooks symbol Thirty second note A closed note head with stem and three hooks symbol Whole rest symbol Half rest symbol Quarter rest symbol Eighth rest symbol Sixteenth rest symbol Thirty second rest thirty one The English names for these notes are Whole note semi breve Half note minim Quarter note crotchet Eighth note quaver Sixteenth note semi quaver Thirty second note demi semi quaver The corresponding rests are referred to by the same system of nomenclature e g semi breve rest et cetera thirty two Sixty fourth and one hundred and twenty eighth notes are occasionally found but are not in common use The double whole note breve made breve symbol or old breve symbol is still used especially in English music which frequently employs the half note as the beat unit Thus in four half measure the breve would be necessary to indicate a tone having four beats thirty three The whole rest has a peculiarity of usage not common to any of the other duration symbols viz that it is often employed as a measure rest filling an entire measure of beats no matter what the measure signature may be Thus not only in four quarter measure but in two quarter three quarter six eighth and other varieties the whole rest fills the entire measure having a value sometimes greater sometimes less than the corresponding whole note Because of this peculiarity of usage the whole rest is termed Takt pausa measure rest by the Germans thirty four A bar is a vertical line across the staff dividing it into measures The word bar is often used synonymously with measure by orchestral conductors and others thus begin at the fourteenth bar after J This use of the word although popular is incorrect thirty five A double bar consists of two vertical lines across the staff at least one of the two being a heavy line The double bar marks the end of a division movement or entire composition CHAPTER IV ABBREVIATIONS SIGNS et cetera thirty six A double bar or single heavy bar with either two or four dots indicates that a section is to be repeated If the repeat marks occur at only one point the entire preceding part is to be repeated but if the marks occur twice the first time at the right of the bar but the second time at the left only the section thus enclosed by the marks is to be repeated Illustration thirty seven Sometimes a different cadence or ending is to be used for the repetition and this is indicated as in Fig twenty four Illustration Fig twenty four thirty eight The Italian word bis is occasionally used to indicate that a certain passage or section is to be repeated This use is becoming obsolete thirty nine The words da capo D C mean literally from the head i e repeat from the beginning The words dal segno D S indicate a repetition from the sign segno symbol or segno symbol instead of from the beginning In the case of both D C and D S the word fine meaning literally the end is ordinarily used to designate the point at which the repeated section is to terminate The fermata fermata symbol was formerly in common use for this same purpose but is seldom so employed at present D C sin nine al fine means repeat from the beginning to the word fine Footnote nine The word sin is a contraction of the Italian word sino meaning as far as or until in the term given above Sec thirty nine it is really superfluous as the word al includes in itself both preposition and article meaning to the D C al fermata symbol means repeat to the fermata or hold D C senza repetizione or D C ma senza repetizione Transcriber s Note Corrected misspelling repetitione both mean repeat from the beginning but without observing other repeat marks during the repetition D C e poi la coda means repeat the first section only to the mark coda symbol then skip to the coda See p seventy four Sec one hundred fifty seven for discussion of coda forty In certain cases where the repetition of characteristic figures can be indicated without causing confusion it is the practice of composers especially in orchestral music to make use of certain signs of repetition Some of the commonest of these abbreviations are shown in the following examples Illustration Fig twenty five Illustration Fig twenty six Illustration Fig twenty seven In Fig twenty eight the repetition of an entire measure is called for Illustration Fig twenty eight forty one The word simile Transcriber s Note Corrected error similie sometimes segue indicates that a certain effect previously begun is to be continued as e g staccato playing pedalling style of bowing in violin music et cetera The word segue is also occasionally used to show that an accompaniment figure especially in orchestral music is to be continued forty two When some part is to rest for two or more measures several methods of notation are possible A rest of two measures is usually indicated thus Illustration Three measures thus Illustration Four measures thus Illustration Rests of more than four measures are usually indicated in one of the following ways Illustration Sometimes the number of measures is written directly on the staff thus Illustration forty three The letters G P general pause or grosse pause the words lunga pausa or simply the word lunga are sometimes written over a rest to show that there is to be a prolonged pause or rest in all parts Such expressions are found only in ensemble music i e music in which several performers are engaged at the same time forty four The fermata or hold fermata symbol over a note or chord indicates that the tone is to be prolonged the duration of the prolongation depending upon the character of the music and the taste of the performer or conductor It has already been noted that the hold over a bar was formerly used to designate the end of the composition as the word fine is employed at present but this usage has practically disappeared and the hold over the bar now usually indicates a short rest between two sections of a composition forty five The sign eightva an abbreviation of all ottava Transcriber s Note Corrected error al ottava in original literally at the octave above the staff indicates that all tones are to be sounded an octave higher than the notes would indicate When found below the staff the same sign serves to indicate that the tones are to be sounded an octave lower The term eightva bassa has also this latter signification forty six Sometimes the word loco in place is used to show that the part is no longer to be sounded an octave higher or lower but this is more often indicated by the termination of the dotted or wavy line forty seven The sign Col eight coll ottava with the octave shows that the tones an octave higher or lower are to be sounded with the tones indicated by the printed notes Transcriber s Note Corrected error colonel ottava in original forty eight For the sake of definiteness in referring to pitches a particular name is applied to each octave and all pitches in the octave are referred to by means of a uniform nomenclature The following figure will make this system clear Illustration Fig twenty nine Thus e g great G written simply G is the G represented by the first line of the bass staff Small A written a is represented by the fifth line of the bass staff Two lined G written two lined g symbol is represented by the space above the fifth line treble staff Three lined C written three lined c symbol is represented by the second added line above the treble staff et cetera The one lined octave may be described as the octave from middle C to the B represented by the third line of the treble staff and any tone within that octave is referred to as one lined Thus one lined D one lined G et cetera In scientific works on acoustics et cetera the pitches in the sub octave or sub contra octave as it is often called are referred to as C two D two E two et cetera those in the contra octave as C one D one et cetera in the great octave as c one d one et cetera in the small octave as c two d two et cetera CHAPTER V ABBREVIATIONS SIGNS et cetera Continued forty nine A dot after a note shows that the value of the note is to be half again as great as it would be without the dot i e the value is to be three halves that of the original note Illustration fifty When two dots follow the note the second dot adds half as much as the first dot has added i e the entire value is seven fourths that of the original note Illustration fifty one When three dots follow the note the third dot adds one half the value added by the second i e the entire value of the triple dotted note is fifteen eighths that of the original note Illustration fifty two A dot over or under a note is called the staccato mark and indicates that the tone is to be sounded and then instantly released Illustration In music for organ and for some other instruments the staccato note is sometimes interpreted differently this depending on the character of the instrument On stringed instruments of the violin family the staccato effect is usually secured by a long rapid stroke of the bow for each tone in the case of harp and drum the hand is quickly brought in contact with the vibrating body thus stopping the tone instantly On the organ the tone is often prolonged to one half the value of the printed note before the keys are released fifty three The wedge shaped dash over the note staccatissimo was formerly employed to indicate a tone still more detached than that indicated by the dot but this sign is really superfluous and is seldom used at present Illustration fifty four A tie is a curved line connecting the heads of two notes that call for the same tone It indicates that they are to be sounded as one tone having a duration equal to the combined value of both notes E g a half note tied to a quarter note would indicate a tone equal in duration length to that shown by a dotted half note two half notes tied would indicate a tone equal in duration to that shown by a whole note See examples under Sections forty nine fifty and fifty one Fig thirty illustrates the more common variety of tie while Fig thirty one shows an example of the enharmonic ten tie Footnote ten For definition of enharmonic see p ten Sec twenty seven Illustration Fig thirty Illustration Fig thirty one fifty five The slur is used in so many different ways that it is impossible to give a general definition It consists of a curved line sometimes very short in which case it looks like the tie but sometimes very long connecting ten fifteen or more notes Some of the more common uses of the slur are A To indicate legato sustained or connected tones as contrasted with staccato detached ones In violin music this implies playing all tones thus slurred in one bow in music for the voice and for wind instruments it implies singing or playing them in one breath B As a phrase mark in the interpretation of which the first tone of the phrase is often accented slightly and the last one shortened in value This interpretation of the phrase is especially common when the phrase is short as in the two note phrase and when the tones constituting the phrase are of short duration e g the phrase given in Fig thirty two would be played approximately as written in Fig thirty three Illustration Fig thirty two Illustration Fig thirty three But if the notes are of greater value especially in slow tempi the slur merely indicates legato i e sustained or connected rendition Fig thirty four illustrates such a case Illustration Fig thirty four This is a matter of such diverse usage that it is difficult to generalize regarding it The tendency seems at present to be in the direction of using the slur in instrumental music as a phrase mark exclusively it being understood that unless there is some direction to the contrary the tones are to be performed in a connected manner C In vocal music to show that two or more tones are to be sung to one syllable of text See Fig thirty five Illustration Fig thirty five MENDELSSOHN S Paul re mem bers His chil dren In notes of small denomination eighths and smaller this same thing is often indicated by stroking the stems together as in Fig thirty six This can only be done in cases where the natural grouping of notes in the measure will not be destroyed Illustration Fig thirty six ev er and ev er for ev er and D To mark special note groups triplets et cetera in which case the slur is accompanied by a figure indicating the number of notes in the group See Fig thirty seven a The most common of these irregular note groups is the triplet which consists of three notes to be performed in the time ordinarily given to two of the same value Sometimes the triplet consists of only two notes as in Fig thirty seven b In such a case the first two of the three notes composing the triplet are considered to be tied Illustration Fig thirty seven When the triplet form is perfectly obvious the Fig three as well as the slur may be omitted Other examples of irregular note groups together with the names commonly applied follow Illustration Doublet Quintuplet or Quintolet Sextuplet or Sextolet Septolet or Septimole fifty six The combination of slur or tie and dots over the notes indicates that the tones are to be somewhat detached but not sharply so Illustration This effect is sometimes erroneously termed portamento lit carrying but this term is more properly reserved for an entirely different effect viz when a singer or player on a stringed instrument passes from a high tone to a low one or vice versa touching lightly on some or all of the diatonic tones between the two melody tones fifty seven The horizontal dash over a note Illustration indicates that the tone is to be slightly accented and sustained This mark is also sometimes used after a staccato passage to show that the tones are no longer to be performed in detached fashion but are to be sustained This latter use is especially common in music for stringed instruments fifty eight The combination of dash and dot over a note Illustration indicates that the tone is to be slightly accented and separated from its neighboring tones fifty nine Accent marks are made in a variety of fashions The most common forms follow horizontal accent symbol vertical accent symbol sf fz All indicate that a certain tone or chord is to be differentiated from its neighboring tones or chords by receiving a certain relative amount of stress sixty In music for keyboard instruments it is sometimes necessary to indicate that a certain part is to be played by a certain hand The abbreviations r h right hand m d mano destra It and m d main droite Fr designate that a passage or tone is to be played with the right hand while l h left hand m s mano sinistra It and m g main gauche Fr show that the left hand is to be employed sixty one The wavy line placed vertically beside a chord Illustration indicates that the tones are to be sounded consecutively instead of simultaneously beginning with the lowest tone all tones being sustained until the duration value of the chord has expired This is called arpeggio playing When the wavy line extends through the entire chord covering both staffs as in Fig thirty eight all the tones of the chord are to be played one after another beginning with the lowest but if there is a separate wavy line for each staff as at Fig thirty nine then the lowest tone represented on the upper staff is to be played simultaneously with the lowest tone represented on the bass staff Illustration Fig thirty eight Illustration Fig thirty nine The word arpeggio plural arpeggi is a derivation of the Italian word arpa meaning harp and from this word arpa and its corresponding verb arpeggiare to play on the harp are derived also a number of other terms commonly used in instrumental music Among these are arpeggiamento arpeggiando arpeggiato et cetera all of these terms referring to a harp style of performance the tones being sounded one after another in rapid succession instead of simultaneously as on the piano sixty two The sign crescendo decrescendo symbol over a note indicates that the tone is to be begun softly gradually increased in power and as gradually decreased again ending as softly as it began In vocal music this effect is called messa di voce sixty three In music for stringed instruments of the violin family the sign down bow symbol indicates down bow and the sign up bow symbol up bow In cello music the down bow sign is sometimes written cello down bow symbol CHAPTER VI EMBELLISHMENTS sixty four Embellishments or graces Fr 
243-11595-0001	train-other-500	agrements are ornamental tones either represented in full in the score or indicated by certain signs The following are the embellishments most commonly found Trill or shake mordent
243-11595-0002	train-other-500	inverted mordent or prall trill turn gruppetto inverted turn appoggiatura
none	none	 and acciaccatura Usage varies greatly in the interpretation of the signs 
243-11595-0003	train-other-500	representing these embellishments and it is impossible to give examples of all the different forms The following definitions represent therefore only the most commonly found examples and the most generally accepted interpretations
none	none	 sixty five The trill or shake consists of the rapid alternation of two tones to the full value of the printed note The lower of these two tones is represented by the printed note while the upper one is the next higher tone in the diatonic scale of the key in which the composition is written The interval between the two tones may therefore be either a half step or a whole step Whether the trill is to begin with the principal tone represented by the printed note or with the one above is a matter of some dispute among theorists and performers but it may safely be said that the majority of modern writers on the subject would have it begin on the principal tone rather than on the tone above Fig forty When the principal note is preceded by a small note on the degree above it is of course understood that the trill begins on the tone above Fig forty one The trill is indicated by the sign trill symbol Illustration Fig forty Illustration Fig forty one The above examples would be termed perfect trills because they close with a turn By inference 
243-11595-0004	train-other-500	an imperfect trill is one closing without a turn sixty six
none	none	 The mordent mordent symbol consists of three tones first the one represented by the printed note second the one next below it in the diatonic scale third the one represented by the printed note again Illustration Fig forty two sixty seven The double or long mordent has five tones sometimes seven instead of three the first two of the three tones of the regular mordent being repeated once or more See Fig forty three 
243-11595-0005	train-other-500	In the case of both mordent and double mordent
none	none	 the tones are sounded as quickly as possible the time taken by the embellishment being subtracted from the value of the principal note as printed Illustration Fig forty three sixty eight The inverted mordent inverted mordent symbol note the absence of the vertical line is like the mordent except that the tone below is replaced by the tone above in each case This ornament 
243-11595-0006	train-other-500	is sometimes called a transient shake because it is really only a part of the more elaborate grace called trill
none	none	 See Fig forty four Illustration Fig forty four The confusion at present attending the interpretation of the last two embellishments described might be largely obviated if the suggestion of a recent writer eleven to call the one the upward mordent and the other the downward mordent were to be universally adopted Footnote eleven Elson Dictionary of Music article mordent sixty nine The turn consists of four tones first the diatonic scale tone above the principal tone second the principal tone itself third the tone below the principal tone and fourth the principal tone again When the sign turn symbol or fancy turn symbol occurs over a note of small value in rapid tempo Fig forty five the turn consists of four tones of equal value but if it occurs over a note of greater value or in a slow tempo the tones are usually played quickly like the mordent and the fourth tone is then held until the time value of the note has expired Fig forty six Illustration Fig forty five Illustration Fig forty six seventy When the turn sign is placed a little to the right of the note the principal tone is sounded first and held to almost its full time value then the turn is played just before the next tone of the melody In this case the four tones are of equal length as in the first example See Fig forty seven Illustration Fig forty seven The student should note the difference between these two effects in the case of a turn over the note the turn comes at the beginning but in the case of the sign after the note 
243-11595-0007	train-other-500	the turn comes at the very end But in both cases the time taken by the embellishment is taken from the time value of the principal note For further details
none	none	 see Grove s Dictionary of Music and Musicians Vol V p one hundred eighty four Also Elson op cit p two hundred seventy four seventy one Sometimes an accidental occurs with the turn and in this case when written above the sign it refers to the highest tone of the turn but when written below to the lowest Fig forty eight Illustration Fig forty eight seventy two In the inverted turn the order of tones is reversed the lowest one coming first 
243-11595-0008	train-other-500	the principal tone next the highest tone third
none	none	 and the principal tone again last Illustration Fig forty nine seventy three The appoggiatura lit leaning note consists of an ornamental tone introduced before a tone of a melody thus delaying the melody tone until the ornamental tone has been heard The time taken for this ornamental tone 
243-11595-0009	train-other-500	is taken from that of the melody tone The appoggiatura was formerly classified into long appoggiatura
none	none	 and short appoggiatura but modern writers seem to consider the term short appoggiatura to be synonymous with acciaccatura twelve and to avoid confusion the word acciaccatura will be used in this sense and defined under its own heading Footnote twelve In organ music the acciaccatura is still taken to mean that the embellishing tone and the melody tone are to be sounded together the former being then instantly released while the latter is held to its full time value seventy four Three rules for the interpretation of the appoggiatura are commonly cited viz 
243-11595-0010	train-other-500	one When it is possible to divide the principal tone into halves then the appoggiatura receives one half the value of the printed note
none	none	 Fig fifty two When the principal note is dotted division into halves being therefore not possible the appoggiatura receives two thirds of the value Fig fifty one three When the principal note is tied to a note of smaller denomination the appoggiatura receives the value of the first of the two notes Fig fifty two Illustration Fig fifty Illustration Fig fifty one Illustration Fig fifty two seventy five The acciaccatura or short appoggiatura is written like the appoggiatura except that it has a light stroke across its stem Illustration It has no definite duration value but is sounded as quickly as possible taking its time from that of the principal tone The appoggiatura 
243-11595-0011	train-other-500	is always accented but the acciaccatura never is the stress always falling on the melody tone See Grove
none	none	 op cit Vol I p ninety six The use of embellishments is on the wane and the student of to day needs the above information only to aid him in the interpretation of music written in previous centuries In the early days of instrumental music 
243-11595-0012	train-other-500	it was necessary to introduce graces of all sorts
none	none	 because the instruments in use were not capable 
243-11595-0013	train-other-500	of sustaining tone for any length of time but with the advent of the modern piano with its comparatively great sustaining power and also with the advent in vocal music of a new style of singing German Lieder singing as contrasted
243-11595-0014	train-other-500	with Italian coloratura singing
none	none	 ornamental tones were used less and less and when found now are usually written out in full in the score instead of being indicated by signs CHAPTER VII SCALES seventy six A scale from scala a Latin word meaning ladder Ger Ton leiter is an ascending or descending series of tones progressing according to some definite system and all bearing in the case of tonality scales at least a very intimate relation to the first tone the key tone or tonic See p twenty eight Sec seventy eight also note one at bottom of p thirty eight Many different kinds of scales have existed in various musical eras the point of resemblance among them all being the fact that they have all more or less recognized the octave as the natural limit of the series The difference among the various scales has been in the selection of intervals between the scale tones and consequently in the number of tones within the octave Thus e g in our major scale the intervals between the tones are all whole steps except two which are half steps and the result is a scale of eight tones including in this number both the key tone and its octave but in the so called pentatonic scale of the Chinese and other older civilizations we find larger intervals e g the step and a half and consequently a smaller number of tones within the octave Thus in the scale upon which many of the older Scotch folk songs are based the intervals are arranged as follows one whole two whole three step and four whole five step and six step step a half step a half The result is a scale of six tones corresponding approximately with C D E G A C in our modern system The term pentatonic is thus seen to be a misnomer since the sixth tone is necessary for the completion of the series just as the eighth tone is essential in our diatonic scales The following Chinese tune called Jasmine is based on the pentatonic scale Illustration seventy seven In studying the theory of the scale the student should bear in mind the fact that a scale is not an arbitrary series of tones which some one has invented and which others are required to make use of It is rather the result of accustoming the ear to certain melodic combinations which were originally hit upon by accident and finally analyzing and systematizing these combinations into a certain definite order or arrangement The application of this idea may be verified when it is recalled that most primitive peoples have invented melodies of some sort but that only in modern times and particularly since the development of instrumental music have these melodies been analyzed and the scale upon which they have been based discovered the inventors of the melodies being themselves wholly ignorant of the existence of such scales seventy eight A key is a number of tones grouping themselves naturally both melodically and harmonically about a central tone the key tone The word tonality is often used synonymously with key in this sense The difference between key and scale is therefore this that while both key and scale employ the same tone material by key we mean the material in general without any particular order or arrangement in mind while by scale we mean the same tones but now arranged into a regular ascending or descending series It should be noted in this connection also that not all scales present an equally good opportunity of having their tones used as a basis for tonality or key feeling neither the chromatic nor the whole step scale possess the necessary characteristics for being used as tonality scales in the same sense that our major and minor scales are so used seventy nine There are three general classes of scales extant at the present time viz one Diatonic two Chromatic three Whole tone thirteen Footnote thirteen If strictly logical terminology is to be insisted upon the whole tone scale should be called the whole step scale eighty The word diatonic means through the tones i e through the tones of the key and is applied to both major and minor scales of our modern tonality system In general a diatonic scale may be defined as one which proceeds by half steps and whole steps There is however one exception to this principle viz in the progression six to seven in the harmonic minor scale which is of course a step and a half See p thirty three Sec eighty six eighty one A major diatonic scale is one in which the intervals between the tones are arranged as follows one whole two whole three half four whole five whole six whole seven half eight step step step step step step step In other words a major diatonic scale is one in which the intervals between three and four and between seven and eight are half steps all the others being whole steps A composition based on this scale is said to be written in the major mode or in a major key The major diatonic scale may begin on any one of the twelve pitches C C sharp or D flat D D sharp or E flat E F F sharp or G flat G G sharp or A flat A A sharp or B flat B but in each case it is the same scale because the intervals between its tones are the same We have then one major scale only but this scale may be written in many different positions and may be sung or played beginning on any one of a number of different pitches eighty two It is interesting to note that the major scale consists of two identical series of four tones each i e the first four tones of the scale are separated from one another by exactly the same intervals and these intervals appear in exactly the same order as in the case of the last four tones of the scale Fig fifty three will make this clear The first four tones of any diatonic scale major or minor are often referred to as the lower tetrachord fourteen and the upper four tones as the upper tetrachord Footnote fourteen The word tetrachord means literally four strings and refers to the primitive instrument the four strings of which were so tuned that the lowest and the highest tones produced were a perfect fourth apart With the Greeks the tetrachord was the unit of analysis as the octave is with us to day and all Greek scales are capable of division into two tetrachords the arrangement of the intervals between the tones in each tetrachord differentiating one scale from another but the tetrachords themselves always consisting of groups of four tones the highest being a perfect fourth above the lowest Illustration Fig fifty three It is interesting further to note that the upper tetrachord of any sharp scale is always used without change as the lower tetrachord of the next major scale involving sharps while the lower tetrachord of any flat scale is used as the upper tetrachord of the next flat scale See Figs fifty four and fifty five Illustration Fig fifty four Illustration Fig fifty five eighty three From the standpoint of staff notation the major scale may be written in fifteen different positions as follows Illustration It will be observed that in the above series of scales those beginning on F sharp and G flat call for the same keys on the piano i e while the notation is different the actual tones of the scale are the same The scales of C sharp and D flat likewise employ the same tones When two scales thus employ the same tones but differ in notation they are said to be enharmonic cf p thirty eight Sec ninety three Note The student is advised to adopt some uniform method of writing scales preferably the one followed in those given above the necessary sharps and flats appearing before the notes in the scale and then repeated collectively at the end as a signature He is also advised to repeat these scales and signatures over and over until absolute familiarity is attained E g E F sharp G sharp A B C sharp D sharp E signature four sharps F C G and D CHAPTER VIII SCALES Continued eighty four The minor diatonic scale is used in several slightly different forms but the characteristic interval between the first and third tones which differentiates it from the major scale remains the same in every case This interval between the first and third tones consists of four half steps in the major scale and of three half steps in the minor scale and this difference in size has given rise to the designation major for the scale having the larger third and minor for the scale having the smaller one eighty five The original or primitive form of the minor scale has its tones arranged as follows one whole two half three whole four whole five half six whole seven whole eight step step step step step step step As its name implies this is the oldest of the three forms being derived from the old Greek Aeolian scale but because of the absence of a leading tone it is suitable for the simplest one part music only and is therefore little used at present eighty six The harmonic minor scale is like the primitive form except that it substitutes a tone one half step higher for the seventh tone of the older i e the primitive form This change was made because the development of writing music in several parts particularly harmonic part writing made necessary a leading tone i e a tone with a strong tendency to move on up to the key tone as a closing point In order to secure a tone with such a strongly upward tendency the interval between seven and eight had to be reduced in size to a half step It should be noted that this change in the seventh tone of the scale caused an interval of a step and a half between the sixth and seventh tones of the scale one whole two half three whole four whole five half six step and seven half eight step step step step step a half step eighty seven The melodic minor scale substitutes a tone one half step higher than six as well as one a half step higher than seven but this change is made in the ascending scale only the descending scale being like the primitive form The higher sixth commonly referred to as the raised sixth was used to get rid of the unmelodic interval of a step and a half fifteen augmented second while the return to the primitive form in descending is made because the ascending form is too much like the tonic major scale Footnote fifteen The step and a half augmented second is unmelodic because it is the same size as a minor third and the mind finds it difficult to take in as a second notes representing it being on adjacent staff degrees an interval of the same size as a third one whole two half three whole four whole five whole six whole seven half eight step step step step step step step seven whole six half five whole four whole three half two whole one step step step step step step This form is used only to a very limited extent and then principally in vocal music the harmonic form being in almost universal use in spite of the augmented second eighty eight The minor scale in its various positions up to five sharps and five flats and in all three forms follows a composition based on any one of these forms or upon a mixture of them which often occurs is said to be in the minor mode It will be noted that the first four tones are alike in all three forms i e the lower tetrachord in the minor scale is invariable no matter what may happen to the upper tetrachord The sign marks the step and a half Illustration Note The student is advised to recite the harmonic form of the minor scale as was suggested in the case of the major scale noting that the raised seventh does not affect the key signature E g E F sharp G A B C D sharp E signature one sharp F eighty nine A minor scale having the same signature as a major scale is said to be its relative minor E g e is the relative minor of G c of E flat d of F et cetera the small letter being used to refer to the minor key or scale while the capital letter indicates the major key or scale unless accompanied by the word minor Relative keys are therefore defined as those having the same signature G and e are relative keys as are also A and f sharp et cetera ninety A minor scale beginning with the same tone as a major scale is referred to as its tonic minor Thus e g c with three flats in its signature is the tonic minor of C with all degrees in natural condition e with one sharp is the tonic minor of E with four sharps et cetera Tonic keys are therefore those having the same key tone ninety one The eight tones of the diatonic scale both major and minor are often referred to by specific names as follows one Tonic the tone This refers to the fact that the tonic is the principal tone or generating tone of the key i e it is the tone two Super tonic above the tone three Mediant midway between tonic and dominant four Sub dominant the under dominant This name does not refer to the position of the tone under the dominant but to the fact that the fifth below the tonic is also a dominant tone the under dominant just as the fifth above is the upper dominant five Dominant the governing tone From the Latin word dominus meaning master six Super dominant above the dominant Or Sub mediant midway between tonic and sub dominant seven Leading tone the tone which demands resolution to the tonic one half step above it eight Octave the eighth tone ninety two The syllables commonly applied to the various major and minor scales in teaching sight singing are as follows sixteen Footnote sixteen These syllables are said to have been derived originally from the initial syllables of the Hymn to Saint John the music of which was a typical Gregorian chant The application of these syllables to the scale tones will be made clear by reference to this hymn as given below It will be observed that this hymn provided syllables only for the six tones of the hexachord then recognized when the octave scale was adopted early in the sixteenth century the initial letters of the last line s and i were combined into a syllable for the seventh tone Illustration Ut que ant lax is Re so na re fi bris Mi ra ges to rum Fa mu li tu o rum Sol ve pol lu ti La bi i re a tum Sanc te Jo han nes Major DO RE MI FA SOL LA TI DO Minor seventeen original LA TI DO RE MI FA SOL LA harmonic LA TI DO RE MI FA SI LA melodic LA TI DO RE MI FI SI LA SOL FA MI RE DO TI LA Footnote seventeen A considerable number of teachers particularly those who did not learn to sing by syllable in childhood object to calling the tonic of the minor scale la insisting that both major and minor tonic should be called do According to this plan the syllables used in singing the harmonic minor scale would be DO RE ME FA SOL LE TI DO There is no particular basis for this theory for although all scales must of course begin with the key tone or tonic this tonic may be referred to by any syllable which will serve as a basis for an association process enabling one to feel the force of the tone as a closing point a home tone Thus in the Dorian mode the tonic would be RE in the Phrygian MI et cetera It is interesting to study the changes in both spelling and pronunciation that have occurred and are still occurring in these syllables The first one ut was changed to DO as early as the sixteenth century because of the difficulty of producing a good singing tone on ut For the same reason and also in order to avoid having two diatonic syllables with the same initial letter the tonic sol fa system invented in England about eighteen twelve and systematized about eighteen fifty changed SI to TI and this change has been almost universally adopted by teachers of sight singing in this country The more elaborate tonic sol fa spelling of the diatonic syllables DOH LAH et cetera has not however been favorably received in this country and the tendency seems to be toward still further simplification rather than toward elaboration It is probable that further changes in both spelling and pronunciation will be made in the near future one such change that seems especially desirable being some other syllable than RE for the second tone of the major scale so that the present syllable may be reserved for flat two thus providing a uniform vowel sound for all intermediate tones of the descending chromatic scale as is already the case in the ascending form ninety three The chromatic scale eighteen is one which proceeds always by half steps Its intervals are therefore always equal no matter with what tone it begins Since however we have from the standpoint of the piano keyboard five pairs of tones nineteen which are enharmonically the same it may readily be seen that the chromatic scale might be notated in all sorts of fashions and this is in fact the real status of the matter there being no one method uniformly agreed upon by composers Footnote eighteen The student should differentiate between the so called tonality scales like the major and minor the tones of which are actually used as a basis for key feeling with the familiar experience of coming home to the tonic after a melodic or harmonic excursion and on the other hand the purely artificial and mechanical construction of the chromatic scale Footnote nineteen Many other enharmonic notations are possible altho the five pairs of tones above referred to are the most common Thus E sharp and F are enharmonically the same as are also C flat and B C sharp and B double sharp et cetera Parry Grove s Dictionary article chromatic recommends writing the scale with such accidentals as can occur in chromatic chords without changing the key in which the passage occurs Thus taking C as a type the first accidental will be D flat as the upper note of the minor ninth on the tonic the next will be E flat the minor third of the key the next F sharp the major third of the super tonic all of which can occur without causing modulation and the remaining two will be A flat and B flat the minor sixth and seventh of the key According to this plan the chromatic scale beginning with C would be spelled C D flat D E flat E F F sharp G A flat A B flat B C the form being the same both ascending and descending This is of course written exclusively from a harmonic standpoint and the advantage of such a form is its definiteness ninety four For sight singing purposes the chromatic scale twenty is usually written by representing the intermediate tones in ascending by sharps in some cases naturals and double sharps and the intermediate tones in descending by flats sometimes naturals and double flats The chromatic scale in nine different positions written from this standpoint follows and the syllables most commonly applied in sight singing have also been added In the first two scales the student of harmony is asked to note that because of the very common practice of modulating to the dominant and sub dominant keys the intermediate tones sharp four and flat seven are quite universally used in both ascending and descending melody passages In other words the scales that follow would more nearly represent actual usage if in each case sharp four FI were substituted for flat five SE in the descending scale and if flat seven TE were substituted for sharp six LI in the ascending form Footnote twenty The word chromatic means literally colored and was first applied to the intermediate tones because by using them the singer could get smoother and more diversely shaded progressions i e could get more color than by using only the diatonic tones Composers were not long discovering the peculiar value of these additional tones and soon found that these same tones were exceedingly valuable also in modulating hence the two uses of intermediate tones at the present time first to embellish a melody second to modulate to another key Illustration Note In writing chromatic scales from this sight singing standpoint the student is urged to adopt a three step process first writing the major diatonic scale both ascending and descending second marking the half steps third inserting accidental notes calling for the intermediate tones In the above chromatic scales these intermediate tones have been represented by black note heads so as to differentiate them from the notes representing diatonic scale tones ninety five The whole step scale the third type mentioned in Sec seventy nine is as its name implies a scale in which the intervals between the tones consist in every instance of whole steps This reduces the number of tones in the scale to seven Beginning with C the scale reads C D E F sharp or G flat A flat B flat C This scale has been used somewhat extensively by the ultramodern French school of composition represented by Debussy Ravel and others but is not making any progress toward universal adoption The remarks of a recent English writer twenty one on this subject may be interesting to the student who is puzzled by the apparent present day tendencies of French music He says The student of some interesting modern developments will also speedily discover that the adoption of the so called whole tone scale as a basis of music is except upon a keyed instrument tuned to the compromise of equal temperament unnatural and impossible No player upon a stringed instrument can play the scale of whole tones and arrive at an octave which is in tune with the starting note unless he deliberately changes one of the notes on the road and alters it while playing it The obvious result of the application of the whole tone scale to an orchestra or a string quartet would be to force them to adopt the equal temperament of the pianoforte and play every interval except the octave out of tune When this modification had taken hold all music in the pure scale would be distorted and destroyed unless string players were to face the practically impossible drudgery of studying both the equal temperament and the pure scale from the start and were able to tackle either form at a moment s notice A thorough knowledge of the natural genesis of the scale of western nations will be the best antidote to fads founded upon ignorance of it It is a curious commentary upon this question that Wagner in the opening of the third act of Tristan bars six to ten experimented with the whole tone scale and drew his pen through it as was to be expected from a composer whose every work proves the writer to have had the pure scale inbred in him Footnote twenty one Stanford Musical Composition nineteen eleven p seventeen There may be some difference of opinion among acousticians as to whether mister Stanford is correct in his scientific assumptions regarding the difference between tempered and pure scales twenty two but even so there is a far more potent reason why the whole step scale will probably never become popular as the major and minor scales now are viz the fact that it offers no possibility of inculcating tonality feeling which has always been the basis of even the simplest primitive music Tonality scales give rise to a feeling of alternate periods of contraction and relaxation an active tone or chord followed by a passive one but no such effect is possible in the whole step scale and it seems suitable therefore only for that class of music whose outlines are purposely intended to be vague and indefinite the impressionistic style of music writing Footnote twenty two Recent tests in Germany seem to prove conclusively that the tempered scale is the scale ordinarily employed by both vocalists and players on stringed instruments and that the ideal of and agitation for a pure i e untempered scale in vocal and in string music is somewhat of a myth CHAPTER IX AUXILIARY WORDS AND ENDINGS ninety six Being a list of articles adverbs conjunctions prepositions and endings often utilized in compounding terms relating to musical effects A preposition variously translated to at for by in with towards A cappella in church style A capriccio at the fancy of the performer A deux mains for two hands A mezza voce with half voice A la or alla in the manner of Alla marcia in the style of a march Assai very or very much Allegro assai very fast Ben well Ben marcato

Opposite of ensemble Sub under or lower Sub dominant the under dominant Tanto same as troppo q v Tre three Tre corde three strings Tres very Tres vivement very lively Troppo too much Non tanto allegro or non troppo allegro not too fast Una un uno one or a Una corda one string Un peu a little A working knowledge of these auxiliary terms will aid the student greatly in arriving at the meaning of hundreds of terms without stopping to look up each individual one CHAPTER X MEASURE ninety seven From the standpoint of the eye a measure is that portion of the staff found between two bars in certain cases this space may be less than a measure as e g at the beginning and end of a movement but from the standpoint of the ear a single isolated measure is not possible and the term must therefore be defined in the plural form Measures are similarly accented groups of evenly spaced beats each group having at least one accented and one non accented beat 
3235_11599_000005_000001	train-clean-100	The strongest accent falls normally on the first beat in the measure 
3235_11599_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Two essential characteristics are involved in the ordinary musical measure 
3235_11599_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 one A group of even beats or pulses always felt though not always actually sounded one or more of these beats being stronger than the rest 
none	none	two Certain rhythmic figures Illustration et cetera which form the actual musical content of these groups 
3235_11599_000009_000000	train-clean-100	The student will note the essential difference between rhythm and measure 
3235_11599_000009_000001	train-clean-100	Rhythm is the regular recurrence of accent in a series of beats or pulses while measure is the grouping of these beats according to some specified system 
none	none	In listening to a piece of music two hearers A and B may feel the rhythm equally strongly but A may subjectively group the beats into one two one two et cetera while B feels the groups as one two three four one two three four et cetera 
3235_11599_000009_000003	train-clean-100	Rhythm is thus seen to be a fundamental thing inherent in the music itself while measure is to a certain extent at least an arbitrary grouping which musicians have adopted for practical purposes 
none	none	ninety eight In syncopation the normal system of accenting is temporarily suspended and the accented tone falls on the regularly unaccented part of the measure Syncopation may therefore be defined as the temporary interruption of a normal series of accents i e accenting a beat that is usually not accented Thus e g in Fig fifty six measure one has the regular system of accents normally found in four quarter measure strong accent on one secondary accent on three but measure three has only one accent and it falls on the second beat Illustration Fig fifty six ninety nine Measures are usually classified as simple and compound A simple measure is one which has but a single accent i e the measure cannot be divided into smaller constituent groups 
3235_11599_000012_000003	train-clean-100	There are two main classes of simple measures two beat measure and three beat measure 
none	none	A compound measure is as its name implies one made up by combining two or more simple measures or by the elaboration of a single measure in slow tempo into several constituent groups 
3235_11599_000012_000005	train-clean-100	The principal compound measures are four beat and six beat both being referred to as compound duple measures 
3235_11599_000012_000006	train-clean-100	Five beat seven beat nine beat and twelve beat measures are also classified as compound measures 
none	none	An English writer twenty three classifies measures as duple triple or quadruple specifying that a simple measure is one in which each beat is represented by a note whose value can be divided into halves Illustration et cetera and that a compound measure is one in which each beat is represented by a dotted note whose value can be divided into three parts Illustration There is thus seen to be considerable difference of opinion as to the meaning of the words simple and compound when applied in this connection the principal question at issue being whether four beat measure is an individual variety or whether it is a variety compounded out of two beat measures either by placing two of these in a group or by the elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats as is often necessary in slow tempi 
3235_11599_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Perhaps the easiest way out of the difficulty is to admit that both may be true but in different compositions 
none	none	That is it is frequently impossible to tell whether a composition that is being listened to is in two beat or in four beat measure and yet it is sometimes possible so to discriminate 
3235_11599_000013_000003	train-clean-100	Since however one cannot in the majority of cases distinguish between two beat and four beat measures it will probably be best to leave the original classification intact and regard four beat measure as a compound variety 
none	none	Footnote twenty three Pearse Rudiments of Musical Knowledge p thirty seven one hundred The commonest varieties of measure are one Duple sometimes called even measure or even time in which there are two beats the first one being accented Examples of duple measure are two four two eight two two two quarter twenty four two eighth and two half measure respectively Footnote twenty four For explanation of terminology see p forty eight Sec one hundred six two Triple the old perfect measure in which there are three beats the first one being accented the second and third unaccented Examples are three eight three four three two three eighth three quarter and three half measure respectively three Quadruple in which there are four beats the first and third being accented primary accent on one secondary accent on three the second and fourth unaccented See note above under Sec ninety nine four Sextuple in which there are six beats the first and fourth being accented the others not 
3235_11599_000020_000002	train-clean-100	In rapid tempi this is always taken as compound duple measure a dotted quarter note having a beat 
none	none	It will be noted that the two measures Illustration are identical in effect with Illustration one hundred one Other varieties of measure sometimes found are nine eight and twelve eight but these are practically always taken as three beat and four beat measures respectively being equivalent to these if each group of three tones is thought of as a triplet Illustration is identical in effect with Illustration one hundred two Quintuple five beat and septuple seven beat measures are occasionally met with but these are rare and will always be sporadic The five beat measure is taken as a combination of three and two or of two and three sometimes a mixture of both in the same composition while the seven beat measure is taken in groups of four and three or of three and four one hundred three The sign common time symbol is usually understood to mean four quarter measure and the sign cut time symbol two half measure but usage varies somewhat and the second sign is sometimes used to indicate four half measure It may safely be said however that the sign cut time symbol always indicates that a half note has a beat Double cut time symbol may occasionally be found indicating four half measure but this is rare The student will note that the sign common time symbol is not a letter C but an incomplete circle differentiating two beat imperfect measure from three beat perfect measure See Appendix A p one hundred six Transcriber s Note page number missing in original CHAPTER XI TEMPO one hundred four The word time in musical nomenclature has been greatly abused having been used to indicate one Rhythm as the time was wrong two Variety of measure signature as two four time three Rate of speed as the time was too slow To obviate the confusion naturally resulting from this three fold and inexact use of the word many teachers of music are adopting certain changes in terminology as noted in Sections one hundred five one hundred six and one hundred seven Such changes may cause some confusion at first but seem to be necessary if our musical terminology is to be at all exact one hundred five The first of the changes mentioned in the above paragraph is to substitute the word rhythm for the word time when correcting mistakes involving misplaced accent et cetera E g Your rhythm in the third measure of the lower score was wrong instead of Your time was wrong one hundred six The second change mentioned would eliminate such blind and misleading expressions as two four time three four time four four time six eight time et cetera and substitute therefor such self explanatory designations as two quarter measure three quarter measure four quarter measure six eighth measure et cetera E g The first movement of the Beethoven Sonata Op two No three is in four quarter measure one hundred seven The third change referred to above would substitute the word tempo plural tempi for the word time in all allusions to rate of speed E g The scherzo was played in very rapid tempo The word tempo has been used in this connection so long by professional musicians that there can be no possible objection to it on the ground of its being a foreign word In fact there is a decided advantage in having a word that is understood in all countries where modern music i e civilized music is performed and just here is found the principal reason for the popularity of the Italian language in musical terminology Schumann MacDowell and other well known composers have tried to break down this popularity by using their own respective vernaculars in both tempo and dynamic indications but in spite of these attempts the Italian language is still quite universally used for this purpose and deservedly so for if we are to have a music notation that is universal so that an American is able to play music written by a Frenchman or a German or a Russian then we ought also to have a certain number of expressions referring to tempo et cetera which will be understood by all i e a music terminology that is universal The Italian language was the first in the field is the most universally known in this particular at the present time and is entirely adequate It should therefore be retained in use as a sort of musical Esperanto one hundred eight There are several ways of finding the correct tempo of a composition one From the metronomic indication found at the beginning of many compositions Thus e g the mark M M ninety two Maelzel s Metronome ninety two means that if the metronome either Maelzel s or some other reliable make is set with the sliding weight at the figure ninety two there will be ninety two clicks per minute and they will serve to indicate to the player or singer the rate at which the beats or pulses should follow one another This is undoubtedly the most accurate means of determining tempi in spite of slight inaccuracies in metronomes twenty five and of the mistakes which composers themselves often make in giving metronomic indications Footnote twenty five To test the accuracy of a metronome set the weight at sixty and see if it beats seconds If it gives more than sixty two or sixty three or less than fifty seven or fifty eight clicks per minute it will not be of much service in giving correct tempi and should be taken to a jeweller to be regulated two Another means of determining the tempo of a composition is to play it at different tempi and then to choose the one that feels right for that particular piece of music This is perhaps the best means of getting at the correct tempo but is open only to the musician of long experience sure judgment and sound scholarship three A third method of finding tempi is through the interpretation of certain words used quite universally by composers to indicate the approximate rate of speed and the general mood of compositions The difficulty with this method is that one can hardly find two composers who employ the same word to indicate the same tempo so that no absolute rate of speed can be indicated and in the last analysis the conductor or performer must fall back on the second method cited above i e individual judgment one hundred nine In spite of the inexactness of use in the case of expressions relating to tempo these expressions are nevertheless extremely useful in giving at least a hint of what was in the composer s mind as he conceived the music that we are trying to interpret Since a number of the terms overlap in meaning and since the meaning of no single term is absolute these expressions relating to tempo are best studied in groups Perhaps the most convenient grouping is as follows one Grave lit weighty serious larghissimo adagissimo and lentissimo indicating the very slowest tempo used in rendering music two Largo twenty six adagio twenty seven and lento indicating quite a slow tempo Footnote twenty six Largo larghetto et cetera are derivatives of the Latin word largus meaning large broad Footnote twenty seven Adagio means literally at ease three Larghetto i e a little largo and adagietto a little adagio a slow tempo but not quite so slow as largo et cetera four Andante going or walking as contrasted with running and andantino indicating a moderately slow tempo Andantino is now quite universally taken slightly faster than andante in spite of the fact that if andante means going and if ino is the diminutive ending then andantino means going less i e more slowly five Moderato a moderate tempo six Allegro and allegretto twenty eight a moderately quick tempo allegretto being usually interpreted as meaning a tempo somewhat slower than allegro Footnote twenty eight There has been some difference of opinion as to which of these two terms indicates the more rapid tempo an analysis tells us that if allegro means quick and if etto is the diminutive ending then allegretto means a little quick i e slower than allegro These two terms are however so closely allied in meaning that a dispute over the matter is a mere waste of breath The word allegro means literally happy joyous and this literal meaning is still sometimes applicable but in the majority of instances the term refers only to rate of speed seven Vivo vivace lit lively a tempo between allegro and presto eight Presto prestissimo vivacissimo and prestissimo possibile the most rapid tempo possible CHAPTER XII TEMPO Continued one hundred ten Innumerable combinations of the words defined in Sec one hundred nine with one another and with other words occur Some of these combinations with their approximate meanings follow The meaning of any such expression not found in the list may usually be arrived at by consulting the terms defined in paragraph one hundred nine and recalling the use of certain auxiliary terms quoted in Chapter IX Largo assai very slow Largo di molto very slow Largo ma non troppo slow but not too slow Largo un poco slow but not so slow as largo Cf larghetto Lentemente slowly Lentando with increasing slowness Tres lentement very slowly Lentissamente very slowly Lentissamamente very slowly Lento assai very slowly Lento a capriccio slowly but capriciously Lento di molto very slowly Andante affettuoso moderately slow and with tenderness and pathos Transcriber s Note Corrected error affetuoso in original Andante amabile moderately slow and lovingly Andante cantabile moderately slow and in singing style Andante grazioso moderately slow and gracefully Andante maestoso moderately slow and majestically Andante con moto slightly faster than andante Andante ma non troppo not too slowly Andante pastorale moderately slow and in simple and unaffected style lit rural pastoral Andante quasi allegro almost as rapid in tempo as allegro lit an andante in the style of allegro Andante sostenuto moderately slow and sustained Allegrissimo much faster than allegro The superlative degree of allegro Allegro agitato a moderately rapid tempo and in agitated style Allegro appassionata a moderately rapid tempo and in passionate style Allegro assai very allegro faster than allegro Allegro commodo a conveniently rapid tempo Allegro con brio an allegro played in brilliant style Faster than allegro Allegro con fuoco an allegro played with fire i e with extreme animation Faster than allegro Allegro con spirito an allegro performed with spirit Allegro con moto faster than allegro Allegro di bravura an allegro performed in brilliant style i e demanding great skill in execution Allegro furioso furiously quicker than allegro very brilliant Allegro giusto an allegro movement but in exact rhythm Allegro ma grazioso an allegro played in graceful style Allegro ma non tanto an allegro movement but not too rapid Allegro ma non troppo an allegro movement but not too rapid Allegro ma non presto an allegro movement but not too rapid Allegro moderato slower than allegro Allegro vivace faster than allegro Presto assai as rapidly as possible Presto ma non troppo a presto movement but not too rapid one hundred eleven There are certain terms which indicate a modification of the normal tempo of a movement these being divided into two classes a those terms which indicate in general a slower tempo and b those which indicate in general a more rapid tempo The further subdivisions of these two classes are shown below a Terms indicating a slower tempo one Terms indicating a gradual retard Ritenente rit ritenuto rit ritardando rit rallentando rall slentando two Terms indicating a tempo which is to become definitely slower at once Piu lento lit more slowly meno mosso lit less movement three Terms indicating a slower tempo combined with an increase in power Largando allargando These words are both derived from largo meaning large broad For terms indicating both slower tempo and softer tone see page fifty nine Sec one hundred twenty seven The student should note the difference between groups one and two as given above the terms in group one indicate that each measure and even each pulse in the measure is a little slower than the preceding one while such terms as piu lento and meno mosso indicate a rate of speed becoming instantly slower and extending over an entire phrase or passage Some composers e g Beethoven and Couperin have evidently had this same distinction in mind between rallentando and ritardando on the one hand and ritenuto and ritenente on the other considering the former rall and rit to indicate a gradually slackening speed and the latter ritenuto and ritenente to indicate a definitely slower rate The majority of composers do not however differentiate between them in this way and it will therefore hardly be worth while for the student to try to remember the distinction b Terms indicating a more rapid tempo one Terms indicating a gradual acceleration Accelerando affrettando Transcriber s Note Corrected misspelling affretando in original this term implies some degree of excitement also stringendo poco a poco animato two Terms indicating a tempo which is to become definitely faster at once Piu allegro piu tosto piu mosso stretto un poco animato one hundred twelve After any modification in tempo either faster or slower has been suggested it is usual to indicate a return to the normal rate by some such expression as a tempo lit in time a tempo primo lit in the first time tempo primo or tempo one hundred thirteen Tempo rubato or a tempo rubato means literally in robbed time i e duration taken from one measure or beat and given to another but in modern practice the term is quite generally applied to any irregularity of rhythm or tempo not definitely indicated in the score The terms ad libitum ad lib a piacere and a capriccio also indicate a modification of the tempo at the will of the performer Ad libitum means at liberty a piacere at pleasure and a capriccio at the caprice of the performer one hundred fourteen The term tempo giusto is the opposite of tempo rubato and of the other terms defined in paragraph one hundred thirteen It means literally in exact time Tempo giusto is sometimes translated quite rapidly twenty nine but this is very unusual Footnote twenty nine Bussler Elements of Notation and Harmony p seventy six one hundred fifteen L istesso tempo means at the same rate of speed E g when a measure signature changes from two four to six eight with a change in beat note from a quarter to a dotted quarter but with the same tempo carried through the entire movement one hundred sixteen Tenuto ten indicates that a tone or chord is to be held to its full value This word is sometimes used after a staccato passage to show that the staccato effect is to be discontinued but is often used merely as a warning not to slight a melody tone i e to give it its full value one hundred seventeen Veloce means swiftly and is applied to brilliant passages e g cadenzas which are to be played as rapidly as possible without much regard for measure rhythm The words rapidamente brillante and volante flying have the same meaning as veloce one hundred eighteen The following expressions referring to tempo are also in common use but cannot easily be classified with any of the groups already defined Con moto with motion i e not too slow Pesante slowly heavily Doppio movimento twice as rapid as before Tempo ordinario in ordinary tempo Tempo commodo in convenient tempo Sempre lento malinconico assai always slowly and in a very melancholy style Animando animato con anima with animation Agitato agitated one hundred nineteen Tempo di marcia is given by Riemann Dictionary of Music p seven hundred eighty three as equivalent to andante M M seventy two eighty four The same writer gives tempo di menuetto as equivalent to allegretto and tempo di valso as equivalent to allegro moderato which he regards as indicating a more rapid tempo than allegretto CHAPTER XIII DYNAMICS one hundred twenty The word dynamics cf dynamic the opposite of static as used in the nomenclature of music has to do with the various degrees of power i e the comparative loudness and softness of tones As in the case of words referring to tempo the expressions referring to dynamics are always relative never absolute it is possible to indicate that one measure is to be louder than another but it is not possible nor desirable to indicate exactly how loud either is to be Thus dynamics perhaps even more than tempo will be seen to depend on the taste of the performer or conductor The following words referring to dynamics are in common use Pianisissimo ppp as softly as possible It will be noted that this is a sort of hyper superlative of piano Pianissimo pp very softly The superlative of piano Piano p softly Mezzo piano mp medium softly Mezzo forte mf medium loudly Forte f loudly lit strong Fortissimo ff very loudly The superlative of forte Fortisissimo fff as loudly as possible The lack of a one word comparative degree in the case of both piano and forte seems to necessitate the hyper superlative degree as given above but the practice of using four or even five p s or f s is not desirable one hundred twenty one The terms defined in Sec one hundred twenty are often combined with others as e g Pianissimo possibile as softly as possible Piano assai very softly Fortissimo possibile as loudly as possible Forte piano fp loud followed at once by soft As in the case of terms relating to tempo the meaning of many other expressions relating to dynamics may easily be arrived at by recalling the list of auxiliary terms quoted under Sec ninety six one hundred twenty two The terms sforzando forzando sforzato and forzato all indicate a strong accent on a single tone or chord These words are abbreviated as follows sf fz and sfz the abbreviation being placed directly above sometimes below the note or chord affected The signs vertical accent symbol and horizontal accent symbol are also commonly used to indicate such an accent In interpreting these accent marks the student must bear in mind again the fact that they have a relative rather than an absolute meaning the mark sf occurring in the midst of a piano passage will indicate a much milder form of accent than would the same mark occurring in the midst of a forte passage one hundred twenty three The words rinforzando and rinforzato abb rinf and rfz mean literally reinforced and are used to indicate a sudden increase in power usually extending over an entire phrase or passage instead of applying only to a single tone or chord as in the case of sforzando et cetera one hundred twenty four Crescendo abb cresc or crescendo symbol means a gradual increase in power It will be noted that this word does not mean loud nor does it mean a sudden increase in power unless accompanied by some auxiliary term such as subito or molto Broadly speaking there are two varieties of crescendo one that in which the same tone increases in power while being prolonged two that in which succeeding tones are each sounded more strongly than the preceding one The first variety is possible only on instruments giving forth a tone which can be varied after it begins Thus e g the human voice the violin the organ enclosed in a swell box and certain wind instruments are all capable of sounding a tone softly at first and gradually increasing the volume until the maximal point of power has been reached But on the piano organ not enclosed in a swell box kettle drum et cetera the power of the tone cannot be varied after the tone has once been sounded and a crescendo effect is therefore possible only in a passage in rendering which each succeeding tone is struck more forcibly than its immediate predecessor This second variety of crescendo offers a means of dramatic effect which may be employed most strikingly as e g when a long passage begins very softly and increases in power little by little until the utmost resources of the instrument or orchestra have been reached A notable example of such an effect is found in the transition from the third to the fourth movements of the Beethoven Fifth Symphony The difference between sforzando rinforzando and crescendo should now be noted sforzando indicates that a single tone or chord is to be louder rinforzando that an entire passage is to be louder beginning with its first tone but crescendo indicates that there is to be a gradual increase in power this increase sometimes occurring during the sounding of a single tone but more often in a passage one hundred twenty five Certain combinations of the word crescendo with other words are so common that they should be especially noted Among these are Crescendo al fortissimo keep on gradually increasing in power until the fortissimo or very loud point has been reached Crescendo subito increase in power suddenly or rapidly Crescendo poco a poco increase in power very very gradually Crescendo poi diminuendo first increase then diminish the tone Crescendo e diminuendo same as cresc poi dim Crescendo molto increase in power very greatly Crescendo ed animando poco a poco growing gradually louder in tone and quicker in tempo Crescendo ed affrettando gradually louder and faster Transcriber s Note Corrected misspelling affretando in original Crescendo poco a poco sin al fine crescendo gradually even up to the very end one hundred twenty six Decrescendo decresc or decrescendo symbol means a gradual diminishing of the tone It is the opposite of crescendo The word diminuendo is synonymous with decrescendo Decrescendo or diminuendo al pianissimo means decrease gradually in power until the pianissimo or very soft point is reached one hundred twenty seven A number of terms referring to both softer tone and slower tempo are in use The most common of these are mancando moriente thirty morendo perdendo from perdere to lose perdendosi calando and smorzando thirty one Such expressions are usually translated gradually dying away Footnote thirty Both moriente and morendo mean literally dying Footnote thirty one From smorzare It to extinguish one hundred twenty eight In piano music the abbreviation Ped indicates that the damper pedal the one at the right is to be depressed while the sign damper release symbol shows that it is to be released In many modern editions this depression and release of the damper pedal are more accurately indicated by the sign damper symbol The term senza sordini is also occasionally found in old editions indicating that the damper pedal is to be depressed while con sordini shows that it is to be released These expressions are taken from a usage in music for stringed instruments in which the term con sordini means that the mute a small clamp of metal ivory or hardwood is to be affixed to the bridge this causing a modification in both power and quality of the tone The damper on the piano does not in any way correspond to the mute thus used on stringed instruments and the terms above explained as sometimes occurring in piano music are not to be recommended even though Beethoven used them in this sense in all his earlier sonatas one hundred twenty nine The words una corda lit one string indicate that the soft pedal the one at the left is to be depressed while the words tre corde lit three strings or tutte le corde all the strings show that the same pedal is to be released These expressions refer to the fact that on grand pianos the soft pedal when depressed moves the hammers to one side so that instead of striking three strings they strike only two in the older pianos only one hence una corda all three strings tre corde being struck again after the release of the pedal one hundred thirty Other terms relating either directly or indirectly to the subject of dynamics are Con alcuna licenza with some degree of license Con amore with tenderness Con bravura with boldness Con celerita with rapidity Con delicato with delicacy Con energico with energy Con espressione with expression Con forza with force Con fuoco with fire and passion Con grand espressione with great expression Con grazia with grace Con melinconia with melancholy Transcriber s Note archaic form of malinconia Con passione with passion Con spirito with spirit Con tenerezza with tenderness Delicato delicately Dolce sweetly gently Dolcissimo most sweetly Dolce e cantabile gently and with singing tone Dolente Doloroso plaintively or sorrowfully Espressivo expressively Grandioso grandly pompously Grazioso gracefully Giocoso humorously cf jocose Giojoso joyfully cf joyous Lacrimando lacrimoso sorrowfully Legato smoothly Leggiero lightly Leggierissimo most lightly almost a staccato Lusingando caressingly coaxingly tenderly Maesta maestoso majestically Martellando martellato strongly accented lit hammered Marziale martial war like Mesto pensively Mezzo voce with half voice Misterioso mysteriously Parlando well accented or enunciated applied to melody playing The word parlando means literally speaking Pastorale in simple and unaffected style lit pastoral rural Pomposo pompously Precipitoso precipitously Recitativo well enunciated This meaning applies only in instrumental music in which a melody is to stand out above the accompaniment For def of recitative in vocal music see p seventy eight Risoluto firmly resolutely Scherzando scherzoso et cetera jokingly These terms are derived from the word scherzo meaning a musical joke Semplice simply Sempre marcatissimo always well marked i e strongly accented Sentimento with sentiment Solenne solemn Sotto voce in subdued voice Spiritoso with spirit Strepitoso precipitously Tranquillo tranquilly Tristamente sadly one hundred thirty one Many other terms are encountered which on their face sometimes seem to be quite formidable but which yield readily to analysis Thus e g crescendo poco a poco al forte ed un pochettino accelerando is seen to mean merely increase gradually to forte and accelerate a very little bit A liberal application of common sense will aid greatly in the interpretation of such expressions CHAPTER XIV TERMS RELATING TO FORMS AND STYLES one hundred thirty two A form in music is a specific arrangement of the various parts of a composition resulting in a structure so characteristic that it is easily recognized by the ear Thus e g although every fugue is different from all other fugues in actual material yet the arrangement of the various parts is so characteristic that no one who knows the fugue form has any doubt as to what kind of a composition he is hearing whenever a fugue is played The word form is therefore seen to be somewhat synonymous with the word plan as used in architecture it is the structure or design underlying music Examples of form are the canon the fugue the sonata et cetera Speaking broadly we may say that form in any art consists in the placing together of certain parts in such relations of proportion and symmetry as to make a unified whole In music this implies unity of tonality and of general rhythmic effect as well as unity in the grouping of the various parts of the work phrases periods movements so as to weld them into one whole giving the impression of completeness to the hearer one hundred thirty three The primal basis of form is the repetition of some characteristic effect and the problem of the composer is to bring about these repetitions in such a way that the ear will recognize them as being the same material and will nevertheless not grow weary of them This is accomplished by varying the material cf thematic development by introducing contrasting material and by choice of key one hundred thirty four The student should note at the outset of this topic the difference in meaning between the terms form and style A form is a plan for building a certain definite kind of composition but a style is merely a manner of writing Thus e g the fugue is a form i e it is a plan which although capable of variation in details is yet carried out fairly definitely in every case but counterpoint is merely a style or manner of writing just as Gothic architecture is a style of building which may be cast into any one of several forms one hundred thirty five The material found in the following sections is an attempt to explain in simple language certain terms relating to forms and styles which are in common use in many cases the definition is too meagre to give anything but a very general idea but it is hoped that the student will at least be set to thinking and that he will eventually be led to a more detailed and scholarly study of the subject The article Form and the separate articles under each term here defined as found in Grove s Dictionary are especially recommended For examples of the various forms described see also Mason and Surette The Appreciation of Music Supplementary Volume one hundred thirty six In a very general way there may be said to be two styles of musical composition the monophonic or homophonic the one voiced and the polyphonic the many voiced The polyphonic thirty two style antedates the monophonic historically Footnote thirty two Polyphonic music flourished from one thousand A D to about seventeen fifty A D the culmination of the polyphonic period being reached in the music of Johann Sebastian Bach sixteen eighty five seventeen fifty Haydn Mozart Beethoven and the later writers have used the monophonic style more than the polyphonic although a combination of the two is often found as e g in the later works of Beethoven one hundred thirty seven In monophonic music there is one voice which has a pronounced melody the other voices if present supporting this melody as a harmonic and often rhythmic background An example of this is the ordinary hymn tune with its melody in the highest part and with three other voices forming a four part harmony The sonata symphony opera modern piano piece et cetera are also largely monophonic though polyphonic passages by way of contrast are often to be found one hundred thirty eight In polyphonic music each voice is to a certain extent melodically interesting and the harmony is the result of combining several melodies in such a way as to give a pleasing effect instead of treating a melody by adding chords as an accompaniment or support Counterpoint canon round fugue et cetera are all polyphonic in style The word contrapuntal is often used synonymously with polyphonic Sections one hundred thirty nine to one hundred forty three relate especially to terms describing polyphonic music one hundred thirty nine Counterpoint is the art of adding one or more parts or melodies to a given melody the latter being known as the cantus firmus or subject It may therefore be broadly defined as the art of combining melodies The word counterpoint comes from the three words punctus contra punctum meaning point against point The word point as here used refers to the punctus one of the neumae of the mediaeval system these neumae being the immediate predecessors of modern notes Both vocal and instrumental music have been written in contrapuntal style The familiar two and three part inventions by Bach are excellent examples of instrumental counterpoint while such choruses as those in The Messiah by Handel illustrate the highest type of vocal counterpoint one hundred forty Imitation is the repetition by one part of a subject or theme previously introduced by another part If the imitation is exact the term strict imitation is applied but if only approximate then the term free imitation is used in referring to it The repetition need not have the exact pitches of the subject in order to be strict on the contrary the imitation is usually at the interval of an octave or a fifth or a second et cetera Fig fifty seven shows an example of strict imitation in which the third part comes in an octave lower than the first part one hundred forty one A canon is a contrapuntal composition in the style of strict imitation one part repeating exactly but at any interval what another part has played or sung The term canonic style is sometimes applied to music in which the imitation is not exact An example of three part canon is given in Fig fifty seven Illustration CANON IN THREE VOICES IN THE UNISON AND OCTAVE Fig fifty seven MOZART The word canon means law and was applied to this particular form of composition because the rules relating to its composition were invariable It is because of this non flexibility that the canon is so little used as a form at the present time the modern composer demands a plan of writing that is capable of being varied to such an extent as to give him room for the exercise of his own particular individuality of conception and this the canon does not do For this same reason too the fugue and the sonata have successively gone out of fashion and from Schumann down to the present time composers have as it were created their own forms the difficulty in listening arising from the fact that no one but the composer himself could recognize the form as a form because it had not been adopted to a great enough extent by other composers to make it in any sense universal The result is that in much present day music it is very difficult for the hearer to discover any trace of familiar design and the impression made by such music is in consequence much less definite than that made by music of the classic school It is probable that a reaction from this state of affairs will come in the near future for in any art it is necessary that there should be at least enough semblance of structure to make the art work capable of standing as a universal thing rather than as the mere temporary expression of some particular composer or of some period of composition one hundred forty two The common school round is an example of canon each voice repeating exactly what the first voice has sung while this first voice is going on with its melody The round is therefore defined as a variety of canon in which the imitation is always in unison with the subject one hundred forty three The fugue Latin fuga flight is a form of contrapuntal composition in which the imitation is always in the dominant key i e a fifth above or a fourth below The imitation called the answer may be an exact repetition of the subject sometimes called the question but is usually not so The fugue differs from the canon also in that the subject is given in complete form before the answer begins while in the canon the imitation begins while the subject is still going on The fugue is not nearly so strict in form as the canon and gives the composer much greater opportunity for expressing musical ideas A canon may be perfect in form and yet be very poor music this same statement might of course be made about any form but is especially true in the stricter ones CHAPTER XV TERMS RELATING TO FORMS AND STYLES Continued Sections one hundred forty four to one hundred sixty relate particularly to terms used in descriptions of monophonic music thirty three Footnote thirty three There is a very pronounced disagreement among theorists as to what terms are to be used in referring to certain forms and parts of forms and it seems impossible to make a compromise that will satisfy even a reasonable number In order to make the material in this chapter consistent with itself therefore it has been thought best by the author to follow the terminology of some single recognized work on form and the general plan of monophonic form here given is therefore that of the volume called Musical Form by Bussler Cornell one hundred forty four A phrase is a short musical thought at least two measures in length closing with either a complete or an incomplete cadence The typical phrase is four measures long The two measure phrase is often called section The word phrase as used in music terminology corresponds with the same word as used in language study one hundred forty five A period is a little piece of music typically eight measures long either complete in itself or forming one of the clearly defined divisions of a larger form The period when complete in itself is the smallest monophonic form The essential characteristic of the regular period is the fact that it usually consists of two balanced phrases often called antecedent and consequent or thesis and antithesis the first phrase giving rise to the feeling of incompleteness by means of a cadence in another key deceptive cadence et cetera the second phrase giving the effect of completeness by means of a definite cadence at the close The second half of the period is sometimes a literal repetition of the first half in all respects except the cadence but in many cases too it is a repetition of only one of the elements rhythm intervals or general outline Figs fifty eight and fifty nine show examples of both types The principle almost invariably holds that the simpler the music cf folk tunes the more obvious the form of the period while the more complex the music the less regular the period Illustration Fig fifty eight MOZART Illustration Fig fifty nine SCHUBERT one hundred forty six The primary forms are built up by combining two or more periods The small two part primary form often called song form or Lied form consists of two periods so placed that the second constitutes a consequent or antithesis to the first The second half of this second period is often exactly the same as the second half of the first period thus binding the two periods together into absolute unity The theme of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony Beethoven quoted below is a perfect example of this form Other examples are Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes and The Last Rose of Summer Illustration BEETHOVEN The small three part primary form is like the two part primary form except that it has a section of contrasting material interpolated between the two periods This middle part is usually an eight measure phrase The large two and three part primary forms usually have sixteen measure periods instead of eight measure ones but are otherwise similar in construction These various primary forms are used in constructing many varieties of compositions among them the theme and variations the polka the waltz the march et cetera as well as most of the shorter movements in sonatas quartets et cetera They are used in vocal music also but are less apt to be regular here because the form of vocal music is largely dependent upon the structure of the text one hundred forty seven A theme is a fragment of melody used as the subject of a fugue as the basis of the development section in sonata form et cetera Sometimes it is a complete tune often in period form on which variations are made as e g in the familiar theme and variations one hundred forty eight Thematic development consists in taking a short theme or several short themes and by means of transposition interval expansion and contraction rhythmic augmentation and diminution inversion tonality changes et cetera building out of it a lengthy composition or section of a composition Fig sixty b c d e and f show how the theme given in Fig sixty a may be varied in a few of these ways There are hundreds of other fashions in which this same theme might be varied without destroying its identity For other examples of thematic development see the development section of Sonata Op thirty one No three as analyzed in Appendix E Transcriber s Note Corrected error Sec three in original Illustration Fig sixty For further illustrations of development in the case of this same theme see Christiani The Principles of Expression in Pianoforte playing p one hundred forty four ff from which the foregoing themes have been adapted one hundred forty nine A rondo is an instrumental composition in homophonic style in which a certain theme appears several times almost always in the same form i e not thematically varied the repetitions of this theme being separated by contrasting material The rondo is the oldest of the larger monophonic forms and has been used in many different ways but perhaps its most characteristic construction is as follows one Principal subject two second subject in dominant key three principal subject four third subject five first subject again six second subject in tonic key seven coda or ending The student should note particularly the problem of repetition and contrast mentioned in Sec one hundred thirty four as here worked out as the rondo was the first monophonic form in which this matter was at all satisfactorily solved and its construction is especially interesting because it is readily seen to be one of the direct predecessors of the highest form of all the sonata Examples of rondos may be found in any volume of sonatas or sonatinas one hundred fifty A suite is a set of instrumental dances all in the same or in nearly related keys The first dance is usually preceded by an introduction or prelude and the various dances are so grouped as to secure contrast of movement a quick dance being usually followed by a slower one The suite is interesting to students of the development of music as being the first form in several movements to be generally adopted by composers It retained its popularity from the beginning of the seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth centuries being finally displaced by the sonata whose immediate predecessor it is thus seen to be The suite was formerly written for solo instrument only harpsichord clavichord piano but modern composers like Dvo vr ak Lachner Moszkowski and others have written suites for full orchestra also one hundred fifty one Among the dances commonly found in suites are the following Allemande duple or quadruple measure Bolero triple measure Bouree duple or quadruple measure Chaconne triple measure Courante a very old dance in triple measure Csardas Hungarian dance in duple or quadruple measure Gavotte quadruple measure Gigue or jig duple measure Habanera Spanish dance in triple measure Minuet slow dance in triple measure Mazurka Polish dance in triple measure Polonaise Polish dance in triple measure Rigaudon lively dance in duple or triple measure Sarabande triple measure Tarantella swift Italian dance in sextuple measure The allemande is especially interesting to students of music form because of its relation to the sonata it being the prototype of the sonata allegro i e the first movement of the sonata The sarabande and courante are likewise interesting as the prototypes of the second movement and the bouree minuet et cetera for their connection with the third movement one hundred fifty two The scherzo lit musical joke is a fanciful instrumental composition It was used by Beethoven as the third movement of the sonata instead of the more limited minuet but is also often found as an independent piece one hundred fifty three A sonata is an instrumental composition of three or more movements usually four the first and last of which are almost always in rapid tempo Each of these movements is a piece of music with a unity of its own but they are all merged together in a larger whole with a broad underlying unity of larger scope The composition receives its name from the fact that its first movement is cast in sonata form See Sec one hundred fifty seven for description of sonata form When the sonata has four movements these are usually arranged as follows one A quick movement allegro presto et cetera often preceded by a slower introduction two A slow movement largo andante adagio et cetera three A minuet or scherzo often with a trio added in which case the part preceding the trio is repeated after the trio is played four A quick movement the finale sometimes a rondo sometimes another sonata form sometimes a theme with variations These movements are all in closely related keys but in a variety of contrasting rhythms one hundred fifty four A trio is a sonata for three instruments such as piano violin and cello while a quartet is a sonata for four instruments the most common quartet combination being as follows First and second violins viola and violoncello The term chamber music is often applied to instrumental music for trio quartet quintet and other similar combinations which are suitable for a small room rather than for a large concert hall The words trio and quartet are also applied to vocal works for three and four voices respectively these having no relation whatsoever to the sonata as described above The word trio is also applied to the middle section of minuets scherzas marches et cetera the term originating in the old usage of writing this part for three instruments only one hundred fifty five A concerto is a sonata for a solo instrument with orchestral accompaniment the form being usually somewhat modified so as to adapt it to a composition in which there must necessarily be opportunity for a good deal of technical display There are usually but three movements in the concerto The great majority of concertos are for piano and orchestra but examples of concertos for violin cello flute oboe and other solo instruments all with orchestral accompaniment have also been written A few modern composers have applied the term concerto to certain large organ works with no orchestral accompaniment the composition being written for just the one instrument but this use of the word is so contrary to the accepted definition that it is hardly justifiable When a concerto is played on two pianos without orchestra this does not mean that there is no orchestral part but that there is no orchestra to play it and so the parts that should be played by the orchestral instruments have simply been arranged for a second piano sometimes organ one hundred fifty six A symphony is a sonata for full orchestra In general its construction is the same as that of the sonata but it is usually of much larger proportions and has in it much greater variety of both tonal and rhythmic material The symphony is generally conceded to be the highest type of instrumental music ever evolved The symphony was accepted as a standard form in the time of Haydn seventeen thirty two eighteen oh nine and was developed enormously by Haydn himself Mozart seventeen fifty six seventeen ninety one and Beethoven seventeen seventy eighteen twenty seven reaching perhaps its highest point in the famous Nine Symphonies of the last named composer Later symphony writers whose works are at present being performed include Schumann Tschaikowsky and Dvo vr ak The word symphony was formerly used synonymously with ritornelle both words being applied to instrumental interludes between parts of vocal works but this usage has now entirely disappeared one hundred fifty seven Sonata form sometimes called sonata allegro is a plan for the construction of instrumental music sonatas quartets symphonies et cetera in which three rather definite divisions always occur the third division being a more or less literal repetition of the first These three parts of sonata form with their usual subdivisions are I EXPOSITION one Principal theme or first subject two Link episode or modulation group three Secondary theme or song group always in a nearly related key four Closing group five Coda II DEVELOPMENT SECTION Treating the themes introduced in the exposition in an almost infinite variety of fashions according to the principles of thematic development See Sec one hundred forty eight III RECAPITULATION OR REPRISE Consisting essentially of the same subdivisions found in the exposition but differing from this first section in one essential point viz that instead of stating the secondary theme in a related key the entire recapitulation is in the principal key This third section is always followed by a coda which may either be very short or quite extended bringing the whole movement to a more definite close The second part of sonata form the development section is sometimes the longest and most intricate of the three divisions and it is at this point that the composer has an opportunity of displaying to the full his originality and inventive skill It is principally because of this development section that the sonata is so far superior as a form to its predecessors For an analyzed example of sonata form see Appendix E The student is advised to take other sonatas and go through the first movements with a view to finding at least the three main divisions mentioned above In some cases the form will of course be so irregular that all the parts indicated cannot be discovered but the general outlines of the scheme will always be present one hundred fifty eight A sonatina as its name implies is a little sonata It differs from the sonata proper principally in having little or no development the second section being of slight importance as compared with the corresponding section of a sonata A grand sonata is like an ordinary sonata in form but is of unusually large dimensions one hundred fifty nine Program music is instrumental music which is supposed to convey to the listener an image or a succession of images that will arouse in him certain emotions which have been previously aroused in the composer s mind by some scene event or idea The clue to the general idea is usually given at the beginning of the music in the form of a poem or a short description of the thing in the mind of the composer but there are many examples in which there is no clue whatsoever except the title of the composition Program music represents a mean between pure music cf the piano sonata or the string quartet on the one hand and descriptive music in which actual imitations of bird calls whistles the blowing of the wind the galloping of horses the rolling of thunder et cetera occur on the other Most program music is written for the orchestra examples being Liszt s The Preludes Strauss Till Eulenspiegel et cetera one hundred sixty A symphonic poem or tone poem is an orchestral composition of large dimensions resembling the symphony in size usually embodying the program idea It has no prescribed form and seems indeed to be often characterized by an almost total lack of design but there are also examples of symphonic poems in which the same theme runs throughout the entire composition being adapted at the various points at which it occurs to the particular moods expressed by the program at those points The symphonic poem was invented by Liszt eighteen eleven eighteen eighty six and has since been used extensively by Strauss Saint Saens and others It came into existence as a part of the general movement which has caused the fugue and the sonata successively to go out of fashion viz the tendency to invent forms which would not hamper the composer in any way but would leave him absolutely free to express his ideas in his own individual way CHAPTER XVI TERMS RELATING TO VOCAL MUSIC one hundred sixty one An anthem is a sacred choral composition usually based on Biblical or liturgical thirty four words It may or may not have an instrumental accompaniment and is usually written in four parts but may have five six eight or more Footnote thirty four A liturgy is a prescribed form or method of conducting a religious service and the parts sung in such a service as e g the holy communion baptism et cetera are referred to as the musical liturgy The word anthem is derived from antifona or antiphona meaning a psalm or hymn sung responsively i e antiphonally by two choirs or by choir and congregation A full anthem is one containing no solo parts a solo anthem is one in which the solo part is predominant over the chorus while a verse anthem is one in which the chorus parts alternate with passages for concerted solo voices i e trios quartets et cetera one hundred sixty two A capella sometimes spelled cappella or alla capella music is part singing either sacred or secular without accompaniment This term means literally in chapel style and refers to the fact that in the early days of the church all singing was unaccompanied one hundred sixty three A motet is a sacred choral composition in contrapuntal style It has no solo parts thus corresponding to the madrigal q v in secular music The motet is intended for a capella performance but is often given with organ accompaniment one hundred sixty four A choral is a hymn tune of the German Protestant Church It is usually harmonized in four voices The choral sometimes spelled chorale is described as having a plain melody a strong harmony and a stately rhythm It differs from the ordinary English and American hymn tune in being usually sung at a much slower tempo and in having a pause at the end of each line of text one hundred sixty five The mass is the liturgy for the celebration of the Lord s Supper in the service of the Roman Catholic Church As used in the terminology of music the word refers to the six hymns which are always included when a composer writes a musical mass and which form the basis of the celebration of the Communion thirty five These six hymns are as follows Footnote thirty five It should be understood that this statement refers to the service called the high mass only there being no music at all in connection with the so called low mass Kyrie Gloria including the Gratias agimus Qui tollis Quoniam Cum Sancto Spirito Credo including the Et Incarnatus Crucifixus and Et Resurrexit Sanctus including the Hosanna Benedictus Agnus Dei including the Dona nobis The requiem mass is the mass for the dead and differs considerably from the ordinary mass Both regular and requiem masses have been written by many of the great composers Bach Beethoven Verdi Gounod and in many cases these masses are so complex that they are not practicable for the actual service of the Church and are therefore performed only by large choral societies as concert works one hundred sixty six A cantata is a vocal composition for chorus and soloists the text being either sacred or secular The accompaniment may be written for piano organ or orchestra When sacred in character the cantata differs from the oratorio in being shorter and less dramatic in not usually having definite characters and in being written for church use while the oratorio is intended for concert performance When secular in subject the cantata differs from the opera in not usually having definite characters and in being always rendered without scenery or action Examples of the sacred cantata are Stainer s The Crucifixion Clough Leighter s The Righteous Branch and Gaul s The Holy City Examples of the secular cantata are Bruch s Armenius Coleridge Taylor s Hiawatha one hundred sixty seven An oratorio is a composition on a large scale for chorus soloists and orchestra the text usually dealing with some religious subject The oratorio as noted above is not intended for the church service but is written for concert performance one hundred sixty eight An opera is a composition for vocal soloists chorus and orchestra with characters action scenery and dramatic movement It is a drama set to music Grand opera is opera with a serious plot in which everything is sung there being no spoken dialog at all Opera comique is a species of opera in which part of the dialog is spoken and part sung Opera comique is not synonymous with comic opera for the plot of opera comique is as often serious as not In fact the entire distinction between the terms grand opera and opera comique is being broken down the latter term referring merely to operas first given at the Opera Comique in Paris and the former term to those given at the Grand Opera House in the same city A comic opera is a humorous opera the plot providing many amusing situations and the whole ending happily It corresponds with the comedy in literature A light opera is one with an exceedingly trivial plot in which songs dances and pretty scenery contribute to the amusement of the audience The music is lively but usually as trivial as the plot The term music drama was used by Wagner in referring to his own operas and is also sometimes applied to other modern operas in which the dramatic element is supposed to predominate over the musical one hundred sixty nine A libretto lit little book is the word text of an opera oratorio cantata or some other similar work one hundred seventy Recitative is a style of vocal solo common to operas oratorios and cantatas especially those written some time ago Its main characteristic is that the word text is of paramount importance both rhythm and tone progression being governed by rhetorical rather than by musical considerations Recitative undoubtedly originated in the intoning of the priest in the ritualistic service of the Church but when applied to the opera it became an important means of securing dramatic effects especially in situations in which the action of the play moved along rapidly Recitative is thus seen to be a species of musical declamation In the early examples of recitative there was scarcely any accompaniment often only one instrument like the cello being employed to play a sort of obbligato melody when full chords were played they were not written out in the score but were merely indicated in a more or less general way by certain signs and figures See thorough bass p eighty five Sec two hundred But about the middle of the seventeenth century a slightly different style of recitative was invented and in this type the orchestra was employed much more freely in the accompaniment especially in the parts between the phrases of the text but to some extent also to support the voice while singing This new style was called recitativo stromento i e accompanied recitative while the original type was called recitativo secco i e dry recitative During the last century the style of recitative has been still further developed by Gluck and Wagner both of whom used the orchestra as an independent entity with interesting melodies harmonies and rhythms all its own while the vocal part is a sort of obbligato to this accompaniment But even in this latest phase of recitative it is the word text that decides the style of both melody and rhythm in the voice part Fig sixty one shows an example of dry recitative taken from The Messiah Illustration ALTO VOICE Be hold a vir gin shall con ceive and bear a son and shall call his name Em man u el God with us one hundred seventy one Aria is likewise a style of vocal solo found in operas et cetera but its predominating characteristic is diametrically opposed to that of the recitative In the aria the word text is usually entirely subordinate to the melody and the latter is often very ornate containing trills runs et cetera The rendition of this ornate style of music is often referred to as coloratura singing but it should be noted that not all arias are coloratura in style The familiar solos from The Messiah Rejoice Greatly and The trumpet shall sound are good examples of the aria style one hundred seventy two A lied Ger song is a vocal solo in which the text the melody and the accompaniment contribute more or less equally to the effect of the whole Strictly speaking the word lied means a poem to be sung and this meaning will explain at once the difference between the lied on the one hand and the Italian recitative and aria on the other for in the lied the text is of great importance but the music is also interesting while in the recitative the text was important but the music very slight and in the aria the text was usually inconsequential while the music held the center of interest The most pronounced characteristic of the lied is the fact that it usually portrays a single mood sentiment or picture thus differing from the ballad which is narrative in style It will be noted that this single mood or sentiment or picture was originally conceived by the poet who wrote the word text and that the composer in writing music to this text has first tried to get at the thought of the poet and has then attempted to compose music which would intensify and make more vivid that thought This intensification of the poet s thought comes as often through the rhythm harmony and dynamics of the accompaniment as through the expressiveness of the voice part The style of song writing in which each verse is sung to the same tune is called the strophe form while that in which each verse has a different melody is often referred to as the continuous or through composed form Ger durch componiert one hundred seventy three A ballad was originally a short simple song the words being in narrative style i e the word text telling a story In the earlier ballads each verse of the poem was usually sung to the same tune strophe form but in the art ballad as developed by Loewe and others the continuous style of composition is employed this giving the composer greater opportunities of making vivid through his music the events described by the poem These later ballads are in consequence neither short nor simple but compare in structure with the lied itself one hundred seventy four A folk song is a short song sung by and usually originating among the common people Its dominant characteristic is usually simplicity this applying to word text melody and accompaniment if there is one The text of the folk song is usually based on some event connected with ordinary life but there are also many examples in which historical and legendary happenings are dealt with Auld Lang Syne and Comin thru the Rye are examples of folk songs There has been some difference of opinion as to whether a song the composer of which is known can ever constitute a real folk song recent writers seem to be taking the sensible view of the matter viz that if a song has the characteristics of a folk rather than an art song and if it remains popular for some time among the common people then it is just as much a folk song whether the composer happens to be known or not one hundred seventy five A madrigal is a secular vocal composition having from three to eight parts It is in contrapuntal style like the motet and is usually sung a capella one hundred seventy six A glee is a vocal composition in three or more parts being usually more simple in style than the madrigal and sometimes having more than one movement The glee may be either gay or sad in mood and seems to be a composition peculiar to the English people one hundred seventy seven A part song is a composition for two or more voices usually four to be sung a capella It is written in monophonic rather than in polyphonic style thus differing from the madrigal and glee Morley s Now is the Month of Maying is an example of the part song as is also Sullivan s O Hush Thee My Baby The term part song is often loosely applied to glees madrigals et cetera CHAPTER XVII RHYTHM MELODY HARMONY AND INTERVALS one hundred seventy eight The four elements commonly attributed to music in the order of their development are Rhythm Melody Harmony and Timbre or tone color one hundred seventy nine Rhythm is the regular recurrence of accent In music it is more specifically the regular recurrence of groups of accented and non accented beats or pulses according to some specified measure system Since rhythm implies continuity there must usually be at least two such measure groups in order to make musical rhythm possible See p forty four Sec ninety seven one hundred eighty A melody is a succession of single tones of various pitches so arranged that the effect of the whole will be unified coherent and pleasing to the ear The soprano part of hymn tunes and other simple harmonized compositions is often referred to as the melody one hundred eighty one Harmony is the science of chord construction and combination The term harmony refers to tones sounding simultaneously i e to chords as differentiated from tones sounding consecutively as in melody The word harmony may therefore be applied to any group of tones of different pitches sounded as a chord although specifically we usually refer to a succession of such chords when we speak of harmony It is possible to use the same combination of tones in either melody or harmony in fact these two elements as applied to modern music have developed together and the style of present day melody is directly based upon the development that has recently taken place in harmonic construction Harmony as contrasted with counterpoint first began to be an important factor in music about sixteen hundred A D i e at the time when opera and oratorio came into existence when form was established and when our modern major and minor scales were adopted Before this practically all music was composed on a contrapuntal basis one hundred eighty two Timbre is that peculiar quality of sound which enables one to distinguish a tone produced by one instrument or voice from a tone produced by an equal number of vibrations on another instrument The word timbre is synonymous with the terms quality of tone and tone quality Ger Klang farbe the excuse for using it being that it expresses adequately in one word an idea that in our language takes at least two this excuse would disappear and incidentally a much mispronounced word would be eliminated if the single word quality were to be adopted as the equivalent of timbre Thus e g the soprano voice singing c has a quality different from the contralto voice singing the same tone The remainder of this chapter and all of Chapter XVIII deal with terms commonly encountered in the study of harmony Courses in this subject usually begin with a study of scales but since this subject has already been somewhat extensively treated this chapter will omit it and will begin with the next topic in harmony study viz the interval one hundred eighty three An interval is the relation of two tones with regard to pitch If the two tones are sounded simultaneously the result is an harmonic interval but if sounded consecutively the result is a melodic interval Fig sixty two represents the pitches f and a as a harmonic interval while Fig sixty three represents the same pitches arranged as a melodic interval Illustration Fig sixty two Illustration Fig sixty three one hundred eighty four In classifying intervals two facts should be constantly kept in mind one The number name of the interval third fifth sixth et cetera is derived from the order of letters as found in the diatonic scale Thus the interval C E is a third because E is the third tone from C counting C as one in the diatonic scale C G is a fifth because G is the fifth tone above C in the diatonic scale It should be noted however that the same number names apply even though one or both letters of the interval are qualified by sharps flats et cetera Thus e g C G sharp is still a fifth as are also C sharp G flat and C flat G sharp two In determining the specific name of any interval perfect fifth major third et cetera the half step and whole step often referred to respectively as minor second and major second are used as units of measurement The half step is usually defined as the smallest usable interval between two tones Thus C C sharp is a half step as are also B C F G flat et cetera A whole step consists of two half steps C D is a whole step as are also B flat C E F sharp F sharp G sharp G flat A flat et cetera The expressions half step and whole step are much to be preferred to half tone and whole tone as being more clear and definite Thus e g the sentence The two tones are a half step apart is much better than The two tones are a half tone apart one hundred eighty five A prime is the relation between two tones whose pitches are properly represented by the same degree of the staff A perfect prime is one whose tones have the same pitch Middle C sounded by piano and violin at the same time would offer an example An augmented prime is one whose second tone is one half step higher than the first Ex C C sharp one hundred eighty six A second is the relation between two tones whose pitches are properly represented by adjacent degrees of the staff The first line and first space are adjacent degrees as are also the third line and fourth space A minor second is one comprising one half step Ex B C A major second is one comprising two half steps Ex B C sharp An augmented second is one comprising three half steps Ex F G sharp one hundred eighty seven A third is an interval comprising two seconds A diminished third has two minor seconds i e two half steps C E double flat A minor third has one minor and one major second i e three half steps C E flat A major third has two major seconds i e four half steps C E one hundred eighty eight A fourth is an interval comprising three seconds A diminished fourth has two minor and one major second C sharp F A perfect fourth has one minor and two major seconds C F An augmented fourth tritone has three major seconds C F sharp one hundred eighty nine A fifth is an interval comprising four seconds A diminished fifth has two minor and two major seconds C G flat A perfect fifth has one minor and three major seconds C G An augmented fifth has four major seconds C G sharp one hundred ninety A sixth is an interval comprising five seconds A minor sixth has two minor and three major seconds C A flat A major sixth has one minor and four major seconds C A An augmented sixth has five major seconds C A sharp one hundred ninety one A seventh is an interval comprising six seconds A diminished seventh has three minor and three major seconds C B double flat A minor seventh has two minor and four major seconds C B flat A major seventh has one minor and five major seconds C B one hundred ninety two An octave is an interval comprising seven seconds A diminished octave has three minor and four major seconds C C flat A perfect octave has two minor and five major seconds C C An augmented octave has one minor and six major seconds C C sharp one hundred ninety three A ninth is usually treated as a second a tenth as a third et cetera The interval of two octaves is often referred to as a fifteenth one hundred ninety four If the major diatonic scale be written and the interval between each tone and the key tone noted it will be observed that the intervals are all either major or perfect See Fig sixty four Illustration Fig sixty four In this connection also it will be noted that the interval next smaller than major is always minor while that next smaller than perfect or minor is always diminished but that the interval next larger than both major and perfect is augmented one hundred ninety five An interval is said to be inverted when the tone originally the upper becomes the lower Thus C E a major third inverted becomes E C a minor sixth CHAPTER XVIII CHORDS CADENCES et cetera one hundred ninety six A chord is a combination of several tones sounding together and bearing an harmonic relation to each other The simplest chord is the triad which consists of a fundamental tone called the root with the third and fifth above it C E G is a triad as are also D F A F A C and G B D one hundred ninety seven Triads are classified as major minor diminished or augmented A major triad has a major third and a perfect fifth i e it is a major third with a minor third on top of it Ex C E G A minor triad has a minor third and a perfect fifth i e it is a minor third with a major third on top of it Ex C E flat G A diminished triad has a minor third and a diminished fifth i e it is a minor third with another minor third on top of it Ex C E flat G flat An augmented triad has a major third and an augmented fifth i e it is a major third with another major third on top of it Ex C E G sharp one hundred ninety eight A triad may be built on any scale tone but those on I IV and V are used so much oftener than the others that they are often called the common chords In referring to triads the Roman numerals are used to show on what scale tone the triad is based the size of the numeral with other signs indicating the kind of triad found on each tone of the scale Thus e g the large I shows that the triad on the first tone in major is a major triad the small II shows that the triad on the second tone is minor et cetera The following figure will make this clear Illustration Fig sixty five The triads in the minor scale are as follows Illustration one hundred ninety nine A triad is said to be in fundamental position when its root is the lowest tone It is said to be in the first inversion when the third is the lowest tone and in the second inversion when the fifth is the lowest tone Thus e g in Fig sixty six the same chord C E G is arranged in three different positions at a in fundamental position at b in the first inversion and at c in the second inversion Illustration Fig sixty six two hundred When the root is not the bass note figures are sometimes used to show what chord is to be played or written Thus e g the figure six over a bass note means that the note given is the third of a chord the root being found by going up a sixth from the bass note i e the chord is to be sounded in its first inversion In the same way the figures six four indicate that the note given is the fifth of the chord the root and fifth being found by going up a sixth and a fourth from the note given i e the chord is to be sounded in its second inversion The use of these and other similar figures and signs is called figured bass or thorough bass notation An example of a figured bass is given in Fig sixty seven Illustration Fig sixty seven Thorough bass notation was formerly used extensively in writing accompaniments to vocal works the accompanist having to interpret the notes and signs given and then to make up an interesting accompaniment as he went along Much of Handel s music was written in this way but in modern editions of these works the chords have been printed in full and the signs omitted two hundred one A seventh chord consists of a fundamental tone with its third fifth and seventh The fifth is sometimes omitted A ninth chord consists of a fundamental with its third fifth seventh and ninth two hundred two A cadence is the close of a musical phrase in melody it refers to the last two tones in harmony to the last two chords The word cadence is derived from cadere a Latin word meaning to fall the reference being to the falling of the voice i e the dropping to the normal pitch at the close of a sentence two hundred three The most frequent cadence in harmony is that involving the chord on I preceded by the chord on V Because of its directness the cadence V I is called the authentic cadence two hundred four The most satisfactory form to the ear of the authentic cadence is that in which the highest voice the soprano of the final chord is the root of that chord When the final chord appears in this position the cadence is called perfect thirty six authentic and when the third or fifth of the chord appear in the soprano the cadence is called imperfect authentic Fig sixty eight shows the chord G B D cadencing to C E G in three different ways The first one a is called a perfect authentic cadence but the last two c and d are imperfect authentic Footnote thirty six Many theorists including Durand in his monumental Treatise on Harmony consider the V I cadence to be the only one which may legitimately be called perfect but the majority of writers seem to take the view that either authentic or plagal cadence may be either perfect or imperfect depending upon the soprano tone as noted above Illustration Fig sixty eight two hundred five A plagal cadence is one in which the tonic chord is preceded by the sub dominant chord IV I The plagal cadence sometimes called the church cadence or amen cadence like the authentic is described as being perfect when the soprano of the tonic chord is the root of that chord and imperfect when the soprano of the final chord is the third or fifth of that chord Fig sixty nine shows the chord F A C cadencing to C E G in three ways The first one a is called a perfect plagal cadence the last two are imperfect plagal Illustration Fig sixty nine two hundred six A half cadence occurs when the dominant chord is used as the final chord of a phrase and is immediately preceded by the tonic chord This form is used to give variety in the course of a composition but is not available at the end because it does not give a definite close in the tonic key Fig seventy shows the use of the half cadence at the close of such a phrase Illustration Fig seventy BACH two hundred seven A deceptive cadence is the progression of the dominant chord to some other chord than the tonic the word deceptive implying that the ear expects to hear V resolve to I and is deceived when it does not do so The most common form of deceptive cadence is that in which V or V seven resolves to VI It is used to give variety but as in the case of the half cadence is not available at the end of a composition Fig seventy one gives an example Illustration Fig seventy one WM MATHER two hundred eight A sequence is a succession of similar harmonic progressions these resulting from a typical or symmetrical movement of the bass part See Fig seventy two Illustration Fig seventy two The word sequence is also applied to a succession of similar melodic progressions as in Fig seventy three Illustration Fig seventy three two hundred nine Modulation is a change of key without any break in the continuity of chords or melody tones Harmonic modulations are usually effected through the medium of a chord some or all of whose tones are common to both keys Examples of both harmonic and melodic modulations are shown in Figs seventy four and seventy five Illustration Fig seventy four The chord most frequently used in modulating is the dominant seventh i e a seventh chord see Sec two hundred one on the dominant tone of the key In the key of C this chord is G B D F in the key of D it is A C sharp E G in the key of A flat it is E flat G B flat D flat et cetera Illustration Fig seventy five two hundred ten A suspension is the temporary substitution of a tone a degree higher than the regular chord tone this temporary tone being later replaced by the regular chord tone See Fig seventy six a Illustration Fig seventy six two hundred eleven A retardation is the temporary substitution of a tone a degree lower than the regular tone this tone as in the case of the suspension being later replaced by the regular chord tone See Fig seventy seven a Illustration Fig seventy seven The regular chord tone to which both suspension and retardation resolve is called the tone of resolution two hundred twelve The anticipation is a chord tone introduced just before the rest of the chord to which it belongs is sounded See Fig seventy eight a Illustration Fig seventy eight two hundred thirteen A pedal point or organ point is a tone sustained through a succession of harmonic progressions to the chords of some of which it usually belongs The term pedal point originated in organ playing where the foot on a pedal can sustain a tone while the hands are playing a succession of harmonies but as now used it may be applied to any kind of music The dominant and tonic are the tones most often used in this way See Fig seventy nine Illustration Fig seventy nine SCHUMANN two hundred fourteen When the upper three voices of a four voice composition are written close together the soprano and tenor never appearing more than an octave apart the term close position is applied But when the upper voices are not written close together the term open position is applied two hundred fifteen By transposition is meant playing singing or writing a piece of music in some other key than the original Thus e g if a song written in the key of G is too high in range for a soloist the accompanist sometimes transposes it to a lower key as F or E thus causing all tones to sound a second or a third lower than they did when the same song was played in the original key CHAPTER XIX MISCELLANEOUS TERMS A battuta with the beat in strict rhythm

NOTATION Many conflicting statements have been made regarding the history and development of music writing and the student who is seeking light on this subject is often at a loss to determine what actually did happen in the rise of our modern system of writing music We have one writer for example asserting that staff notation was begun by drawing a single red line across the page this line representing the pitch f fourth line bass staff the neumae the predecessors of our modern notes standing either for this pitch f or for a higher or lower pitch according to their position on the line or above or below it Another line continues this writer this time of yellow color was soon added above the red one and this line was to represent c middle C Soon the colors of these lines were omitted and the letters F and C were placed at the beginning of each of them From this arose our F and C clefs which preceded the G clef by some centuries thirty seven Footnote thirty seven Elson Music Dictionary article Notation Another writer thirty eight gives a somewhat different explanation stating that the staff system with the use of clefs came about through writing a letter C or F in the margin of the manuscript and drawing a line from this letter to the neume which was to represent the tone for which this particular letter stood Footnote thirty eight Goddard The Rise of Music p one hundred seventy seven A third writer thirty nine asserts that because the alphabetical notation was not suitable for recording melodies because of its inconvenience in sight singing points were placed at definite distances above the words and above and below one another In this system everything depended on the accuracy with which the points were interspersed and the scribes as a guide to the eye began to scratch a straight line across the page to indicate the position of one particular scale degree from which all the others could be shown by the relative distances of their points But this was not found sufficiently definite and the scratched line was therefore colored red and a second line was added colored yellow indicating the interval of a fifth above the first Footnote thirty nine Williams in Grove s Dictionary article Notation It will be noted that all three writers agree that a certain thing happened but as in the case of the four Gospels in the New Testament not all the writers agree on details and it is difficult to determine which account is most nearly accurate in detail as well as in general statement Communication was much slower a thousand years ago than now and ideas about new methods of doing things did not spread rapidly consequently it is entirely possible that various men or groups of men in various places worked out a system of notation differing somewhat in details of origin and development but alike in final result The point is that the development of musical knowledge rise of part writing increased interest in instrumental music et cetera demanded a more exact system of notation than had previously existed just as the development of science in the nineteenth century necessitated a more accurate scientific nomenclature and in both cases the need gave rise to the result as we have it to day Out of the chaos of conflicting statements regarding the development of music notation the student may glean an outline knowledge of three fairly distinct periods or stages each of these stages being intimately bound up with the development of music itself in that period These three stages are one The Greek system which used the letters of the alphabet for representing fixed pitches two The period of the neumae three The period of staff notation Of the Greek system little is known beyond the fact that the letters of the alphabet were used to represent pitches This method was probably accurate enough but it was cumbersome and did not afford any means of writing measured music nor did it give the eye any opportunity of grasping the general outline of the melody in its progression upward and downward as staff notation does The Greek system seems to have been abandoned at some time preceding the fifth century At any rate it was about this time that certain accent marks began to be written above the text of the Latin hymns of the church these marks serving to indicate in a general way the progress of the melody E g an upward stroke of the pen indicated a rise of the melody a downward stroke a fall et cetera In the course of two or three centuries these marks were added to and modified quite considerably and the system of notation which thus grew up was called neume notation the word neume sometimes spelled neuma or pneuma being of Greek origin and meaning a nod or sign This system of neumes was in some ways a retrogression from the Greek letter system for the neumes indicated neither definite pitches nor definite tone lengths But it had this advantage over the Greek system that the position of the signs on the page indicated graphically to the eye the general direction of the melody as well as giving at least a hint concerning the relative highness or lowness of each individual tone the so called diastematic system and this was a great aid to the eye in singing just as the relative highness and lowness of notes on the modern staff is of great value in reading music at the present time Thus although the neumae did not enable one to sing a new melody at sight as our modern staff notation does yet they served very well to recall to the eye the general outline of a melody previously learned by ear and therefore enabled the singer the system was used for vocal music only to differentiate between that particular melody and the dozens of others which he probably knew Neume notation was used mostly in connection with the plain song melodies of the Church and since the words of these chants were sung as they would be pronounced in reading the deficiency of the neume system in not expressing definite duration values was not felt But later on with the rise of so called measured music cf invention of opera development of independent instrumental music et cetera this lack was seen to be one of the chief disadvantages of the system The elements of neume writing as given by Riemann in his Dictionary of Music are one The signs for a single note Virga Virgula and Punctus Punctum two The sign for a rising interval Pes Podatus three The sign for a falling interval Clinis Flexa four Some signs for special manners of performance Tremula Bebung Quilisma shake Plica turn et cetera The others were either synonyms of the above named or combinations of them Since music in the middle ages was always copied by hand it will readily be understood that these neumae were not uniform either in shape or size and that each writer made use of certain peculiarities of writing which although perfectly intelligible to himself could not readily be interpreted by others cf writing shorthand Here then we observe the greatest weakness of the neume system its lack of uniformity and its consequent inability accurately to express musical ideas for universal interpretation Examples of several neumes are given merely in order to give the beginner a general idea of their appearance Virga virga symbol or virga symbol Punctus punctus symbol or punctus symbol Pes pes symbol or pes symbol Clinis clinis symbol or clinis symbol As music grew more and more complex and especially as writing in several parts came into use cf rise of organum descant and counterpoint it became increasingly difficult to express musical ideas on the basis of the old notation and numerous attempts were made to invent a more accurate and usable system Among these one of the most interesting was that in which the words of the text were written in the spaces between long parallel lines placing the initial letters of the words tone and semi tone at the beginning of the line to indicate the scale interval An example will make this clear Illustration This indicated the precise melodic interval but did not give any idea of the rhythm and the natural accents of the text were the only guide the singer had in this direction as was the case in neume notation and in early staff notation also Various other attempts to invent a more definite notation were made but all were sporadic and it was not until the idea of using the lines later lines and spaces to represent definite pitches and writing notes of various shapes derived from the neumae to indicate relative duration values it was only when this combination of two elements was devised that any one system began to be universally used Just how the transition from neume to staff notation was made no one knows it was not done in a day nor in a year but was the result of a gradual process of evolution and improvement Nor is it probable that any one man deserves the entire credit for the invention of staff notation although this feat is commonly attributed to an Italian monk named Guido d Arezzo approximate dates nine hundred ninety five ten fifty To this same monk we are indebted however for the invention of the syllables UT RE MI et cetera which in a somewhat modified form are so widely used for sight singing purposes For a more detailed account of the transition to staff notation see Grove op cit article notation It will now be readily seen that our modern notation is the result of a combination of two preceding methods the Greek letters and the neumes together with a new element the staff emphasizing the idea that higher tones are written higher on the staff than lower ones The development of the neumes into notes of various shapes indicating relative time values and the division of the staff into measures with a definite measure signature at the beginning are natural developments of the earlier primitive idea In the system of musica mensurabilis or measured music which was inaugurated a little later the virga which had meanwhile developed into a square headed neume was adopted as the longa or long note and the punctus in two of its forms as breve and semi breve short and half short The longa is now extinct but the modern form of the breve is still used as the double whole note and the semi breve is our modern whole note Red colored notes were sometimes used to indicate changes in value and before long outline notes called empty notes came into use these being easier to make than the solid ones The transition from square and diamond shaped notes to round and oval ones also came about because of the greater facility with which the latter could be written and for the same reason notes of small denomination were later tied together or stroked This latter usage began about seventeen hundred A D It is interesting to find that when measured music was finally inaugurated there were at first but two measure signatures viz the circle standing for three beat measure the so called perfect measure and the semi circle or broken circle which indicated two beat measure Occasionally three beat measure was indicated by three vertical strokes at the beginning of the melody while two beat measure was shown by two such strokes Upon the basis of these two varieties of measure primitive in conception though they may have been has been built nevertheless the whole system now employed and in the last analysis all forms of measure now in use will be found to be of either the two beat or the three beat variety The circle has disappeared entirely as a measure sign but the broken circle still survives and from it are derived the familiar signs common time symbol and cut time symbol which are sometimes erroneously referred to as being the initial letter of our word common as used in the expression common time The transition from the older style of measure signature to the present one seems to have occurred during the century following the invention of opera i e from about sixteen hundred to about seventeen hundred A D The rest came into use very soon after measured music began to be composed and we soon find rests corresponding with the various denominations of notes in use viz Illustration The terms applied to these rests vary in different authorities but it will be noted that the pausa semi pausa and suspirum correspond respectively to the double whole rest whole rest and half rest in use at present The bar and double bar may be developments of the maxima rest as some writers suggest but are probably also derived from the practice of drawing a line vertically through the various parts of a score to show which notes belonged together thus facilitating score reading The bar may occasionally be found as early as fifteen hundred but was not employed universally until sixteen fifty or later The number of lines used in the staff has varied greatly since the time of Guido there having been all the way from four to fifteen at various times and in various places four being the standard number for a long time These lines when there were quite a number in the staff were often divided into groups of four by red lines which were not themselves used for notes These red lines were gradually omitted and the staff divided into sections by a space as in modern usage The number of lines in each section was changed to five in some cases six for the sake of having a larger available range in each section The clefs at the beginning of the staffs are of course simply altered forms of the letters F C and G which were written at first by Guido and others to make the old neume notation more definite The staccato sign seems not to have appeared until about the time of Bach the legato sign being also invented at about the same time The fermata was first used in imitative part writing to show where each part was to stop but with the development of harmonic writing the present practice was inaugurated Leger lines came into use in the seventeenth century Sharps and flats were invented because composers found it necessary to use other tones than those that could be represented by the staff degrees in their natural condition The history of their origin and development is somewhat complicated and cannot be given here but it should be noted once more that it was the need of expressing more than could be expressed by the older symbols that called forth the newer and more comprehensive method The use of sharps and flats in key signatures grew up early in the seventeenth century In the earlier signatures it was customary to duplicate sharps or flats on staff degrees having the same pitch name thus Illustration Illustration The use of the G clef as here shown did not of course exist at that time The double sharp and double flat became necessary when equal temperament making possible the use of the complete cycle of keys was adopted This was in the time of Bach sixteen eighty five seventeen fifty Signs of expression relating to tempo and dynamics date back at least as far as the year one thousand A D but the modern terms used for this purpose did not appear until some years after the invention of opera the date given by C F A Williams in Grove s Dictionary being sixteen thirty eight These words and signs of expression were at first used only in connection with instrumental music but were gradually applied to vocal music also Other systems of notation have been invented from time to time in the course of the last two or three centuries but in most cases they have died with their inventors and in no case has any such system been accepted with anything even approaching unanimity The tonic sol fa system forty is used quite extensively in England for vocal music but has gained little ground anywhere else and the chances are that the present system of notation with possibly slight additions and modifications will remain the standard notation for some time to come in spite of the attacks that are periodically made upon it on the ground of cumbersomeness difficulty in teaching children et cetera The main characteristics of staff notation may be summed up as follows Footnote forty The tonic sol fa system represents an attempt to invent a simpler notation to be used by beginners especially in the lower grades of the public schools and by singers in choral societies who have never learned to interpret staff notation and who therefore find some simpler scheme of notation necessary if they are to read music at all In this system the syllables do re mi et cetera in phonetic spelling are used the tone being arrived at in each case first by means of a firmly established sense of tonality and second by associating each diatonic tone with some universally felt emotional feeling thus do is referred to as the strong tone mi as the calm one and la as the sad tone great emphasis being placed upon do as the center of the major tonality and upon la as the center of the minor The system is thus seen to have one advantage over staff notation viz that in presenting it the teacher is compelled to begin with a presentation of actual tones while in many cases the teacher of staff notation begins by presenting facts regarding the staff and other symbols before the pupil knows anything about tone and rhythm as such The symbol for each diatonic tone is the initial letter of the syllable i e d for do r for re et cetera the key being indicated by a letter at the beginning of the composition The duration value of tones is indicated by a system of bars dots and spaces the bar being used to indicate the strongest pulse of each measure as in staff notation the beats being shown by the mark a dash indicating the continuation of the same tone through another beat If a beat has two tones this is indicated by writing the two initial letters representing them with a between them A modulation is indicated by giving the new key letter and by printing the syllable initials from the standpoint of both the old and the new do position The figure above and to the right of the letter indicates the tone in the octave above while the same figure below and to the right indicates the octave below A blank space indicates a rest The tune of My Country Tis of Thee as printed in tonic sol fa notation below will make these points clear Key F d d r t one d r m m f m r d r d t one d s s s s f m f f f f m r m f m r d m f s l f m r d The advantages of the system are one the strong sense of key feeling aroused and the ease with which modulations are felt and two the fact that it is necessary to learn to sing in but one key thus making sight singing a much simpler matter and transposition the easiest process imaginable But these are advantages from the standpoint of the vocalist producing but one tone at a time only and do not apply to instrumental music The scheme will therefore probably be always restricted to vocal music and will hardly come into very extensive use even in this field for the teacher of music is finding it perfectly possible to improve methods of presentation to such an extent that learning to sing from the staff becomes a very simple matter even to the young child And even though this were not true the tonic sol fa will always be hampered by the fact that since all letters are printed in a straight horizontal line the ear does not have the assistance of the eye in appreciating the rise and fall of melody as is the case in staff notation one Pitches represented by lines and spaces of a staff the higher the line the higher the pitch represented signs called clefs at the beginning of each staff making clear the pitch names of the lines and spaces two Duration values shown by shapes of notes three Accents shown by position of notes on the staff with regard to bars i e the strongest accent always falls just after the bar and the beat relatively least accented is found just before the bar four Extent and description of beat groups shown by measure signs five Key shown by key signature placed at the beginning of each staff six Rate of speed dynamic changes et cetera shown by certain Italian words allegro andante et cetera whose meaning is as universally understood as staff notation itself APPENDIX B MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS one Broadly speaking musical instruments may be divided into two classes viz one those that have a keyboard and are therefore capable of sounding several tones simultaneously two those that as a rule sound only one tone at a time as the violin and trumpet The piano is of course the most familiar example of the first class and a brief description is therefore given The piano was invented about two hundred years ago by Cristofori sixteen fifty one seventeen thirty one an Italian It was an enormous improvement over the types of keyboard instrument that were in use at that time clavichord harpsichord spinet virginal and has resulted in an entirely different style of composition See note on embellishments p twenty six two The most characteristic things about the piano as contrasted with its immediate predecessors are one that on it the loudness and softness of the tone can be regulated by the force with which the keys are struck hence the name pianoforte meaning literally the soft loud two the fact that the piano is capable of sustaining tone to a much greater extent than its predecessors In other words the tone continues sounding for some little time after the key is struck while on the earlier instruments it stopped almost instantly after being sounded The essentials of the piano mechanism are one Felt hammers controlled by keys each hammer striking two or three strings which are tuned in unison and immediately rebounding from these strings allowing them to vibrate as long as the key is held down The mechanism that allows the hammers to rebound from the strings and fall into position for another blow is called the escapement two A damper made of softer felt pressing against each string and preventing it from vibrating until it is wanted three A keyboard action that controls both hammers and dampers causing the damper to leave the string at the same instant that the hammer strikes it four A pedal damper pedal controlling all of the dampers so that at any moment all the strings may be released so as to be free to vibrate Other interesting details are one The strings are stretched over a thin sheet of wood called the sound board This aids greatly in intensifying the tone two The soft pedal the one at the left in an upright piano causes the hammers to move up nearer the strings and the shorter swing thus afforded causes a less violent blow and consequently a softer tone In the grand piano this same pedal shifts the mechanism to one side so that the hammers strike only one or two of the strings this resulting in a softer tone of somewhat modified quality These details regarding the mechanism of the piano can easily be verified by removing the front of any ordinary upright piano and observing what takes place when the keys are struck or the pedals depressed three There are two familiar types of organ in use at the present time one the reed organ two the pipe organ The reed organ is very simple in construction the tone being produced by the vibration of metal reeds fixed in little cells through which air is forced or sucked from the bellows the latter being usually worked by the feet of the player More power may be secured either by drawing additional stops thus throwing on more sets of reeds or by opening the knee swells which either throw on more reeds sometimes octave couplers or else open a swell box in which some of the reeds are enclosed the tone being louder when the box is open than when closed More tone may also be secured by pumping harder four The essential characteristic of the pipe organ is a number of sets or registers of pipes called stops each set being capable usually of sounding the entire chromatic scale through a range of five or six octaves Thus for example when the stop melodia is drawn by pulling out a stop knob or tilting a tablet one set of pipes only sounds when the keyboard is played on but if the stop flute is drawn with melodia two pipes speak every time a key is depressed Thus if an organ has forty speaking stops all running through the entire keyboard then each time one key is depressed forty pipes will speak and if a chord of five tones is played two hundred pipes will speak The object of having so many pipes is not merely to make possible a very powerful tone but rather to give greater variety of tone color The pipe organ usually has a pedal keyboard on which the feet of the performer play a bass part this part often sounding an octave or more lower than the notes indicate An eight foot stop on the organ produces tones of the same pitches as the piano when corresponding keys are struck A four foot stop sounds tones an octave higher and a two foot stop tones two octaves higher A sixteen foot stop sounds tones an octave lower than the piano and a thirty two foot stop tones two octaves lower while some organs have also a sixty four foot stop which sounds three octaves lower This gives the organ an exceedingly wide range its compass being greater than that of any other single instrument and comparable in both range of pitches and variety of color only with the modern orchestra Modern pipe organs always have a number of combination pedals or pistons usually both by means of which the organist is enabled to throw on a number of stops with one movement The selection and use of suitable stops couplers combinations et cetera is called registration five The instruments mentioned at the beginning of this appendix as belonging to the second class are more familiar in connection with ensemble playing being commonly associated with either band or orchestra six A band is a company of musicians all of whom play upon either wind or percussion instruments the main body of tone being produced by the brass and wood wind divisions Sousa s band is usually made up in somewhat the following manner four flutes and piccolos twelve B flat clarinets one E flat clarinet one alto clarinet one bass clarinet two oboes two bassoons two sarrusophones four saxophones four cornets two trumpets one soprano saxhorn fluegelhorn four French horns four trombones two contra bass tubas four tubas one snare drum one bass drum two kettle drums cymbals triangle bells castanets xylophone et cetera seven An orchestra is a company of musicians performing upon stringed instruments as well as upon wind and percussion It is differentiated from the band by the fact that the main body of tone is produced by the strings There are four classes of instruments in the orchestra viz strings wood wind brass wind and percussion In addition to these four classes there is the harp which although a stringed instrument does not belong in the same group as the other strings because the manner of producing the tone is altogether different eight In the first group the strings are found the first and second violins viola violoncello usually spelled cello and double bass The first and second violins are identical in every way but play different parts while the other members of the family merely represent larger examples of the same type of instrument nine In the second group the wood wind are found the flute piccolo oboe bassoon English horn double bassoon clarinet and bass clarinet The English horn double bassoon bass clarinet and piccolo are not called for in the older compositions hence are not always present in the orchestra ten In the third group the brass choir are found the French horn usually referred to as the horn trumpet sometimes replaced by the cornet trombone and tuba eleven The fourth group percussion consists of kettle drums bass drum cymbals snare drum triangle bells et cetera twelve In an orchestra of about one hundred players the proportion of instruments is as about as follows although it varies somewhat according to the taste of the conductor the style of composition to be performed et cetera eighteen first violins sixteen second violins fourteen violas twelve cellos ten basses one harp three flutes one piccolo three oboes one English horn three clarinets one bass clarinet three bassoons one contra or double bassoon four horns two trumpets three trombones one tuba three kettle drums one bass drum one snare drum one each of triangle cymbals bells and other instruments of percussion several of which are often manipulated by one performer thirteen The cuts and brief descriptions here added will give at least a rudimentary idea of the appearance and possibilities of the instruments most commonly used in bands and orchestras For fuller descriptions and particulars regarding range quality et cetera the student is referred to Mason s The Orchestral Instruments and What They Do Lavignac s Music and Musicians and to the various articles which describe each instrument under its own name in Grove s Dictionary or in any good encyclopaedia For still fuller details some work on orchestration will have to be consulted fourteen The violin has four strings tuned thus Illustration g d a e these making available a range of about three and one half octaves g c This range forty one may be extended upward somewhat further by means of harmonics these being produced by lightly touching the string at certain points while the bow is moving across it instead of holding it down against the finger board The highest string of the violin viola and cello also is often called the chanterelle because it is most often used for playing the melody The violin ordinarily produces but one tone at a time but by stopping two strings simultaneously and so drawing the bow as to set both in vibration two tones may be produced at the same time while three and four tones can be sounded almost simultaneously Footnote forty one The ranges noted in connection with these descriptions of instruments are ordinarily the practical orchestral or band ranges rather than those which are possible in solo performance Illustration VIOLIN Length twenty three one two inches Length of bow twenty nine one two inches The mute or sordino is a small clamp made of metal wood or ivory which when clipped to the top of the bridge causes the vibrations to be transmitted less freely to the body of the violin giving rise to a tone modified in quality and decreased in power For certain special effects the player is directed to pluck the string pizzicato this method of playing giving rise to a dry detached tone instead of the smooth flowing one that is so characteristic of the violin as commonly played Violins in the orchestra are divided into firsts and seconds the first violins being always seated at the left of the audience and the seconds at the right Illustration VIOLA Length twenty six in Length of bow twenty eight fifteen The viola has four strings also tuned in fifths thus Illustration c g d a The viola looks exactly like the violin at a little distance and is really only a larger sized violin having a range a fifth lower Its tone is not so incisive as that of the violin being rather heavier more gloomy as it is often described The viola is not so useful as the violin as a solo instrument because it is not capable of producing so many varieties of color nevertheless it is invaluable for certain effects In orchestral music it is of course one of the most valuable instruments for filling in the harmony The viola players are usually seated behind the second violin players in the orchestra Illustration VIOLONCELLO Length three fort ten in Length of bow twenty eight in sixteen The violoncello or cello sometimes called bass viol has four strings tuned thus Illustration C G d a Its range is about three and one half octaves from C to e or f but in solo work this range is sometimes extended much higher The cello is much more universally used as a solo instrument than the viola and its tone is capable of a much greater degree of variation In the orchestra it plays the bass of the string quartet reinforced by the double bass but is also often used for solo passages Con sordino and pizzicato passages occur as often for the cello as for the violin seventeen The double bass differs from the other members of the string family in that it is tuned in fourths instead of in fifths Its four strings are tuned as follows Illustration EE AA D G the entire range of the instrument being from EE to a In music written for double bass the notes are always printed an octave higher than the tones are to sound that is when the bass player sees the note Illustration c he plays Illustration C this being done to avoid leger lines The tone of the bass is much heavier and the instrument itself is much more clumsy to handle than the other members of the group hence it is almost never used as a solo instrument but it is invaluable for reinforcing the bass part in orchestral music The mute is rarely used on the double bass but the pizzicato effect is very common and the bass pizzicato tone is much fuller and richer than that of any other stringed instrument Illustration DOUBLE BASS Length six fort six in Length of bow twenty three one two in eighteen The flute has a range of three octaves Illustration c c It is used in both solo and orchestral playing as well as in bands The flute was formerly always made of wood but is at present often made of metal nineteen The piccolo is a flute playing an octave higher than the one described above The notes are printed as for the flute but the player understands that the tone is to sound an octave higher The piccolo is used widely in band music and quite often in orchestral music also but since the tone is so brilliant and penetrating and is incapable of any great variation it is not suitable for solo performance Illustration OBOE hautboy Length twenty four one two in Range b e CONTRA BASSOON Double bassoon Length six fort Range about an octave lower than bassoon but not all tones in this range are practicable ENGLISH HORN Cor Anglais Length two fort eleven one two in Range e a PICCOLO Length thirteen in Note that this is approximately half the length of the flute FLUTE Length twenty six one two in BASSOON fagotto Length four fort three one two in Range BB flat b flat twenty The next four instruments to be described oboe bassoon English horn and contra bassoon are often referred to as the oboe family since the principle of tone production and general manipulation is the same in all four The tone in these instruments is produced by the vibration of two very thin pieces of cane which are called together a double reed The oboe is especially valuable in the orchestra as a solo instrument and its thin nasal tones are suggestive of rustic pastoral simplicity both oboe and English horn being often used by orchestral composers in passages intended to express the idea of rural out of door life The English horn is also often used in passages where the idea of melancholy and suffering is to be conveyed to the audience In a military band the oboe corresponds to the first violin of the orchestra The bassoon and contra bassoon are used mostly to provide a bass part for the harmony of the wood wind group but they are also sometimes employed especially the bassoon to depict comic or grotesque effects Illustration BASS CLARINET Length three fort three in Range D to b flat Illustration CLARINET Length twenty eight in twenty one The next two types of instruments to be described clarinet and saxophone are alike in that the tone is produced by the vibration of a single strip of cane called single reed which is held against the lower lip of the player The clarinet and bass clarinet are made of wood and are used in both bands and orchestras but the saxophone is usually made of metal and the tone being more strident and penetrating the instrument is ordinarily used only in combination with other wind instruments i e in bands Since the fingering of the clarinet is excessively difficult the performer can play in only certain keys on the same instrument hence to play in different keys clarinets in several keys must be provided there being usually three in all The music is written as though it were to be played in the key of C but the tones produced are actually in other keys For this reason the clarinet is called a transposing instrument The range of the clarinet is the greatest possessed by any of the wind instruments that of the clarinet in C being from Illustration e to Illustration g Illustration SAXOPHONES SOPRANO ALTO Length fifteen three four in TENOR Length two fort seven one two in BASS Length three fort nine in Combined range AA to g flat Illustration SARRUSOPHONE The sarrusophone is an instrument with a double reed It is made of brass and exists in several sizes the only one ever used in the orchestra being the double bass sarrusophone which has approximately the same range as the double bassoon and is sometimes but rarely made use of in the orchestra instead of the latter instrument The tone of the sarrusophone is something like that of the bassoon Illustration FRENCH HORN Length twenty two three four in twenty two The French horn often called valve horn or simply horn really consists of a long tube about sixteen feet which is bent into circular form for convenience in handling Its range is from Illustration BB to Illustration f In the orchestra French horns are used in pairs two of the players taking the higher tones and two the lower The tone is intensely mellow but incapable of any extensive variation but in spite of this lack of variety the tone itself is so wonderfully beautiful that the instrument is one of the most useful in the orchestra both in solo passages and to fill in the harmony The horn as well as the trumpet and trombone differs from most of the wood wind instruments in that its mouthpiece contains no reed the lips of the player constituting the vibrating body as they are stretched across the mouthpiece and air is forced against them The horn is used in bands as well as in orchestras Illustration TRUMPET Length twenty two one two in twenty three The range of the trumpet is Illustration g b the typical tone being brilliant and ringing It is used in both band and orchestra playing the highest parts assigned to the brass choir The trumpet is often replaced in both band and orchestra by its less refined cousin the cornet because of the ease with which the latter can be played as compared with the trumpet and the larger number of players that are available in consequence of this ease of execution twenty four The cornet looks something like the trumpet but is not so slim and graceful in appearance Its tube is only four and one half feet long as compared with a length of about eight feet in the trumpet and sixteen feet in the French horn The range of the cornet in B flat is from Illustration e to Illustration b flat The tone is somewhat commonplace as compared with the trumpet but because of its great agility in the rendition of trills repeated tones et cetera it is universally used in all sorts of combinations even as noted above taking the place of the trumpet in many small orchestras Illustration CORNET Length thirteen three four in Illustration SLIDE TROMBONE Length three fort nine in Range of tenor trombone the size ordinarily used E to b flat twenty five The pitch sounded by the trombone is altered by lengthening or shortening the tube of which the instrument is constructed this being possible because the lower part slides into the upper and can be pulled out to increase the total length of the tube through which the air passes There are usually three trombones in the orchestra each playing a separate part and the combination of this trio with the tuba reinforcing the bass part is majestic and thrilling being powerful enough to dominate the entire orchestra in Fortissimo passages But the trombones are useful in soft passages also and their tone when playing pianissimo is rich serene and sonorous twenty six The bass tuba is a member of the saxhorn family forty two and supplies the lowest part of the brass choir as the double bass does in the string choir It is used in both orchestra and band being often supported in the larger bands by a still lower toned member of the same family the contra bass tuba The range of the tuba is from Illustration GG to Illustration g Footnote forty two The saxhorn was invented about eighteen forty by Adolphe Sax a Frenchman The saxophone is the invention of the same man Illustration BASS TUBA Length three fort three in Illustration BASS DRUM Diameter about two one two fort Illustration CYMBALS Diameter thirteen one four in twenty seven The kettle drum is the most important member of the percussion family and is always used either in pairs or in threes The size of these instruments varies somewhat with the make but when two drums are used the diameter is approximately that given under the illustration The range of a pair of drums is one octave Illustration F f and when but two drums are used the larger one takes the tones from F to about C of this range and the smaller takes those from about B flat to F The most common usage is to tune one drum to the tonic and the other to the dominant of the key in which the composition is written The pitch of the kettle drum can be varied by increasing or lessening the tension of the head by means of thumb screws which act on a metal ring Illustration KETTLE DRUMS Diameter of Head twenty four one two in and twenty seven one two in The other important members of the percussion family are shown on this and the following page their use being so obvious as to require no detailed explanation Illustration TAMBOURINE Diameter ten to twelve in Illustration BELLS Fr carillon Ger Glockenspiel Illustration SIDE DRUM Diameter about fifteen one two in Illustration TRIANGLE Height about eight in twenty eight The harp is one of the oldest of instruments dating back over six thousand years but it is only in comparatively recent years that it has been used in the symphony orchestra Its range is from Illustration CC flat to Illustration f flat Illustration HARP Height five fort eight in The modern double action harp has forty six strings which are tuned in half steps and whole steps so as to sound the scale of C flat major It has a series of seven pedals around its base each pedal having two notches below it into either of which the pedal may be lowered and held fast The first pedal shortens the F flat string so that it now sounds F giving the key of G flat the second one shortens the C flat string so that it sounds C giving the key of D flat the third pedal shortens the G flat string so that it sounds G giving the key of A flat the fourth changes D flat to D giving the key of E flat and so on until when all the pedals are fixed in their first notches the scale of C is sounded instead of C flat as was the case before any of the pedals were depressed But if the first pedal is now pushed down into the second notch the original F flat string is still further shortened and now sounds the pitch F sharp giving us the key of G and if all the other pedals are likewise successively lowered to the second notch we get in turn all the sharp keys D A E B F sharp and C sharp the last named key being obtained as the result of having all the pedals fixed in their second notches thus making all the tones of the original C flat scale a whole step higher so that they now sound the C sharp scale Chords of not more than four tones for each hand may be played simultaneously on the harp but arpeggio and scale passages are the rule and are more successful than simultaneous chords The notation of harp music is essentially like that of piano music APPENDIX C ACOUSTICS NOTE It is usually taken for granted that the student of music is familiar with the significance of such terms as over tone equal temperament et cetera and with principles such as that relating to the relation between vibration rates and pitches the writer has in his own experience found however that most students are not at all familiar with such data and this appendix is therefore added in the hope that a few facts at least regarding the laws of sound may be brought to the attention of some who would otherwise remain in entire ignorance of the subject one Acoustics is the science which deals with sound and the laws of its production and transmission Since all sound is caused by vibration acoustics may be defined as the science which treats of the phenomena of sound producing vibration two All sound as stated above is produced by vibration of some sort strike a tuning fork against the top of a table and see the vibrations which cause the tone or if the fork is a small one and the vibrations cannot be seen hold it against the edge of a sheet of paper and hear the blows it strikes or watch one of the lowest strings of the piano after striking the key a sharp blow or look closely at the heavier strings of the violin or better still the cello and watch them oscillate rapidly to and fro as the bow moves across them The vibrating body may be a string a thin piece of wood a piece of metal a membrane cf drum the lips cf playing the cornet the vocal cords et cetera Often it is a column of air whose vibrations give rise to the tone the reed or other medium merely serving to set the air in vibration three Sound is transmitted through the air in somewhat this fashion the vibrating body a string for example strikes the air particles in its immediate vicinity and they being in contact with other such air particles strike these others the latter in turn striking yet others and so on both a forward and backward movement being set up oscillation 
3630_11612_000007_000002	train-clean-360	These particles lie so close together that no movement at all can be detected and it is only when the disturbance finally reaches the air particles that are in contact with the ear drum that any effect is evident 
3630_11612_000008_000000	train-clean-360	This phenomenon of sound transmission may perhaps be made more clear by the old illustration of a series of eight billiard balls in a row on a table if the first ball is tapped lightly striking gently against ball number two the latter as well as numbers three four five six and seven will not apparently move at all but ball number eight at the other end will roll away 
none	none	The air particles act upon each other in much this same fashion the difference being that when they are set in motion by a vibrating body a complete vibration backward and forward causes a similar backward and forward movement of the particles oscillation instead of simply a forward jerk as in the case of the billiard balls Another way of describing the same process is this the vibration of some body produces waves in the air cf waves in the ocean which carry water forward but do not themselves move on continuously these waves spread out spherically i e in all directions and finally reach the ear where they set the ear drum in vibration thus sending certain sound stimuli to the nerves of hearing in the inner ear and thus to the brain An important thing to be noted in connection with sound transmission is that sound will not travel in a vacuum some kind of a medium is essential for its transmission 
3630_11612_000010_000001	train-clean-360	This medium may be air water a bar of iron or steel the earth et cetera 
none	none	four The rate at which sound travels through the air is about eleven hundred feet per second the rapidity varying somewhat with fluctuations in temperature and humidity In water the rate is much higher than in air about four times as great while the velocity of sound through other mediums as e g steel is sometimes as much as sixteen times as great as through air five Sound like light may be intensified by a suitable reflecting surface directly back of the vibrating body cf sounding board it may also be reflected by some surface at a distance from its source in such a way that at a certain point the focus the sound may be very clearly heard but at other places even those nearer the source of sound it can scarcely be heard at all 
3630_11612_000012_000002	train-clean-360	If there is such a surface in an auditorium as often occurs there will be a certain point where everything can be heard very easily but in the rest of the room it may be very difficult to understand what is being said or sung 
none	none	Echoes are caused by sound reflection the distance of the reflecting surface from the vibrating body determining the number of syllables that will be echoed The acoustics of an auditorium i e its hearing properties depend upon the position and nature of the reflecting surfaces and also upon the length of time a sound persists after the vibrating body has stopped If it persists longer than two one four or two one three seconds the room will not be suitable for musical performances because of the mixture of persisting tones with following ones this causing a blurred effect somewhat like that obtained by playing a series of unrelated chords on the piano while the damper pedal is held down 
3630_11612_000014_000002	train-clean-360	The duration of the reverberation depends upon the size and height of the room material of floor and walls furniture size of audience et cetera 
none	none	six Sound may be classified roughly into tones and noises although the line of cleavage is not always sharply drawn If I throw stones at the side of a barn sounds are produced but they are caused by irregular vibrations of an irregularly constructed surface and are referred to as noise But if I tap the head of a kettle drum a regular series of vibrations is set up and the resulting sound is referred to as tone In general the material of music consists of tones but for special effects certain noises are also utilized cf castanets et cetera seven Musical tones have three properties viz one Pitch two Intensity three 
3630_11612_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Quality timbre 
none	none	By pitch is meant the highness or lowness of tone 
3630_11612_000020_000001	train-clean-360	It depends upon rate of vibration 
3630_11612_000020_000002	train-clean-360	If a body vibrates only eight or ten times per second no tone is heard at all but if it vibrates regularly at the rate of sixteen or eighteen per second a tone of very low pitch is heard 
none	none	If it vibrates at the rate of twenty four the pitch is higher at thirty higher still at two hundred yet higher and when a rate of about thirty eight thousand per second has been reached the pitch is so high that most ears cannot perceive it at all 
3630_11612_000020_000004	train-clean-360	The highest tone that can ordinarily be heard is the E flat four octaves higher than the highest E flat of the piano 
none	none	The entire range of sound humanly audible is therefore about eleven octaves rates sixteen thirty eight thousand but only about eight of these octaves are utilized for musical purposes The tones of the piano with a range of seven one three octaves are produced by vibration rates approximately between twenty seven and four thousand two hundred twenty four In the orchestra the range is slightly more extended the rates being from thirty three to four thousand seven hundred fifty two Certain interesting facts regarding the relation between vibration rates and pitches have been worked out it has been discovered for instance that if the number of vibrations is doubled the pitch of the resulting tone is an octave higher i e if a string vibrating at the rate of two hundred sixty one per second gives rise to the pitch c then a string one half as long and vibrating twice as rapidly five hundred twenty two will give rise to the pitch c i e an octave higher than c In the same way it has been found that if the rate is multiplied by five four the pitch of the tone will be a major third higher if multiplied by three two a perfect fifth higher et cetera These laws are often stated thus the ratio of the octave to the fundamental is as two is to one that of the major third as five is to four that of the perfect fifth as three is to two and so on through the entire series of pitches embraced within the octave the ratio being of course the same for all octaves nine The intensity loudness or softness of tones depends upon the amplitude width of the vibrations a louder tone being the result of vibrations of greater amplitude and vice versa This may be verified by plucking a long string on cello or double bass and noting that when plucked gently vibrations of small amplitude are set up while a vigorous pluck results in much wider vibrations and consequently in a louder tone It should be noted that the pitch of the tone is not affected by the change in amplitude of vibration 
3630_11612_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The intensity of tones varies with the medium conveying them being usually louder at night because the air is then more elastic 
none	none	Tone intensity is also affected by sympathetic vibrations set up in other bodies 
3630_11612_000023_000002	train-clean-360	If two strings of the same length are stretched side by side and one set in vibration so as to produce tone the other will soon begin to vibrate also and the combined tone will be louder than if only one string produced it 
none	none	This phenomenon is the basis of what is known as resonance cf body of violin resonance cavities of nose and mouth sounding board of piano et cetera ten Quality depends upon the shape or form of the vibrations which give rise to the tone 
3630_11612_000024_000002	train-clean-360	A series of simple vibrations will cause a simple or colorless tone while complex vibrations giving rise to overtones of various kinds and in a variety of proportions cause more individualistic peculiarities of quality 
none	none	Quality is affected also by the shape and size of the resonance body Cf last part of sec 
3630_11612_000024_000004	train-clean-360	nine above 
none	none	eleven 
3630_11612_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Practically every musical tone really consists of a combination of several tones sounding simultaneously the combined effect upon the ear giving the impression of a single tone 
none	none	The most important tone of the series is the fundamental which dominates the combination and gives the pitch but this fundamental is practically always combined with a greater or less number of faint and elusive attending tones called overtones or harmonics 
3630_11612_000025_000003	train-clean-360	The first of these overtones is the octave above the fundamental the second is the fifth above this octave the third two octaves above the fundamental and so on through the series as shown in the figure below 
none	none	The presence of these overtones is accounted for by the fact that the string or other vibrating body does not merely vibrate in its entirety but has in addition to the principal oscillation a number of sectional movements also Thus it is easily proved that a string vibrates in halves thirds et cetera in addition to the principal vibration of the entire string and it is the vibration of these halves thirds et cetera which gives rise to the harmonics or upper partials as they are often called The figure shows Great C and its first eight overtones 
3630_11612_000025_000007	train-clean-360	A similar series might be worked out from any other fundamental 
none	none	Illustration NOTE The B flat in this series is approximate only It will be recalled that in the section ten dealing with quality the statement was made that quality depends upon the shape of the vibrations it should now be noted that it is the form of these vibrations that determines the nature and proportion of the overtones and hence the quality Thus e g a tone that has too large a proportion of the fourth upper partial i e the third of the chord will be reedy and somewhat unpleasant This is the case with many voices that are referred to as nasal Too great a proportion of overtones is what causes certain pianos to sound tin panny The tone produced by a good tuning fork is almost entirely free from overtones it has therefore no distinctive quality and is said to be a simple tone 
3630_11612_000027_000004	train-clean-360	The characteristic tone of the oboe on the other hand has many overtones and is therefore highly individualistic this enables us to recognize the tone of the instrument even though we cannot see the player 
none	none	Such a tone is said to be complex twelve The mathematical ratio referred to on page one hundred thirty four if strictly carried out in tuning a keyboard instrument would cause the half steps to vary slightly in size and playing in certain keys especially those having a number of sharps or flats in the signature would therefore sound out of tune 
3630_11612_000028_000002	train-clean-360	There would be many other disadvantages in such a system notably the inability to modulate freely to other keys and since modulation is one of the predominant and most striking characteristics of modern music this would constitute a serious barrier to advances in composition 
none	none	To obviate these disadvantages a system of equal temperament was invented and has been in universal use since the time of Bach sixteen eighty five seventeen fifty who was the first prominent composer to use it extensively Equal temperament means simply dividing the octave into twelve equal parts thus causing all scales as played on keyboard instruments at least to sound exactly alike To show the practicability of equal temperament Bach wrote a series of forty eight preludes and fugues two in each major and two in each minor key 
3630_11612_000029_000001	train-clean-360	He called the collection The Well tempered Clavichord 
none	none	thirteen Various standards of pitch have existed at different times in the last two centuries and even now there is no absolute uniformity although conditions are much better than they were even twenty five years ago Scientists use what is known as the scientific standard sometimes called the philosophic standard viz two hundred fifty six double vibrations for middle C This pitch is not in actual use for musical purposes but is retained for theoretical purposes because of its convenience of computation being a power of two In eighteen eighty five a conference of musicians at Vienna ratified the pitch giving Middle C two hundred sixty one vibrations this having been adopted by the French as their official pitch some twenty six years before 
3630_11612_000030_000004	train-clean-360	In eighteen ninety one a convention of piano manufacturers at Philadelphia adopted this same pitch for the United States and it has been in practically universal use ever since 
none	none	This pitch giving Middle C two hundred sixty one vibrations is known as International Pitch Concert pitch is slightly higher than International the difference between the two varying somewhat but being almost always less than one half step This higher pitch is still often used by bands and sometimes by orchestras to give greater brilliancy to the wind instruments REFERENCES Lavignac Music and Musicians pp one sixty six Broadhouse The Student s Helmholz Helmholtz Sensations of Tone Hamilton Sound and its Relation to Music NOTE For a simple and illuminating treatment of the subject from the standpoint of the music student the books by Lavignac and Hamilton are especially recommended APPENDIX D TERMINOLOGY REFORM A recent writer forty three on vocal terminology makes the following statement as an introduction to certain remarks advocating a more definite use of terms relating to tone production by the human voice 
4958-11613-0000	train-other-500	The correct use of words is the most potent factor in the development of the thinker
none	none	 If this statement has any basis of fact whatsoever to support it then it must be evident to the merest novice in musical work that the popular use of many common terms by musicians is keeping a good many people from clear and logical thought in a field that needs accurate thinkers very badly However this may be it must be patent to all that our present terminology is in many respects neither correct nor logical and the movement inaugurated by the Music Section of the National Education Association some years ago to secure greater uniformity in the use and definition of certain expressions should therefore not only command the respect and commendation but the active support of all progressive teachers of music Footnote forty three Floyd S Muckey Vocal Terminology The Musician May nineteen twelve p three hundred thirty seven Let it be noted at the outset that such reforms as are advocated by the committee will never come into general use while the rank and file of teachers throughout the country merely approve the reports so carefully compiled and submitted each year these reforms will become effective only as individual teachers make up their minds that the end to be attained is worth the trouble of being careful to use only correct terminology every day for a month or three months or a year whatever length of time may be necessary in order to get the new habits fixed in mind and muscle The Terminology Committee was appointed by the Department of Music of the N E A in nineteen oh six and made its first report at Los Angeles in nineteen oh seven Since then the indefatigable chairman of the committee mister Chas I Rice of Worcester Mass has contributed generously of both time and strength and has by his annual reports to the Department set many of us to thinking along certain new lines and has caused some of us at any rate to adopt in our own teaching certain changes of terminology which have enabled us to make our work more effective In his first report mister Rice says Any one who has observed the teaching of school music in any considerable number of places in this country cannot fail to have remarked the great diversity of statement employed by different teachers regarding the facts 
4958-11613-0001	train-other-500	which we are engaged in teaching and the equal diversity of terminology used in teaching the symbols by which musicians seek to record these facts
4958-11613-0002	train-other-500	To the teacher of exact sciences our picturesque use of the same term to describe two or more entirely different things never ceases to be a marvel Thoughtful men and women will become impressed with the untruthfulness of certain statements and little by little change their practice
none	none	 Others will follow influenced by example The revolutionists will deride us for not moving faster while the conservatives will be suspicious of any change 
4958-11613-0003	train-other-500	At this meeting in Los Angeles a list of thirteen points was recommended by the committee and adopted by the Music Department
none	none	 These points are given in the N E A Volume of Proceedings for nineteen oh seven p eight hundred seventy five Since nineteen oh seven the committee consisting of Chas I Rice P C Hayden W B Kinnear Leo R Lewis and Constance Barlow Smith have each year selected a number of topics for discussion 
4958-11613-0005	train-other-500	and have submitted valuable reports recommending the adoption of certain reforms
none	none	 Some of the points recommended have usually been rejected by the Department but many of them have been adopted and the reports of the committee have set many teachers thinking and have made us all more careful in the use and definition of common terms A complete list of all points adopted by the Department since nineteen oh seven has been made by mister Rice for School Music and this list is here reprinted from the January nineteen thirteen number of that magazine TERMINOLOGY ADOPTIONS nineteen oh seven nineteen ten one Tone Specific name for a musical sound of definite pitch Use neither sound a general term nor note a term of notation two

4958-11613-0061	train-other-500	descending Same as the Primitive ADOPTIONS OF THE nineteen twelve MEETING AT CHICAGO Pulse and Beat The Committee finds that the words Pulse and Beat
4958-11613-0062	train-other-500	are in general use as synonymous terms meaning one of the succession of throbs or impulses of which we are conscious when listening to music Each of these pulses or beats has an exact point of beginning a duration and an exact point of ending
4958-11613-0063	train-other-500	the latter coincident with the beginning of the next pulse or beat When thus used both words are terms of ear Beat One of these words Beat is also in universal use
none	none	 meaning one of a series of physical motions by means of which a conductor holds his group of performers to a uniform movement 
4958-11613-0064	train-other-500	When thus used it becomes a term of eye The conductor s baton if it is to be authoritative cannot wander about through the whole duration of the pulse but must move quickly to a point of comparative repose
4958-11613-0065	train-other-500	remaining until just before the arrival of the next pulse when it again makes a rapid swing finishing coincidently with the initial tone or silence of the new pulse Thus it is practically the end of the conductor s beat that marks the beginning of the pulse
4958-11613-0066	train-other-500	The Committee is of opinion that Beat might preferably be used as indicating the outward sign Beat Note This term beat note is already in use in another important connection see Terminology Report nineteen eleven
4958-11613-0067	train-other-500	and the Committee recommends that those using the above terms shall say This note is an on the beat note this one is an after the beat note this one a before the beat note DEFINITIONS Matters of Ear
4958-11613-0068	train-other-500	Pulse The unit of movement in music one of a series of regularly recurring throbs or impulses Measure A group of pulses Pulse Group Two or more tones grouped within the pulse
none	none	 Matters of Eye 
4958-11613-0069	train-other-500	Beat One of a series of conventional movements made by the conductor This might include any unconventional motion which served to mark the movement of the music whether made by conductor performer or auditor Beat Note
4958-11613-0070	train-other-500	A note of the denomination indicated by the measure sign as the unit of note value in a given measure Example Given the following measure signs two four two two two eight quarter
4958-11613-0071	train-other-500	half or eighth notes respectively are beat notes Beat Group A group of notes or notes and rests of smaller denomination than the beat note which represents a full beat from beginning to end and is equal in value to the beat note
4958-11613-0072	train-other-500	A beat group may begin with a rest On the Beat Note or rest Any note or rest ranging in value from a full beat down which calls for musical action or inaction synchronously with the conductor s beat
4958-11613-0073	train-other-500	After the Beat Note Any note in a beat group which indicates that a tone is to be sounded after the beginning and before or at the middle of the pulse Before the Beat Note
4958-11613-0074	train-other-500	Any note in a beat group which indicates that a tone is to be sounded after the middle of the pulse To illustrate terminology and to differentiate between Pulse and Beat as terms respectively of ear and eye the following is submitted
none	none	 Whenever a brief tone involves the musical idea of syncopation 
4958-11613-0075	train-other-500	it may be regarded as an after the pulse tone and the note that calls for it as an after the beat note when it involves the idea of anticipation or preparation it may be regarded as a before the pulse tone and the note that calls for it as a before the beat note
4958-11613-0076	train-other-500	Measure and Meter What is the measure sign What is the meter signature These two words are used synonymously and one of them is unnecessary The Committee recommends that Measure be retained and used
4958-11613-0077	train-other-500	Meter has its use in connection with hymns The author does not find it possible at present to agree with all the recommendations made in the above report but the summary is printed in full for the sake of completeness
none	none	 The Music Teacher s National Association has also interested itself mildly in the subject of terminology reform and at its meeting in Washington D C in nineteen oh eight Professor Waldo S Pratt gave his address as president of the Association on the subject 
4958-11613-0079	train-other-500	System and Precision in Musical Speech
none	none	 This address interested the members of the Association to such an extent that Professor Pratt was asked to act as a committee whose purpose it should be 
4958-11613-0080	train-other-500	to look into the matter of reforms necessary in music terminology and report at a later session In nineteen ten Professor Pratt read a report in which he advocated the idea of making some changes in music nomenclature
4958-11613-0081	train-other-500	but took the ground that the subject is too comprehensive to be mastered in the short time that can be given to it by a committee and that it is therefore impossible to recommend specific changes
none	none	 He also took occasion to remark that one difficulty in the whole matter of terminology is that many terms and expressions are used colloquially and that such use although usually not scientific 
4958-11613-0082	train-other-500	is often not distinctly harmful and is not of sufficient importance to cause undue excitement on the part of reformers Quoting from the report at this point A great deal of confusion is more apparent than real between note and tone between step and degree
none	none	 between key and tonality 
4958-11613-0083	train-other-500	No practical harm is done by speaking of the first note of a piece when really first tone would be more accurate To say that a piece is written in the key of B flat
none	none	 is more convenient than to say that it is written in the tonality of which B flat is the tonic 
4958-11613-0084	train-other-500	The truth is that some of the niceties of expression upon which insistence is occasionally laid are merely fussy not because they have not some sort of reason but because they fail to take into account the practical difference between colloquial or off hand speech
4958-11613-0085	train-other-500	and the diction of a scientific treatise This is said without forgetting that colloquialism
none	none	 always needs watching and that some people form the habit of being careless or positively uncouth 
4958-11613-0086	train-other-500	as if it were a mark of high artistic genius Professor Pratt s report is thus seen to be philosophic rather than constructive and terminology reform will undoubtedly make more immediate progress through the efforts of the N E A Committee with its specific recommendations
4958-11613-0087	train-other-500	even though these are sometimes admittedly fussy
none	none	 than through the policy of the M T N A 
4958-11613-0088	train-other-500	of waiting for some one to get time to take up the subject in a scholarly way Nevertheless the philosophic view is sometimes badly needed especially when the spirit of reform becomes too rabid and attaches too great importance to trifles
none	none	 A judicious intermingling of the two committees in a series of joint meetings would undoubtedly result in mutual helpfulness and possibly also in a more tangible and convincing statement of
