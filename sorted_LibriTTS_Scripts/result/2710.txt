none	none	the books should be read and in which they were published these following comments should hopefully help most of our readers The Vicomte de Bragelonne is the final volume of D Artagnan Romances it is usually split into three or four parts and the final portion is entitled The Man in the Iron Mask The Man in the Iron Mask we re familiar with today is the last volume of the four volume edition Not all the editions split them in the same manner hence some of the confusion but wait there s yet more reason for confusion We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne split into four etexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne Ten Years Later Louise de la Valliere and The Man in the Iron Mask you WILL be getting The Man in the Iron Mask One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now entitled Ten Years Later says it s the sequel to The Three Musketeers While this is technically true there s another book Twenty Years After that comes between The confusion is generated by the two facts that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years After and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty Years After the original story however this is why the different words After and Later the Ten Years After is ten years after the Twenty Years later as per history Also the third book of the D Artagnan Romances while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne has the subtitle Ten Years Later These two titles are also given to different volumes The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book or the first volume of the three or four volume editions Ten Years Later can similarly refer to the whole book or the second volume of the four volume edition To add to the confusion in the case of our etexts it refers to the first one hundred four chapters of the whole book covering material in the first and second etexts in the new series Here is a guide to the series which may prove helpful The Three Musketeers Etext twelve fifty seven First book of the D Artagnan Romances Covers the years sixteen twenty five sixteen twenty eight Twenty Years After Etext twelve fifty nine Second book of the D Artagnan Romances Covers the years sixteen forty eight sixteen forty nine Third in the order that we published but second in time sequence Ten Years Later Etext twelve fifty eight First one hundred four chapters of the third book of the D Artagnan Romances Covers the years sixteen sixty sixteen sixty one The Vicomte de Bragelonne Etext twenty six

none	none	Both men are seriously wounded and the duke is taken back to England to recover Raoul s friend the Comte de Guiche is the next to succumb to Henrietta s charms and Monsieur obtains his exile as well though De Guiche soon effects a reconciliation But then the king s eye falls on Madame Henrietta during the comte s absence and this time Monsieur s jealousy has no recourse Anne of Austria intervenes and the king and his sister in law decide to pick a young lady with whom the king can pretend to be in love the better to mask their own affair They unfortunately select Louise de la Valliere Raoul s fiancee While the court is in residence at Fontainebleau the king unwitting overhears Louise confessing her love for him while chatting with her friends beneath the royal oak and the king promptly forgets his affection for Madame That same night Henrietta overhears at the same oak De Guiche confessing his love for her to Raoul The two embark on their own affair A few days later during a rainstorm Louis and Louise are trapped alone together and the whole court begins to talk of the scandal while their love affair blossoms Aware of Louise s attachment the king arranges for Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite period Meanwhile the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert Although the Belle Isle plot backfired Colbert prompts the king to ask Fouquet for more and more money and without his two friends to raise it for him Fouquet is sorely pressed The situation gets so bad that his new mistress Madame de Belliere must resort to selling all her jewels and her gold and silver plate Aramis while this is going on has grown friendly with the governor of the Bastile M de Baisemeaux a fact that Baisemeaux unwittingly reveals to D Artagnan while inquiring of him as to Aramis s whereabouts This further arouses the suspicions of the musketeer who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis He had ridden overnight at an insane pace but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet had already presented Belle Isle to the king Aramis learns from the governor the location of a mysterious prisoner who bears a remarkable resemblance to Louis XIV in fact the two are identical He uses the existence of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk the general of the society of the Jesuits to name him Aramis the new general of the order On Aramis s advice hoping to use Louise s influence with the king to counteract Colbert s influence Fouquet also writes a love letter to La Valliere unfortunately undated It never reaches its destination however as the servant ordered to deliver it turns out to be an agent of Colbert s Porthos in the meantime has been recovering from his midnight ride from Belle Isle at Fouquet s residence at Saint Mande Athos has retired once again to La Fere D Artagnan little amused by the court s activities at Fontainebleau and finding himself with nothing to do has returned to Paris and we find him again in Planchet s grocery shop And so the story continues in this the third etext of The Vicomte de Bragelonne Enjoy John Bursey Chapter I Malaga During all these long and noisy debates between the opposite ambitions of politics and love one of our characters perhaps the one least deserving of neglect was however very much neglected very much forgotten and exceedingly unhappy In fact D Artagnan D Artagnan we say for we must call him by his name to remind our readers of his existence D Artagnan we repeat had absolutely nothing whatever to do amidst these brilliant butterflies of fashion After following the king during two whole days at Fontainebleau and critically observing the various pastoral fancies and heroi comic transformations of his sovereign the musketeer felt that he needed something more than this to satisfy the cravings of his nature At every moment assailed by people asking him How do you think this costume suits me Monsieur d Artagnan he would reply to them in quiet sarcastic tones Why I think you are quite as well dressed as the best dressed monkey to be found in the fair at Saint Laurent It was just such a compliment D Artagnan would choose

none	none	he did not feel disposed to pay any other and whether agreeable or not the inquirer was obliged to be satisfied with it Whenever any one asked him How do you intend to dress yourself this evening he replied I shall undress myself at which the ladies all laughed and a few of them blushed But after a couple of days passed in this manner the musketeer perceiving that nothing serious was likely to arise which would concern him and that the king had completely or at least appeared to have completely forgotten Paris Saint Mande and Belle Isle that M Colbert s mind was occupied with illuminations and fireworks that for the next month at least the ladies had plenty of glances to bestow and also to receive in exchange D Artagnan asked the king for leave of absence for a matter of private business At the moment D Artagnan made his request his majesty was on the point of going to bed quite exhausted from dancing You wish to leave me Monsieur d Artagnan inquired the king with an air of astonishment for Louis XIV could never understand why any one who had the distinguished honor of being near him could wish to leave him Sire said D Artagnan I leave you simply because I am not of the slightest service to you in anything Ah if I could only hold the balancing pole while you were dancing it would be a very different affair But my dear Monsieur d Artagnan said the king gravely people dance without balancing poles Ah indeed said the musketeer continuing his imperceptible tone of irony I had no idea such a thing was possible You have not seen me dance then inquired the king Yes but I always thought dancers went from easy to difficult acrobatic feats I was mistaken all the more greater reason therefore that I should leave for a time Sire I repeat you have no present occasion for my services besides if your majesty should have any need of me you would know where to find me Very well said the king and he granted him leave of absence We shall not look for D Artagnan therefore at Fontainebleau for to do so would be useless but with the permission of our readers follow him to the Rue des Lombards where he was located at the sign of the Pilon d Or in the house of our old friend Planchet It was about eight o clock in the evening and the weather was exceedingly warm there was only one window open and that one belonging to a room on the entresol A perfume of spices mingled with another perfume less exotic but more penetrating namely that which arose from the street ascended to salute the nostrils of the musketeer D Artagnan reclining in an immense straight backed chair with his legs not stretched out but simply placed upon a stool formed an angle of the most obtuse form that could possibly be seen Both his arms were crossed over his head his head reclining upon his left shoulder like Alexander the Great His eyes usually so quick and intelligent in their expression were now half closed and seemed fastened as it were upon a small corner of blue sky that was visible behind the opening of the chimneys there was just enough blue and no more to fill one of the sacks of lentils or haricots which formed the principal furniture of the shop on the ground floor Thus extended at his ease and sheltered in his place of observation behind the window D Artagnan seemed as if he had ceased to be a soldier as if he were no longer an officer belonging to the palace but was on the contrary a quiet easy going citizen in a state of stagnation between his dinner and supper or between his supper and his bed one of those strong ossified brains which have no more room for a single idea so fiercely does animal matter keep watch at the doors of intelligence narrowly inspecting the contraband trade which might result from the introduction into the brain of a symptom of thought We have already said night was closing in the shops were being lighted while the windows of the upper apartments were being closed and the rhythmic steps of a patrol of soldiers forming the night watch could be heard retreating D Artagnan continued however to think of nothing except the blue corner of the sky A few paces from him completely in the shade lying on his stomach upon a sack of Indian corn was Planchet with both his arms under his chin and his eyes fixed on D Artagnan who was either thinking dreaming or sleeping with his eyes open Planchet had been watching him for a tolerably long time and by way of interruption he began by exclaiming Hum hum But D Artagnan did not stir Planchet then saw that it was necessary to have recourse to more effectual means still after a prolonged reflection on the subject the most ingenious means that suggested itself to him under the present circumstances was to let himself roll off the sack on to the floor murmuring at the same time against himself the word stupid But notwithstanding the noise produced by Planchet s fall D Artagnan who had in the course of his existence heard many other and very different falls did not appear to pay the least attention to the present one Besides an enormous cart laden with stones passing from the Rue Saint Mederic absorbed in the noise of its wheels the noise of Planchet s tumble And yet Planchet fancied that in token of tacit approval he saw him imperceptibly smile at the word stupid This emboldened him to say Are you asleep Monsieur d Artagnan No Planchet I am not even asleep replied the musketeer I am in despair said Planchet to hear such a word as even Well and why not is it not a grammatical word Monsieur Planchet Of course Monsieur d Artagnan Well Well then the word distresses me beyond measure 
8063_274112_000065_000001	train-clean-100	Tell me 
none	none	why you are distressed Planchet said D Artagnan If you say that you are not even asleep it is as much as to say that you have not even the consolation of being able to sleep or better still it is precisely the same as telling me that you are getting bored to death Planchet you know that I am never bored
8063_274112_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Except to day and the day before yesterday 
none	none	Bah Monsieur d Artagnan it is a week since you returned here from Fontainebleau in other words you have no longer your orders to issue or your men to review and maneuver You need the sound of guns drums and all that din and confusion I who have myself carried a musket can easily believe that Planchet replied D Artagnan I assure you I am not bored in the least in the world In that case what are you doing lying there as if you were dead My dear Planchet there was once upon a time at the siege of La Rochelle when I was there when you were there when we both were there a certain Arab who was celebrated for the manner in which he adjusted culverins 
8063_274112_000027_000001	train-clean-100	He was a clever fellow although of a very odd complexion which was the same color as your olives 
none	none	Well this Arab whenever he had done eating or working used to sit down to rest himself as I am resting myself now and smoked I cannot tell you what sort of magical leaves in a large amber mouthed tube and if any officers happening to pass reproached him for being always asleep he used quietly to reply Better to sit down than to stand up to lie down than to sit down to be dead than to lie down He was an acutely melancholy Arab and I remember him perfectly well form the color of his skin and the style of his conversation He used to cut off the heads of Protestants with the most singular gusto Precisely and then used to embalm them when they were worth the trouble and when he was thus engaged with his herbs and plants about him he looked like a basket maker making baskets You are quite right Planchet he did Oh I can remember things very well at times
8063_274112_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 I have no doubt of it but what do you think of his mode of reasoning 
none	none	I think it
8063_274112_000177_000000	train-clean-100	 good 
none	none	in one sense but very stupid in another Expound your meaning M Planchet Well monsieur in point of fact then better to sit down than to stand up is plain enough especially when one may be fatigued and Planchet smiled in a roguish way as for better to be lying down let that pass but as for the last proposition that it is better to be dead than alive it is in my opinion very absurd my own undoubted preference being for my bed and if you are not of my opinion it is simply as I have already had the honor of telling you because you are boring yourself to death Planchet do you know M La Fontaine The chemist at the corner of the Rue Saint Mederic No the writer of fables Oh Maitre Corbeau Exactly well then I am like his hare He has got a hare also then He has all sorts of animals
8063_274112_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Well what does his hare do then

none	none	Ah ah Planchet I am like that hare I am thinking You are thinking you say said Planchet uneasily Yes your house is dull enough to drive people to think you will admit that I hope And yet monsieur you have a look out upon the street Yes and wonderfully interesting that is of course But it is no less true monsieur that if you were living at the back of the house you would bore yourself I mean you would think more than ever Upon my word Planchet I hardly know that Still said the grocer if your reflections are at all like those which led you to restore King Charles II and Planchet finished by a little laugh which was not without its meaning Ah Planchet my friend returned D Artagnan you are getting ambitious Is there no other king to be restored M d Artagnan no second Monk to be packed up like a salted hog in a deal box No my dear Planchet all the kings are seated on their respective thrones less comfortably so perhaps than I am upon this chair but at all events there they are And D Artagnan sighed deeply Monsieur d Artagnan said Planchet you are making me very uneasy You are very good Planchet I begin to suspect something

none	none	You have had the nightmare during the last three nights I Yes you and in your nightmare you called out several times Aramis deceitful Aramis Ah I said that did I murmured D Artagnan uneasily Yes those very words upon my honor Well what else You know the saying Planchet dreams go by contraries Not so for every time during the last three days when you went out you have not once failed to ask me on your return Have you seen M d Herblay or else Have you received any letters for me from M d Herblay Well it is very natural I should take an interest in my old friend said D Artagnan Of course but not to such an extent as to get thin on that account Planchet I ll get fatter I give you my word of honor I will
8063_274112_000086_000000	train-clean-100	 Very well monsieur I accept it for I know that when you give your word of honor it is sacred 
none	none	I will not dream of Aramis any more and I will never ask you again if there are any letters from M d Herblay but on condition that you explain one thing to me Tell me what it is monsieur I am a great observer and just now you made use of a very singular oath which is unusual for you You mean Malaga I suppose Precisely It is the oath I have used ever since I have been a grocer Very proper too it is the name of a dried grape or raisin I believe It is my most ferocious oath when I have once said Malaga I am a man no longer Still I never knew you use that oath before Very likely not monsieur I had a present made me of it said Planchet and as he pronounced these words he winked his eye with a cunning expression which thoroughly awakened D Artagnan s attention Come come M Planchet Why I am not like you monsieur said Planchet

8063_274112_000132_000001	train-clean-100	You have noticed it then 
none	none	My dear Planchet you must understand that when people see each other every day and one of the two absents himself the other misses him Do you not feel the want of my society when I am in the country Prodigiously that is to say I feel like a body without a soul

none	none	To look after your debts I suppose And when I returned how did you think I looked as far as my face was concerned Exceedingly self satisfied You admit you say that I always look satisfied And what have you attributed my satisfaction to That your business was going on very well that your purchases of rice prunes raw sugar dried apples pears and treacle were advantageous You were always very picturesque in your notions and ideas Planchet and I was not in the slightest degree surprised to find you had selected grocery as an occupation which is of all trades the most varied and the very pleasantest as far as the character is concerned inasmuch as one handles so many natural and perfumed productions Perfectly true monsieur but you are very greatly mistaken In what way In thinking that I leave here every fortnight to collect my money or to make purchases Ho ho how could you possibly have thought such a thing Ho ho ho And Planchet began to laugh in a manner that inspired D Artagnan with very serious misgivings as to his sanity I confess said the musketeer that I do not precisely catch your meaning Very true monsieur What do you mean by very true It must be true since you say it but pray be assured that it in no way lessens my opinion of you Ah that is lucky No you are a man of genius and whenever the question happens to be of war tactics surprises or good honest blows to be dealt with why kings are marionettes compared to you But for the consolations of the mind the proper care of the body the agreeable things of like if one may say so ah monsieur don t talk to me about men of genius they are nothing short of executioners Good said D Artagnan really fidgety with curiosity upon my word you interest me in the highest degree You feel already less bored than you did just now do you not

8063_274112_000182_000000	train-clean-100	 Exactly to Fontainebleau 
none	none	And in Heaven s name what are you going to do at Fontainebleau Planchet answered D Artagnan by a wink full of sly humor You have some property there you rascal Oh a very paltry affair a little bit of a house nothing more I understand you But it is tolerable enough after all I am going to Planchet s country seat exclaimed D Artagnan Whenever you like

8063_274112_000197_000000	train-clean-100	 Besides what 
none	none	Why added Planchet I do not wish to fatigue myself Why so D Artagnan ventured to ask Because I should lose half the pleasure I expect to enjoy replied Planchet And thereupon he rose from his sack of Indian corn stretching himself and making all his bones crack one after the other with a sort of harmony Planchet Planchet exclaimed D Artagnan I do declare that there is no sybarite upon the face of the globe who can for a moment be compared to you Oh Planchet it is very clear that we have never yet eaten a ton of salt together Why so monsieur Because even now I can scarcely say I know you said D Artagnan and because in point of fact I return to the opinion which for a moment I had formed of you that day at Boulogne when you strangled or did so as nearly as possible M de Wardes s valet Lubin in plain language Planchet that you are a man of great resources Planchet began to laugh with a laugh full of self conceit bade the musketeer good night and went down to his back shop which he used as a bedroom D Artagnan resumed his original position upon his chair and his brow which had been unruffled for a moment became more pensive than ever He had already forgotten the whims and dreams of Planchet Yes said he taking up again the thread of his thoughts which had been broken by the whimsical conversation in which we have just permitted our readers to participate Yes yes those three points include everything First to ascertain what Baisemeaux wanted with Aramis secondly to learn why Aramis does not let me hear from him and thirdly to ascertain where Porthos is The whole mystery lies in these three points Since therefore continued D Artagnan our friends tell us nothing we must have recourse to our own poor intelligence I must do what I can mordioux or rather Malaga as Planchet would say Chapter II A Letter from M Baisemeaux D Artagnan faithful to his plan went the very next morning to pay a visit to M de Baisemeaux It was cleaning up or tidying day at the Bastile the cannons were furbished up the staircases scraped and cleaned and the jailers seemed to be carefully engaged in polishing the very keys As for the soldiers belonging to the garrison they were walking about in different courtyards under the pretense that they were clean enough The governor Baisemeaux received D Artagnan with more than ordinary politeness but he behaved towards him with so marked a reserve of manner that all D Artagnan s tact and cleverness could not get a syllable out of him The more he kept himself within bounds the more D Artagnan s suspicion increased The latter even fancied he remarked that the governor was acting under the influence of a recent recommendation Baisemeaux had not been at the Palais Royal with D Artagnan the same cold and impenetrable man which the latter now found in the Baisemeaux of the Bastile When D Artagnan wished to make him talk about the urgent money matters which had brought Baisemeaux in search of D Artagnan and had rendered him expansive notwithstanding what had passed on that evening Baisemeaux pretended that he had some orders to give in the prison and left D Artagnan so long alone waiting for him that our musketeer feeling sure that he should not get another syllable out of him left the Bastile without waiting until Baisemeaux returned from his inspection But D Artagnan s suspicions were aroused and when once that was the case D Artagnan could not sleep or remain quiet for a moment He was among men what the cat is among quadrupeds the emblem of anxiety and impatience at the same moment A restless cat can no more remain the same place than a silk thread wafted idly to and fro with every breath of air A cat on the watch is as motionless as death stationed at its place of observation and neither hunger nor thirst can draw it from its meditations D Artagnan who was burning with impatience suddenly threw aside the feeling like a cloak which he felt too heavy on his shoulders and said to himself that that which they were concealing from him was the very thing it was important he should know and consequently he reasoned that Baisemeaux would not fail to put Aramis on his guard if Aramis had given him any particular recommendation and this was in fact the very thing that happened Baisemeaux had hardly had time to return from the donjon than D Artagnan placed himself in ambuscade close to the Rue de Petit Musc so as to see every one who might leave the gates of the Bastile After he had spent an hour on the look out from the Golden Portcullis under the pent house of which he could keep himself a little in the shade D Artagnan observed a soldier leave the Bastile This was indeed the surest indication he could possibly have wished for as every jailer or warder has certain days and even certain hours for leaving the Bastile since all are alike prohibited from having either wives or lodgings in the castle and can accordingly leave without exciting any curiosity but a soldier once in barracks is kept there for four and twenty hours when on duty and no one knew this better than D Artagnan The guardsman in question therefore was not likely to leave his regimentals except on an express and urgent order The soldier we were saying left the Bastile at a slow and lounging pace like a happy mortal in fact who instead of mounting sentry before a wearisome guard house or upon a bastion no less wearisome has the good luck to get a little liberty in addition to a walk both pleasures being luckily reckoned as part of his time on duty He bent his steps towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine enjoying the fresh air and the warmth of the sun and looking at all the pretty faces he passed D Artagnan followed him at a distance he had
8063_274117_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 not yet 
none	none	arranged his ideas as what was to be done I must first of all he thought see the fellow s face A man seen is a man judged D Artagnan increased his pace and which was not very difficult by the by soon got in advance of the soldier Not only did he observe that his face showed a tolerable amount of intelligence and resolution but he noticed also that his nose was a little red He has a weakness for brandy I see said D Artagnan to himself At the same moment that he remarked his red nose he saw that the soldier had a white paper in his belt Good he has a letter added D Artagnan The only difficulty was to get hold of the letter But a common soldier would of course be only too delighted at having been selected by M de Baisemeaux as a special messenger and would not be likely to sell his message As D Artagnan was biting his nails the soldier continued to advance more and more into the Faubourg Saint Antoine He is certainly going to Saint Mande he said to himself and I shall not be able to learn what the letter contains It was enough to drive him wild If I were in uniform said D Artagnan to himself I would have this fellow seized and his letter with him I could easily get assistance at the very first guard house but the devil take me if I mention my name in an affair of this kind If I were to treat him to something to drink his suspicions would be roused and besides he might drink me drunk Mordioux my wits seem to have left me said D Artagnan it is all over with me Yet supposing I were to attack this poor devil make him draw his sword and kill him for the sake of his letter No harm in that if it were a question of a letter from a queen to a nobleman or a letter from a cardinal to a queen but what miserable intrigues are those of Messieurs Aramis and Fouquet with M Colbert A man s life for that No no indeed not even ten crowns As he philosophized in this manner biting first his nails and then his mustaches he perceived a group of archers and a commissary of the police engaged in carrying away a man of very gentlemanly exterior who was struggling with all his might against them The archers had torn his clothes and were dragging him roughly away He begged they would lead him along more respectfully asserting that he was a gentleman and a soldier And observing our soldier walking in the street he called out Help comrade The soldier walked on with the same step towards the man who had called out to him followed by the crowd An idea suddenly occurred to D Artagnan it was his first one and we shall find it was not a bad one either During the time the gentleman was relating to the soldier that he had just been seized in a house as a thief when the truth was he was only there as a lover and while the soldier was pitying him and offering him consolation and advice with that gravity which a French soldier has always ready whenever his vanity or his esprit de corps is concerned D Artagnan glided behind the soldier who was closely hemmed in by the crowd and with a rapid sweep like a sabre slash snatched the letter from his belt As at this moment the gentleman with the torn clothes was pulling about the soldier to show how the commissary of police had pulled him about D Artagnan effected his pillage of the letter without the slightest interference He stationed himself about ten paces distant behind the pillar of an adjoining house and read on the address To Monsieur du Vallon at Monsieur Fouquet s Saint Mande Good he said and then he unsealed without tearing the letter drew out the paper which was folded in four from the inside which contained only these words DEAR MONSIEUR DU VALLON Will you be good enough to tell Monsieur d Herblay that he has been to the Bastile and has been making inquiries Your devoted DE BAISEMEAUX Very good all right exclaimed D Artagnan it is clear enough now Porthos is engaged in it Being now satisfied of what he wished to know Mordioux thought the musketeer what is to be done with that poor devil of a soldier That hot headed cunning fellow De Baisemeaux will make him pay dearly for my trick if he returns without the letter what will they do to him Besides I don t want the letter when the egg has been sucked what is the good of the shell D Artagnan perceived that the commissary and the archers had succeeded in convincing the soldier and went on their way with the prisoner the latter being still surrounded by the crowd and continuing his complaints D Artagnan advanced into the very middle of the crowd let the letter fall without any one having observed him and then retreated rapidly The soldier resumed his route towards Saint Mande his mind occupied with the gentleman who had implored his protection Suddenly he thought of his letter and looking at his belt saw that it was no longer there D Artagnan derived no little satisfaction from his sudden terrified cry The poor soldier in the greatest anguish of mind looked round him on every side and at last about twenty paces behind him he perceived the lucky envelope He pounced on it like a falcon on its prey The envelope was certainly a little dirty and rather crumpled but at all events the letter itself was found D Artagnan observed that the broken seal attracted the soldier s attention a good deal but he finished apparently by consoling himself and returned the letter to his belt Go on said D Artagnan I have plenty of time before me so you may precede me It appears that Aramis is not in Paris since Baisemeaux writes to Porthos Dear Porthos how delighted I shall be to see him again and to have some conversation with him said the Gascon And regulating his pace according to that of the soldier he promised himself to arrive a quarter of an hour after him at M Fouquet s Chapter III In Which the Reader will be Delighted to Find that Porthos Has Lost Nothing of His Muscularity D Artagnan had according to his usual style calculated that every hour is worth sixty minutes and every minute worth sixty seconds Thanks to this perfectly exact calculation of minutes and seconds he reached the superintendent s door at the very moment the soldier was leaving it with his belt empty D Artagnan presented himself at the door which a porter with a profusely embroidered livery held half opened for him D Artagnan would very much have liked to enter without giving his name but this was impossible and so he gave it Notwithstanding this concession which ought to have removed every difficulty in the way at least D Artagnan thought so the concierge hesitated however at the second repetition of the title captain of the king s guards the concierge without quite leaving the passage clear for him ceased to bar it completely D Artagnan understood that orders of the most positive character had been given He decided therefore to tell a falsehood a circumstance moreover which did not seriously affect his peace of mind when he saw that beyond the falsehood the safety of the state itself or even purely and simply his own individual personal interest might be at stake He moreover added to the declarations he had already made that the soldier sent to M du Vallon was his own messenger and that the only object that letter had in view was to announce his intended arrival From that moment no one opposed D Artagnan s entrance any further and he entered accordingly A valet wished to accompany him but he answered that it was useless to take that trouble on his account inasmuch as he knew perfectly well where M du Vallon was There was nothing of course to say to a man so thoroughly and completely informed on all points and D Artagnan was permitted therefore to do as he liked The terraces the magnificent apartments the gardens were all reviewed and narrowly inspected by the musketeer He walked for a quarter of an hour in this more than royal residence which included as many wonders as articles of furniture and as many servants as there were columns and doors Decidedly he said to himself this mansion has no other limits than the pillars of the habitable world Is it probable Porthos has taken it into his head to go back to Pierrefonds without even leaving M Fouquet s house He finally reached a remote part of the chateau inclosed by a stone wall which was covered with a profusion of thick plants luxuriant in blossoms as large and solid as fruit At equal distances on the top of this wall were placed various statues in timid or mysterious attitudes These were vestals hidden beneath the long Greek peplum with its thick sinuous folds agile nymphs covered with their marble veils and guarding the palace with their fugitive glances A statue of Hermes with his finger on his lips one of Iris with extended wings another of Night sprinkled all over with poppies dominated the gardens and outbuildings which could be seen through the trees All these statues threw in white relief their profiles upon the dark ground of the tall cypresses which darted their somber summits towards the sky Around these cypresses were entwined climbing roses whose flowering rings were fastened to every fork of the branches and spread over the lower boughs and the various statues showers of flowers of the rarest fragrance These enchantments seemed to the musketeer the result of the greatest efforts of the human mind He felt in a dreamy almost poetical frame of mind The idea that Porthos was living in so perfect an Eden gave him a higher idea of Porthos showing how tremendously true it is that even the very highest orders of minds are not quite exempt from the influence of surroundings D Artagnan found the door and on or rather in the door a kind of spring which he detected having touched it the door flew open D Artagnan entered closed the door behind him and advanced into a pavilion built in a circular form in which no other sound could be heard but cascades and the songs of birds At the door of the pavilion he met a lackey It is here I believe said D Artagnan without hesitation that M le Baron du Vallon is staying Yes monsieur answered the lackey Have the goodness to tell him that M le Chevalier d Artagnan captain of the king s musketeers is waiting to see him D Artagnan was introduced into the salon and had not long to remain in expectation a well remembered step shook the floor of the adjoining room a door opened or rather flew open and Porthos appeared and threw himself into his friend s arms with a sort of embarrassment which did not ill become him You here he exclaimed And you replied D Artagnan Ah you sly fellow Yes said Porthos with a somewhat embarrassed smile yes you see I am staying in M Fouquet s house at which you are not a little surprised I suppose Not at all why should you not be one of M Fouquet s friends M Fouquet has a very large number particularly among clever men Porthos had the modesty not to take the compliment to himself Besides he added you saw me at Belle Isle A greater reason for my believing you to be one of M Fouquet s friends The fact is I am acquainted with him said Porthos with a certain embarrassment of manner Ah friend Porthos said D Artagnan how treacherously you have behaved towards me In what way exclaimed Porthos What you complete so admirable a work as the fortifications of Belle Isle and you did not tell me of it Porthos colored Nay more than that continued D Artagnan you saw me out yonder you know I am in the king s service and yet you could not guess that the king jealously desirous of learning the name of the man whose abilities had wrought a work of which he heard the most wonderful accounts you could not guess I say that the king sent me to learn who this man was What the king sent you to learn Of course but don t let us speak of that any more Not speak of it said Porthos on the contrary we will speak of it and so the king knew that we were fortifying Belle Isle Of course does not the king know everything But he did not know who was fortifying it No he only suspected from what he had been told of the nature of the works that it was some celebrated soldier or another The devil said Porthos if I had only known that You would not have run away from Vannes as you did perhaps No what did you say when you couldn t find me My dear fellow I reflected Ah indeed you reflect do you Well and what did that reflection lead to It led me to guess the whole truth Come then tell me what did you guess after all said Porthos settling himself into an armchair and assuming the airs of a sphinx I guessed in the first place that you were fortifying Belle Isle There was no great difficulty in that for you saw me at work Wait a minute I also guessed something else that you were fortifying Belle Isle by M Fouquet s orders That s true But even that is not all Whenever I feel myself in trim for guessing I do not stop on my road and so I guessed that M Fouquet wished to preserve the most absolute secrecy respecting these fortifications I believe that was his intention in fact said Porthos Yes but do you know why he wished to keep it secret In order it should not become known perhaps said Porthos That was his principal reason But his wish was subservient to a bit of generosity In fact said Porthos I have heard it said that M Fouquet was a very generous man To a bit of generosity he wished to exhibit towards the king Oh oh You seem surprised at that Yes And you didn t guess No Well I know it then You are a wizard Not at all I assure you How do you know it then By a very simple means I heard M Fouquet himself say so to the king Say what to the king That he fortified Belle Isle on his majesty s account and that he had made him a present of Belle Isle And you heard M Fouquet say that to the king In those very words He even added Belle Isle has been fortified by an engineer one of my friends a man of a great deal of merit whom I shall ask your majesty s permission to present to you What is his name said the king The Baron du Vallon M Fouquet replied Very well returned his majesty you will present him to me The king said that Upon the word of a D Artagnan Oh oh said Porthos Why have I not been presented then Have they not spoken to you about this presentation Yes certainly but I am always kept waiting for it Be easy it will be sure to come Humph humph grumbled Porthos which D Artagnan pretended not to hear and changing the conversation he said You seem to be living in a very solitary place here my dear fellow I always preferred retirement I am of a melancholy disposition replied Porthos with a sigh Really that is odd said D Artagnan I never remarked that before It is only since I have taken to reading said Porthos with a thoughtful air But the labors of the mind have not affected the health of the body I trust Not in the slightest degree Your strength is as great as ever Too great my friend too great Ah I had heard that for a short time after your arrival That I could hardly move a limb I suppose How was it said D Artagnan smiling and why was it you could not move Porthos perceiving that he had made a mistake wished to correct it Yes I came from Belle Isle upon very hard horses he said and that fatigued me I am no longer astonished then since I who followed you found seven or eight lying dead on the road I am very heavy you know said Porthos So that you were bruised all over My marrow melted and that made me very ill Poor Porthos But how did Aramis act towards you under those circumstances Very well indeed He had me attended to by M Fouquet s own doctor But just imagine at the end of a week I could not breathe any longer What do you mean The room was too small I had absorbed every atom of air Indeed I was told so at least and so I was removed into another apartment Where you were able to breathe I hope and trust Yes more freely but no exercise nothing to do The doctor pretended that I was not to stir I on the contrary felt that I was stronger than ever that was the cause of a very serious accident What accident Fancy my dear fellow that I revolted against the directions of that ass of a doctor and I resolved to go out whether it suited him or not and consequently I told the valet who waited on me to bring me my clothes You were quite naked then Oh no on the contrary I had a magnificent dressing gown to wear The lackey obeyed I dressed myself in my own clothes which had become too large for me but a strange circumstance had happened my feet had become too large Yes I quite understand And my boots too small You mean your feet were still swollen Exactly you have hit it Pardieu And is that the accident you were going to tell me about Oh yes I did not make the same reflection you have done I said to myself Since my feet have entered my boots ten times there is no reason why they should not go in the eleventh Allow me to tell you my dear Porthos that on this occasion you failed in your logic In short then they placed me opposite to a part of the room which was partitioned I tried to get my boot on I pulled it with my hands I pushed with all the strength of the muscles of my leg making the most unheard of efforts when suddenly the two tags of my boot remained in my hands and my foot struck out like a ballista How learned you are in fortification dear Porthos My foot darted out like a ballista and came against the partition which it broke in I really thought that like Samson I had demolished the temple And the number of pictures the quantity of china vases of flowers carpets and window panes that fell down were really wonderful Indeed Without reckoning that on the other side of the partition was a small table laden with porcelain Which you knocked over Which I dashed to the other side of the room said Porthos laughing Upon my word it is as you say astonishing replied D Artagnan beginning to laugh also whereupon Porthos laughed louder than ever I broke said Porthos in a voice half choked from his increasing mirth more than three thousand francs worth of china ha ha ha Good said D Artagnan I smashed more than four thousand francs worth of glass ho ho ho Excellent Without counting a luster which fell on my head and was broken into a thousand pieces ha ha ha Upon your head said D Artagnan holding his sides On top But your head was broken I suppose No since I tell you on the contrary my dear fellow that it was the luster which was broken like glass which in point of fact it was Ah the luster was glass you say Venetian glass a perfect curiosity quite matchless indeed and weighed two hundred pounds And it fell upon your head Upon my head Just imagine a globe of crystal gilded all over the lower part beautifully encrusted perfumes burning at the top with jets from which flame issued when they were lighted I quite understand but they were not lighted at the time I suppose Happily not or I should have been grilled prematurely And you were only knocked down flat instead Not at all How not at all Why the luster fell on my skull It appears that we have upon the top of our heads an exceedingly thick crust Who told you that Porthos The doctor A sort of dome which would bear Notre Dame Bah Yes it seems that our skulls are made in that manner Speak for yourself my dear fellow it is your own skull that is made in that manner and not the skulls of other people Well that may be so said Porthos conceitedly so much however was that the case in my instance that no sooner did the luster fall upon the dome which we have at the top of our head than there was a report like a cannon the crystal was broken to pieces and I fell covered from head to foot With blood poor Porthos Not at all with perfumes which smelt like rich creams it was delicious but the odor was too strong and I felt quite giddy from it perhaps you have experienced it sometimes yourself D Artagnan Yes in inhaling the scent of the lily of the valley so that my poor friend you were knocked over by the shock and overpowered by the perfumes Yes but what is very remarkable for the doctor told me he had never seen anything like it You had a bump on your head I suppose interrupted D Artagnan I had five Why five I will tell you the luster had at its lower extremity five gilt ornaments excessively sharp Oh Well these five ornaments penetrated my hair which as you see I wear very thick Fortunately so And they made a mark on my skin But just notice the singularity of it these things seem really only to happen to me Instead of making indentations they made bumps The doctor could never succeed in explaining that to me satisfactorily Well then I will explain it to you You will do me a great service if you will said Porthos winking his eyes which with him was sign of the profoundest attention Since you have been employing your brain in studies of an exalted character in important calculations and so on the head has gained a certain advantage so that your head is now too full of science Do you think so I am sure of it The result is that instead of allowing any foreign matter to penetrate the interior of the head your bony box or skull which is already too full avails itself of the openings which are made in allowing this excess to escape Ah said Porthos to whom this explanation appeared clearer than that of the doctor The five protuberances caused by the five ornaments of the luster must certainly have been scientific globules brought to the surface by the force of circumstances In fact said Porthos the real truth is that I felt far worse outside my head than inside I will even confess that when I put my hat upon my head clapping it on my head with that graceful energy which we gentlemen of the sword possess if my fist was not very gently applied I experienced the most painful sensations I quite believe you Porthos Therefore my friend said the giant M Fouquet decided seeing how slightly built the house was to give me another lodging and so they brought me here It is the private park I think is it not Yes Where the rendezvous are made that park indeed which is so celebrated in some of those mysterious stories about the superintendent I don t know I have had no rendezvous or heard mysterious stories myself but they have authorized me to exercise my muscles and I take advantage of the permission by rooting up some of the trees What for To keep my hand in and also to take some birds nests I find it more convenient than climbing You are as pastoral as Tyrcis my dear Porthos Yes I like the small eggs I like them very much better than larger ones You have no idea how delicate an omelette is if made of four or five hundred eggs of linnets chaffinches starlings blackbirds and thrushes But five hundred eggs is perfectly monstrous A salad bowl will hold them easily enough said Porthos D Artagnan looked at Porthos admiringly for full five minutes as if he had seen him for the first time while Porthos spread his chest out joyously and proudly They remained in this state several minutes Porthos smiling and D Artagnan looking at him D Artagnan was evidently trying to give the conversation a new turn Do you amuse yourself much here Porthos he asked at last very likely after he had found out what he was searching for Not always I can imagine that but when you get thoroughly bored by and by what do you intend to do Oh I shall not be here for any length of time Aramis is waiting until the last bump on my head disappears in order to present me to the king who I am told cannot endure the sight of a bump Aramis is still in Paris then No Whereabouts is he then At Fontainebleau Alone With M Fouquet Very good But do you happen to know one thing No tell it me and then I shall know Well then I think Aramis is forgetting you Do you really think so Yes for at Fontainebleau yonder you must know they are laughing dancing banqueting and drawing the corks of M de Mazarin s wine in fine style Are you aware that they have a ballet every evening there The deuce they have I assure you that your dear Aramis is forgetting you Well that is not at all unlikely and I have myself thought so sometimes Unless he is playing you a trick the sly fellow Oh You know that Aramis is as sly as a fox Yes but to play me a trick Listen in the first place he puts you under a sort of sequestration He sequestrates me Do you mean to say I am sequestrated I think so I wish you would have the goodness to prove that to me Nothing easier Do you ever go out Never Do you ever ride on horseback Never Are your friends allowed to come and see you Never Very well then never to go out never to ride on horseback never to be allowed to see your friends that is called being sequestrated But why should Aramis sequestrate me inquired Porthos Come said D Artagnan be frank Porthos As gold It was Aramis who drew the plan of the fortifications at Belle Isle was it not Porthos colored as he said Yes but that was all he did Exactly and my own opinion is that it was no very great affair after all That is mine too Very good I am delighted we are of the same opinion He never even came to Belle Isle said Porthos There now you see It was I who went to Vannes as you may have seen Say rather as I did see Well that is precisely the state of the case my dear Porthos Aramis who only drew the plans wishes to pass himself off as the engineer whilst you who stone by stone built the wall the citadel and the bastions he wishes to reduce to the rank of a mere builder By builder you mean mason perhaps Mason the very word Plasterer in fact Hodman Exactly Oh oh my dear Aramis you seem to think you are only five and twenty years of age still Yes and that is not all for he believes you are fifty I should have amazingly liked to have seen him at work Yes indeed A fellow who has got the gout Yes Who has lost three of his teeth Four While I look at mine And Porthos opening his large mouth very wide displayed two rows of teeth not quite as white as snow but even hard and sound as ivory You can hardly believe Porthos said D Artagnan what a fancy the king has for good teeth Yours decide me I will present you to the king myself You Why not Do you think I have less credit at court than Aramis Oh no Do you think I have the slightest pretensions upon the fortifications at Belle Isle Certainly not It is your own interest alone which would induce me to do it I don t doubt it in the least Well I am the intimate friend of the king and a proof of that is that whenever there is anything disagreeable to tell him it is I who have to do it But dear D Artagnan if you present me Well Aramis will be angry With me No with me Bah whether he or I present you since you are to be presented what does it matter They were going to get me some clothes made Your own are splendid Oh those I had ordered were far more beautiful Take care the king likes simplicity In that case I will be simple But what will M Fouquet say when he learns that I have left Are you a prisoner then on parole No not quite that But I promised him I would not leave without letting him know Wait a minute we shall return to that presently Have you anything to do here I nothing nothing of any importance at least Unless indeed you are Aramis s representative for something of importance By no means What I tell you pray understand that is out of interest for you I suppose for instance that you are commissioned to send messages and letters to him Ah letters yes I send certain letters to him Where To Fontainebleau Have you any letters then But Nay let me speak Have you any letters I say I have just received one for him Interesting I suppose so You do not read them then I am not at all curious said Porthos as he drew out of his pocket the soldier s letter which Porthos had not read but D Artagnan had Do you know what to do with it said D Artagnan Of course do as I always do send it to him Not so Why not Keep it then Did they not tell you that this letter was important Very important Well you must take it yourself to Fontainebleau To Aramis Yes Very good And since the king is there You will profit by that I shall profit by the opportunity to present you to the king Ah D Artagnan there is no one like you for expedients Therefore instead of forwarding to our friend any messages which may or may not be faithfully delivered we will ourselves be the bearers of the letter I had never even thought of that and yet it is simple enough And therefore because it is urgent Porthos we ought to set off at once In fact said Porthos the sooner we set off the less chance there is of Aramis s letter being delayed Porthos your reasoning is always accurate and in your case logic seems to serve as an auxiliary to the imagination Do you think so said Porthos It is the result of your hard reading replied D Artagnan So come along let us be off But said Porthos my promise to M Fouquet Which Not to leave Saint Mande without telling him of it Ah Porthos said D Artagnan how very young you still are In what way You are going to Fontainebleau are you not where you will find M Fouquet Yes Probably in the king s palace Yes repeated Porthos with an air full of majesty Well you will accost him with these words M Fouquet I have the honor to inform you that I have just left Saint Mande And said Porthos with the same majestic mien seeing me at Fontainebleau at the king s M Fouquet will not be able to tell me I am not speaking the truth My dear Porthos I was just on the point of opening my lips to make the same remark but you anticipate me in everything Oh Porthos how fortunately you are gifted Years have made not the slightest impression on you Not over much certainly Then there is nothing more to say I think not All your scruples are removed Quite so In that case I shall carry you off with me Exactly and I will go and get my horse saddled You have horses here then I have five You had them sent from Pierrefonds I suppose No M Fouquet gave them to me My dear Porthos we shall not want five horses for two persons besides I have already three in Paris which would make eight and that will be too many It would not be too many if I had some of my servants here but alas I have not got them Do you regret them then I regret Mousqueton I miss Mousqueton What a good hearted fellow you are Porthos said D Artagnan but the best thing you can do is to leave your horses here as you have left Mousqueton out yonder Why so Because by and by it might turn out a very good thing if M Fouquet had never given you anything at all I don t understand you said Porthos It is not necessary you should understand But yet I will explain to you later Porthos I ll wager it is some piece of policy or other And of the most subtle character returned D Artagnan Porthos nodded his head at this word policy then after a moment s reflection he added I confess D Artagnan that I am no politician I know that well Oh no one knows what you told me yourself you the bravest of the brave What did I tell you Porthos That every man has his day You told me so and I have experienced it myself There are certain days when one feels less pleasure than others in exposing one s self to a bullet or a sword thrust Exactly my own idea And mine too although I can hardly believe in blows or thrusts that kill outright The deuce and yet you have killed a few in your time Yes but I have never been killed Your reason is a very good one Therefore I do not believe I shall ever die from a thrust of a sword or a gun shot In that case then you are afraid of nothing Ah water perhaps Oh I swim like an otter Of a quartan fever then I have never had one yet and I don t believe I ever shall but there is one thing I will admit and Porthos dropped his voice What is that asked D Artagnan adopting the same tone of voice as Porthos I must confess repeated Porthos that I am horribly afraid of politics Ah bah exclaimed D Artagnan Upon my word it s true said Porthos in a stentorian voice I have seen his eminence Monsieur le Cardinal de Richelieu and his eminence Monsieur le Cardinal de Mazarin the one was a red politician the other a black politician I never felt very much more satisfied with the one than with the other the first struck off the heads of M de Marillac M de Thou M de Cinq Mars M Chalais M de Bouteville and M de Montmorency the second got a whole crowd of Frondeurs cut in pieces and we belonged to them On the contrary we did not belong to them said D Artagnan Oh indeed yes for if I unsheathed my sword for the cardinal I struck it for the king My good Porthos Well I have done My dread of politics is such that if there is any question of politics in the matter I should greatly prefer to return to Pierrefonds You would be quite right if that were the case But with me my dear Porthos no politics at all that is quite clear You have labored hard in fortifying Belle Isle the king wished to know the name of the clever engineer under whose directions the works were carried out you are modest as all men of true genius are perhaps Aramis wishes to put you under a bushel But I happen to seize hold of you I make it known who you are I produce you the king rewards you and that is the only policy I have to do with And the only one I will have to do with either said Porthos holding out his hand to D Artagnan But D Artagnan knew Porthos s grasp he knew that once imprisoned within the baron s five fingers no hand ever left it without being half crushed He therefore held out not his hand but his fist and Porthos did not even perceive the difference The servants talked a little with each other in an undertone and whispered a few words which D Artagnan understood but which he took very good care not to let Porthos understand Our friend he said to himself was really and truly Aramis s prisoner Let us now see what the result will be of the liberation of the captive

none	none	The Rat and the Cheese D Artagnan and Porthos returned on foot as D Artagnan had set out When D Artagnan as he entered the shop of the Pilon d Or announced to Planchet that M du Vallon would be one of the privileged travelers and as the plume in Porthos s hat made the wooden candles suspended over the front jingle together a melancholy presentiment seemed to eclipse the delight Planchet had promised himself for the morrow 
8063_274115_000003_000001	train-clean-100	But the grocer had a heart of gold ever mindful of the good old times a trait that carries youth into old age 
none	none	So Planchet notwithstanding a sort of internal shiver checked as soon as experienced received Porthos with respect mingled with the tenderest cordiality Porthos who was a little cold and stiff in his manners at first on account of the social difference existing at that period between a baron and a grocer soon began to soften when he perceived so much good feeling and so many kind attentions in Planchet He was particularly touched by the liberty which was permitted him to plunge his great palms into the boxes of dried fruits and preserves into the sacks of nuts and almonds and into the drawers full of sweetmeats So that notwithstanding Planchet s pressing invitations to go upstairs to the entresol he chose as his favorite seat during the evening which he had to spend at Planchet s house the shop itself where his fingers could always fish up whatever his nose detected The delicious figs from Provence filberts from the forest Tours plums were subjects of his uninterrupted attention for five consecutive hours His teeth like millstones cracked heaps of nuts the shells of which were scattered all over the floor where they were trampled by every one who went in and out of the shop Porthos pulled from the stalk with his lips at one mouthful bunches of the rich Muscatel raisins with their beautiful bloom half a pound of which passed at one gulp from his mouth to his stomach In one of the corners of the shop Planchet s assistants huddled together looked at each other without venturing to open their lips They did not know who Porthos was for they had never seen him before The race of those Titans who had worn the cuirasses of Hugh Capet Philip Augustus and Francis I had already begun to disappear They could hardly help thinking he might be the ogre of the fairy tale who was going to turn the whole contents of Planchet s shop into his insatiable stomach and that too without in the slightest degree displacing the barrels and chests that were in it Cracking munching chewing nibbling sucking and swallowing Porthos occasionally said to the grocer You do a very good business here friend Planchet He will very soon have none at all to do if this sort of thing continues grumbled the foreman who had Planchet s word that he should be his successor 
8063_274115_000005_000001	train-clean-100	In the midst of his despair he approached Porthos who blocked up the whole of the passage leading from the back shop to the shop itself 
none	none	He hoped that Porthos would rise and that this movement would distract his devouring ideas What do you want my man asked Porthos affably I should like to pass you monsieur if it is not troubling you too much
8063_274115_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Very well said Porthos it does not trouble me in the least 
none	none	At the same moment he took hold of the young fellow by the waistband lifted him off the ground and placed him very gently on the other side smiling all the while with the same affable expression As soon as Porthos had placed him on the ground the lad s legs so shook under him that he fell back upon some sacks of corks But noticing the giant s gentleness of manner he ventured again and said Ah monsieur pray be careful
8063_274115_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 What about inquired Porthos 
none	none	You are positively putting a fiery furnace into your body How is that my good fellow All those things are very heating to the system Which Raisins nuts and almonds Yes but if raisins nuts and almonds are heating
8063_274115_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 There is no doubt at all of it monsieur 
none	none	Honey is very cooling said Porthos stretching out his hand toward a small barrel of honey which was open and he plunged the scoop with which the wants of the customers were supplied into it and swallowed a good half pound at one gulp I must trouble you for some water now my man said Porthos In a pail monsieur asked the lad simply No in a water bottle that will be quite enough and raising the bottle to his mouth as a trumpeter does his trumpet he emptied the bottle at a single draught Planchet was agitated in every fibre of propriety and self esteem However a worthy representative of the hospitality which prevailed in early days he feigned to be talking very earnestly with D Artagnan and incessantly repeated Ah monsieur what a happiness 
8063_274115_000023_000001	train-clean-100	what an honor 
none	none	What time shall we have supper Planchet inquired Porthos I feel hungry The foreman clasped his hands together 
8063_274115_000025_000001	train-clean-100	The two others got under the counters fearing Porthos might have a taste for human flesh 
none	none	We shall only take a sort of snack here said D Artagnan and when we get to Planchet s country seat we will have supper Ah ah so we are going to your country house Planchet said Porthos so much the better You overwhelm me monsieur le baron The monsieur le baron had a great effect upon the men who detected a personage of the highest quality in an appetite of that kind This title too reassured them They had never heard that an ogre was ever called monsieur le baron I will take a few biscuits to eat on the road said Porthos carelessly and he emptied a whole jar of aniseed biscuits into the huge pocket of his doublet My shop is saved exclaimed Planchet Yes as the cheese was whispered the foreman
8063_274115_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 What cheese 
8063_274115_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 The Dutch cheese inside which a rat had made his way and we found only the rind left 
none	none	Planchet looked all round his shop and observing the different articles which had escaped Porthos s teeth he found the comparison somewhat exaggerated The foreman who remarked what was passing in his master s mind said Take care he is not gone yet Have you any fruit here said Porthos as he went upstairs to the entresol where it had just been announced that some refreshment was prepared Alas thought the grocer addressing a look at D Artagnan full of entreaty which the latter half understood 
8063_274115_000038_000000	train-clean-100	As soon as they had finished eating they set off 
none	none	It was late when the three riders who had left Paris about six in the evening arrived at Fontainebleau The journey passed very agreeably Porthos took a fancy to Planchet s society because the latter was very respectful in his manners and seemed delighted to talk to him about his meadows his woods and his rabbit warrens 
8063_274115_000038_000004	train-clean-100	Porthos had all the taste and pride of a landed proprietor 
none	none	When D Artagnan saw his two companions in earnest conversation he took the opposite side of the road and letting his bridle drop upon his horse s neck separated himself from the whole world as he had done from Porthos and from Planchet The moon shone softly through the foliage of the forest The breezes of the open country rose deliciously perfumed to the horse s nostrils and they snorted and pranced along delightedly Porthos and Planchet began to talk about hay crops Planchet admitted to Porthos that in the advanced years of his life he had certainly neglected agricultural pursuits for commerce but that his childhood had been passed in Picardy in the beautiful meadows where the grass grew as high as the knees and where he had played under the green apple trees covered with red cheeked fruit he went on to say that he had solemnly promised himself that as soon as he should have made his fortune he would return to nature and end his days as he had begun them as near as he possibly could to the earth itself where all men must sleep at last Eh eh said Porthos in that case my dear Monsieur Planchet your retirement is not far distant
8063_274115_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 How so 
none	none	Why you seem to be in the way of making your fortune very soon Well we are getting on pretty well I must admit replied Planchet Come tell me what is the extent of your ambition and what is the amount you intend to retire upon There is one circumstance monsieur said Planchet without answering the question which occasions me a good deal of anxiety What is it inquired Porthos looking all round him as if in search of the circumstance that annoyed Planchet and desirous of freeing him from it Why formerly said the grocer you used to call me Planchet quite short and you would have spoken to me then in a much more familiar manner than you do now Certainly certainly I should have said so formerly replied the good natured Porthos with an embarrassment full of delicacy but formerly Formerly I was M d Artagnan s lackey is not that what you mean Yes Well if I am not quite his lackey I am as much as ever I was his devoted servant and more than that since that time Well Planchet Since that time I have had the honor of being in partnership with him Oh oh said Porthos What has D Artagnan gone into the grocery business No no said D Artagnan whom these words had drawn out of his reverie and who entered into the conversation with that readiness and rapidity which distinguished every operation of his mind and body It was not D Artagnan who entered into the grocery business but Planchet who entered into a political affair with me Yes said Planchet with mingled pride and satisfaction we transacted a little business which brought me in a hundred thousand francs and M d Artagnan two hundred thousand Oh oh said Porthos with admiration So that monsieur le baron continued the grocer I again beg you to be kind enough to call me Planchet as you used to do and to speak to me as familiarly as in old times You cannot possibly imagine the pleasure it would give me If that be the case my dear Planchet I will do so certainly replied Porthos And as he was quite close to Planchet he raised his hand as if to strike him on the shoulder in token of friendly cordiality but a fortunate movement of the horse made him miss his aim so that his hand fell on the crupper of Planchet s horse instead which made the animal s legs almost give way D Artagnan burst out laughing as he said Take care Planchet for if Porthos begins to like you so much he will caress you and if he caresses you he will knock you as flat as a pancake Porthos is still as strong as ever you know Oh said Planchet Mousqueton is not dead and yet monsieur le baron is very fond of him Certainly said Porthos with a sigh which made all the three horses rear and I was only saying this very morning to D Artagnan how much I regretted him But tell me Planchet Thank you monsieur le baron thank you
8063_274115_000063_000000	train-clean-100	 Good lad good lad 
8063_274115_000063_000001	train-clean-100	How many acres of park have you got 
8063_274115_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 of park 
none	none	have you got Of park Yes we will reckon up the meadows presently and the woods afterwards
8063_274115_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 Whereabouts monsieur 
8063_274115_000066_000001	train-clean-100	 At your chateau 
none	none	Oh monsieur le baron I have neither chateau nor park nor meadows nor woods
8063_274115_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 What have you got then inquired Porthos and why do you call it a country seat 
none	none	I did not call it a country seat monsieur le baron replied Planchet somewhat humiliated but a country box Ah ah I understand You are modest No monsieur le baron I speak the plain truth 
8063_274115_000071_000001	train-clean-100	I have rooms for a couple of friends that s all 
none	none	But in that case whereabouts do your friends walk
8063_274115_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 In the first place they can walk about the king s forest which is very beautiful 
none	none	Yes I know the forest is very fine said Porthos nearly as beautiful as my forest at Berry Planchet opened his eyes very wide Have you a forest of the same kind as the forest at Fontainebleau monsieur le baron he stammered out Yes I have two indeed but the one at Berry is my favorite Why so asked Planchet
8063_274115_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 Because I don t know where it ends and also because it is full of poachers 
none	none	How can the poachers make the forest so agreeable to you
8063_274115_000080_000000	train-clean-100	 Because they hunt my game and I hunt them which in these peaceful times is for me a sufficiently pleasing picture of war on a small scale 
none	none	They had reached this turn of conversation when Planchet looking up perceived the houses at the commencement of Fontainebleau the lofty outlines of which stood out strongly against the misty visage of the heavens whilst rising above the compact and irregularly formed mass of buildings the pointed roofs of the chateau were clearly visible the slates of which glistened beneath the light of the moon like the scales of an immense fish Gentlemen said Planchet I have the honor to inform you that we have arrived at Fontainebleau Chapter V Planchet s Country House The cavaliers looked up and saw that what Planchet had announced to them was true Ten minutes afterwards they were in the street called the Rue de Lyon on the opposite side of the hostelry of the Beau Paon A high hedge of bushy elders hawthorn and wild hops formed an impenetrable fence behind which rose a white house with a high tiled roof Two of the windows which were quite dark looked upon the street Between the two a small door with a porch supported by a couple of pillars formed the entrance to the house The door was gained by a step raised a little from the ground Planchet got off his horse as if he intended to knock at the door but on second thoughts he took hold of his horse by the bridle and led it about thirty paces further on his two companions following him He then advanced about another thirty paces until he arrived at the door of a cart house lighted by an iron grating and lifting up a wooden latch pushed open one of the folding doors He entered first leading his horse after him by the bridle into a small courtyard where an odor met them which revealed their close vicinity to a stable That smells all right said Porthos loudly getting off his horse and I almost begin to think I am near my own cows at Pierrefonds I have only one cow Planchet hastened to say modestly And I have thirty said Porthos or rather I don t exactly know how many I have When the two cavaliers had entered Planchet fastened the door behind them In the meantime D Artagnan who had dismounted with his usual agility inhaled the fresh perfumed air with the delight a Parisian feels at the sight of green fields and fresh foliage plucked a piece of honeysuckle with one hand and of sweet briar with the other Porthos clawed hold of some peas which were twined round poles stuck into the ground and ate or rather browsed upon them shells and all and Planchet was busily engaged trying to wake up an old and infirm peasant who was fast asleep in a shed lying on a bed of moss and dressed in an old stable suit of clothes The peasant recognizing Planchet called him the master to the grocer s great satisfaction Stable the horses well old fellow and you shall have something good for yourself said Planchet Yes yes fine animals they are too said the peasant
8063_274116_000006_000001	train-clean-100	 Oh they shall have as much as they like 
none	none	Gently gently my man said D Artagnan we are getting on a little too fast 
8063_274116_000007_000001	train-clean-100	A few oats and a good bed nothing more 
8063_274116_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Some bran and water for my horse said Porthos for it is very warm I think 
none	none	Don t be afraid gentlemen replied Planchet Daddy Celestin is an old gendarme who fought at Ivry He knows all about horses so come into the house And he led the way along a well sheltered walk which crossed a kitchen garden then a small paddock and came out into a little garden behind the house the principal front of which as we have already noticed faced the street As they approached they could see through two open windows on the ground floor which led into a sitting room the interior of Planchet s residence This room softly lighted by a lamp placed on the table seemed from the end of the garden like a smiling image of repose comfort and happiness In every direction where the rays of light fell whether upon a piece of old china or upon an article of furniture shining from excessive neatness or upon the weapons hanging against the wall the soft light was softly reflected and its rays seemed to linger everywhere upon something or another agreeable to the eye The lamp which lighted the room whilst the foliage of jasmine and climbing roses hung in masses from the window frames splendidly illuminated a damask table cloth as white as snow 
8063_274116_000009_000006	train-clean-100	The table was laid for two persons 
none	none	Amber colored wine sparkled in a long cut glass bottle and a large jug of blue china with a silver lid was filled with foaming cider Near the table in a high backed armchair reclined fast asleep a woman of about thirty years of age her face the very picture of health and freshness Upon her knees lay a large cat with her paws folded under her and her eyes half closed purring in that significant manner which according to feline habits indicates perfect contentment The two friends paused before the window in complete amazement while Planchet perceiving their astonishment was in no little degree secretly delighted at it Ah Planchet you rascal said D Artagnan I now understand your absences Oh oh there is some white linen said Porthos in his turn in a voice of thunder At the sound of this gigantic voice the cat took flight the housekeeper woke up with a start and Planchet assuming a gracious air introduced his two companions into the room where the table was already laid Permit me my dear he said to present to you Monsieur le Chevalier d Artagnan my patron D Artagnan took the lady s hand in his in the most courteous manner and with precisely the same chivalrous air as he would have taken Madame s Monsieur le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds added Planchet Porthos bowed with a reverence which Anne of Austria would have approved of It was then Planchet s turn and he unhesitatingly embraced the lady in question not however until he had made a sign as if requesting D Artagnan s and Porthos s permission a permission as a matter of course frankly conceded D Artagnan complimented Planchet and said You are indeed a man who knows how to make life agreeable
8063_274116_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Life monsieur said Planchet laughing is capital which a man ought to invest as sensibly as he possibly can 
none	none	And you get very good interest for yours said Porthos with a burst of laughter like a peal of thunder 
8063_274116_000017_000000	train-clean-100	Planchet turned to his housekeeper 
8063_274116_000017_000001	train-clean-100	 You have before you he said to her the two gentlemen who influenced the greatest gayest grandest portion of my life 
none	none	I have spoken to you about them both very frequently And about two others as well said the lady with a very decided Flemish accent Madame is Dutch inquired D Artagnan Porthos curled his mustache a circumstance which was not lost upon D Artagnan who noticed everything
8063_274116_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 I am from Antwerp said the lady 
none	none	And her name is Madame Getcher said Planchet
8063_274116_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 You should not call her madame said D Artagnan 
none	none	Why not asked Planchet Because it would make her seem older every time you call her so Well I call her Truchen And a very pretty name too said Porthos Truchen said Planchet came to me from Flanders with her virtue and two thousand florins She ran away from a brute of a husband who was in the habit of beating her Being myself a Picard born I was always very fond of the Artesian women and it is only a step from Artois to Flanders she came crying bitterly to her godfather my predecessor in the Rue des Lombards she placed her two thousand florins in my establishment which I have turned to very good account and which have brought her in ten thousand Bravo Planchet She is free and well off she has a cow a maid servant and old Celestin at her orders she mends my linen knits my winter stockings she only sees me every fortnight and seems to make herself in all things tolerably happy And indeed gentlemen I am very happy and comfortable said Truchen with perfect ingenuousness 
8063_274116_000031_000000	train-clean-100	Porthos began to curl the other side of his mustache 
8063_274116_000031_000001	train-clean-100	 The deuce thought D Artagnan can Porthos have any intentions in that quarter 
none	none	In the meantime Truchen had set her cook to work had laid the table for two more and covered it with every possible delicacy that could convert a light supper into a substantial meal a meal into a regular feast Fresh butter salt beef anchovies tunny a shopful of Planchet s commodities fowls vegetables salad fish from the pond and the river game from the forest all the produce in fact of the province Moreover Planchet returned from the cellar laden with ten bottles of wine the glass of which could hardly be seen for the thick coating of dust which covered them 
8063_274116_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Porthos s heart began to expand as he said I am hungry and he sat himself beside Madame Truchen whom he looked at in the most killing manner 
none	none	D Artagnan seated himself on the other side of her while Planchet discreetly and full of delight took his seat opposite Do not trouble yourselves he said if Truchen should leave the table now and then during supper for she will have to look after your bedrooms In fact the housekeeper made her escape quite frequently and they could hear on the first floor above them the creaking of the wooden bedsteads and the rolling of the castors on the floor 
8063_274116_000034_000001	train-clean-100	While this was going on the three men Porthos especially ate and drank gloriously it was wonderful to see them 
8063_274116_000034_000002	train-clean-100	The ten full bottles were ten empty ones by the time Truchen returned with the cheese 
none	none	D Artagnan still preserved his dignity and self possession but Porthos had lost a portion of his and the mirth soon began to grow somewhat uproarious D Artagnan recommended a new descent into the cellar and as Planchet no longer walked with the steadiness of a well trained foot soldier the captain of the musketeers proposed to accompany him They set off humming songs wild enough to frighten anybody who might be listening Truchen remained behind at table with Porthos While the two wine bibbers were looking behind the firewood for what they wanted a sharp report was heard like the impact of a pair of lips on a lady s cheek Porthos fancies himself at La Rochelle thought D Artagnan as they returned freighted with bottles Planchet was singing so loudly that he was incapable of noticing anything 
8063_274116_000035_000002	train-clean-100	D Artagnan whom nothing ever escaped remarked how much redder Truchen s left cheek was than her right 
none	none	Porthos was sitting on Truchen s left and was curling with both his hands both sides of his mustache at once and Truchen was looking at him with a most bewitching smile The sparkling wine of Anjou very soon produced a remarkable effect upon the three companions D Artagnan had hardly strength enough left to take a candlestick to light Planchet up his own staircase Planchet was pulling Porthos along who was following Truchen who was herself jovial enough It was D Artagnan who found out the rooms and the beds Porthos threw himself into the one destined for him after his friend had undressed him D Artagnan got into his own bed saying to himself Mordioux I had made up my mind never to touch that light colored wine which brings my early camp days back again Fie fie if my musketeers were only to see their captain in such a state And drawing the curtains of his bed he added Fortunately enough though they will not see me The country is very amusing said Porthos stretching out his legs which passed through the wooden footboard and made a tremendous crash of which however no one in the house was capable of taking the slightest notice By two o clock in the morning every one was fast asleep

none	none	Showing What Could Be Seen from Planchet s House The next morning found the three heroes sleeping soundly Truchen had closed the outside blinds to keep the first rays of the sun from the leaden lidded eyes of her guests like a kind good housekeeper It was still perfectly dark then beneath Porthos s curtains and under Planchet s canopy when D Artagnan awakened by an indiscreet ray of light which made its way through a peek hole in the shutters jumped hastily out of bed as if he wished to be the first at a forlorn hope He took by assault Porthos s room which was next to his own The worthy Porthos was sleeping with a noise like distant thunder in the dim obscurity of the room his gigantic frame was prominently displayed and his swollen fist hung down outside the bed upon the carpet D Artagnan awoke Porthos who rubbed his eyes in a tolerably good humor In the meantime Planchet was dressing himself and met at their bedroom doors his two guests who were still somewhat unsteady from their previous evening s entertainment Although it was yet very early the whole household was already up The cook was mercilessly slaughtering in the poultry yard Celestin was gathering white cherries in the garden Porthos brisk and lively as ever held out his hand to Planchet s and D Artagnan requested permission to embrace Madame Truchen 
8063_274117_000002_000008	train-clean-100	The latter to show that she bore no ill will approached Porthos upon whom she conferred the same favor 
8063_274117_000002_000009	train-clean-100	Porthos embraced Madame Truchen heaving an enormous sigh 
none	none	Planchet took both his friends by the hand I am going to show you over the house he said when we arrived last night it was as dark as an oven and we were unable to see anything but in broad daylight everything looks different and you will be satisfied I hope If we begin by the view you have here said D Artagnan that charms me beyond everything I have always lived in royal mansions you know and royal personages have tolerably sound ideas upon the selection of points of view
8063_274117_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 I am a great stickler for a good view myself said Porthos 
none	none	At my Chateau de Pierrefonds I have had four avenues laid out and at the end of each is a landscape of an altogether different character from the others You shall see my prospect said Planchet and he led his two guests to a window Ah said D Artagnan this is the Rue de Lyon Yes I have two windows on this side a paltry insignificant view for there is always that bustling and noisy inn which is a very disagreeable neighbor 
8063_274117_000008_000001	train-clean-100	I had four windows here but I bricked up two 
8063_274117_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 Let us go on said D Artagnan 
none	none	They entered a corridor leading to the bedrooms and Planchet pushed open the outside blinds Hollo what is that out yonder said Porthos The forest said Planchet It is the horizon a thick line of green which is yellow in the spring green in the summer red in the autumn and white in the winter All very well but it is like a curtain which prevents one seeing a greater distance Yes said Planchet still one can see at all events everything that intervenes Ah the open country said Porthos
8063_274117_000015_000001	train-clean-100	 But what is that I see out there crosses and stones 
none	none	Ah that is the cemetery exclaimed D Artagnan Precisely said Planchet I assure you it is very curious Hardly a day passes that some one is not buried there for Fontainebleau is by no means an inconsiderable place Sometimes we see young girls clothed in white carrying banners at others some of the town council or rich citizens with choristers and all the parish authorities and then too we see some of the officers of the king s household
8063_274117_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 I should not like that said Porthos 
none	none	There is not much amusement in it at all events said D Artagnan I assure you it encourages religious thoughts replied Planchet
8063_274117_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh I don t deny that 
none	none	But continued Planchet we must all die one day or another and I once met with a maxim somewhere which I have remembered that the thought of death is a thought that will do us all good I am far from saying the contrary said Porthos But objected D Artagnan the thought of green fields flowers rivers blue horizons extensive and boundless plains is not likely to do us good If I had any I should be far from rejecting them said Planchet but possessing only this little cemetery full of flowers so moss grown shady and quiet I am contented with it and I think of those who live in town in the Rue des Lombards for instance and who have to listen to the rumbling of a couple of thousand vehicles every day and to the soulless tramp tramp tramp of a hundred and fifty thousand foot passengers But living said Porthos living remember that
8063_274117_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 That is exactly the reason said Planchet timidly why I feel it does me good to contemplate a few dead 
none	none	Upon my word said D Artagnan that fellow Planchet is born a philosopher as well as a grocer Monsieur said Planchet I am one of those good humored sort of men whom Heaven created for the purpose of living a certain span of days and of considering all good they meet with during their transitory stay on earth D Artagnan sat down close to the window and as there seemed to be something substantial in Planchet s philosophy he mused over it Ah ah exclaimed Planchet if I am not mistaken we are going to have a representation now for I think I heard something like chanting Yes said D Artagnan I hear singing too Oh it is only a burial of a very poor description said Planchet disdainfully the officiating priest the beadle and only one chorister boy nothing more You observe messieurs that the defunct lady or gentleman could not have been of very high rank No no one seems to be following the coffin
8063_274117_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes said Porthos I see a man 
none	none	You are right a man wrapped in a cloak said D Artagnan It s not worth looking at said Planchet I find it interesting said D Artagnan leaning on the window sill Come come you are beginning to take a fancy to the place already said Planchet delightedly it is exactly my own case I was so melancholy at first that I could do nothing but make the sign of the cross all day and the chants were like so many nails being driven into my head but now they lull me to sleep and no bird I have ever seen or heard can sing better than those which are to be met with in this cemetery Well said Porthos this is beginning to get a little dull for me and I prefer going downstairs Planchet with one bound was beside his guest whom he offered to lead into the garden What said Porthos to D Artagnan as he turned round are you going to remain here
8063_274117_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes I will join you presently 
none	none	Well M D Artagnan is right after all said Planchet are they beginning to bury yet Not yet Ah yes the grave digger is waiting until the cords are fastened round the bier But see a woman has just entered the cemetery at the other end Yes yes my dear Planchet said D Artagnan quickly leave me leave me I feel I am beginning already to be much comforted by my meditations so do not interrupt me Planchet left and D Artagnan remained devouring with his eager gaze from behind the half closed blinds what was taking place just before him 
8063_274117_000048_000001	train-clean-100	The two bearers of the corpse had unfastened the straps by which they carried the litter and were letting their burden glide gently into the open grave 
none	none	At a few paces distant the man with the cloak wrapped round him the only spectator of this melancholy scene was leaning with his back against a large cypress tree and kept his face and person entirely concealed from the grave diggers and the priests the corpse was buried in five minutes The grave having been filled up the priests turned away and the grave digger having addressed a few words to them followed them as they moved away The man in the mantle bowed as they passed him and put a piece of gold into the grave digger s hand Mordioux murmured D Artagnan it is Aramis himself Aramis in fact remained alone on that side at least for hardly had he turned his head when a woman s footsteps and the rustling of her dress were heard in the path close to him He immediately turned round and took off his hat with the most ceremonious respect he led the lady under the shelter of some walnut and lime trees which overshadowed a magnificent tomb Ah who would have thought it said D Artagnan the bishop of Vannes at a rendezvous He is still the same Abbe Aramis as he was at Noisy le Sec Yes he added after a pause but as it is in a cemetery the rendezvous is sacred But he almost laughed The conversation lasted for fully half an hour D Artagnan could not see the lady s face for she kept her back turned towards him but he saw perfectly well by the erect attitude of both the speakers by their gestures by the measured and careful manner with which they glanced at each other either by way of attack or defense that they must be conversing about any other subject than of love At the end of the conversation the lady rose and bowed profoundly to Aramis Oh oh said D Artagnan this rendezvous finishes like one of a very tender nature though 
8063_274117_000053_000001	train-clean-100	The cavalier kneels at the beginning the young lady by and by gets tamed down and then it is she who has to supplicate 
8063_274117_000053_000002	train-clean-100	Who is this lady 
none	none	I would give anything to ascertain This seemed impossible however for Aramis was the first to leave the lady carefully concealed her head and face and then immediately departed D Artagnan could hold out no longer he ran to the window which looked out on the Rue de Lyon and saw Aramis entering the inn The lady was proceeding in quite an opposite direction and seemed in fact to be about to rejoin an equipage consisting of two led horses and a carriage which he could see standing close to the borders of the forest She was walking slowly her head bent down absorbed in the deepest meditation Mordioux Mordioux I must and will learn who that woman is said the musketeer again and then without further deliberation he set off in pursuit of her As he was going along he tried to think how he could possibly contrive to make her raise her veil She is not young he said and is a woman of high rank in society 
8063_274117_000055_000004	train-clean-100	I ought to know that figure and peculiar style of walk As he ran the sound of his spurs and of his boots upon the hard ground of the street made a strange jingling noise a fortunate circumstance in itself which he was far from reckoning upon 
none	none	The noise disturbed the lady she seemed to fancy she was being either followed or pursued which was indeed the case and turned round D Artagnan started as if he had received a charge of small shot in his legs and then turning suddenly round as if he were going back the same way he had come he murmured Madame de Chevreuse D Artagnan would not go home until he had learnt everything He asked Celestin to inquire of the grave digger whose body it was they had buried that morning A poor Franciscan mendicant friar replied the latter who had not even a dog to love him in this world and to accompany him to his last resting place If that were really the case thought D Artagnan we should not have found Aramis present at his funeral The bishop of Vannes is not precisely a dog as far as devotion goes his scent however is quite as keen I admit Chapter VII How Porthos Truchen and Planchet Parted with Each Other on Friendly Terms Thanks to D Artagnan There was good living in Planchet s house Porthos broke a ladder and two cherry trees stripped the raspberry bushes and was only unable to succeed in reaching the strawberry beds on account as he said of his belt Truchen who had become quite sociable with the giant said that it was not the belt so much as his corporation and Porthos in a state of the highest delight embraced Truchen who gathered him a pailful of the strawberries and made him eat them out of her hands D Artagnan who arrived in the midst of these little innocent flirtations scolded Porthos for his indolence and silently pitied Planchet Porthos breakfasted with a very good appetite and when he had finished he said looking at Truchen I could make myself very happy here Truchen smiled at his remark and so did Planchet but not without embarrassment D Artagnan then addressed Porthos You must not let the delights of Capua make you forget the real object of our journey to Fontainebleau My presentation to the king Certainly I am going to take a turn in the town to get everything ready for that Do not think of leaving the house I beg Oh no exclaimed Porthos Planchet looked at D Artagnan nervously Will you be away long he inquired No my friend and this very evening I will release you from two troublesome guests Oh Monsieur d Artagnan can you say No no you are a noble hearted fellow but your house is very small Such a house with half a dozen acres of land would be fit for a king and make him very happy too But you were not born a great lord No more was M Porthos murmured Planchet But he has become so my good fellow his income has been a hundred thousand francs a year for the last twenty years and for the last fifty years Porthos has been the owner of a couple of fists and a backbone which are not to be matched throughout the whole realm of France Porthos is a man of the very greatest consequence compared to you and well I need say no more for I know you are an intelligent fellow No no monsieur explain what you mean Look at your orchard how stripped it is how empty your larder your bedstead broken your cellar almost exhausted look too at Madame Truchen Oh my goodness gracious said Planchet Madame Truchen is an excellent person continued D Artagnan but keep her for yourself do you understand and he slapped him on the shoulder Planchet at this moment perceived Porthos and Truchen sitting close together in an arbor Truchen with a grace of manner peculiarly Flemish was making a pair of earrings for Porthos out of a double cherry while Porthos was laughing as amorously as Samson in the company of Delilah Planchet pressed D Artagnan s hand and ran towards the arbor We must do Porthos the justice to say that he did not move as they approached and very likely he did not think he was doing any harm Nor indeed did Truchen move either which rather put Planchet out but he too had been so accustomed to see fashionable folk in his shop that he found no difficulty in putting a good countenance on what seemed disagreeable or rude Planchet seized Porthos by the arm and proposed to go and look at the horses but Porthos pretended he was tired Planchet then suggested that the Baron du Vallon should taste some noyeau of his own manufacture which was not to be equaled anywhere an offer the baron immediately accepted and in this way Planchet managed to engage his enemy s attention during the whole of the day by dint of sacrificing his cellar in preference to his amour propre Two hours afterwards D Artagnan returned Everything is arranged he said I saw his majesty at the very moment he was setting off for the chase the king expects us this evening The king expects me cried Porthos drawing himself up It is a sad thing to have to confess but a man s heart is like an ocean billow for from that very moment Porthos ceased to look at Madame Truchen in that touching manner which had so softened her heart Planchet encouraged these ambitious leanings as best as he could He talked over or rather gave exaggerated accounts of all the splendors of the last reign its battles sieges and grand court ceremonies He spoke of the luxurious display which the English made the prizes the three brave companions carried off and how D Artagnan who at the beginning had been the humblest of the four finished by becoming the leader He fired Porthos with a generous feeling of enthusiasm by reminding him of his early youth now passed away he boasted as much as he could of the moral life this great lord had led and how religiously he respected the ties of friendship he was eloquent and skillful in his choice of subjects He tickled Porthos frightened Truchen and made D Artagnan think At six o clock the musketeer ordered the horses to be brought round and told Porthos to get ready He thanked Planchet for his kind hospitality whispered a few words about a post he might succeed in obtaining for him at court which immediately raised Planchet in Truchen s estimation where the poor grocer so good so generous so devoted had become much lowered ever since the appearance and comparison with him of the two great gentlemen Such however is a woman s nature they are anxious to possess what they have not got and disdain it as soon as it is acquired After having rendered this service to his friend Planchet D Artagnan said in a low tone of voice to Porthos That is a very beautiful ring you have on your finger It is worth three hundred pistoles said Porthos Madame Truchen will remember you better if you leave her that ring replied D Artagnan a suggestion which Porthos seemed to hesitate to adopt You think it is not beautiful enough perhaps said the musketeer I understand your feelings a great lord such as you would not think of accepting the hospitality of an old servant without paying him most handsomely for it but I am sure that Planchet is too good hearted a fellow to remember that you have an income of a hundred thousand francs a year I have more than half a mind said Porthos flattered by the remark to make Madame Truchen a present of my little farm at Bracieux it has twelve acres It is too much my good Porthos too much just at present Keep it for a future occasion He then took the ring off Porthos s finger and approaching Truchen said to her Madame monsieur le baron hardly knows how to entreat you out of your regard for him to accept this little ring M du Vallon is one of the most generous and discreet men of my acquaintance He wished to offer you a farm that he has at Bracieux but I dissuaded him from it Oh said Truchen looking eagerly at the diamond Monsieur le baron exclaimed Planchet quite overcome My good friend stammered out Porthos delighted at having been so well represented by D Artagnan These several exclamations uttered at the same moment made quite a pathetic winding up of a day which might have finished in a very ridiculous manner But D Artagnan was there and on every occasion wheresoever D Artagnan exercised any control matters ended only just in the very way he wished and willed There were general embracings Truchen whom the baron s munificence had restored to her proper position very timidly and blushing all the while presented her forehead to the great lord with whom she had been on such very pretty terms the evening before Planchet himself was overcome by a feeling of genuine humility Still in the same generosity of disposition Porthos would have emptied his pockets into the hands of the cook and of Celestin but D Artagnan stopped him No he said it is now my turn And he gave one pistole to the woman and two to the man and the benedictions which were showered down upon them would have rejoiced the heart of Harpagon himself and have rendered even him a prodigal D Artagnan made Planchet lead them to the chateau and introduced Porthos into his own apartment where he arrived safely without having been perceived by those he was afraid of meeting Chapter VIII The Presentation of Porthos at Court At seven o clock the same evening the king gave an audience to an ambassador from the United Provinces in the grand reception room The audience lasted a quarter of an hour His majesty afterwards received those who had been recently presented together with a few ladies who paid their respects first In one corner of the salon concealed behind a column Porthos and D Artagnan were conversing together waiting until their turn arrived Have you heard the news inquired the musketeer of his friend No Well look then Porthos raised himself on tiptoe and saw M Fouquet in full court dress leading Aramis towards the king Aramis said Porthos Presented to the king by M Fouquet Ah ejaculated Porthos For having fortified Belle Isle continued D Artagnan And I You oh you as I have already had the honor of telling you are the good natured kind hearted Porthos and so they begged you to take care of Saint Mande a little Ah repeated Porthos But happily I was there said D Artagnan and presently it will be my turn At this moment Fouquet addressed the king Sire he said I have a favor to solicit of your majesty M d Herblay is not ambitious but he knows when he can be of service Your majesty needs a representative at Rome who would be able to exercise a powerful influence there may I request a cardinal s hat for M d Herblay The king started I do not often solicit anything of your majesty said Fouquet That is a reason certainly replied the king who always expressed any hesitation he might have in that manner and to which remark there was nothing to say in reply Fouquet and Aramis looked at each other The king resumed M d Herblay can serve us equally well in France an archbishopric for instance Sire objected Fouquet with a grace of manner peculiarly his own your majesty overwhelms M d Herblay the archbishopric may in your majesty s extreme kindness be conferred in addition to the hat the one does not exclude the other The king admired the readiness which he displayed and smiled saying D Artagnan himself could not have answered better He had no sooner pronounced the name than D Artagnan appeared Did your majesty call me he said Aramis and Fouquet drew back a step as if they were about to retire Will your majesty allow me said D Artagnan quickly as he led forward Porthos to present to your majesty M le Baron du Vallon one of the bravest gentlemen of France As soon as Aramis saw Porthos he turned as pale as death while Fouquet clenched his hands under his ruffles D Artagnan smiled blandly at both of them while Porthos bowed visibly overcome before the royal presence Porthos here murmured Fouquet in Aramis s ear Hush deep treachery at work hissed the latter Sire said D Artagnan it is more than six years ago I ought to have presented M du Vallon to your majesty but certain men resemble stars they move not one inch unless their satellites accompany them The Pleiades are never disunited and that is the reason I have selected for the purpose of presenting him to you the very moment when you would see M d Herblay by his side Aramis almost lost countenance He looked at D Artagnan with a proud haughty air as though willing to accept the defiance the latter seemed to throw down Ah these gentlemen are good friends then said the king Excellent friends sire the one can answer for the other Ask M de Vannes now in what manner Belle Isle was fortified Fouquet moved back a step Belle Isle said Aramis coldly was fortified by that gentleman and he indicated Porthos with his hand who bowed a second time Louis could not withhold his admiration though at the same time his suspicions were aroused Yes said D Artagnan but ask monsieur le baron whose assistance he had in carrying the works out Aramis s said Porthos frankly and he pointed to the bishop What the deuce does all this mean thought the bishop and what sort of a termination are we to expect to this comedy What exclaimed the king is the cardinal s I mean this bishop s name Aramis His nom de guerre said D Artagnan My nickname said Aramis A truce to modesty exclaimed D Artagnan beneath the priest s robe sire is concealed the most brilliant officer a gentleman of the most unparalleled intrepidity and the wisest theologian in your kingdom Louis raised his head And an engineer also it appears he said admiring Aramis s calm imperturbable self possession An engineer for a particular purpose sire said the latter My companion in the musketeers sire said D Artagnan with great warmth of manner the man who has more than a hundred times aided your father s ministers by his advice M d Herblay in a word who with M du Vallon myself and M le Comte de la Fere who is known to your majesty formed that quartette which was a good deal talked about during the late king s reign and during your majesty s minority And who fortified Belle Isle the king repeated in a significant tone Aramis advanced and bowed In order to serve the son as I served the father D Artagnan looked very narrowly at Aramis while he uttered these words which displayed so much true respect so much warm devotion such entire frankness and sincerity that even he D Artagnan the eternal doubter he the almost infallible in judgment was deceived by it A man who lies cannot speak in such a tone as that he said Louis was overcome by it In that case he said to Fouquet who anxiously awaited the result of this proof the cardinal s hat is promised Monsieur d Herblay I pledge you my honor that the first promotion shall be yours Thank M Fouquet for it Colbert overheard these words they stung him to the quick and he left the salon abruptly And you Monsieur du Vallon said the king what have you to ask I am truly pleased to have it in my power to acknowledge the services of those who were faithful to my father Sire began Porthos but he was unable to proceed with what he was going to say Sire exclaimed D Artagnan this worthy gentleman is utterly overpowered by your majesty s presence he who so valiantly sustained the looks and the fire of a thousand foes But knowing what his thoughts are I who am more accustomed to gaze upon the sun can translate them he needs nothing absolutely nothing his sole desire is to have the happiness of gazing upon your majesty for a quarter of an hour You shall sup with me this evening said the king saluting Porthos with a gracious smile Porthos became crimson from delight and pride The king dismissed him and D Artagnan pushed him into the adjoining apartment after he had embraced him warmly Sit next to me at table said Porthos in his ear Yes my friend Aramis is annoyed with me I think Aramis has never liked you so much as he does now Fancy it was I who was the means of his getting the cardinal s hat Of course said Porthos By the by does the king like his guests to eat much at his table It is a compliment to himself if you do said D Artagnan for he himself possesses a royal appetite Chapter IX Explanations Aramis cleverly managed to effect a diversion for the purpose of finding D Artagnan and Porthos He came up to the latter behind one of the columns and as he pressed his hand said So you have escaped from my prison Do not scold him said D Artagnan it was I dear Aramis who set him free Ah my friend replied Aramis looking at Porthos could you not have waited with a little more patience D Artagnan came to the assistance of Porthos who already began to breathe hard in sore perplexity You see you members of the Church are great politicians we mere soldiers come at once to the point The facts are these I went to pay Baisemeaux a visit Aramis pricked up his ears at this announcement Stay said Porthos you make me remember that I have a letter from Baisemeaux for you Aramis And Porthos held out the bishop the letter we have already seen Aramis begged to be allowed to read it and read it without D Artagnan feeling in the slightest degree embarrassed by the circumstance that he was so well acquainted with the contents of it Besides Aramis s face was so impenetrable that D Artagnan could not but admire him more than ever after he had read it he put the letter into his pocket with the calmest possible air You were saying captain he observed I was saying continued the musketeer that I had gone to pay Baisemeaux a visit on his majesty s service On his majesty s service said Aramis Yes said D Artagnan and naturally enough we talked about you and our friends I must say that Baisemeaux received me coldly so I soon took my leave of him As I was returning a soldier accosted me and said no doubt as he recognized me notwithstanding I was in private clothes Captain will you be good enough to read me the name written on this envelope and I read To Monsieur du Vallon at M Fouquet s house Saint Mande The deuce I said to myself Porthos has not returned then as I fancied to Bell Isle or to Pierrefonds but is at M Fouquet s house at Saint Mande and as M Fouquet is not at Saint Mande Porthos must be quite alone or at all events with Aramis I will go and see Porthos and I accordingly went to see Porthos Very good said Aramis thoughtfully You never told me that said Porthos I had no time my friend And you brought back Porthos with you to Fontainebleau Yes to Planchet s house Does Planchet live at Fontainebleau inquired Aramis Yes near the cemetery said Porthos thoughtlessly What do you mean by near the cemetery said Aramis suspiciously Come thought the musketeer since there is to be a squabble let us take advantage of it Yes the cemetery said Porthos Planchet is a very excellent fellow who makes very excellent preserves but his house has windows which look out upon the cemetery And a confoundedly melancholy prospect it is So this morning This morning said Aramis more and more excited D Artagnan turned his back to them and walked to the window where he began to play a march upon one of the panes of glass Yes this morning we saw a man buried there Ah Very depressing was it not I should never be able to live in a house where burials can always be seen from the window D Artagnan on the contrary seems to like it very much So D Artagnan saw it as well Not simply saw it he literally never took his eyes off the whole time Aramis started and turned to look at the musketeer but the latter was engaged in earnest conversation with Saint Aignan Aramis continued to question Porthos and when he had squeezed all the juice out of this enormous lemon he threw the peel aside He turned towards his friend D Artagnan and clapping him on the shoulder when Saint Aignan had left him the king s supper having been announced said D Artagnan Yes my dear fellow he replied We do not sup with his majesty I believe Well we do Can you give me ten minutes conversation Twenty if you like His majesty will take quite that time to get properly seated at table Where shall we talk then Here upon these seats if you like the king has left we can sit down and the apartment is empty Let us sit down then They sat down and Aramis took one of D Artagnan s hands in his Tell me candidly my dear friend whether you have not counseled Porthos to distrust me a little I admit I have but not as you understand it I saw that Porthos was bored to death and I wished by presenting him to the king to do for him and for you what you would never do for yourselves What is that Speak in your own praise And you have done it most nobly I thank you And I brought the cardinal s hat a little nearer just as it seemed to be retreating from you Ah I admit that said Aramis with a singular smile you are indeed not to be matched for making your friends fortunes for them You see then that I only acted with the view of making Porthos s fortune for him I meant to have done that myself but your arm reaches farther than ours It was now D Artagnan s turn to smile Come said Aramis we ought to deal truthfully with each other Do you still love me D Artagnan The same as I used to do replied D Artagnan without compromising himself too much by this reply In that case thanks and now for the most perfect frankness said Aramis you visited Belle Isle on behalf of the king Pardieu You wished to deprive us of the pleasure of offering Bell Isle completely fortified to the king But before I could deprive you of that pleasure I ought to have been made acquainted with your intention of doing so You came to Belle Isle without knowing anything Of you yes How the devil could I imagine that Aramis had become so clever an engineer as to be able to fortify like Polybius or Archimedes True And yet you smelt me out over yonder Oh yes And Porthos too I did not divine that Aramis was an engineer I was only able to guess that Porthos might have become one There is a saying one becomes an orator one is born a poet but it has never been said one is born Porthos and one becomes an engineer Your wit is always amusing said Aramis coldly Well I will go on Do When you found out our secret you made all the haste you could to communicate it to the king I certainly made as much haste as I could since I saw that you were making still more When a man weighing two hundred and fifty pounds as Porthos does rides post when a gouty prelate I beg your pardon but you yourself told me you were so when a prelate scours the highway I naturally suppose that my two friends who did not wish to be communicative with me had certain matters of the highest importance to conceal from me and so I made as much haste as my leanness and the absence of gout would allow Did it not occur to you my dear friend that you might be rendering Porthos and myself a very sad service Yes I thought it not unlikely but you and Porthos made me play a very ridiculous part at Belle Isle I beg your pardon said Aramis Excuse me said D Artagnan So that pursued Aramis you now know everything No indeed You know I was obliged to inform M Fouquet of what had happened in order that he would be able to anticipate what you might have to tell the king That is rather obscure Not at all M Fouquet has his enemies you will admit that I suppose Certainly And one in particular A dangerous one A mortal enemy Well in order to counteract that man s influence it was necessary that M Fouquet should give the king a proof of his great devotion to him and of his readiness to make the greatest sacrifices He surprised his majesty by offering him Belle Isle If you had been the first to reach Paris the surprise would have been destroyed it would have looked as if we had yielded to fear I understand That is the whole mystery said Aramis satisfied that he had at last quite convinced the musketeer Only said the latter it would have been more simple to have taken me aside and said to me My dear D Artagnan we are fortifying Belle Isle and intend to offer it to the king Tell us frankly for whom you are acting Are you a friend of M Colbert or of M Fouquet Perhaps I should not have answered you but you would have added Are you my friend I should have said Yes Aramis hung down his head In this way continued D Artagnan you would have paralyzed my movements and I should have gone to the king and said Sire M Fouquet is fortifying Belle Isle and exceedingly well too but here is a note which the governor of Belle Isle gave me for your majesty or M Fouquet is about to wait upon your majesty to explain his intentions with regard to it I should not have been placed in an absurd position you would have enjoyed the surprise so long planned and we should not have had any occasion to look askant at each other when we met While on the contrary replied Aramis you have acted altogether as one friendly to M Colbert And you really are a friend of his I suppose Certainly not indeed exclaimed the captain M Colbert is a mean fellow and I hate him as I used to hate Mazarin but without fearing him Well then said Aramis I love M Fouquet and his interests are mine You know my position I have no property or means whatever M Fouquet gave me several livings a bishopric as well M Fouquet has served and obliged me like the generous hearted man he is and I know the world sufficiently well to appreciate a kindness when I meet with one M Fouquet has won my regard and I have devoted myself to his service You could not possibly do better You will find him a very liberal master Aramis bit his lips and then said The best a man could possibly have He then paused for a minute D Artagnan taking good care not to interrupt him I suppose you know how Porthos got mixed up in all this No said D Artagnan I am curious of course but I never question a friend when he wishes to keep a secret from me Well then I will tell you It is hardly worth the trouble if the confidence is to bind me in any way Oh do not be afraid there is no man whom I love better than Porthos because he is so simple minded and good natured Porthos is so straightforward in everything Since I have become a bishop I have looked for these primeval natures which make me love truth and hate intrigue D Artagnan stroked his mustache but said nothing I saw Porthos and again cultivated his acquaintance his own time hanging idly on his hands his presence recalled my earlier and better days without engaging me in any present evil I sent for Porthos to come to Vannes M Fouquet whose regard for me is very great having learnt that Porthos and I were attached to each other by old ties of friendship promised him increase of rank at the earliest promotion and that is the whole secret I shall not abuse your confidence said D Artagnan I am sure of that my dear friend no one has a finer sense of honor than yourself I flatter myself that you are right Aramis And now and here the prelate looked searchingly and scrutinizingly at his friend now let us talk of ourselves and for ourselves will you become one of M Fouquet s friends Do not interrupt me until you know what that means Well I am listening Will you become a marechal of France peer duke and the possessor of a duchy with a million of francs But my friend replied D Artagnan what must one do to get all that Belong to M Fouquet But I already belong to the king Not exclusively I suppose Oh a D Artagnan cannot be divided You have I presume ambitions as noble hearts like yours have Yes certainly I have Well Well I wish to be a marechal the king will make me marechal duke peer the king will make me all that Aramis fixed a searching look upon D Artagnan Is not the king master said D Artagnan No one disputes it but Louis XIII was master also Oh my dear friend between Richelieu and Louis XIII stood no D Artagnan said the musketeer very quietly There are many stumbling blocks round the king said Aramis Not for the king s feet Very likely not still One moment Aramis I observe that every one thinks of himself and never of his poor prince I will maintain myself maintaining him And if you meet with ingratitude The weak alone are afraid of that You are quite certain of yourself I think so Still the king may some day have no further need for you On the contrary I think his need of me will soon be greater than ever and hearken my dear fellow if it became necessary to arrest a new Conde who would do it This this alone in France and D Artagnan struck his sword which clanked sullenly on the tesselated floor You are right said Aramis turning very pale and then he rose and pressed D Artagnan s hand That is the last summons for supper said the captain of the musketeers will you excuse me Aramis threw his arm round the musketeer s neck and said A friend like you is the brightest jewel in the royal crown And they immediately separated I was right mused D Artagnan there is indeed something strangely serious stirring We must hasten the explosion breathed the coming cardinal for D Artagnan has discovered the existence of a plot Chapter X Madame and De Guiche It will not be forgotten how Comte de Guiche left the queen mother s apartments on the day when Louis XIV presented La Valliere with the beautiful bracelets he had won in the lottery The comte walked to and fro for some time outside the palace in the greatest distress from a thousand suspicions and anxieties with which his mind was beset Presently he stopped and waited on the terrace opposite the grove of trees watching for Madame s departure More than half an hour passed away and as he was at that moment quite alone the comte could hardly have had any very diverting ideas at his command He drew his tables from his pocket and after hesitating over and over again determined to write these words Madame I implore you to grant me one moment s conversation Do not be alarmed at this request which contains nothing in any way opposed to the profound respect with which I subscribe myself et cetera et cetera He had signed and folded this singular love letter when he suddenly observed several ladies leaving the chateau and afterwards several courtiers too in fact almost every one that formed the queen s circle He saw La Valliere herself then Montalais talking with Malicorne he watched the departure of the very last of the numerous guests that had a short time before thronged the queen mother s cabinet Madame herself had not yet passed she would be obliged however to cross the courtyard in order to enter her own apartments and from the terrace where he was standing De Guiche could see all that was going on in the courtyard At last he saw Madame leave attended by a couple of pages who were carrying torches before her She was walking very quickly as soon as she reached the door she said Let some one go and look for De Guiche he has to render an account of a mission he had to discharge for me if he should be disengaged request him to be good enough to come to my apartment De Guiche remained silent hidden in the shade but as soon as Madame had withdrawn he darted from the terrace down the steps and assumed a most indifferent air so that the pages who were hurrying towards his rooms might meet him Ah it is Madame then who is seeking me he said to himself quite overcome and he crushed in his hand the now worse than useless letter M le comte said one of the pages approaching him we are indeed most fortunate in meeting you Why so messieurs A command from Madame From Madame said De Guiche looking surprised Yes M le comte her royal highness has been asking for you she expects to hear she told us the result of a commission you had to execute for her Are you at liberty I am quite at her royal highness s orders Will you have the goodness to follow us then When De Guiche entered the princess s apartments he found her pale and agitated Montalais was standing at the door evidently uneasy about what was passing in her mistress s mind De Guiche appeared Ah is that you Monsieur de Guiche said Madame come in I beg Mademoiselle de Montalais I do not require your attendance any longer Montalais more puzzled than ever courtesied and withdrew De Guiche and the princess were left alone The comte had every advantage in his favor it was Madame who had summoned him to a rendezvous But how was it possible for the comte to make use of this advantage Madame was so whimsical and her disposition so changeable She soon allowed this to be perceived for suddenly opening the conversation she said Well have you nothing to say to me He imagined she must have guessed his thoughts he fancied for those who are in love are thus constituted being as credulous and blind as poets or prophets he fancied she knew how ardent was his desire to see her and also the subject uppermost in his mind Yes Madame he said and I think it very singular The affair of the bracelets she exclaimed eagerly you mean that I suppose Yes Madame And you think the king is in love do you not Guiche looked at her for some time her eyes sank under his gaze which seemed to read her very heart I think he said that the king may possibly have had an idea of annoying some one were it not for that the king would hardly show himself so earnest in his attentions as he is he would not run the risk of compromising from mere thoughtlessness of disposition a young girl against whom no one has been hitherto able to say a word Indeed the bold shameless girl said the princess haughtily I can positively assure your royal highness said De Guiche with a firmness marked by great respect that Mademoiselle de la Valliere is beloved by a man who merits every respect for he is a brave and honorable gentleman Bragelonne My friend yes Madame Well and though he is your friend what does that matter to the king The king knows that Bragelonne is affianced to Mademoiselle de la Valliere and as Raoul has served the king most valiantly the king will not inflict an irreparable injury upon him Madame began to laugh in a manner that produced a sinister impression upon De Guiche I repeat Madame I do not believe the king is in love with Mademoiselle de la Valliere and the proof that I do not believe it is that I was about to ask you whose amour propre it is likely the king is desirous of wounding You who are well acquainted with the whole court can perhaps assist me in ascertaining that and assuredly with greater certainty since it is everywhere said that your royal highness is on very friendly terms with the king Madame bit her lips and unable to assign any good and sufficient reasons changed the conversation Prove to me she said fixing on him one of those looks in which the whole soul seems to pass into the eyes prove to me I say that you intended to interrogate me at the very moment I sent for you De Guiche gravely drew from his pocket the now crumpled note that he had written and showed it to her Sympathy she said Yes said the comte with an indescribable tenderness of tone sympathy I have explained to you how and why I sought you you however have yet to tell me Madame why you sent for me True replied the princess She hesitated and then suddenly exclaimed Those bracelets will drive me mad You expected the king would offer them to you replied De Guiche Why not But before you Madame before you his sister in law was there not the queen herself to whom the king should have offered them Before La Valliere cried the princess wounded to the quick could he not have presented them to me Was there not the whole court indeed to choose from I assure you Madame said the comte respectfully that if any one heard you speak in this manner if any one were to see how red your eyes are and Heaven forgive me to see too that tear trembling on your eyelids it would be said that your royal highness was jealous Jealous said the princess haughtily jealous of La Valliere She expected to see De Guiche yield beneath her scornful gesture and her proud tone but he simply and boldly replied Jealous of La Valliere yes Madame Am I to suppose monsieur she stammered out that your object is to insult me It is not possible Madame replied the comte slightly agitated but resolved to master that fiery nature Leave the room said the princess thoroughly exasperated De Guiche s coolness and silent respect having made her completely lose her temper De Guiche fell back a step bowed slowly but with great respect drew himself up looking as white as his lace cuffs and in a voice slightly trembling said It was hardly worth while to have hurried here to be subjected to this unmerited disgrace And he turned away with hasty steps He had scarcely gone half a dozen paces when Madame darted like a tigress after him seized him by the cuff and making him turn round again said trembling with passion as she did so The respect you pretend to have is more insulting than the insult itself Insult me if you please but at least speak Madame said the comte gently as he drew his sword thrust this blade into my heart rather than kill me by degrees At the look he fixed upon her a look full of love resolution and despair even she knew how readily the comte so outwardly calm in appearance would pass his sword through his own breast if she added another word She tore the blade from his hands and pressing his arm with a feverish impatience which might pass for tenderness said Do not be too hard upon me comte You see how I am suffering and yet you have no pity for me Tears the cries of this strange attack stifled her voice As soon as De Guiche saw her weep he took her in his arms and carried her to an armchair in another moment she would have been suffocated Oh why he murmured as he knelt by her side why do you conceal your troubles from me Do you love any one tell me It would kill me I know but not until I should have comforted consoled and served you even And do you love me to that extent she replied completely conquered I do indeed love you to that extent Madame She placed both her hands in his My heart is indeed another s she murmured in so low a tone that her voice could hardly be heard but he heard it and said Is it the king you love She gently shook her head and her smile was like a clear bright streak in the clouds through which after the tempest has passed one almost fancies Paradise is opening But she added there are other passions in a high born heart Love is poetry but the real life of the heart is pride Comte I was born on a throne I am proud and jealous of my rank Why does the king gather such unworthy objects round him Once more I repeat said the comte you are acting unjustly towards that poor girl who will one day be my friend s wife Are you simple enough to believe that comte If I did not believe it he said turning very pale Bragelonne should be informed of it to morrow indeed he should if I thought that poor La Valliere had forgotten the vows she had exchanged with Raoul But no it would be cowardly to betray a woman s secret it would be criminal to disturb a friend s peace of mind You think then said the princess with a wild burst of laughter that ignorance is happiness I believe it he replied Prove it to me then she said hurriedly It is easily done Madame It is reported through the whole court that the king loves you and that you return his affection Well she said breathing with difficulty Well admit for a moment that Raoul my friend had come and said to me Yes the king loves Madame and has made an impression upon her heart I possibly should have slain Raoul It would have been necessary said the princess with the obstinacy of a woman who feels herself not easily overcome for M de Bragelonne to have had proofs before he ventured to speak to you in that manner Such however is the case replied De Guiche with a deep sigh that not having been warned I have never examined into the matter seriously and I now find that my ignorance has saved my life So then you drive selfishness and coldness to that extent said Madame that you would let this unhappy young man continue to love La Valliere I would until La Valliere s guilt were revealed But the bracelets Well Madame since you yourself expected to receive them from the king what can I possibly say The argument was a telling one and the princess was overwhelmed by it and from that moment her defeat was assured But as her heart and mind were instinct with noble and generous feelings she understood De Guiche s extreme delicacy She saw that in his heart he really suspected that the king was in love with La Valliere and that he did not wish to resort to the common expedient of ruining a rival in the mind of a woman by giving the latter the assurance and certainty that this rival s affections were transferred to another woman She guessed that his suspicions of La Valliere were aroused and that in order to leave himself time for his convictions to undergo a change so as not to ruin Louise utterly he was determined to pursue a certain straightforward line of conduct She could read so much real greatness of character and such true generosity of disposition in her lover that her heart really warmed with affection towards him whose passion for her was so pure and delicate Despite his fear of incurring her displeasure De Guiche by retaining his position as a man of proud independence of feeling and deep devotion became almost a hero in her estimation and reduced her to the state of a jealous and little minded woman She loved him for this so tenderly that she could not refuse to give him a proof of her affection See how many words we have wasted she said taking his hand suspicions anxieties mistrust sufferings I think we have enumerated all those words Alas Madame yes Efface them from your heart as I drive them from mine Whether La Valliere does or does not love the king and whether the king does or does not love La Valliere from this moment you and I will draw a distinction in the two characters I have to perform You open your eyes so wide that I am sure you hardly understand me You are so impetuous Madame that I always tremble at the fear of displeasing you And see how he trembles now poor fellow she said with the most charming playfulness of manner Yes monsieur I have two characters to perform I am the sister of the king the sister in law of the king s wife In this character ought I not to take an interest in these domestic intrigues Come tell me what you think As little as possible Madame Agreed monsieur but it is a question of dignity and then you know I am the wife of the king s brother De Guiche sighed A circumstance she added with an expression of great tenderness which will remind you that I am always to be treated with the profoundest respect De Guiche fell at her feet which he kissed with the religious fervor of a worshipper And I begin to think that really and truly I have another character to perform I was almost forgetting it Name it oh name it said De Guiche I am a woman she said in a voice lower than ever and I love He rose she opened her arms and their lips met A footstep was heard behind the tapestry and Mademoiselle de Montalais appeared What do you want said Madame M de Guiche is wanted replied Montalais who was just in time to see the agitation of the actors of these four characters for De Guiche had consistently carried out his part with heroism Chapter XI Montalais and Malicorne Montalais was right M de Guiche thus summoned in every direction was very much exposed from such a multiplication of business to the risk of not attending to any It so happened that considering the awkwardness of the interruption Madame notwithstanding her wounded pride and secret anger could not for the moment at least reproach Montalais for having violated in so bold a manner the semi royal order with which she had been dismissed on De Guiche s entrance De Guiche also lost his presence of mind or it would be more correct to say had already lost it before Montalais s arrival for scarcely had he heard the young girl s voice than without taking leave of Madame as the most ordinary politeness required even between persons equal in rank and station he fled from her presence his heart tumultuously throbbing and his brain on fire leaving the princess with one hand raised as though to bid him adieu Montalais was at no loss therefore to perceive the agitation of the two lovers the one who fled was agitated and the one who remained was equally so Well murmured the young girl as she glanced inquisitively round her this time at least I think I know as much as the most curious woman could possibly wish to know Madame felt so embarrassed by this inquisitorial look that as if she heard Montalais s muttered side remark she did not speak a word to her maid of honor but casting down her eyes retired at once to her bedroom Montalais observing this stood listening for a moment and then heard Madame lock and bolt her door By this she knew that the rest of the evening was at her own disposal and making behind the door which had just been closed a gesture which indicated but little real respect for the princess she went down the staircase in search of Malicorne who was very busily engaged at that moment in watching a courier who covered with dust had just left the Comte de Guiche s apartments Montalais knew that Malicorne was engaged in a matter of some importance she therefore allowed him to look and stretch out his neck as much as he pleased and it was only when Malicorne had resumed his natural position that she touched him on the shoulder Well said Montalais what is the latest intelligence you have M de Guiche is in love with Madame Fine news truly I know something more recent than that Well what do you know That Madame is in love with M de Guiche The one is the consequence of the other Not always my good monsieur Is that remark intended for me Present company always excepted Thank you said Malicorne Well and in the other direction what is stirring The king wished this evening after the lottery to see Mademoiselle de la Valliere Well and he has seen her No indeed What do you mean by that The door was shut and locked So that So that the king was obliged to go back again looking very sheepish like a thief who has forgotten his crowbar Good And in the third place inquired Montalais The courier who has just arrived for De Guiche came from M de Bragelonne Excellent said Montalais clapping her hands together Why so Because we have work to do If we get weary now something unlucky will be sure to happen We must divide the work then said Malicorne in order to avoid confusion Nothing easier replied Montalais Three intrigues carefully nursed and carefully encouraged will produce one with another and taking a low average three love letters a day Oh exclaimed Malicorne shrugging his shoulders you cannot mean what you say darling three letters a day that may do for sentimental common people A musketeer on duty a young girl in a convent may exchange letters with their lovers once a day perhaps from the top of a ladder or through a hole in the wall A letter contains all the poetry their poor little hearts have to boast of But the cases we have in hand require to be dealt with very differently Well finish said Montalais out of patience with him Some one may come Finish Why I am only at the beginning I have still three points as yet untouched Upon my word he will be the death of me with his Flemish indifference exclaimed Montalais And you will drive me mad with your Italian vivacity I was going to say that our lovers here will be writing volumes to each other But what are you driving at At this Not one of our lady correspondents will be able to keep the letters they may receive Very likely M de Guiche will not be able to keep his either That is probable Very well then I will take care of all that That is the very thing that is impossible said Malicorne Why so Because you are not your own mistress your room is as much La Valliere s as yours and there are certain persons who will think nothing of visiting and searching a maid of honor s room so that I am terribly afraid of the queen who is as jealous as a Spaniard of the queen mother who is as jealous as a couple of Spaniards and last of all of Madame herself who has jealousy enough for ten Spaniards You forgot some one else Who Monsieur I was only speaking of the women Let us add them up then we will call Monsieur No one De Guiche No two The Vicomte de Bragelonne No three And the king the king No four Of course the king who not only will be more jealous but more powerful than all the rest put together Ah my dear Well Into what a wasp s nest you have thrust yourself And as yet not quite far enough if you will follow me into it Most certainly I will follow you where you like Yet Well yet While we have time I think it will be prudent to turn back But I on the contrary think the wisest course to take is to put ourselves at once at the head of all these intrigues You will never be able to do it With you I could superintend ten of them I am in my element you must know I was born to live at the court as the salamander is made to live in the fire Your comparison does not reassure me in the slightest degree in the world my dear Montalais I have heard it said and by learned men too that in the first place there are no salamanders at all and that if there had been any they would have been infallibly baked or roasted on leaving the fire Your learned men may be very wise as far as salamanders are concerned but they would never tell you what I can tell you namely that Aure de Montalais is destined before a month is over to become the first diplomatist in the court of France Be it so but on condition that I shall be the second Agreed an offensive and defensive alliance of course Only be very careful of any letters I will hand them to you as I receive them What shall we tell the king about Madame That Madame is still in love with his majesty What shall we tell Madame about the king That she would be exceedingly wrong not to humor him What shall we tell La Valliere about Madame Whatever we choose for La Valliere is in our power How so Every way What do you mean In the first place through the Vicomte de Bragelonne Explain yourself You do not forget I hope that Monsieur de Bragelonne has written many letters to Mademoiselle de la Valliere I forget nothing Well then it was I who received and I who intercepted those letters And consequently it is you who have them still Yes Where here Oh no I have them safe at Blois in the little room you know well enough That dear little room that darling little room the ante chamber of the palace I intend you to live in one of these days But I beg your pardon you said that all those letters are in that little room Yes Did you not put them in a box Of course in the same box where I put all the letters I received from you and where I put mine also when your business or your amusements prevented you from coming to our rendezvous Ah very good said Malicorne Why are you satisfied Because I see there is a possibility of not having to run to Blois after the letters for I have them here You have brought the box away It was very dear to me because it belonged to you Be sure and take care of it for it contains original documents that will be of priceless value by and by I am perfectly well aware of that indeed and that is the very reason why I laugh as I do and with all my heart too And now one last word Why last Do we need any one to assist us No one Valets or maid servants Bad policy You will give the letters you will receive them Oh we must have no pride in this affair otherwise M Malicorne and Mademoiselle Aure not transacting their own affairs themselves will have to make up their minds to see them done by others You are quite right but what is going on yonder in M de Guiche s room Nothing he is only opening his window Let us be gone And they both immediately disappeared all the terms of the contract being agreed on The window just opened was in fact that of the Comte de Guiche It was not alone with the hope of catching a glimpse of Madame through her curtains that he seated himself by the open window for his preoccupation of mind had at that time a different origin He had just received as we have already stated the courier who had been dispatched to him by Bragelonne the latter having written to De Guiche a letter which had made the deepest impression upon him and which he had read over and over again Strange strange he murmured How irresponsible are the means by which destiny hurries men onward to their fate Leaving the window in order to approach nearer to the light he once more read the letter he had just received CALAIS MY DEAR COUNT I found M de Wardes at Calais he has been seriously wounded in an affair with the Duke of Buckingham De Wardes is as you know unquestionably brave but full of malevolent and wicked feelings He conversed with me about yourself for whom he says he has a warm regard also about Madame whom he considers a beautiful and amiable woman He has guessed your affection for a certain person He also talked to me about the lady for whom I have so ardent a regard and showed the greatest interest on my behalf in expressing a deep pity for me accompanied however by dark hints which alarmed me at first but which I at last looked upon as the result of his usual love of mystery These are the facts he had received news of the court you will understand however that it was only through M de Lorraine The report goes so says the news that a change has taken place in the king s affections You know whom that concerns Afterwards the news continues people are talking about one of the maids of honor respecting whom various slanderous reports are being circulated These vague phrases have not allowed me to sleep I have been deploring ever since yesterday that my diffidence and vacillation of purpose notwithstanding a certain obstinacy of character I may possess have left me unable to reply to these insinuations In a word M de Wardes was setting off for Paris and I did not delay his departure with explanations for it seemed rather hard I confess to cross examine a man whose wounds are hardly yet closed In short he travelled by short stages as he was anxious to leave he said in order to be present at a curious spectacle the court cannot fail to offer within a short time He added a few congratulatory words accompanied by vague sympathizing expressions I could not understand the one any more than the other I was bewildered by my own thoughts and tormented by a mistrust of this man a mistrust which you know better than any one else I have never been able to overcome As soon as he left my perceptions seemed to become clearer It is hardly possible that a man of De Wardes s character should not have communicated something of his own malicious nature to the statements he made to me It is not unlikely therefore that in the strange hints De Wardes threw out in my presence there may be a mysterious signification which I might have some difficulty in applying either to myself or to some one with whom you are acquainted Being compelled to leave as soon as possible in obedience to the king s commands the idea did not occur to me of running after De Wardes in order to ask him to explain his reserve but I have dispatched a courier to you with this letter which will explain in detail my various doubts I regard you as myself you have reflected and observed it will be for you to act M de Wardes will arrive very shortly endeavor to learn what he meant if you do not already know M de Wardes moreover pretended that the Duke of Buckingham left Paris on the very best of terms with Madame This was an affair which would have unhesitatingly made me draw my sword had I not felt that I was under the necessity of dispatching the king s mission before undertaking any quarrel whatsoever Burn this letter which Olivain will hand you Whatever Olivain says you may confidently rely on Will you have the goodness my dear comte to recall me to the remembrance of Mademoiselle de la Valliere whose hands I kiss with the greatest respect Your devoted DE BRAGELONNE P S If anything serious should happen we should be prepared for everything dispatch a courier to me with this one single word come and I will be in Paris within six and thirty hours after the receipt of your letter De Guiche sighed folded up the letter a third time and instead of burning it as Raoul had recommended him to do placed it in his pocket He felt it needed reading over and over again How much distress of mind yet what sublime confidence he shows murmured the comte he has poured out his whole soul in this letter He says nothing of the Comte de la Fere and speaks of his respect for Louise He cautions me on my own account and entreats me on his Ah continued De Guiche with a threatening gesture you interfere in my affairs Monsieur de Wardes do you Very well then I will shortly occupy myself with yours As for you poor Raoul you who intrust your heart to my keeping be assured I will watch over it With this promise De Guiche begged Malicorne to come immediately to his apartments if possible Malicorne acknowledged the invitation with an activity which was the first result of his conversation with Montalais And while De Guiche who thought that his motive was undiscovered cross examined Malicorne the latter who appeared to be working in the dark soon guessed his questioner s motives The consequence was that after a quarter of an hour s conversation during which De Guiche thought he had ascertained the whole truth with regard to La Valliere and the king he had learned absolutely nothing more than his own eyes had already acquainted him with while Malicorne learned or guessed that Raoul who was absent was fast becoming suspicious and that De Guiche intended to watch over the treasure of the Hesperides Malicorne accepted the office of dragon De Guiche fancied he had done everything for his friend and soon began to think of nothing but his personal affairs The next evening De Wardes s return and first appearance at the king s reception were announced When that visit had been paid the convalescent waited on Monsieur De Guiche taking care however to be at Monsieur s apartments before the visit took place Chapter XII How De Wardes Was Received at Court Monsieur had received De Wardes with that marked favor light and frivolous minds bestow on every novelty that comes in their way De Wardes who had been absent for a month was like fresh fruit to him To treat him with marked kindness was an infidelity to old friends and there is always something fascinating in that moreover it was a sort of reparation to De Wardes himself Nothing consequently could exceed the favorable notice Monsieur took of him The Chevalier de Lorraine who feared this rival but a little but who respected a character and disposition only too parallel to his own in every particular with the addition of a bull dog courage he did not himself possess received De Wardes with a greater display of regard and affection than even Monsieur had done De Guiche as we have said was there also but kept in the background waiting very patiently until all these interchanges were over De Wardes while talking to the others and even to Monsieur himself had not for a moment lost sight of De Guiche who he instinctively felt was there on his account As soon as he had finished with the others he went up to De Guiche They exchanged the most courteous compliments after which De Wardes returned to Monsieur and the other gentlemen In the midst of these congratulations Madame was announced She had been informed of De Wardes s arrival and knowing all the details of his voyage and duel she was not sorry to be present at the remarks she knew would be made without delay by one who she felt assured was her personal enemy Two or three of her ladies accompanied her De Wardes saluted Madame in the most graceful and respectful manner and as a commencement of hostilities announced in the first place that he could furnish the Duke of Buckingham s friends with the latest news about him This was a direct answer to the coldness with which Madame had received him The attack was a vigorous one and Madame felt the blow but without appearing to have even noticed it He rapidly cast a glance at Monsieur and at De Guiche the former colored and the latter turned very pale Madame alone preserved an unmoved countenance but as she knew how many unpleasant thoughts and feelings her enemy could awaken in the two persons who were listening to him she smilingly bent forward towards the traveler as if to listen to the news he had brought but he was speaking of other matters Madame was brave even to imprudence if she were to retreat it would be inviting an attack so after the first disagreeable impression had passed away she returned to the charge Have you suffered much from your wounds Monsieur de Wardes she inquired for we have been told that you had the misfortune to get wounded It was now De Wardes s turn to wince he bit his lips and replied No Madame hardly at all Indeed and yet in this terribly hot weather The sea breezes were very fresh and cool Madame and then I had one consolation Indeed What was it The knowledge that my adversary s sufferings were still greater than my own Ah you mean he was more seriously wounded than you were I was not aware of that said the princess with utter indifference Oh Madame you are mistaken or rather you pretend to misunderstand my remark I did not say that he was a greater sufferer in body than myself but his heart was very seriously affected De Guiche comprehended instinctively from what direction the struggle was approaching he ventured to make a sign to Madame as if entreating her to retire from the contest But she without acknowledging De Guiche s gesture without pretending to have noticed it even and still smiling continued Is it possible she said that the Duke of Buckingham s heart was touched I had no idea until now that a heart wound could be cured Alas Madame replied De Wardes politely every woman believes that and it is this belief that gives them that superiority to man which confidence begets You misunderstand altogether dearest said the prince impatiently M de Wardes means that the Duke of Buckingham s heart had been touched not by the sword but by something sharper Ah very good very good exclaimed Madame It is a jest of M de Wardes s Very good but I should like to know if the Duke of Buckingham would appreciate the jest It is indeed a very great pity he is not here M de Wardes The young man s eyes seemed to flash fire Oh he said as he clenched his teeth there is nothing I should like better De Guiche did not move Madame seemed to expect that he would come to her assistance Monsieur hesitated The Chevalier de Lorraine advanced and continued the conversation Madame he said De Wardes knows perfectly well that for a Buckingham s heart to be touched is nothing new and what he has said has already taken place Instead of an ally I have two enemies murmured Madame two determined enemies and in league with each other And she changed the conversation To change the conversation is as every one knows a right possessed by princes which etiquette requires all to respect The remainder of the conversation was moderate enough in tone the principal actors had rehearsed their parts Madame withdrew easily and Monsieur who wished to question her on several matters offered her his hand on leaving The chevalier was seriously afraid that an understanding might be established between the husband and wife if he were to leave them quietly together He therefore made his way to Monsieur s apartments in order to surprise him on his return and to destroy with a few words all the good impressions Madame might have been able to sow in his heart De Guiche advanced towards De Wardes who was surrounded by a large number of persons and thereby indicated his wish to converse with him De Wardes at the same time showing by his looks and by a movement of his head that he perfectly understood him There was nothing in these signs to enable strangers to suppose they were otherwise than upon the most friendly footing De Guiche could therefore turn away from him and wait until he was at liberty He had not long to wait for De Wardes freed from his questioners approached De Guiche and after a fresh salutation they walked side by side together You have made a good impression since your return my dear De Wardes said the comte Excellent as you see And your spirits are just as lively as ever Better And a very great happiness too Why not Everything is so ridiculous in this world everything so absurd around us You are right You are of my opinion then I should think so And what news do you bring us from yonder I None at all I have come to look for news here But tell me you surely must have seen some people at Boulogne one of our friends for instance it is no great time ago Some people one of our friends Your memory is short Ah true Bragelonne you mean Exactly so Who was on his way to fulfil a mission with which he was intrusted to King Charles II Precisely Well then did he not tell you or did not you tell him I do not precisely know what I told him I must confess but I do know what I did not tell him De Wardes was finesse itself He perfectly well knew from De Guiche s tone and manner which was cold and dignified that the conversation was about to assume a disagreeable turn He resolved to let it take what course it pleased and to keep strictly on his guard May I ask you what you did not tell him inquired De Guiche All about La Valliere La Valliere What is it and what was that strange circumstance you seem to have known over yonder which Bragelonne who was here on the spot was not acquainted with Do you really ask me that in a serious manner Nothing more so What you a member of the court living in Madame s household a friend of Monsieur s a guest at their table the favorite of our lovely princess Guiche colored violently from anger What princess are you alluding to he said I am only acquainted with one my dear fellow I am speaking of Madame herself Are you devoted to another princess then Come tell me De Guiche was on the point of launching out but he saw the drift of the remark A quarrel was imminent between the two young men De Wardes wished the quarrel to be only in Madame s name while De Guiche would not accept it except on La Valliere s account From this moment it became a series of feigned attacks which would have continued until one of the two had been touched home De Guiche therefore resumed all the self possession he could command There is not the slightest question in the world of Madame in this matter my dear De Wardes said Guiche but simply of what you were talking about just now What was I saying That you had concealed certain things from Bragelonne Certain things which you know as well as I do replied De Wardes No upon my honor Nonsense If you tell me what they are I shall know but not otherwise I swear What I who have just arrived from a distance of sixty leagues and you who have not stirred from this place who have witnessed with your own eyes that which rumor informed me of at Calais Do you now tell me seriously that you do not know what it is about Oh comte this is hardly charitable of you As you like De Wardes but I again repeat I know nothing You are truly discreet well perhaps it is very prudent of you And so you will not tell me anything will not tell me any more than you told Bragelonne You are pretending to be deaf I see I am convinced that Madame could not possibly have more command over herself than you have Double hypocrite murmured Guiche to himself you are again returning to the old subject Very well then continued De Wardes since we find it so difficult to understand each other about La Valliere and Bragelonne let us speak about your own affairs Nay said De Guiche I have no affairs of my own to talk about You have not said anything about me I suppose to Bragelonne which you cannot repeat to my face No but understand me Guiche that however much I may be ignorant of certain matters I am quite as conversant with others If for instance we were conversing about the intimacies of the Duke of Buckingham at Paris as I did during my journey with the duke I could tell you a great many interesting circumstances Would you like me to mention them De Guiche passed his hand across his forehead which was covered in perspiration No no he said a hundred times no I have no curiosity for matters which do not concern me The Duke of Buckingham is for me nothing more than a simple acquaintance whilst Raoul is an intimate friend I have not the slightest curiosity to learn what happened to the duke while I have on the contrary the greatest interest in all that happened to Raoul In Paris Yes in Paris or Boulogne You understand I am on the spot if anything should happen I am here to meet it whilst Raoul is absent and has only myself to represent him so Raoul s affairs before my own But he will return Not however until his mission is completed In the meantime you understand evil reports cannot be permitted to circulate about him without my looking into them And for a better reason still that he will remain some time in London said De Wardes chuckling You think so said De Guiche simply Think so indeed do you suppose he was sent to London for no other purpose than to go there and return again immediately No no he was sent to London to remain there Ah De Wardes said De Guiche grasping De Wardes s hand that is a very serious suspicion concerning Bragelonne which completely confirms what he wrote to me from Boulogne De Wardes resumed his former coldness of manner his love of raillery had led him too far and by his own imprudence he had laid himself open to attack Well tell me what did he write to you about he inquired He told me that you had artfully insinuated some injurious remarks against La Valliere and that you had seemed to laugh at his great confidence in that young girl Well it is perfectly true I did so said De Wardes and I was quite ready at the time to hear from the Vicomte de Bragelonne that which every man expects from another whenever anything may have been said to displease him In the same way for instance if I were seeking a quarrel with you I should tell you that Madame after having shown the greatest preference for the Duke of Buckingham is at this moment supposed to have sent the handsome duke away for your benefit Oh that would not wound me in the slightest degree my dear De Wardes said De Guiche smiling notwithstanding the shiver that ran through his whole frame Why such a favor would be too great a happiness I admit that but if I absolutely wished to quarrel with you I should try and invent a falsehood perhaps and speak to you about a certain arbor where you and that illustrious princess were together I should speak also of certain gratifications of certain kissings of the hand and you who are so secret on all occasions so hasty so punctilious Well said De Guiche interrupting him with a smile upon his lips although he almost felt as if he were going to die I swear I should not care for that nor should I in any way contradict you for you must know my dear marquis that for all matters which concern myself I am a block of ice but it is a very different thing when an absent friend is concerned a friend who on leaving confided his interests to my safe keeping for such a friend De Wardes believe me I am like fire itself I understand you Monsieur de Guiche In spite of what you say there cannot be any question between us just now either of Bragelonne or of this insignificant girl whose name is La Valliere At this moment some of the younger courtiers were crossing the apartment and having already heard the few words which had just been pronounced were able also to hear those which were about to follow De Wardes observed this and continued aloud Oh if La Valliere were a coquette like Madame whose innocent flirtations I am sure were first of all the cause of the Duke of Buckingham being sent back to England and afterwards were the reason of your being sent into exile for you will not deny I suppose that Madame s pretty ways really had a certain influence over you The courtiers drew nearer to the speakers Saint Aignan at their head and then Manicamp But my dear fellow whose fault was that said De Guiche laughing I am a vain conceited fellow I know and everybody else knows it too I took seriously that which was only intended as a jest and got myself exiled for my pains But I saw my error I overcame my vanity and I obtained my recall by making the amende honorable and by promising myself to overcome this defect and the consequence is that I am so thoroughly cured that I now laugh at the very thing which three or four days ago would have almost broken my heart But Raoul is in love and is loved in return he cannot laugh at the reports which disturb his happiness reports which you seem to have undertaken to interpret when you know marquis as I do as these gentlemen do as every one does in fact that all such reports are pure calumny Calumny exclaimed De Wardes furious at seeing himself caught in the snare by De Guiche s coolness of temper Certainly calumny Look at this letter from him in which he tells me you have spoken ill of Mademoiselle de la Valliere and where he asks me if what you reported about this young girl is true or not Do you wish me to appeal to these gentlemen De Wardes to decide And with admirable coolness De Guiche read aloud the paragraph of the letter which referred to La Valliere And now continued De Guiche there is no doubt in the world as far as I am concerned that you wished to disturb Bragelonne s peace of mind and that your remarks were maliciously intended De Wardes looked round him to see if he could find support from any one but at the idea that De Wardes had insulted either directly or indirectly the idol of the day every one shook his head and De Wardes saw that he was in the wrong Messieurs said De Guiche intuitively divining the general feeling my discussion with Monsieur de Wardes refers to a subject so delicate in its nature that it is most important no one should hear more than you have already heard Close the doors then I beg you and let us finish our conversation in the manner which becomes two gentlemen one of whom has given the other the lie Messieurs messieurs exclaimed those who were present Is it your opinion then that I was wrong in defending Mademoiselle de la Valliere said De Guiche In that case I pass judgment upon myself and am ready to withdraw the offensive words I may have used to Monsieur de Wardes The deuce certainly not said Saint Aignan Mademoiselle de la Valliere is an angel Virtue and purity itself said Manicamp You see Monsieur de Wardes said De Guiche I am not the only one who undertakes the defense of that poor girl I entreat you therefore messieurs a second time to leave us You see it is impossible we could be more calm and composed than we are It was the very thing the courtiers wished some went out at one door and the rest at the other and the two young men were left alone Well played said De Wardes to the comte Was it not replied the latter How can it be wondered at my dear fellow I have got quite rusty in the country while the command you have acquired over yourself comte confounds me a man always gains something in women s society so pray accept my congratulations I do accept them And I will make Madame a present of them And now my dear Monsieur de Wardes let us speak as loud as you please Do not defy me I do defy you for you are known to be an evil minded man if you do that you will be looked upon as a coward too and Monsieur would have you hanged this evening at his window casement Speak my dear De Wardes speak I have fought already But not quite enough yet I see you would not be sorry to fight with me while my wounds are still open No better still The deuce you are unfortunate in the moment you have chosen a duel after the one I have just fought would hardly suit me I have lost too much blood at Boulogne at the slightest effort my wounds would open again and you would really have too good a bargain True said De Guiche and yet on your arrival here your looks and your arms showed there was nothing the matter with you Yes my arms are all right but my legs are weak and then I have not had a foil in my hand since that devil of a duel and you I am sure have been fencing every day in order to carry your little conspiracy against me to a successful issue Upon my honor monsieur replied De Guiche it is six months since I last practiced No comte after due reflection I will not fight at least with you I will await Bragelonne s return since you say it is Bragelonne who finds fault with me Oh no indeed You shall not wait until Bragelonne s return exclaimed the comte losing all command over himself for you have said that Bragelonne might possibly be some time before he returns and in the meanwhile your wicked insinuations would have had their effect Yet I shall have my excuse So take care I will give you a week to finish your recovery That is better We will wait a week Yes yes I understand a week will give time to my adversary to make his escape No no I will not give you one day even You are mad monsieur said De Wardes retreating a step And you are a coward if you do not fight willingly Nay what is more I will denounce you to the king as having refused to fight after having insulted La Valliere Ah said De Wardes you are dangerously treacherous though you pass for a man of honor There is nothing more dangerous than the treachery as you term it of the man whose conduct is always loyal and upright Restore me the use of my legs then or get yourself bled till you are as white as I am so as to equalize our chances No no I have something better than that to propose What is it We will fight on horseback and will exchange three pistol shots each You are a first rate marksman I have seen you bring down swallows with single balls and at full gallop Do not deny it for I have seen you myself I believe you are right said De Wardes and as that is the case it is not unlikely I might kill you You would be rendering me a very great service if you did I will do my best Is it agreed Give me your hand upon it There it is but on one condition however Name it That not a word shall be said about it to the king Not a word I swear I will go and get my horse then And I mine Where shall we meet In the plain I know an admirable place Shall we go together Why not And both of them on their way to the stables passed beneath Madame s windows which were faintly lighted a shadow could be seen behind the lace curtains There is a woman said De Wardes smiling who does not suspect that we are going to fight to die perhaps on her account Chapter XIII The Combat De Wardes and De Guiche selected their horses and saddled them with their own hands with holster saddles De Guiche having two pairs of pistols went to his apartments to get them and after having loaded them gave the choice to De Wardes who selected the pair he had made use of twenty times before the same indeed with which De Guiche had seen him kill swallows flying You will not be surprised he said if I take every precaution You know the weapons well and consequently I am only making the chances equal Your remark was quite useless replied De Guiche and you have done no more than you are entitled to do Now said De Wardes I beg you to have the goodness to help me to mount for I still experience a little difficulty in doing so In that case we had better settle the matter on foot No once in the saddle I shall be all right Very good then we will not speak of it again said De Guiche as he assisted De Wardes to mount his horse And now continued the young man in our eagerness to murder one another we have neglected one circumstance What is that That it is quite dark and we shall almost be obliged to grope about in order to kill Oh said De Guiche you are as anxious as I am that everything should be done in proper order Yes but I do not wish people to say that you have assassinated me any more than supposing I were to kill you I should myself like to be accused of such a crime Did any one make a similar remark about your duel with the Duke of Buckingham said De Guiche it took place precisely under the same conditions as ours Very true but there was still light enough to see by and we were up to our middles almost in the water besides there were a good number of spectators on shore looking at us De Guiche reflected for a moment and the thought which had already presented itself to him became more confirmed that De Wardes wished to have witnesses present in order to bring back the conversation about Madame and to give a new turn to the combat He avoided saying a word in reply therefore and as De Wardes once more looked at him interrogatively he replied by a movement of the head that it would be best to let things remain as they were The two adversaries consequently set off and left the chateau by the same gate close to which we may remember to have seen Montalais and Malicorne together The night as if to counteract the extreme heat of the day had gathered the clouds together in masses which were moving slowly along from the west to the east The vault above without a clear spot anywhere visible or without the faintest indication of thunder seemed to hang heavily over the earth and soon began by the force of the wind to split into streamers like a huge sheet torn to shreds Large and warm drops of rain began to fall heavily and gathered the dust into globules which rolled along the ground At the same time the hedges which seemed conscious of the approaching storm the thirsty plants the drooping branches of the trees exhaled a thousand aromatic odors which revived in the mind tender recollections thoughts of youth endless life happiness and love How fresh the earth smells said De Wardes it is a piece of coquetry to draw us to her By the by replied De Guiche several ideas have just occurred to me and I wish to have your opinion upon them Relative to Relative to our engagement It is quite some time in fact that we should begin to arrange matters Is it to be an ordinary combat and conducted according to established custom Let me first know what your established custom is That we dismount in any particular open space that may suit us fasten our horses to the nearest object meet each without our pistols in our hands and afterwards retire for a hundred and fifty paces in order to advance on each other Very good that is precisely the way in which I killed poor Follivent three weeks ago at Saint Denis I beg your pardon but you forgot one circumstance What is that That in your duel with Follivent you advanced towards each other on foot your swords between your teeth and your pistols in your hands True While now on the contrary as you cannot walk you yourself admit that we shall have to mount our horses again and charge and the first who wishes to fire will do so That is the best course no doubt but it is quite dark we must make allowances for more missed shots than would be the case in the daytime Very well each will fire three times the pair of pistols already loaded and one reload Excellent Where shall our engagement take place Have you any preference No You see that small wood which lies before us The wood which is called Rochin Exactly You know it Perfectly You know that there is an open glade in the center Yes Well this glade is admirably adapted for such a purpose with a variety of roads by places paths ditches windings and avenues We could not find a better spot I am perfectly satisfied if you are so We are at our destination if I am not mistaken Yes Look at the beautiful open space in the center The faint light which the stars afford seems concentrated in this spot the woods which surround it seem with their barriers to form its natural limits Very good Do as you say Let us first settle the conditions These are mine if you have any objection to make you will state it I am listening If the horse be killed its rider will be obliged to fight on foot That is a matter of course since we have no change of horses here But that does not oblige his adversary to dismount His adversary will in fact be free to act as he likes The adversaries having once met in close contact cannot quit each other under any circumstances and may consequently fire muzzle to muzzle Agreed Three shots and no more will do I suppose Quite sufficient I think Here are powder and balls for your pistols measure out three charges take three balls I will do the same then we will throw the rest of the powder and balls away And we will solemnly swear said De Wardes that we have neither balls nor powder about us Agreed and I swear it said De Guiche holding his hand towards heaven a gesture which De Wardes imitated And now my dear comte said De Wardes allow me to tell you that I am in no way your dupe You already are or soon will be the accepted lover of Madame I have detected your secret and you are afraid I shall tell others of it You wish to kill me to insure my silence that is very clear and in your place I should do the same De Guiche hung down his head Only continued De Wardes triumphantly was it really worth while tell me to throw this affair of Bragelonne s on my shoulders But take care my dear fellow in bringing the wild boar to bay you enrage him to madness in running down the fox you endow him with the ferocity of the jaguar The consequence is that brought to bay by you I shall defend myself to the very last You will be quite right to do so Yes but take care I shall work more harm than you think In the first place as a beginning you will readily suppose that I have not been absurd enough to lock up my secret or your secret rather in my own breast There is a friend of mine who resembles me in every way a man whom you know very well who shares my secret with me so pray understand that if you kill me my death will not have been of much service to you whilst on the contrary if I kill you and everything is possible you know you understand De Guiche shuddered If I kill you continued De Wardes you will have secured two mortal enemies to Madame who will do their very utmost to ruin her Oh monsieur exclaimed De Guiche furiously do not reckon upon my death so easily Of the two enemies you speak of I trust most heartily to dispose of one immediately and the other at the earliest opportunity The only reply De Wardes made was a burst of laughter so diabolical in its sound that a superstitious man would have been terrified But De Guiche was not so impressionable as that I think he said that everything is now settled Monsieur de Wardes so have the goodness to take your place first unless you would prefer me to do so By no means said De Wardes I shall be delighted to save you the slightest trouble And spurring his horse to a gallop he crossed the wide open space and took his stand at that point of the circumference of the cross road immediately opposite to where De Guiche was stationed De Guiche remained motionless At this distance of a hundred paces the two adversaries were absolutely invisible to each other being completely concealed by the thick shade of elms and chestnuts A minute elapsed amidst the profoundest silence At the end of the minute each of them in the deep shade in which he was concealed heard the double click of the trigger as they put the pistols on full cock De Guiche adopting the usual tactics put his horse to a gallop persuaded that he should render his safety doubly sure by the movement as well as by the speed of the animal He directed his course in a straight line towards the point where in his opinion De Wardes would be stationed and he expected to meet De Wardes about half way but in this he was mistaken He continued his course presuming that his adversary was impatiently awaiting his approach When however he had gone about two thirds of the distance he beheld the trees suddenly illuminated and a ball flew by cutting the plume of his hat in two Nearly at the same moment and as if the flash of the first shot had served to indicate the direction of the other a second report was heard and a second ball passed through the head of De Guiche s horse a little below the ear The animal fell These two reports proceeding from the very opposite direction in which he expected to find De Wardes surprised him a great deal but as he was a man of amazing self possession he prepared himself for his horse falling but not so completely however that the toe of his boot escaped being caught under the animal as it fell Very fortunately the horse in its dying agonies moved so as to enable him to release the leg which was less entangled than the other De Guiche rose felt himself all over and found that he was not wounded At the very moment he had felt the horse tottering under him he placed his pistols in the holsters afraid that the force of the fall might explode one at least if not both of them by which he would have been disarmed and left utterly without defense Once on his feet he took the pistols out of the holsters and advanced towards the spot where by the light of the flash he had seen De Wardes appear De Wardes had at the first shot accounted for the maneuver than which nothing could have been simpler Instead of advancing to meet De Guiche or remaining in his place to await his approach De Wardes had for about fifteen paces followed the circle of the shadow which hid him from his adversary s observation and at the very moment when the latter presented his flank in his career he had fired from the place where he stood carefully taking aim and assisted instead of being inconvenienced by the horse s gallop It has been seen that notwithstanding the darkness the first ball passed hardly more than an inch above De Guiche s head De Wardes had so confidently relied upon his aim that he thought he had seen De Guiche fall his astonishment was extreme when he saw he still remained erect in his saddle He hastened to fire his second shot but his hand trembled and he killed the horse instead It would be a most fortunate chance for him if De Guiche were to remain held fast under the animal Before he could have freed himself De Wardes would have loaded his pistol and had De Guiche at his mercy But De Guiche on the contrary was up and had three shots to fire De Guiche immediately understood the position of affairs It would be necessary to exceed De Wardes in rapidity of execution He advanced therefore so as to reach him before he should have had time to reload his pistol De Wardes saw him approaching like a tempest The ball was rather tight and offered some resistance to the ramrod To load carelessly would be simply to lose his last chance to take the proper care in loading meant fatal loss of time or rather throwing away his life He made his horse bound on one side De Guiche turned round also and at the moment the horse was quiet again fired and the ball carried off De Wardes s hat from his head De Wardes now knew that he had a moment s time at his own disposal he availed himself of it in order to finish loading his pistol De Guiche noticing that his adversary did not fall threw the pistol he had just discharged aside and walked straight towards De Wardes elevating the second pistol as he did so He had hardly proceeded more than two or three paces when De Wardes took aim at him as he was walking and fired An exclamation of anger was De Guiche s answer the comte s arm contracted and dropped motionless by his side and the pistol fell from his grasp His anxiety was excessive I am lost murmured De Wardes he is not mortally wounded At the very moment however De Guiche was about to raise his pistol against De Wardes the head shoulders and limbs of the comte seemed to collapse He heaved a deep drawn sigh tottered and fell at the feet of De Wardes s horse That is all right said De Wardes and gathering up the reins he struck his spurs into the horse s sides The horse cleared the comte s motionless body and bore De Wardes rapidly back to the chateau When he arrived there he remained a quarter of an hour deliberating within himself as to the proper course to be adopted In his impatience to leave the field of battle he had omitted to ascertain whether De Guiche were dead or not A double hypothesis presented itself to De Wardes s agitated mind either De Guiche was killed or De Guiche was wounded only If he were killed why should he leave his body in that manner to the tender mercies of the wolves it was a perfectly useless piece of cruelty for if De Guiche were dead he certainly could not breathe a syllable of what had passed if he were not killed why should he De Wardes in leaving him there uncared for allow himself to be regarded as a savage incapable of one generous feeling This last consideration determined his line of conduct De Wardes immediately instituted inquires after Manicamp He was told that Manicamp had been looking after De Guiche and not knowing where to find him had retired to bed De Wardes went and awoke the sleeper without any delay and related the whole affair to him which Manicamp listened to in perfect silence but with an expression of momentarily increasing energy of which his face could hardly have been supposed capable It was only when De Wardes had finished that Manicamp uttered the words Let us go As they proceeded Manicamp became more and more excited and in proportion as De Wardes related the details of the affair to him his countenance assumed every moment a darker expression And so he said when De Wardes had finished you think he is dead Alas I do And you fought in that manner without witnesses He insisted upon it It is very singular What do you mean by saying it is singular That it is very unlike Monsieur de Guiche s disposition You do not doubt my word I suppose Hum hum You do doubt it then A little But I shall doubt it more than ever I warn you if I find the poor fellow is really dead Monsieur Manicamp Monsieur de Wardes It seems you intend to insult me Just as you please The fact is I never did like people who come and say I have killed such and such a gentleman in a corner it is a great pity but I killed him in a perfectly honorable manner It has an ugly appearance M de Wardes Silence we have arrived In fact the glade could now be seen and in the open space lay the motionless body of the dead horse To the right of the horse upon the dark grass with his face against the ground the poor comte lay bathed in his blood He had remained in the same spot and did not even seem to have made the slightest movement Manicamp threw himself on his knees lifted the comte in his arms and found him quite cold and steeped in blood He let him gently fall again Then stretching out his hand and feeling all over the ground close to where the comte lay he sought until he found De Guiche s pistol By Heaven he said rising to his feet pale as death and with the pistol in his hand you are not mistaken he is quite dead Dead repeated De Wardes Yes and his pistol is still loaded added Manicamp looking into the pan But I told you that I took aim as he was walking towards me and fired at him at the very moment he was going to fire at me Are you quite sure that you fought with him Monsieur de Wardes I confess that I am very much afraid it has been a foul assassination Nay nay no exclamations You have had your three shots and his pistol is still loaded You have killed his horse and he De Guiche one of the best marksmen in France has not touched even either your horse or yourself Well Monsieur de Wardes you have been very unlucky in bringing me here all the blood in my body seems to have mounted to my head and I verily believe that since so good an opportunity presents itself I shall blow your brains out on the spot So Monsieur de Wardes recommend yourself to Heaven Monsieur Manicamp you cannot think of such a thing On the contrary I am thinking of it very strongly Would you assassinate me Without the slightest remorse at least for the present Are you a gentleman I have given a great many proofs of that Let me defend my life then at least Very likely in order I suppose that you may do to me what you have done to poor De Guiche And Manicamp slowly raised his pistol to the height of De Wardes s breast and with arm stretched out and a fixed determined look on his face took a careful aim De Wardes did not attempt a flight he was completely terrified In the midst however of this horrible silence which lasted about a second but which seemed an age to De Wardes a faint sigh was heard Oh exclaimed De Wardes he still lives Help De Guiche I am about to be assassinated Manicamp fell back a step or two and the two young men saw the comte raise himself slowly and painfully upon one hand Manicamp threw the pistol away a dozen paces and ran to his friend uttering a cry of delight De Wardes wiped his forehead which was covered with a cold perspiration It was just in time he murmured Where are you hurt inquired Manicamp of De Guiche and whereabouts are you wounded De Guiche showed him his mutilated hand and his chest covered with blood Comte exclaimed De Wardes I am accused of having assassinated you speak I implore you and say that I fought loyally Perfectly so said the wounded man Monsieur de Wardes fought quite loyally and whoever says the contrary will make an enemy of me Then sir said Manicamp assist me in the first place to carry this gentleman home and I will afterwards give you every satisfaction you please or if you are in a hurry we can do better still let us stanch the blood from the comte s wounds here with your pocket handkerchief and mine and then as there are two shots left we can have them between us Thank you said De Wardes Twice already in one hour I have seen death too close at hand to be agreeable I don t like his look at all and I prefer your apologies Manicamp burst out laughing and Guiche too in spite of his sufferings The two young men wished to carry him but he declared he felt quite strong enough to walk alone The ball had broken his ring finger and his little finger and then had glanced along his side but without penetrating deeply into his chest It was the pain rather than the seriousness of the wound therefore which had overcome De Guiche Manicamp passed his arm under one of the count s shoulders and De Wardes did the same with the other and in this way they brought him back to Fontainebleau to the house of the same doctor who had been present at the death of the Franciscan Aramis s predecessor Chapter XIV The King s Supper The king while these matters were being arranged was sitting at the supper table and the not very large number of guests for that day had taken their seats too after the usual gesture intimating the royal permission At this period of Louis XIV s reign although etiquette was not governed by the strict regulations subsequently adopted the French court had entirely thrown aside the traditions of good fellowship and patriarchal affability existing in the time of Henry IV which the suspicious mind of Louis XIII had gradually replaced with pompous state and ceremony 
7879-274125-0001	train-other-500	which he despaired of being able fully to realize The king therefore was seated alone at a small separate table which like the desk of a president overlooked the adjoining tables
7879-274125-0002	train-other-500	Although we say a small table we must not omit to add that this small table was the largest one there Moreover it was the one on which were placed the greatest number and quantity of dishes
7879-274125-0003	train-other-500	consisting of fish game meat fruit vegetables and preserves The king was young and full of vigor and energy very fond of hunting addicted to all violent exercises of the body
none	none	 possessing besides like all the members of the Bourbon family a rapid digestion and an appetite speedily renewed Louis XIV was a formidable table companion 
7879-274125-0004	train-other-500	he delighted in criticising his cooks but when he honored them by praise and commendation the honor was overwhelming The king began by eating several kinds of soup either mixed together or taken separately
7879-274125-0005	train-other-500	He intermixed or rather separated each of the soups by a glass of old wine He ate quickly and somewhat greedily Porthos who from the beginning had out of respect been waiting for a jog of D Artagnan s arm
7879-274125-0006	train-other-500	seeing the king make such rapid progress turned to the musketeer and said in a low voice It seems as if one might go on now his majesty is very encouraging from the example he sets Look
7879-274125-0007	train-other-500	The king eats said D Artagnan but he talks at the same time try and manage matters in such a manner that if he should happen to address a remark to you he will not find you with your mouth full which would be very disrespectful
7879-274125-0008	train-other-500	The best way in that case said Porthos is to eat no supper at all and yet I am very hungry I admit and everything looks and smells most invitingly as if appealing to all my senses at once
7879-274125-0009	train-other-500	Don t think of not eating for a moment said D Artagnan that would put his majesty out terribly The king has a saying that he who works well eats well and he does not like people to eat indifferently at his table
7879-274125-0010	train-other-500	How can I avoid having my mouth full if I eat said Porthos All you have to do replied the captain of the musketeers is simply to swallow what you have in it whenever the king does you the honor to address a remark to you
7879-274125-0011	train-other-500	Very good said Porthos and from that moment he began to eat with a certain well bred enthusiasm
none	none	 The king occasionally looked at the different persons who were at table with him and en connoisseur could appreciate the different dispositions of his guests 
7879-274125-0012	train-other-500	Monsieur du Vallon he said Porthos was enjoying a salmi de lievre and swallowed half of the back His name pronounced in such a manner made him start and by a vigorous effort of his gullet he absorbed the whole mouthful
7879-274125-0013	train-other-500	Sire replied Porthos in a stifled voice but sufficiently intelligible nevertheless Let those
none	none	 filets d agneau be handed to Monsieur du Vallon said the king do you like brown meats M du Vallon 
7879-274125-0014	train-other-500	Sire I like everything replied Porthos D Artagnan whispered Everything your majesty sends me Porthos repeated Everything your majesty sends me an observation which the king apparently received with great satisfaction
7879-274125-0015	train-other-500	People eat well who work well replied the king
none	none	 delighted to have en tete a tete a guest who could eat as Porthos did 
7879-274125-0016	train-other-500	Porthos received the dish of lamb and put a portion of it on his plate Well said the king Exquisite said Porthos calmly Have you as good mutton in your part of the country Monsieur du Vallon continued the king
7879-274125-0017	train-other-500	Sire I believe that from my own province as everywhere else the best of everything is sent to Paris for your majesty s use but on the other hand I do not eat lamb in the same way your majesty does Ah ah
7879-274125-0018	train-other-500	and how do you eat it Generally I have a lamb dressed whole Whole Yes sire In what manner Monsieur du Vallon In this sire my cook who is a German
7879-274125-0019	train-other-500	first stuffs the lamb in question with small sausages he procures from Strasburg force meat balls from Troyes and larks from Pithiviers by some means or other which I am not acquainted with
7879-274125-0020	train-other-500	he bones the lamb as he would do a fowl leaving the skin on however which forms a brown crust all over the animal when it is cut in beautiful slices in the same way as an enormous sausage a rose colored gravy pours forth
7879-274125-0021	train-other-500	which is as agreeable to the eye as it is exquisite to the palate And Porthos finished by smacking his lips The king opened his eyes with delight and while cutting some of the
none	none	 faisan en daube which was being handed to him he said 
7879-274125-0022	train-other-500	That is a dish I should very much like to taste Monsieur du Vallon Is it possible a whole lamb Absolutely an entire lamb sire
none	none	 Pass those pheasants to M du Vallon 
7879-274125-0023	train-other-500	I perceive he is an amateur The order was immediately obeyed Then continuing the conversation he said And you do not find the lamb too fat No sire the fat falls down at the same time as the gravy does and swims on the surface
7879-274125-0024	train-other-500	then the servant who carves removes the fat with a spoon which I have had expressly made for that purpose Where do you reside inquired the king At Pierrefonds sire At Pierrefonds
none	none	 where is that M du Vallon near Belle Isle 
7879-274125-0025	train-other-500	Oh no sire Pierrefonds is in the Soissonnais I thought you alluded to the lamb on account of the salt marshes No sire I have marshes which are not salt it is true but which are not the less valuable on that account
7879-274125-0026	train-other-500	The king had now arrived at the entrements but without losing sight of Porthos who continued to play his part in the best manner
none	none	 You have an excellent appetite M du Vallon said the king and you make an admirable guest at table 
7879-274125-0027	train-other-500	Ah sire if your majesty were ever to pay a visit to Pierrefonds we would both of us eat our lamb together for your appetite is not an indifferent one by any means D Artagnan gave Porthos a kick under the table which made Porthos color up
7879-274125-0028	train-other-500	At your majesty s present happy age said Porthos in order to repair the mistake he had made I was in the musketeers and nothing could ever satisfy me then Your majesty has an excellent appetite as I have already had the honor of mentioning
7879-274125-0029	train-other-500	but you select what you eat with quite too much refinement to be called for one moment a great eater The king seemed charmed at his guest s politeness Will you try some of these creams he said to Porthos Sire
7879-274125-0030	train-other-500	you majesty treats me with far too much kindness to prevent me speaking the whole truth
none	none	 Pray do so M du Vallon 
7879-274125-0031	train-other-500	Will sire with regard to sweet dishes I only recognize pastry and even that should be rather solid all these frothy substances swell the stomach and occupy a space which seems to me to be too precious to be so badly tenanted
none	none	 Ah gentlemen said the king indicating Porthos by a gesture 
7879-274125-0032	train-other-500	here is indeed a model of gastronomy It was in such a manner that our fathers who so well knew what good living was
none	none	 used to eat 
7879-274125-0033	train-other-500	while we added his majesty do nothing but tantalize with our stomachs And as he spoke he took the breast of a chicken with ham while Porthos attacked a dish of partridges and quails The cup bearer filled his majesty s glass
none	none	 Give M du Vallon some of my wine said the king 
7879-274125-0034	train-other-500	This was one of the greatest honors of the royal table D Artagnan pressed his friend s knee If you could only manage to swallow the half of that boar s head I see yonder said he to Porthos
none	none	 I shall believe you will be a duke and peer within the next twelvemonth 
7879-274125-0035	train-other-500	Presently said Porthos phlegmatically I shall come to that by and by In fact it was not long before it came to the boar s turn for the king seemed to take pleasure in urging on his guest
7879-274125-0036	train-other-500	he did not pass any of the dishes to Porthos until he had tasted them himself and he accordingly took some of the boar s head Porthos showed that he could keep pace with his sovereign
none	none	 and instead of eating the half as D Artagnan had told him he ate three fourths of it It 
7879-274125-0037	train-other-500	is impossible said the king in an undertone that a gentleman who eats so good a supper every day and who has such beautiful teeth can be otherwise than the most straightforward upright man in my kingdom Do you hear said D Artagnan in his friend s ear
7879-274125-0038	train-other-500	Yes I think I am rather in favor said Porthos balancing himself on his chair Oh you are in luck s way The king and Porthos continued to eat in the same manner to the great satisfaction of the other guests
7879-274125-0039	train-other-500	some of whom from emulation had attempted to follow them but were obliged to give up half way The king soon began to get flushed and the reaction of the blood to his face announced that the moment of repletion had arrived
none	none	 It was then that Louis XIV instead of becoming gay and cheerful as most good livers generally do became dull melancholy and taciturn 
7879-274125-0040	train-other-500	Porthos on the contrary was lively and communicative D Artagnan s foot had more than once to remind him of this peculiarity of the king
none	none	 The dessert now made its appearance The king had ceased to think anything further of Porthos he turned his eyes anxiously towards the entrance door and he was heard occasionally to inquire how it happened that Monsieur de Saint Aignan was so long in arriving At last at the moment when his majesty was finishing a pot of preserved plums with a deep sigh Saint Aignan appeared The king s eyes which had become somewhat dull immediately began to sparkle The comte advanced towards the king s table and Louis rose at his approach Everybody got up at the same time including Porthos who was just finishing an almond cake capable of making the jaws of a crocodile stick together The supper was over Chapter XV After Supper The king took Saint Aignan by the arm and passed into the adjoining apartment What has detained you comte said the king I was bringing the answer sire replied the comte She has taken a long time to reply to what I wrote her Sire your majesty deigned to write in verse and Mademoiselle de la Valliere wished to repay your majesty in the same coin that is to say in gold Verses Saint Aignan exclaimed the king in ecstasy Give them to me at once And Louis broke the seal of a little letter inclosing the verses which history has preserved entire for us and which are more meritorious in invention than in execution Such as they were however the king was enchanted with them and exhibited his satisfaction by unequivocal transports of delight but the universal silence which reigned in the rooms warned Louis so sensitively particular with regard to good breeding that his delight must give rise to various interpretations He turned aside and put the note in his pocket and then advancing a few steps which brought him again to the threshold of the door close to his guests he said M du Vallon I have seen you to day with the greatest pleasure and my pleasure will be equally great to see you again Porthos bowed as the Colossus of Rhodes would have done and retired from the room with his face towards the king M d Artagnan continued the king you will await my orders in the gallery I am obliged to you for having made me acquainted with M du Vallon Gentlemen addressing himself to the other guests I return to Paris to morrow on account of the departure of the Spanish and Dutch ambassadors Until to morrow then The apartment was immediately cleared of the guests The king took Saint Aignan by the arm made him read La Valliere s verses over again and said What do you think of them Charming sire They charm me in fact and if they were known Oh the professional poets would be jealous of them but it is not likely they will know anything about them Did you give her mine Oh sire she positively devoured them They were very weak I am afraid That is not what Mademoiselle de la Valliere said of them Do you think she was pleased with them I am sure of it sire I must answer then Oh sire immediately after supper Your majesty will fatigue yourself You are quite right study after eating is notoriously injurious The labor of a poet especially so and besides there is great excitement prevailing at Mademoiselle de la Valliere s What do you mean With her as with all the ladies of the court Why On account of poor De Guiche s accident Has anything serious happened to De Guiche then Yes sire he has one hand nearly destroyed a hole in his breast in fact he is dying Good heavens who told you that Manicamp brought him back just now to the house of a doctor here in Fontainebleau and the rumor soon reached us all Brought back Poor De Guiche and how did it happen Ah that is the very question how did it happen You say that in a very singular manner Saint Aignan Give me the details What does he say himself He says nothing sire but others do What others Those who brought him back sire Who are they I do not know sire but M de Manicamp knows M de Manicamp is one of his friends As everybody is indeed said the king Oh no returned Saint Aignan you are mistaken sire every one is not precisely a friend of M de Guiche How do you know that Does your majesty require me to explain myself Certainly I do Well sire I believe I have heard something said about a quarrel between two gentlemen When This very evening before your majesty s supper was served That can hardly be I have issued such stringent and severe ordinances with respect to duelling that no one I presume would dare to disobey them In that case Heaven preserve me from excusing any one exclaimed Saint Aignan Your majesty commanded me to speak and I spoke accordingly Tell me then in what way the Comte de Guiche has been wounded Sire it is said to have been at a boar hunt This evening Yes sire One of his hands shattered and a hole in his breast Who was at the hunt with M de Guiche I do not know sire but M de Manicamp knows or ought to know You are concealing something from me Saint Aignan Nothing sire I assure you Then explain to me how the accident happened was it a musket that burst Very likely sire But yet on reflection it could hardly have been that for De Guiche s pistol was found close by him still loaded His pistol But a man does not go to a boar hunt with a pistol I should think Sire it is also said that De Guiche s horse was killed and that the horse is still to be found in the wide open glade in the forest His horse Guiche go on horseback to a boar hunt Saint Aignan I do not understand a syllable of what you have been telling me Where did this affair happen At the Rond point in that part of the forest called the Bois Rochin That will do Call M d Artagnan Saint Aignan obeyed and the musketeer entered Monsieur d Artagnan said the king you will leave this place by the little door of the private staircase Yes sire You will mount your horse Yes sire And you will proceed to the Rond point du Bois Rochin Do you know the spot Yes sire I have fought there twice What exclaimed the king amazed at the reply Under the edicts sire of Cardinal Richelieu returned D Artagnan with his usual impassability That is very different monsieur You will therefore go there and will examine the locality very carefully A man has been wounded there and you will find a horse lying dead You will tell me what your opinion is upon the whole affair Very good sire As a matter of course it is your own opinion I require and not that of any one else You shall have it in an hour s time sire I prohibit your speaking with any one whoever it may be Except with the person who must give me a lantern said D Artagnan Oh that is a matter of course said the king laughing at the liberty which he tolerated in no one but his captain of the musketeers D Artagnan left by the little staircase Now let my physician be sent for said Louis Ten minutes afterwards the king s physician arrived quite out of breath You will go monsieur said the king to him and accompany M de Saint Aignan wherever he may take you you will render me an account of the state of the person you may see in the house you will be taken to The physician obeyed without a remark as at that time people began to obey Louis XIV and left the room preceding Saint Aignan Do you Saint Aignan send Manicamp to me before the physician can possibly have spoken to him And Saint Aignan left in his turn Chapter XVI Showing in What Way D Artagnan Discharged the Mission with Which the King Had Intrusted Him While the king was engaged in making these last mentioned arrangements in order to ascertain the truth D Artagnan without losing a second ran to the stable took down the lantern saddled his horse himself and proceeded towards the place his majesty had indicated According to the promise he had made he had not accosted any one and as we have observed he had carried his scruples so far as to do without the assistance of the stable helpers altogether D Artagnan was one of those who in moments of difficulty pride themselves on increasing their own value By dint of hard galloping he in less than five minutes reached the wood fastened his horse to the first tree he came to and penetrated to the broad open space on foot He then began to inspect most carefully on foot and with his lantern in his hand the whole surface of the Rond point went forward turned back again measured examined and after half an hour s minute inspection he returned silently to where he had left his horse and pursued his way in deep reflection and at a foot pace to Fontainebleau Louis was waiting in his cabinet he was alone and with a pencil was scribbling on paper certain lines which D Artagnan at the first glance recognized as unequal and very much touched up The conclusion he arrived at was that they must be verses The king raised his head and perceived D Artagnan Well monsieur he said do you bring me any news Yes sire What have you seen As far as probability goes sire D Artagnan began to reply It was certainty I requested of you I will approach it as near as I possibly can The weather was very well adapted for investigations of the character I have just made it has been raining this evening and the roads were wet and muddy Well the result M d Artagnan Sire your majesty told me that there was a horse lying dead in the cross road of the Bois Rochin and I began therefore by studying the roads I say the roads because the center of the cross road is reached by four separate roads The one that I myself took was the only one that presented any fresh traces Two horses had followed it side by side their eight feet were marked very distinctly in the clay One of the riders was more impatient than the other for the footprints of the one were invariably in advance of the other about half a horse s length Are you quite sure they were traveling together said the king Yes sire The horses are two rather large animals of equal pace horses well used to maneuvers of all kinds for they wheeled round the barrier of the Rond point together Well and after The two cavaliers paused there for a minute no doubt to arrange the conditions of the engagement the horses grew restless and impatient One of the riders spoke while the other listened and seemed to have contented himself by simply answering His horse pawed the ground which proves that his attention was so taken up by listening that he let the bridle fall from his hand A hostile meeting did take place then Undoubtedly Continue you are a very accurate observer One of the two cavaliers remained where he was standing the one in fact who had been listening the other crossed the open space and at first placed himself directly opposite to his adversary The one who had remained stationary traversed the Rond point at a gallop about two thirds of its length thinking that by this means he would gain upon his opponent but the latter had followed the circumference of the wood You are ignorant of their names I suppose Completely so sire Only he who followed the circumference of the wood was mounted on a black horse How do you know that I found a few hairs of his tail among the brambles which bordered the sides of the ditch Go on As for the other horse there can be no trouble in describing him since he was left dead on the field of battle What was the cause of his death A ball which had passed through his brain Was the ball that of a pistol or a gun It was a pistol bullet sire Besides the manner in which the horse was wounded explained to me the tactics of the man who had killed it He had followed the circumference of the wood in order to take his adversary in flank Moreover I followed his foot tracks on the grass The tracks of the black horse do you mean Yes sire Go on Monsieur d Artagnan As your majesty now perceives the position of the two adversaries I will for a moment leave the cavalier who had remained stationary for the one who started off at a gallop Do so The horse of the cavalier who rode at full speed was killed on the spot How do you know that The cavalier had not time even to throw himself off his horse and so fell with it I observed the impression of his leg which with a great effort he was enabled to extricate from under the horse The spur pressed down by the weight of the animal had plowed up the ground Very good and what did he do as soon as he rose up again He walked straight up to his adversary Who still remained upon the verge of the forest Yes sire Then having reached a favorable distance he stopped firmly for the impression of both his heels are left in the ground quite close to each other fired and missed his adversary How do you know he did not hit him I found a hat with a ball through it Ah a proof then exclaimed the king Insufficient sire replied D Artagnan coldly it is a hat without any letters indicating its ownership without arms a red feather as all hats have the lace even had nothing particular in it Did the man with the hat through which the bullet had passed fire a second time Oh sire he had already fired twice How did you ascertain that I found the waddings of the pistol And what became of the bullet which did not kill the horse It cut in two the feather of the hat belonging to him against whom it was directed and broke a small birch at the other end of the open glade In that case then the man on the black horse was disarmed whilst his adversary had still one more shot to fire Sire while the dismounted rider was extricating himself from his horse the other was reloading his pistol Only he was much agitated while he was loading it and his hand trembled greatly How do you know that Half the charge fell to the ground and he threw the ramrod aside not having time to replace it in the pistol Monsieur d Artagnan this is marvellous you tell me It is only close observation sire and the commonest highwayman could tell as much The whole scene is before me from the manner in which you relate it I have in fact reconstructed it in my own mind with merely a few alterations And now said the king let us return to the dismounted cavalier You were saying that he walked towards his adversary while the latter was loading his pistol Yes but at the very moment he himself was taking aim the other fired Oh said the king and the shot The shot told terribly sire the dismounted cavalier fell upon his face after having staggered forward three or four paces Where was he hit In two places in the first place in his right hand and then by the same bullet in his chest But how could you ascertain that inquired the king full of admiration By a very simple means the butt end of the pistol was covered with blood and the trace of the bullet could be observed with fragments of a broken ring The wounded man in all probability had the ring finger and the little finger carried off As far as the hand goes I have nothing to say but the chest Sire there were two small pools of blood at a distance of about two feet and a half from each other At one of these pools of blood the grass was torn up by the clenched hand at the other the grass was simply pressed down by the weight of the body Poor De Guiche exclaimed the king Ah it was M de Guiche then said the musketeer quietly I suspected it but did not venture to mention it to your majesty And what made you suspect it I recognized the De Gramont arms upon the holsters of the dead horse And you think he is seriously wounded Very seriously since he fell immediately and remained a long time in the same place however he was able to walk as he left the spot supported by two friends You met him returning then No but I observed the footprints of three men the one on the right and the one on the left walked freely and easily but the one in the middle dragged his feet as he walked besides he left traces of blood at every step he took Now monsieur since you saw the combat so distinctly that not a single detail seems to have escaped you tell me something about De Guiche s adversary Oh sire I do not know him And yet you see everything very clearly Yes sire I see everything but I do not tell all I see and since the poor devil has escaped your majesty will permit me to say that I do not intend to denounce him And yet he is guilty since he has fought a duel monsieur Not guilty in my eyes sire said D Artagnan coldly Monsieur exclaimed the king are you aware of what you are saying Perfectly sire but according to my notions a man who fights a duel is a brave man such at least is my own opinion but your majesty may have another it is but natural for you are master here Monsieur d Artagnan I ordered you however D Artagnan interrupted the king by a respectful gesture You ordered me sire to gather what particulars I could respecting a hostile meeting that had taken place those particulars you have If you order me to arrest M de Guiche s adversary I will do so but do not order me to denounce him to you for in that case I will not obey Very well Arrest him then Give me his name sire The king stamped his foot angrily but after a moment s reflection he said You are right ten times twenty times a hundred times right That is my opinion sire I am happy that this time it accords with your majesty s One word more Who assisted Guiche I do not know sire But you speak of two men There was a person present then as second There was no second sire Nay more than that when M de Guiche fell his adversary fled without giving him any assistance The miserable coward exclaimed the king The consequence of your ordinances sire If a man has fought well and fairly and has already escaped one chance of death he naturally wishes to escape a second M de Bouteville cannot be forgotten very easily And so men turn cowards No they become prudent And he has fled then you say Yes and as fast as his horse could possibly carry him In what direction In the direction of the chateau Well and after that Afterwards as I have had the honor of telling your majesty two men on foot arrived who carried M de Guiche back with them What proof have you that these men arrived after the combat A very evident proof sire at the moment the encounter took place the rain had just ceased the ground had not had time to imbibe the moisture and was consequently soaked the footsteps sank in the ground but while M de Guiche was lying there in a fainting condition the ground became firm again and the footsteps made a less sensible impression Louis clapped his hands together in sign of admiration Monsieur d Artagnan he said you are positively the cleverest man in my kingdom The identical thing M de Richelieu thought and M de Mazarin said sire And now it remains for us to see if your sagacity is at fault Oh sire a man may be mistaken humanum est errare said the musketeer philosophically one In that case you are not human Monsieur d Artagnan for I believe you are never mistaken Your majesty said that we were going to see whether such was the case or not Yes In what way may I venture to ask I have sent for M de Manicamp and M de Manicamp is coming And M de Manicamp knows the secret De Guiche has no secrets from M de Manicamp D Artagnan shook his head No one was present at the combat I repeat and unless M de Manicamp was one of the two men who brought him back Hush said the king he is coming remain and listen attentively Very good sire And at the very same moment Manicamp and Saint Aignan appeared at the threshold of the door Chapter XVII The Encounter The king signified with an imperious gesture first to the musketeer then to Saint Aignan On your lives not a word D Artagnan withdrew like a sentinel to a corner of the room Saint Aignan in his character of a favorite leaned over the back of the king s chair Manicamp with his right foot properly advanced a smile upon his lips and his white and well formed hands gracefully disposed advanced to make his reverence to the king who returned the salutation by a bow Good evening M de Manicamp he said Your majesty did me the honor to send for me said Manicamp Yes in order to learn from you all the details of the unfortunate accident which has befallen the Comte de Guiche Oh sire it is grievous indeed You were there Not precisely sire But you arrived on the scene of the accident a few minutes after it took place Sire about half an hour afterwards And where did the accident happen I believe sire the place is called the Rond point du Bois Rochin Oh the rendezvous of the hunt The very spot sire Good give me all the details you are acquainted with respecting this unhappy affair Monsieur de Manicamp Perhaps your majesty has already been informed of them and I fear to fatigue you with useless repetition No do not be afraid of that Manicamp looked round him he saw only D Artagnan leaning with his back against the wainscot D Artagnan calm kind and good natured as usual and Saint Aignan whom he had accompanied and who still leaned over the king s armchair with an expression of countenance equally full of good feeling He determined therefore to speak out Your majesty is perfectly aware he said that accidents are very frequent in hunting In hunting do you say I mean sire when an animal is brought to bay Ah ah said the king it was when the animal was brought to bay then that the accident happened Alas sire unhappily it was The king paused for a moment before he said What animal was being hunted A wild boar sire And what could possibly have possessed De Guiche to go to a wild boar hunt by himself that is but a clownish idea of sport only fit for that class of people who unlike the Marechal de Gramont have no dogs and huntsmen to hunt as gentlemen should do Manicamp shrugged his shoulders Youth is very rash he said sententiously Well go on said the king At all events continued Manicamp not venturing to be too precipitate and hasty and letting his words fall very slowly one by one at all events sire poor De Guiche went hunting all alone Quite alone indeed What a sportsman And is not M de Guiche aware that the wild boar always stands at bay That is the very thing that really happened sire He had some idea then of the beast being there Yes sire some peasants had seen it among their potatoes two And what kind of animal was it A short thick beast You may as well tell me monsieur that De Guiche had some idea of committing suicide for I have seen him hunt and he is an active and vigorous hunter Whenever he fires at an animal brought to bay and held in check by the dogs he takes every possible precaution and yet he fires with a carbine and on this occasion he seems to have faced the boar with pistols only Manicamp started A costly pair of pistols excellent weapons to fight a duel with a man and not a wild boar What an absurdity There are some things sire which are difficult of explanation You are quite right and the event which we are now discussing is certainly one of them Go on During the recital Saint Aignan who probably would have made a sign to Manicamp to be careful what he was about found that the king s glance was constantly fixed upon himself so that it was utterly impossible to communicate with Manicamp in any way As for D Artagnan the statue of Silence at Athens was far more noisy and far more expressive than he Manicamp therefore was obliged to continue in the same way he had begun and so contrived to get more and more entangled in his explanation Sire he said this is probably how the affair happened Guiche was waiting to receive the boar as it rushed towards him On foot or on horseback inquired the king On horseback He fired upon the brute and missed his aim and then it dashed upon him And the horse was killed Ah your majesty knows that then I have been told that a horse has been found lying dead in the cross roads of the Bois Rochin and I presume it was De Guiche s horse Perfectly true sire it was his Well so much for the horse and now for De Guiche De Guiche once down was attacked and worried by the wild boar and wounded in the hand and in the chest It is a horrible accident but it must be admitted it was De Guiche s own fault How could he possibly have gone to hunt such an animal merely armed with pistols he must have forgotten the fable of Adonis Manicamp rubbed his ear in seeming perplexity Very true he said it was very imprudent Can you explain it Monsieur Manicamp Sire what is written is written Ah you are a fatalist Manicamp looked very uncomfortable and ill at ease I am angry with you Monsieur Manicamp continued the king With me sire Yes How was it that you who are De Guiche s intimate friend and who know that he is subject to such acts of folly did not stop him in time Manicamp no longer knew what to do the tone in which the king spoke was anything but that of a credulous man On the other hand it did not indicate any particular severity nor did he seem to care very much about the cross examination There was more of raillery in it than menace And you say then continued the king that it was positively De Guiche s horse that was found dead Quite positive sire Did that astonish you No sire for your majesty will remember that at the last hunt M de Saint Maure had a horse killed under him and in the same way Yes but that one was ripped open Of course sire Had Guiche s horse been ripped open like M de Saint Maure s horse I should not have been astonished Manicamp opened his eyes very wide Am I mistaken resumed the king was it not in the frontal bone that De Guiche s horse was struck You must admit Monsieur de Manicamp that that is a very singular place for a wild boar to attack You are aware sire that the horse is a very intelligent animal and he doubtless endeavoured to defend himself But a horse defends himself with his heels and not with his head In that case the terrified horse may have slipped or fallen down said Manicamp and the boar you understand sire the boar Oh I understand that perfectly as far as the horse is concerned but how about his rider Well that too is simple enough the boar left the horse and attacked the rider and as I have already had the honor of informing your majesty shattered De Guiche s hand at the very moment he was about to discharge his second pistol at him and then with a gouge of his tusk made that terrible hole in his chest Nothing is more likely really Monsieur de Manicamp you are wrong in placing so little confidence in your own eloquence and you can tell a story most admirably Your majesty is exceedingly kind said Manicamp saluting him in the most embarrassed manner From this day henceforth I will prohibit any gentleman attached to my court going out to a similar encounter Really one might just as well permit duelling Manicamp started and moved as if he were about to withdraw Is your majesty satisfied Delighted but do not withdraw yet Monsieur de Manicamp said Louis I have something to say to you Well well thought D Artagnan there is another who is not up to the mark and he uttered a sigh which might signify Oh the men of our stamp where are they now At this moment an usher lifted up the curtain before the door and announced the king s physician Ah exclaimed Louis here comes Monsieur Valot who has just been to see M de Guiche We shall now hear news of the man maltreated by the boar Manicamp felt more uncomfortable than ever In this way at least added the king our conscience will be quite clear And he looked at D Artagnan who did not seem in the slightest degree discomposed Chapter XVIII The Physician M Valot entered The position of the different persons present was precisely the same the king was seated Saint Aignan leaning over the back of his armchair D Artagnan with his back against the wall and Manicamp still standing Well M Valot said the king did you obey my directions With the greatest alacrity sire You went to the doctor s house in Fontainebleau Yes sire And you found M de Guiche there I did sire What state was he in speak unreservedly In a very sad state indeed sire The wild boar did not quite devour him however Devour whom De Guiche What wild boar The boar that wounded him M de Guiche wounded by a boar So it is said at least By a poacher rather or by a jealous husband or an ill used lover who in order to be revenged fired upon him What is it that you say Monsieur Valot Were not M de Guiche s wounds produced by defending himself against a wild boar M de Guiche s wounds are the result of a pistol bullet that broke his ring finger and the little finger of the right hand and afterwards buried itself in the intercostal muscles of the chest A bullet Are you sure Monsieur de Guiche was wounded by a bullet exclaimed the king pretending to look much surprised Indeed I am sire so sure in fact that here it is And he presented to the king a half flattened bullet which the king looked at but did not touch Did he have that in his chest poor fellow he asked Not precisely The ball did not penetrate but was flattened as you see either upon the trigger of the pistol or upon the right side of the breast bone Good heavens said the king seriously you said nothing to me about this Monsieur de Manicamp Sire What does all this mean then this invention about hunting a wild boar at nightfall Come speak monsieur Sire It seems then that you are right said the king turning round towards his captain of musketeers and that a duel actually took place The king possessed to a greater extent than any one else the faculty enjoyed by the great in power or position of compromising and dividing those beneath him Manicamp darted a look full of reproaches at the musketeer D Artagnan understood the look at once and not wishing to remain beneath the weight of such an accusation advanced a step forward and said Sire your majesty commanded me to go and explore the place where the cross roads meet in the Bois Rochin and to report to you according to my own ideas what had taken place there I submitted my observations to you but without denouncing any one It was your majesty yourself who was the first to name the Comte de Guiche Well monsieur well said the king haughtily you have done your duty and I am satisfied with you But you Monsieur de Manicamp have failed in yours for you have told me a falsehood A falsehood sire The expression is a hard one Find a more accurate then Sire I will not attempt to do so I have already been unfortunate enough to displease your majesty and it will in every respect be far better for me to accept most humbly any reproaches you may think proper to address to me You are right monsieur whoever conceals the truth from me risks my displeasure Sometimes sire one is ignorant of the truth No further falsehood monsieur or I double the punishment Manicamp bowed and turned pale D Artagnan again made another step forward determined to interfere if the still increasing anger of the king attained certain limits You see monsieur continued the king that it is useless to deny the thing any longer M de Guiche has fought a duel I do not deny it sire and it would have been truly generous on your majesty s part not to have forced me to tell a falsehood Forced Who forced you Sire M de Guiche is my friend Your majesty has forbidden duels under pain of death A falsehood might save my friend s life and I told it Good murmured D Artagnan an excellent fellow upon my word Instead of telling a falsehood monsieur you should have prevented him from fighting said the king Oh sire your majesty who is the most accomplished gentleman in France knows quite as well as any of us other gentlemen that we have never considered M de Bouteville dishonored for having suffered death on the Place de Greve That which does in truth dishonor a man is to avoid meeting his enemy not to avoid meeting his executioner Well monsieur that may be so said Louis XIV I am desirous of suggesting a means of your repairing all If it be a means of which a gentleman may avail himself I shall most eagerly seize the opportunity The name of M de Guiche s adversary Oh oh murmured D Artagnan are we going to take Louis XIII as a model Sire said Manicamp with an accent of reproach You will not name him then said the king Sire I do not know him Bravo murmured D Artagnan Monsieur de Manicamp hand your sword to the captain Manicamp bowed very gracefully unbuckled his sword smiling as he did so and handed it for the musketeer to take But Saint Aignan advanced hurriedly between him and D Artagnan Sire he said will your majesty permit me to say a word Do so said the king delighted perhaps at the bottom of his heart for some one to step between him and the wrath he felt he had carried him too far Manicamp you are a brave man and the king will appreciate your conduct but to wish to serve your friends too well is to destroy them Manicamp you know the name the king asks you for It is perfectly true I do know it You will give it up then If I felt I ought to have mentioned it I should have already done so Then I will tell it for I am not so extremely sensitive on such points of honor as you are You are at liberty to do so but it seems to me however Oh a truce to magnanimity I will not permit you to go to the Bastile in that way Do you speak or I will Manicamp was keen witted enough and perfectly understood that he had done quite sufficient to produce a good opinion of his conduct it was now only a question of persevering in such a manner as to regain the good graces of the king Speak monsieur he said to Saint Aignan I have on my own behalf done all that my conscience told me to do and it must have been very importunate he added turning towards the king since its mandates led me to disobey your majesty s commands but your majesty will forgive me I hope when you learn that I was anxious to preserve the honor of a lady Of a lady said the king with some uneasiness Yes sire A lady was the cause of this duel Manicamp bowed If the position of the lady in question warrants it he said I shall not complain of your having acted with so much circumspection on the contrary indeed Sire everything which concerns your majesty s household or the household of your majesty s brother is of importance in my eyes In my brother s household repeated Louis XIV with a slight hesitation The cause of the duel was a lady belonging to my brother s household do you say Or to Madame s Ah to Madame s Yes sire Well and this lady Is one of the maids of honor of her royal highness Madame la Duchesse d Orleans For whom M de Guiche fought do you say Yes sire and this time I tell no falsehood Louis seemed restless and anxious Gentlemen he said turning towards the spectators of this scene will you have the goodness to retire for a moment I wish to be alone with M de Manicamp I know he has some important communication to make for his own justification and which he will not venture before witnesses Put up your sword M de Manicamp Manicamp returned his sword to his belt The fellow decidedly has his wits about him murmured the musketeer taking Saint Aignan by the arm and withdrawing with him He will get out of it said the latter in D Artagnan s ear And with honor too comte Manicamp cast a glance of recognition at Saint Aignan and the captain which luckily passed unnoticed by the king Come come said D Artagnan as he left the room I had an indifferent opinion of the new generation Well I was mistaken after all There is some good in them I perceive Valot preceded the favorite and the captain leaving the king and Manicamp alone in the cabinet Chapter XIX Wherein D Artagnan Perceives that It Was He Who Was Mistaken and Manicamp Who Was Right The king determined to be satisfied that no one was listening went himself to the door and then returned precipitately and placed himself opposite Manicamp And now we are alone Monsieur de Manicamp explain yourself With the greatest frankness sire replied the young man And in the first place pray understand added the king that there is nothing to which I personally attach a greater importance than the honor of any lady That is the very reason sire why I endeavored to study your delicacy of sentiment and feeling Yes I understand it all now You say that it was one of the maids of honor of my sister in law who was the subject of dispute and that the person in question De Guiche s adversary the man in point of fact whom you will not name But whom M de Saint Aignan will name monsieur Yes you say however that this man insulted some one belonging to the household of Madame Yes sire Mademoiselle de la Valliere Ah said the king as if he had expected the name and yet as if its announcement had caused him a sudden pang ah it was Mademoiselle de la Valliere who was insulted I do not say precisely that she was insulted sire But at all events I merely say that she was spoken of in terms far enough from respectful A man dares to speak in disrespectful terms of Mademoiselle de la Valliere and yet you refuse to tell me the name of the insulter Sire I thought it was quite understood that your majesty had abandoned the idea of making me denounce him Perfectly true monsieur returned the king controlling his anger besides I shall know in good time the name of this man whom I shall feel it my duty to punish Manicamp perceived that they had returned to the question again As for the king he saw he had allowed himself to be hurried away a little too far and therefore continued And I will punish him not because there is any question of Mademoiselle de la Valliere although I esteem her very highly but because a lady was the object of the quarrel And I intend that ladies shall be respected at my court and that quarrels shall be put a stop to altogether Manicamp bowed And now Monsieur de Manicamp continued the king what was said about Mademoiselle de la Valliere Cannot your majesty guess I Your majesty can imagine the character of the jest in which young men permit themselves to indulge They very probably said that she was in love with some one the king ventured to remark Probably so But Mademoiselle de la Valliere has a perfect right to love any one she pleases said the king That is the very point De Guiche maintained And on account of which he fought do you mean Yes sire the sole and only cause The king colored And you do not know anything more then In what respect sire In the very interesting respect which you are now referring to What does your majesty wish to know Why the name of the man with whom La Valliere is in love and whom De Guiche s adversary disputed her right to love Sire I know nothing I have heard nothing and have learnt nothing even accidentally but De Guiche is a noble hearted fellow and if momentarily he substituted himself in the place or stead of La Valliere s protector it was because that protector was himself of too exalted a position to undertake her defense These words were more than transparent they made the king blush but this time with pleasure He struck Manicamp gently on the shoulder Well well Monsieur de Manicamp you are not only a ready witty fellow but a brave gentleman besides and your friend De Guiche is a paladin quite after my own heart you will express that to him from me Your majesty forgives me then Completely And I am free The king smiled and held out his hand to Manicamp which he took and kissed respectfully And then added the king you relate stories so charmingly I sire You told me in the most admirable manner the particulars of the accident which happened to Guiche I can see the wild boar rushing out of the wood I can see the horse fall down fighting with his head and the boar rush from the horse to the rider You do not simply relate a story well you positively paint its incidents Sire I think your majesty condescends to laugh at my expense said Manicamp On the contrary said Louis seriously I have so little intention of laughing Monsieur de Manicamp that I wish you to relate this adventure to every one The adventure of the hunt Yes in the same manner you told it to me without changing a single word you understand Perfectly sire And you will relate it then Without losing a minute Very well and now summon M d Artagnan I hope you are no longer afraid of him Oh sire from the very moment I am sure of your majesty s kind disposition I no longer fear anything Call him then said the king Manicamp opened the door and said Gentlemen the king wishes you to return D Artagnan Saint Aignan and Valot entered Gentlemen said the king I summoned you for the purposes of saying that Monsieur de Manicamp s explanation has entirely satisfied me D Artagnan glanced at Valot and Saint Aignan as much as to say Well did I not tell you so The king led Manicamp to the door and then in a low tone of voice said See that M de Guiche takes good care of himself and particularly that he recovers as soon as possible I am very desirous of thanking him in the name of every lady but let him take special care that he does not begin again Were he to die a hundred times sire he would begin again if your majesty s honor were in any way called in question This remark was direct enough But we have already said that the incense of flattery was very pleasing to the king and provided he received it he was not very particular as to its quality Very well very well he said as he dismissed Manicamp I will see De Guiche myself and make him listen to reason And as Manicamp left the apartment the king turned round towards the three spectators of this scene and said Tell me Monsieur d Artagnan how does it happen that your sight is so imperfect you whose eyes are generally so very good My sight bad sire Certainly It must be the case since your majesty says so but in what respect may I ask Why with regard to what occurred in the Bois Rochin Ah ah Certainly You pretended to have seen the tracks of two horses to have detected the footprints of two men and have described the particulars of an engagement which you assert took place Nothing of the sort occurred pure illusion on your part Ah ah said D Artagnan Exactly the same thing with the galloping to and fro of the horses and the other indications of a struggle It was the struggle of De Guiche against the wild boar and absolutely nothing else only the struggle was a long and a terrible one it seems Ah ah continued D Artagnan And when I think that I almost believed it for a moment but then you told it with such confidence I admit sire that I must have been very short sighted said D Artagnan with a readiness of humor which delighted the king You do admit it then Admit it sire most assuredly I do So now that you see the thing In quite a different light from that in which I saw it half an hour ago And to what then do you attribute this difference in your opinion Oh a very simple thing sire half an hour ago I returned from Bois Rochin where I had nothing to light me but a stupid stable lantern While now While now I have all the wax lights of your cabinet and more than that your majesty s own eyes which illuminate everything like the blazing sun at noonday The king began to laugh and Saint Aignan broke out into convulsions of merriment It is precisely like M Valot said D Artagnan resuming the conversation where the king had left off he has been imagining all along that not only was M de Guiche wounded by a bullet but still more that he extracted it even from his chest Upon my word said Valot I assure you Now did you not believe that continued D Artagnan Yes said Valot not only did I believe it but at this very moment I would swear it Well my dear doctor you have dreamt it I have dreamt it M de Guiche s wound a mere dream the bullet a dream So take my advice and prate no more about it Well said returned the king M d Artagnan s advice is sound Do not speak of your dream to any one Monsieur Valot and upon the word of a gentleman you will have no occasion to repent it Good evening gentlemen a very sad affair indeed is a wild boar hunt A very serious thing indeed repeated D Artagnan in a loud voice is a wild boar hunt and he repeated it in every room through which he passed and left the chateau taking Valot with him And now we are alone said the king to Saint Aignan what is the name of De Guiche s adversary Saint Aignan looked at the king Oh do not hesitate said the king you know that I am bound beforehand to forgive De Wardes said Saint Aignan Very good said Louis XIV and then retiring to his own room added to himself To forgive is not to forget Chapter XX Showing the Advantage of Having Two Strings to One s Bow Manicamp quitted the king s apartment delighted at having succeeded so well when just as he reached the bottom of the staircase and was passing a doorway he felt that some one suddenly pulled him by the sleeve He turned round and recognized Montalais who was waiting for him in the passage and who in a very mysterious manner with her body bent forward and in a low tone of voice said to him Follow me monsieur and without any delay if you please Where to mademoiselle inquired Manicamp In the first place a true knight would not have asked such a question but would have followed me without requiring any explanation Well mademoiselle I am quite ready to conduct myself as a true knight No it is too late and you cannot take the credit of it We are going to Madame s apartment so come at once Ah ah said Manicamp Lead on then And he followed Montalais who ran before him as light as Galatea This time said Manicamp as he followed his guide I do not think that stories about hunting expeditions would be acceptable We will try however and if need be well if there should be any occasion for it we must try something else Montalais still ran on How fatiguing it is thought Manicamp to have need of one s head and legs at the same time At last however they arrived Madame had just finished undressing and was in a most elegant deshabille but it must be understood that she had changed her dress before she had any idea of being subjected to the emotions now agitating her She was waiting with the most restless impatience and Montalais and Manicamp found her standing near the door At the sound of their approaching footsteps Madame came forward to meet them Ah she said at last Here is M Manicamp replied Montalais Manicamp bowed with the greatest respect Madame signed to Montalais to withdraw and she immediately obeyed Madame followed her with her eyes in silence until the door closed behind her and then turning towards Manicamp said What is the matter and is it true as I am told Monsieur de Manicamp that some one is lying wounded in the chateau Yes Madame unfortunately so Monsieur de Guiche Yes Monsieur de Guiche repeated the princess I had in fact heard it rumored but not confirmed And so in truth it is Monsieur de Guiche who has been thus unfortunate M de Guiche himself Madame Are you aware M de Manicamp said the princess hastily that the king has the strongest antipathy to duels Perfectly so Madame but a duel with a wild beast is not answerable Oh you will not insult me by supposing that I credit the absurd fable with what object I cannot tell respecting M de Guiche having been wounded by a wild boar No no monsieur the real truth is known and in addition to the inconvenience of his wound M de Guiche runs the risk of losing his liberty if not his life Alas Madame I am well aware of that but what is to be done You have seen the king Yes Madame What did you say to him I told him how M de Guiche went to the chase and how a wild boar rushed forth out of the Bois Rochin how M de Guiche fired at it and how in fact the furious brute dashed at De Guiche killed his horse and grievously wounded himself And the king believed that Implicitly Oh you surprise me Monsieur de Manicamp you surprise me very much And Madame walked up and down the room casting a searching look from time to time at Manicamp who remained motionless and impassible in the same place At last she stopped And yet she said every one here seems unanimous in giving another cause for this wound What cause Madame said Manicamp may I be permitted without indiscretion to ask your highness You ask such a question You M de Guiche s intimate friend his confidant indeed Oh Madame his intimate friend yes confidant no De Guiche is a man who can keep his own secrets who has some of his own certainly but who never breathes a syllable about them De Guiche is discretion itself Madame Very well then those secrets which M de Guiche keeps so scrupulously I shall have the pleasure of informing you of said the princess almost spitefully for the king may possibly question you a second time and if on the second occasion you were to repeat the same story to him he possibly might not be very well satisfied with it But Madame I think your highness is mistaken with regard to the king His majesty was perfectly satisfied with me I assure you In that case permit me to assure you Monsieur de Manicamp it only proves one thing which is that his majesty is very easily satisfied I think your highness is mistaken in arriving at such an opinion his majesty is well known not to be contented except with very good reason And do you suppose that he will thank you for your officious falsehood when he will learn to morrow that M de Guiche had on behalf of his friend M de Bragelonne a quarrel which ended in a hostile meeting A quarrel on M de Bragelonne s account said Manicamp with the most innocent expression in the world what does your royal highness do me the honor to tell me What is there astonishing in that M de Guiche is susceptible irritable and easily loses his temper On the contrary Madame I know M de Guiche to be very patient and never susceptible or irritable except upon very good grounds But is not friendship a just ground said the princess Oh certainly Madame and particularly for a heart like his Very good you will not deny I suppose that M de Bragelonne is M de Guiche s good friend A great friend Well then M de Guiche has taken M de Bragelonne s part and as M de Bragelonne was absent and could not fight he fought for him Manicamp began to smile and moved his head and shoulders very slightly as much as to say Oh if you will positively have it so But speak at all events said the princess out of patience speak I Of course it is quite clear you are not of my opinion and that you have something to say I have only one thing to say Madame Name it That I do not understand a single word of what you have just been telling me What you do not understand a single word about M de Guiche s quarrel with M de Wardes exclaimed the princess almost out of temper Manicamp remained silent A quarrel she continued which arose out of a conversation scandalous in its tone and purport and more or less well founded respecting the virtue of a certain lady Ah of a certain lady this is quite another thing said Manicamp You begin to understand do you not Your highness will excuse me but I dare not You dare not said Madame exasperated very well then wait one moment I will dare Madame Madame exclaimed Manicamp as if in great dismay be careful of what you are going to say It would seem monsieur that if I happened to be a man you would challenge me notwithstanding his majesty s edicts as Monsieur de Guiche challenged M de Wardes and that too on account of the virtue of Mademoiselle de la Valliere Of Mademoiselle de la Valliere exclaimed Manicamp starting backwards as if that was the very last name he expected to hear pronounced What makes you start in that manner Monsieur de Manicamp said Madame ironically do you mean to say you would be impertinent enough to suspect that young lady s honor Madame in the whole course of this affair there has not been the slightest question of Mademoiselle de la Valliere s honor What when two men have almost blown each other s brains out on a woman s behalf do you mean to say she has had nothing to do with the affair and that her name has not been called in question at all I did not think you so good a courtier Monsieur de Manicamp Pray forgive me Madame said the young man but we are very far from understanding one another You do me the honor to speak one language while I am speaking altogether another I beg your pardon but I do not understand your meaning Forgive me then but I fancied I understood your highness to remark that De Guiche and De Wardes had fought on Mademoiselle de la Valliere s account Certainly On account of Mademoiselle de la Valliere I think you said repeated Manicamp I do not say that M de Guiche personally took an interest in Mademoiselle de la Valliere but I say that he did so as representing or acting on behalf of another On behalf of another Come do not always assume such a bewildered look Does not every one here know that M de Bragelonne is affianced to Mademoiselle de la Valliere and that before he went on the mission with which the king intrusted him he charged his friend M de Guiche to watch over that interesting young lady There is nothing more for me to say then Your highness is well informed Of everything I beg you to understand that clearly Manicamp began to laugh which almost exasperated the princess who was not as we know of a very patient disposition Madame resumed the discreet Manicamp saluting the princess let us bury this affair altogether in forgetfulness for it will probably never be quite cleared up Oh as far as that goes there is nothing more to do and the information is complete The king will learn that M de Guiche has taken up the cause of this little adventuress who gives herself all the airs of a grand lady he will learn that Monsieur de Bragelonne having nominated his friend M de Guiche his guardian in ordinary the latter immediately fastened as he was required to do upon the Marquis de Wardes who ventured to trench upon his privileges Moreover you cannot pretend to deny Monsieur Manicamp you who know everything so well that the king on his side casts a longing eye upon this famous treasure and that he will bear no slight grudge against M de Guiche for constituting himself its defender Are you sufficiently well informed now or do you require anything further If so speak monsieur No Madame there is nothing more I wish to know Learn however for you ought to know it Monsieur de Manicamp learn that his majesty s indignation will be followed by terrible consequences In princes of a similar temperament to that of his majesty the passion which jealousy causes sweeps down like a whirlwind Which you will temper Madame I exclaimed the princess with a gesture of indescribable irony I and by what title may I ask Because you detest injustice Madame And according to your account then it would be an injustice to prevent the king arranging his love affairs as he pleases You will intercede however in M de Guiche s favor You are mad monsieur said the princess in a haughty tone of voice On the contrary I am in the most perfect possession of my senses and I repeat you will defend M de Guiche before the king Why should I Because the cause of M de Guiche is your own Madame said Manicamp with ardor kindling in his eyes What do you mean by that I mean Madame that with respect to the defense which Monsieur de Guiche undertook in M de Bragelonne s absence I am surprised that your highness has not detected a pretext in La Valliere s name having been brought forward A pretext But a pretext for what repeated the princess hesitatingly for Manicamp s steady look had just revealed something of the truth to her I trust Madame said the young man I have said sufficient to induce your highness not to overwhelm before his majesty my poor friend De Guiche against whom all the malevolence of a party bitterly opposed to your own will now be directed You mean on the contrary I suppose that all those who have no great affection for Mademoiselle de la Valliere and even perhaps a few of those who have some regard for her will be angry with the comte Oh Madame why will you push your obstinacy to such an extent and refuse to open your ears and listen to the counsel of one whose devotion to you is unbounded Must I expose myself to the risk of your displeasure am I really to be called upon to name contrary to my own wish the person who was the real cause of this quarrel The person said Madame blushing Must I continued Manicamp tell you how poor De Guiche became irritated furious exasperated beyond all control at the different rumors now being circulated about this person Must I if you persist in this willful blindness and if respect should continue to prevent me naming her must I I repeat recall to your recollection the various scenes which Monsieur had with the Duke of Buckingham and the insinuations which were reported respecting the duke s exile Must I remind you of the anxious care the comte always took in his efforts to please to watch to protect that person for whom alone he lives for whom alone he breathes Well I will do so and when I shall have made you recall all the particulars I refer to you will perhaps understand how it happened that the comte having lost all control over himself and having been for some time past almost harassed to death by De Wardes became at the first disrespectful expression which the latter pronounced respecting the person in question inflamed with passion and panted only for an opportunity of avenging the affront The princess concealed her face with her hands Monsieur monsieur she exclaimed do you know what you are saying and to whom you are speaking And so Madame pursued Manicamp as if he had not heard the exclamations of the princess nothing will astonish you any longer neither the comte s ardor in seeking the quarrel nor his wonderful address in transferring it to a quarter foreign to your own personal interests That latter circumstance was indeed a marvelous instance of tact and perfect coolness and if the person in whose behalf the comte so fought and shed his blood does in reality owe some gratitude to the poor wounded sufferer it is not on account of the blood he has shed or the agony he has suffered but for the steps he has taken to preserve from comment or reflection an honor which is more precious to him than his own Oh cried Madame as if she had been alone is it possible the quarrel was on my account Manicamp felt he could now breathe for a moment and gallantly had he won the right to do so Madame on her side remained for some time plunged in a painful reverie Her agitation could be seen by her quick respiration by her drooping eyelids by the frequency with which she pressed her hand upon her heart But in her coquetry was not so much a passive quality as on the contrary a fire which sought for fuel to maintain itself finding anywhere and everywhere what it required If it be as you assert she said the comte will have obliged two persons at the same time for Monsieur de Bragelonne also owes a deep debt of gratitude to M de Guiche and with far greater reason indeed because everywhere and on every occasion Mademoiselle de la Valliere will be regarded as having been defended by this generous champion Manicamp perceived that there still remained some lingering doubt in the princess s heart A truly admirable service indeed he said is the one he has rendered to Mademoiselle de la Valliere A truly admirable service to M de Bragelonne The duel has created a sensation which in some respects casts a dishonorable suspicion upon that young girl a sensation indeed which will embroil her with the vicomte The consequence is that De Wardes s pistol bullet has had three results instead of one it destroys at the same time the honor of a woman the happiness of a man and perhaps it has wounded to death one of the best gentlemen in France Oh Madame your logic is cold even calculating it always condemns it never absolves Manicamp s concluding words scattered to the winds the last doubt which lingered not in Madame s heart but in her mind She was no longer a princess full of scruples nor a woman with her ever returning suspicions but one whose heart has just felt the mortal chill of a wound Wounded to death she murmured in a faltering voice oh Monsieur de Manicamp did you not say wounded to death Manicamp returned no other answer than a deep sigh And so you said that the comte is dangerously wounded continued the princess Yes Madame one of his hands is shattered and he has a bullet lodged in his breast Gracious heavens resumed the princess with a feverish excitement this is horrible Monsieur de Manicamp a hand shattered do you say and a bullet in his breast And that coward that wretch that assassin De Wardes did it Manicamp seemed overcome by a violent emotion He had in fact displayed no little energy in the latter part of his speech As for Madame she entirely threw aside all regard for the formal observances of propriety society imposes for when with her passion spoke in accents either of anger or sympathy nothing could restrain her impulses Madame approached Manicamp who had subsided in a chair as if his grief were a sufficiently powerful excuse for his infraction of the laws of etiquette Monsieur she said seizing him by the hand be frank with me Manicamp looked up Is M de Guiche in danger of death Doubly so Madame he replied in the first place on account of the hemorrhage which has taken place an artery having been injured in the hand and next in consequence of the wound in his breast which may the doctor is afraid at least have injured some vital part He may die then Die yes Madame and without even having had the consolation of knowing that you have been told of his devotion You will tell him I Yes are you not his friend I oh no Madame I will only tell M de Guiche if indeed he is still in a condition to hear me I will only tell him what I have seen that is your cruelty to him Oh monsieur you will not be guilty of such barbarity Indeed Madame I shall speak the truth for nature is very energetic in a man of his age The physicians are clever men and if by chance the poor comte should survive his wound I should not wish him to die of a wound of the heart after surviving one of the body Manicamp rose and with an expression of profoundest respect seemed to be desirous of taking leave At least monsieur said Madame stopping him with almost a suppliant air you will be kind enough to tell me in what state your wounded friend is and who is the physician who attends him As regards the state he is in Madame he is seriously ill his physician is M Valot his majesty s private medical attendant M Valot is moreover assisted by a professional friend to whose house M de Guiche has been carried What he is not in the chateau said Madame Alas Madame the poor fellow was so ill that he could not even be conveyed thither Give me the address monsieur said the princess hurriedly I will send to inquire after him Rue du Feurre a brick built house with white outside blinds The doctor s name is on the door You are returning to your wounded friend Monsieur de Manicamp Yes Madame You will be able then to do me a service I am at your highness s orders Do what you intended to do return to M de Guiche send away all those whom you may find there and have the kindness yourself to go away too Madame Let us waste no time in useless explanations Accept the fact as I present it to you see nothing in it beyond what is really there and ask nothing further than what I tell you I am going to send one of my ladies perhaps two because it is now getting late I do not wish them to see you or rather I do not wish you to see them These are scruples you can understand you particularly Monsieur de Manicamp who seem capable of divining so much Oh Madame perfectly I can even do better still I will precede or rather walk in advance of your attendants it will at the same time be the means of showing them the way more accurately and of protecting them if occasion arises though there is no probability of their needing protection And by this means then they would be sure of entering without difficulty would they not Certainly Madame for as I should be the first to pass I thus remove any difficulties that might chance to be in the way Very well Go go Monsieur de Manicamp and wait at the bottom of the staircase I go at once Madame Stay Manicamp paused When you hear the footsteps of two women descending the stairs go out and without once turning round take the road which leads to where the poor count is lying But if by any mischance two other persons were to descend and I were to be mistaken You will hear one of the two clap her hands together softly Go Manicamp turned round bowed once more and left the room his heart overflowing with joy In fact he knew very well that the presence of Madame herself would be the best balm to apply to his friend s wounds A quarter of an hour had hardly elapsed when he heard the sound of a door opened softly and closed with like precaution He listened to the light footfalls gliding down the staircase and then heard the signal agreed upon He immediately went out and faithful to his promise bent his way without once turning his head through the streets of Fontainebleau towards the doctor s dwelling Chapter XXI M Malicorne the Keeper of the Records of France Two women their figures completely concealed by their mantles and whose masks effectually hid the upper portion of their faces timidly followed Manicamp s steps On the first floor behind curtains of red damask the soft light of a lamp placed upon a low table faintly illumined the room at the other extremity of which on a large bedstead supported by spiral columns around which curtains of the same color as those which deadened the rays of the lamp had been closely drawn lay De Guiche his head supported by pillows his eyes looking as if the mists of death were gathering his long black hair scattered over the pillow set off the young man s hollow temples It was easy to see that fever was the chief tenant of the chamber De Guiche was dreaming His wandering mind was pursuing through gloom and mystery one of those wild creations delirium engenders Two or three drops of blood still liquid stained the floor Manicamp hurriedly ran up the stairs but paused at the threshold of the door looked into the room and seeing that everything was perfectly quiet he advanced towards the foot of the large leathern armchair a specimen of furniture of the reign of Henry IV and seeing that the nurse as a matter of course had dropped off to sleep he awoke her and begged her to pass into the adjoining room Then standing by the side of the bed he remained for a moment deliberating whether it would be better to awaken Guiche in order to acquaint him with the good news But as he began to hear behind the door the rustling of silk dresses and the hurried breathing of his two companions and as he already saw that the curtain screening the doorway seemed on the point of being impatiently drawn aside he passed round the bed and followed the nurse into the next room As soon as he had disappeared the curtain was raised and his two female companions entered the room he had just left The one who entered first made a gesture to her companion which riveted her to the spot where she stood close to the door and then resolutely advanced towards the bed drew back the curtains along the iron rod and threw them in thick folds behind the head of the bed She gazed upon the comte s pallid face remarked his right hand enveloped in linen whose dazzling whiteness was emphasized by the counterpane patterned with dark leaves thrown across the couch She shuddered as she saw a stain of blood growing larger and larger upon the bandages The young man s breast was uncovered as though for the cool night air to assist his respiration A narrow bandage fastened the dressings of the wound around which a purplish circle of extravasated blood was gradually increasing in size A deep sigh broke from her lips She leaned against one of the columns of the bed and gazed through the apertures in her mask upon the harrowing spectacle before her A hoarse harsh groan passed like a death rattle through the comte s clenched teeth The masked lady seized his left hand which scorched like burning coals But at the very moment she placed her icy hand upon it the action of the cold was such that De Guiche opened his eyes and by a look in which revived intelligence was dawning seemed as though struggling back again into existence The first thing upon which he fixed his gaze was this phantom standing erect by his bedside At that sight his eyes became dilated but without any appearance of consciousness in them The lady thereupon made a sign to her companion who had remained at the door and in all probability the latter had already received her lesson for in a clear tone of voice and without any hesitation whatever she pronounced these words Monsieur le comte her royal highness Madame is desirous of knowing how you are able to bear your wound and to express to you by my lips her great regret at seeing you suffer As she pronounced the word Madame Guiche started he had not as yet remarked the person to whom the voice belonged and he naturally turned towards the direction whence it preceded But as he felt the cold hand still resting on his own he again turned towards the motionless figure beside him Was it you who spoke madame he asked in a weak voice or is there another person in beside you in the room Yes replied the figure in an almost unintelligible voice as she bent down her head Well said the wounded man with a great effort I thank you Tell Madame that I no longer regret to die since she has remembered me At the words to die pronounced by one whose life seemed to hang on a thread the masked lady could not restrain her tears which flowed under the mask and appeared upon her cheeks just where the mask left her face bare If De Guiche had been in fuller possession of his senses he would have seen her tears roll like glistening pearls and fall upon his bed The lady forgetting that she wore her mask raised her hand as though to wipe her eyes and meeting the rough velvet she tore away her mask in anger and threw it on the floor At the unexpected apparition before him which seemed to issue from a cloud De Guiche uttered a cry and stretched his arms towards her but every word perished on his lips and his strength seemed utterly abandoning him His right hand which had followed his first impulse without calculating the amount of strength he had left fell back again upon the bed and immediately afterwards the white linen was stained with a larger spot than before In the meantime the young man s eyes became dim and closed as if he were already struggling with the messenger of death and then after a few involuntary movements his head fell back motionless on his pillow his face grew livid The lady was frightened but on this occasion contrary to what is usually the case fear attracted She leaned over the young man gazed earnestly fixedly at his pale cold face which she almost touched then imprinted a rapid kiss upon De Guiche s left hand who trembling as if an electric shock had passed through him awoke a second time opened his large eyes incapable of recognition and again fell into a state of complete insensibility Come she said to her companion we must not remain here any longer I shall be committing some folly or other Madame Madame your highness is forgetting your mask said her vigilant companion Pick it up replied her mistress as she tottered almost senseless towards the staircase and as the outer door had been left only half closed the two women light as birds passed through it and with hurried steps returned to the palace One of them ascended towards Madame s apartments where she disappeared the other entered the rooms belonging to the maids of honor namely on the entresol and having reached her own room she sat down before a table and without giving herself time even to breathe wrote the following letter This evening Madame has been to see M de Guiche Everything is going well on this side See that your news is equally exemplary and do not forget to burn this paper She folded the letter and leaving her room with every possible precaution crossed a corridor which led to the apartments appropriated to the gentlemen attached to Monsieur s service She stopped before a door under which having previously knocked twice in a short quick manner she thrust the paper and fled Then returning to her own room she removed every trace of her having gone out and also of having written the letter Amid the investigations she was so diligently pursuing she perceived on the table the mask which belonged to Madame and which according to her mistress s directions she had brought back but had forgotten to restore to her Oh oh she said I must not forget to do to morrow what I have forgotten to day And she took hold of the velvet mask by that part which covered the cheeks and feeling that her thumb was wet looked at it It was not only wet but reddened The mask had fallen upon one of the spots of blood which we have already said stained the floor and from that black velvet outside which had accidentally come into contact with it the blood had passed through to the inside and stained the white cambric lining Oh oh said Montalais for doubtless our readers have already recognized her by these various maneuvers I shall not give back this mask it is far too precious now And rising from her seat she ran towards a box made of maple wood which inclosed different articles of toilette and perfumery No not here she said such a treasure must not be abandoned to the slightest chance of detection Then after a moment s silence and with a smile that was peculiarly her own she added Beautiful mask stained with the blood of that brave knight you shall go and join that collection of wonders La Valliere s and Raoul s letters that loving collection indeed which will some day or other form part of the history of France of European royalty You shall be placed under M Malicorne s care said the laughing girl as she began to undress herself under the protection of that worthy M Malicorne she said blowing out the taper who thinks he was born only to become the chief usher of Monsieur s apartments and whom I will make keeper of the records and historiographer of the house of Bourbon and of the first houses in the kingdom Let him grumble now that discontented Malicorne she added as she drew the curtains and fell asleep Chapter XXII The Journey The next day being agreed upon for the departure the king at eleven o clock precisely descended the grand staircase with the two queens and Madame in order to enter his carriage drawn by six horses that were pawing the ground in impatience at the foot of the staircase The whole court awaited the royal appearance in the Fer a cheval crescent in their travelling costumes the large number of saddled horses and carriages of ladies and gentlemen of the court surrounded by their attendants servants and pages formed a spectacle whose brilliancy could scarcely be equalled The king entered his carriage with the two queens Madame was in the same one with Monsieur The maids of honor followed their example and took their seats two by two in the carriages destined for them The weather was exceedingly warm a light breeze which early in the morning all had thought would have proved sufficient to cool the air soon became fiercely heated by the rays of the sun although it was hidden behind the clouds and filtered through the heated vapor which rose from the ground like a scorching wind bearing particles of fine dust against the faces of the travelers Madame was the first to complain of the heat Monsieur s only reply was to throw himself back in the carriage as though about to faint and to inundate himself with scents and perfumes uttering the deepest sighs all the while whereupon Madame said to him with her most amiable expression Really Monsieur I fancied that you would have been polite enough on account of the terrible heat to have left me my carriage to myself and to have performed the journey yourself on horseback Ride on horseback cried the prince with an accent of dismay which showed how little idea he had of adopting this unnatural advice you cannot suppose such a thing Madame My skin would peel off if I were to expose myself to such a burning breeze as this Madame began to laugh You can take my parasol she said But the trouble of holding it replied Monsieur with the greatest coolness besides I have no horse What no horse replied the princess who if she did not secure the solitude she required at least obtained the amusement of teasing No horse You are mistaken Monsieur for I see your favorite bay out yonder My bay horse exclaimed the prince attempting to lean forward to look out of the door but the movement he was obliged to make cost him so much trouble that he soon hastened to resume his immobility Yes said Madame your horse led by M de Malicorne Poor beast replied the prince how warm it must be And with these words he closed his eyes like a man on the point of death Madame on her side reclined indolently in the other corner of the carriage and closed her eyes also not however to sleep but to think more at her ease In the meantime the king seated in the front seat of his carriage the back of which he had yielded up to the two queens was a prey to that feverish contrariety experienced by anxious lovers who without being able to quench their ardent thirst are ceaselessly desirous of seeing the loved object and then go away partially satisfied without perceiving they have acquired a more insatiable thirst than ever The king whose carriage headed the procession could not from the place he occupied perceive the carriages of the ladies and maids of honor which followed in a line behind it Besides he was obliged to answer the eternal questions of the young queen who happy to have with her her dear husband as she called him in utter forgetfulness of royal etiquette invested him with all her affection stifled him with her attentions afraid that some one might come to take him from her or that he himself might suddenly take a fancy to quit her society Anne of Austria whom nothing at that moment occupied except the occasional cruel throbbings in her bosom looked pleased and delighted and although she perfectly realized the king s impatience tantalizingly prolonged his sufferings by unexpectedly resuming the conversation at the very moment the king absorbed in his own reflections began to muse over his secret attachment Everything seemed to combine not alone the little teasing attentions of the queen but also the queen mother s interruptions to make the king s position almost insupportable for he knew not how to control the restless longings of his heart At first he complained of the heat a complaint merely preliminary to others but with sufficient tact to prevent Maria Theresa guessing his real object Understanding the king s remark literally she began to fan him with her ostrich plumes But the heat passed away and the king then complained of cramps and stiffness in his legs and as the carriages at that moment stopped to change horses the queen said Shall I get out with you I too feel tired of sitting We can walk on a little distance the carriage will overtake us and we can resume our places presently The king frowned it is a hard trial a jealous woman makes her husband submit to whose fidelity she suspects when although herself a prey to jealousy she watches herself so narrowly that she avoids giving any pretext for an angry feeling The king therefore in the present case could not refuse he accepted the offer alighted from the carriage gave his arm to the queen and walked up and down with her while the horses were being changed As he walked along he cast an envious glance upon the courtiers who were fortunate enough to be on horseback The queen soon found out that the promenade she had suggested afforded the king as little pleasure as he had experienced from driving She accordingly expressed a wish to return to her carriage and the king conducted her to the door but did not get in with her He stepped back a few paces and looked along the file of carriages for the purpose of recognizing the one in which he took so strong an interest At the door of the sixth carriage he saw La Valliere s fair countenance As the king thus stood motionless wrapt in thought without perceiving that everything was ready and that he alone was causing the delay he heard a voice close beside him addressing him in the most respectful manner It was M Malicorne in a complete costume of an equerry holding over his left arm the bridles of a couple of horses Your majesty asked for a horse I believe he said A horse Have you one of my horses here inquired the king trying to remember the person who addressed him and whose face was not as yet familiar to him Sire replied Malicorne at all events I have a horse here which is at your majesty s service And Malicorne pointed at Monsieur s bay horse which Madame had observed It was a beautiful creature royally caparisoned This is not one of my horses monsieur said the king Sire it is a horse out of his royal highness s stables but he does not ride when the weather is as hot as it is now Louis did not reply but approached the horse which stood pawing the ground with its foot Malicorne hastened to hold the stirrup for him but the king was already in the saddle Restored to good humor by this lucky accident the king hastened towards the queen s carriage where he was anxiously expected and notwithstanding Maria Theresa s thoughtful and preoccupied air he said I have been fortunate enough to find this horse and I intend to avail myself of it I felt stifled in the carriage Adieu ladies Then bending gracefully over the arched neck of his beautiful steed he disappeared in a second Anne of Austria leaned forward in order to look after him as he rode away he did not get very far for when he reached the sixth carriage he reined in his horse suddenly and took off his hat He saluted La Valliere who uttered a cry of surprise as she saw him blushing at the same time with pleasure Montalais who occupied the other seat in the carriage made the king a most respectful bow And then with all the tact of a woman she pretended to be exceedingly interested in the landscape and withdrew herself into the left hand corner The conversation between the king and La Valliere began as all lovers conversations generally do namely by eloquent looks and by a few words utterly devoid of common sense The king explained how warm he had felt in his carriage so much so indeed that he could almost regard the horse he then rode as a blessing thrown in his way And he added my benefactor is an exceedingly intelligent man for he seemed to guess my thoughts intuitively I have now only one wish that of learning the name of the gentleman who so cleverly assisted his king out of his dilemma and extricated him from his cruel position Montalais during this colloquy the first words of which had awakened her attention had slightly altered her position and contrived so as to meet the king s look as he finished his remark It followed very naturally that the king looked inquiringly as much at her as at La Valliere she had every reason to suppose that it was herself who was appealed to and consequently might be permitted to answer She therefore said Sire the horse which your majesty is riding belongs to Monsieur and was being led by one of his royal highness s gentlemen And what is that gentleman s name may I ask mademoiselle M de Malicorne sire The name produced its usual effect for the king repeated it smilingly Yes sire replied Aure Stay it is the gentleman who is galloping on my left hand and she pointed out Malicorne who with a very sanctified expression was galloping by the side of the carriage knowing perfectly well that they were talking of him at that very moment but sitting in his saddle as if he were deaf and dumb Yes said the king that is the gentleman I remember his face and will not forget his name and the king looked tenderly at La Valliere Aure had now nothing further to do she had let Malicorne s name fall the soil was good all that was now left to be done was to let the name take root and the event would bear fruit in due season She consequently threw herself back in her corner feeling perfectly justified in making as many agreeable signs of recognition as she liked to Malicorne since the latter had had the happiness of pleasing the king As will readily be believed Montalais was not mistaken and Malicorne with his quick ear and his sly look seemed to interpret her remark as All goes on well the whole being accompanied by a pantomimic action which he fancied conveyed something resembling a kiss Alas mademoiselle said the king after a moment s pause the liberty and freedom of the country is soon about to cease your attendance on Madame will be more strictly enforced and we shall see each other no more Your majesty is too much attached to Madame replied Louise not to come and see her very frequently and whenever your majesty may chance to pass across the apartments Ah said the king in a tender voice which was gradually lowered in its tone to perceive is not to see and yet it seems that it would be quite sufficient for you Louise did not answer a syllable a sigh filled her heart almost to bursting but she stifled it You exercise a great control over yourself said the king to Louise who smiled upon him with a melancholy expression Exert the strength you have in loving fondly he continued and I will bless Heaven for having bestowed it on you La Valliere still remained silent but raised her eyes brimful of affection toward the king Louis as if overcome by this burning glance passed his hand across his forehead and pressing the sides of his horse with his knees made him bound several paces forward La Valliere leaning back in her carriage with her eyes half closed gazed fixedly upon the king whose plumes were floating in the air she could not but admire his graceful carriage his delicate and nervous limbs which pressed his horse s sides and the regular outline of his features which his beautiful curling hair set off to great advantage revealing occasionally his small and well formed ear In fact the poor girl was in love and she reveled in her innocent affection In a few moments the king was again by her side Do you not perceive he said how terribly your silence affects me Oh mademoiselle how pitilessly inexorable you would become if you were ever to resolve to break off all acquaintance with any one and then too I think you changeable in fact in fact I dread this deep affection which fills my whole being Oh sire you are mistaken said La Valliere if ever I love it will be for all my life If you love you say exclaimed the king you do not love now then She hid her face in her hands You see said the king that I am right in accusing you you must admit you are changeable capricious a coquette perhaps Oh no sire be perfectly satisfied as to that No I say again no no Promise me then that to me you will always be the same Oh always sire That you will never show any of that severity which would break my heart none of that fickleness of manner which would be worse than death to me Oh no no Very well then but listen I like promises I like to place under the guarantee of an oath under the protection of Heaven in fact everything which interests my heart and my affections Promise me or rather swear to me that if in the life we are about to commence a life which will be full of sacrifice mystery anxiety disappointment and misunderstanding swear to me that if we should in any way deceive or misunderstand each other or should judge each other unjustly for that indeed would be criminal in love such as ours swear to me Louise She trembled with agitation to the very depths of her heart it was the first time she had heard her name pronounced in that manner by her royal lover As for the king taking off his glove and placing his hand within the carriage he continued Swear that never in all our quarrels will we allow one night even to pass by if any misunderstanding should arise between us without a visit or at least a message from either in order to convey consolation and repose to the other La Valliere took her lover s burning hand between her own cool palms and pressed it softly until a movement of the horse frightened by the proximity of the wheels obliged her to abandon her happiness She had vowed as he desired Return sire she said return to the queen I foresee a storm yonder which threatens my peace of mind and yours Louis obeyed saluted Mademoiselle de Montalais and set off at a gallop to rejoin the queen As he passed Monsieur s carriage he observed that he was fast asleep although Madame on her part was wide awake As the king passed her she said What a beautiful horse sire Is it not Monsieur s bay horse The young queen kindly asked Are you better now sire three Chapter XXIII Triumfeminate On the king s arrival in Paris he sat at the council which had been summoned and worked for a certain portion of the day The queen remained with the queen mother and burst into tears as soon as she had taken leave of the king Ah madame she said the king no longer loves me What will become of me A husband always loves his wife when she is like you replied Anne of Austria A time may come when he will love another woman instead of me What do you call loving Always thinking of a person always seeking her society Do you happen to have remarked said Anne of Austria that the king has ever done anything of the sort No madame said the young queen hesitatingly What is there to complain of then Marie You will admit that the king leaves me The king my daughter belongs to his people And that is the very reason why he no longer belongs to me and that is the reason too why I shall find myself as so many queens before me forsaken and forgotten whilst glory and honors will be reserved for others Oh my mother the king is so handsome how often will others tell him that they love him and how much indeed they must do so It is very seldom indeed that women love the man in loving the king But if such a thing happened which I doubt you would do better to wish Marie that such women should really love your husband In the first place the devoted love of a mistress is a rapid element of the dissolution of a lover s affection and then by dint of loving the mistress loses all influence over her lover whose power of wealth she does not covet caring only for his affection Wish therefore that the king should love but lightly and that his mistress should love with all her heart Oh my mother what power may not a deep affection exercise over him And yet you say you are resigned Quite true quite true I speak absurdly There is a feeling of anguish however which I can never control And that is The king may make a happy choice may find a home with all the tender influences of home not far from that we can offer him a home with children round him the children of another woman Oh madame I should die if I were but to see the king s children Marie Marie replied the queen mother with a smile and she took the young queen s hand in her own remember what I am going to say and let it always be a consolation to you the king cannot have a Dauphin without you With this remark the queen mother quitted her daughter in law in order to meet Madame whose arrival in the grand cabinet had just been announced by one of the pages Madame had scarcely taken time to change her dress Her face revealed her agitation which betrayed a plan the execution of which occupied while the result disturbed her mind I came to ascertain she said if your majesties are suffering any fatigue from our journey None at all said the queen mother A little replied Maria Theresa I have suffered from annoyance more than anything else said Madame How was that inquired Anne of Austria The fatigue the king undergoes in riding about on horseback That does the king good And it was I who advised him said Maria Theresa turning pale Madame said not a word in reply but one of those smiles which were peculiarly her own flitted for a moment across her lips without passing over the rest of her face then immediately changing the conversation she continued We shall find Paris precisely the Paris we quitted the same intrigues plots and flirtations going on Intrigues What intrigues do you allude to inquired the queen mother People are talking a good deal about M Fouquet and Madame Plessis Belliere Who makes up the number to about ten thousand replied the queen mother But what are the plots you speak of We have it seems certain misunderstandings with Holland to settle What about Monsieur has been telling me the story of the medals Oh exclaimed the young queen you mean those medals struck in Holland on which a cloud is seen passing across the sun which is the king s device You are wrong in calling that a plot it is an insult But so contemptible that the king can well despise it replied the queen mother Well what are the flirtations which are alluded to Do you mean that of Madame d Olonne No no nearer ourselves than that Casa de usted murmured the queen mother and without moving her lips in her daughter in law s ear without being overheard by Madame who thus continued You know the terrible news four Oh yes M de Guiche s wound And you attribute it I suppose as every one else does to an accident which happened to him while hunting Yes of course said both the queens together their interest awakened Madame drew closer to them as she said in a low tone of voice It was a duel Ah said Anne of Austria in a severe tone for in her ears the word duel which had been forbidden in France all the time she reigned over it had a strange sound A most deplorable duel which has nearly cost Monsieur two of his best friends and the king two of his best servants What was the cause of the duel inquired the young queen animated by a secret instinct Flirtation repeated Madame triumphantly The gentlemen in question were conversing about the virtue of a particular lady belonging to the court One of them thought that Pallas was a very second rate person compared to her the other pretended that the lady in question was an imitation of Venus alluring Mars and thereupon the two gentlemen fought as fiercely as Hector and Achilles Venus alluring Mars said the young queen in a low tone of voice without venturing to examine into the allegory very deeply Who is the lady inquired Anne of Austria abruptly You said I believe she was one of the ladies of honor Did I say so replied Madame Yes at least I thought I heard you mention it Are you not aware that such a woman is of ill omen to a royal house Is it not Mademoiselle de la Valliere said the queen mother Yes indeed that plain looking creature I thought she was affianced to a gentleman who certainly is not at least so I have heard either M de Guiche or M de Wardes Very possibly madame The young queen took up a piece of tapestry and began to broider with an affectation of tranquillity her trembling fingers contradicted What were you saying about Venus and Mars pursued the queen mother Is there a Mars also She boasts of that being the case Did you say she boasts of it That was the cause of the duel And M de Guiche upheld the cause of Mars Yes certainly like the devoted servant he is The devoted servant of whom exclaimed the young queen forgetting her reserve in allowing her jealous feeling to escape Mars not to be defended except at the expense of Venus replied Madame M de Guiche maintained the perfect innocence of Mars and no doubt affirmed that it was all a mere boast And M de Wardes said Anne of Austria quietly spread the report that Venus was within her rights I suppose Oh De Wardes thought Madame you shall pay dearly for the wound you have given that noblest best of men And she began to attack De Wardes with the greatest bitterness thus discharging her own and De Guiche s debt with the assurance that she was working the future ruin of her enemy She said so much in fact that had Manicamp been there he would have regretted he had shown such firm regard for his friend inasmuch as it resulted in the ruin of his unfortunate foe I see nothing in the whole affair but one cause of mischief and that is La Valliere herself said the queen mother The young queen resumed her work with perfect indifference of manner while Madame listened eagerly I do not yet quite understand what you said just now about the danger of coquetry resumed Anne of Austria It is quite true Madame hastened to say that if the girl had not been a coquette Mars would not have thought at all about her The repetition of this word Mars brought a passing color to the queen s face but she still continued her work I will not permit that in my court gentlemen should be set against each other in this manner said Anne of Austria calmly Such manners were useful enough perhaps in days when the divided nobility had no other rallying point than mere gallantry At that time women whose sway was absolute and undivided were privileged to encourage men s valor by frequent trials of their courage But now thank Heaven there is but one master in France and to him every instinct of the mind every pulse of the body are due I will not allow my son to be deprived of any single one of his servants And she turned towards the young queen saying What is to be done with this La Valliere La Valliere said the queen apparently surprised I do not even know the name and she accompanied this remark by one of those cold fixed smiles only to be observed on royal lips Madame was herself a princess great in every respect great in intelligence great by birth by pride the queen s reply however completely astonished her and she was obliged to pause for a moment in order to recover herself She is one of my maids of honor she replied with a bow In that case retorted Maria Theresa in the same tone it is your affair my sister and not ours I beg your pardon resumed Anne of Austria it is my affair And I perfectly well understand she pursued addressing a look full of intelligence at Madame Madame s motive for saying what she has just said Everything which emanates from you madame said the English princess proceeds from the lips of Wisdom If we send this girl back to her own family said Maria Theresa gently we must bestow a pension upon her Which I will provide for out of my income exclaimed Madame No no interrupted Anne of Austria no disturbance I beg The king dislikes that the slightest disrespectful remark should be made of any lady Let everything be done quietly Will you have the kindness Madame to send for this girl here and you my daughter will have the goodness to retire to your own room The dowager queen s entreaties were commands and as Maria Theresa rose to return to her apartments Madame rose in order to send a page to summon La Valliere Chapter XXIV The First Quarrel La Valliere entered the queen mother s apartments without in the least suspecting that a serious plot was being concerted against her She thought it was for something connected with her duties and never had the queen mother been unkind to her when such was the case Besides not being immediately under the control or direction of Anne of Austria she could only have an official connection with her to which her own gentleness of disposition and the rank of the august princess made her yield on every occasion with the best possible grace She therefore advanced towards the queen mother with that soft and gentle smile which constituted her principal charm and as she did not approach sufficiently close Anne of Austria signed to her to come nearer Madame then entered the room and with a perfectly calm air took her seat beside her mother in law and continued the work which Maria Theresa had begun When La Valliere instead of the direction which she expected to receive immediately on entering the room perceived these preparations she looked with curiosity if not with uneasiness at the two princesses Anne seemed full of thought while Madame maintained an affectation of indifference that would have alarmed a less timid person even than Louise Mademoiselle said the queen mother suddenly without attempting to moderate or disguise her Spanish accent which she never failed to do except when she was angry come closer we were talking of you as every one else seems to be doing Of me exclaimed La Valliere turning pale Do you pretend to be ignorant of it are you not aware of the duel between M de Guiche and M de Wardes Oh madame I heard of it yesterday said La Valliere clasping her hands together And did you not foresee this quarrel Why should I madame Because two men never fight without a motive and because you must be aware of the motive which awakened the animosity of the two in question I am perfectly ignorant of it madame A persevering denial is a very commonplace mode of defense and you who have great pretensions to be witty and clever ought to avoid commonplaces What else have you to say Oh madame your majesty terrifies me with your cold severity of manner but I do not understand how I can have incurred your displeasure or in what respect people concern themselves about me Then I will tell you M de Guiche has been obliged to undertake your defense My defense Yes He is a gallant knight and beautiful adventuresses like to see brave knights couch lances in their honor But for my part I hate fields of battle and above all I hate adventures and take my remark as you please La Valliere sank at the queen s feet who turned her back upon her She stretched out her hands towards Madame who laughed in her face A feeling of pride made her rise to her feet I have begged your majesty to tell me what is the crime I am accused of I can claim this at your hands and I see I am condemned before I am even permitted to justify myself Eh indeed cried Anne of Austria listen to her beautiful phrases Madame and to her fine sentiments she is an inexhaustible well of tenderness and heroic expressions One can easily see young lady that you have cultivated your mind in the society of crowned heads La Valliere felt struck to the heart she became not whiter but as white as a lily and all her strength forsook her I wished to inform you interrupted the queen disdainfully that if you continue to nourish such feelings you will humiliate us to such a degree that we shall be ashamed of appearing before you Be simple in your manners By the by I am informed that you are affianced is it the case La Valliere pressed her hand over her heart which was wrung with a fresh pang Answer when you are spoken to Yes madame To a gentleman Yes madame His name The Vicomte de Bragelonne Are you aware that it is an exceedingly fortunate circumstance for you mademoiselle that such is the case and without fortune or position as you are or without any very great personal advantages you ought to bless Heaven for having procured you such a future as seems to be in store for you La Valliere did not reply Where is the Vicomte de Bragelonne pursued the queen In England said Madame where the report of this young lady s success will not fail to reach him Oh Heaven murmured La Valliere in despair Very well mademoiselle said Anne of Austria we will get this young gentleman to return and send you away somewhere with him If you are of a different opinion for girls have strange views and fancies at times trust to me I will put you in a proper path again I have done as much for girls who are not as good as you are probably La Valliere ceased to hear the queen who pitilessly added I will send you somewhere by yourself where you will be able to indulge in a little serious reflection Reflection calms the ardor of the blood and swallows up the illusions of youth I suppose you understand what I have been saying Madame Not a word I am innocent of everything your majesty supposes Oh madame you are a witness of my despair I love I respect your majesty so much It would be far better not to respect me at all said the queen with a chilling irony of manner It would be far better if you were not innocent Do you presume to suppose that I should be satisfied simply to leave you unpunished if you had committed the fault Oh madame you are killing me No acting if you please or I will precipitate the denouement of this play leave the room return to your own apartment and I trust my lesson may be of service to you Madame said La Valliere to the Duchess d Orleans whose hands she seized in her own do you who are so good intercede for me I replied the latter with an insulting joy I good Ah mademoiselle you think nothing of the kind and with a rude hasty gesture she repulsed the young girl s grasp La Valliere instead of giving way as from her extreme pallor and her tears the two princesses possibly expected suddenly resumed her calm and dignified air she bowed profoundly and left the room Well said Anne of Austria to Madame do you think she will begin again I always suspect those gentle patient characters replied Madame Nothing is more full of courage than a patient heart nothing more self reliant than a gentle spirit I feel I may almost venture to assure you she will think twice before she looks at the god Mars again So long as she does not obtain the protection of his buckler I do not care retorted Madame A proud defiant look of the queen mother was the reply to this objection which was by no means deficient in finesse and both of them almost sure of their victory went to look for Maria Theresa who had been waiting for them with impatience It was about half past six in the evening and the king had just partaken of refreshment He lost no time but the repast finished and business matters settled he took Saint Aignan by the arm and desired him to lead the way to La Valliere s apartments The courtier uttered an exclamation Well what is that for It is a habit you will have to adopt and in order to adopt a habit one must make a beginning Oh sire said Saint Aignan it is hardly possible for every one can be seen entering or leaving those apartments If however some pretext or other were made use of if your majesty for instance would wait until Madame were in her own apartments No pretext no delays I have had enough of these impediments and mysteries I cannot perceive in what respect the king of France dishonors himself by conversing with an amiable and clever girl Evil be to him who evil thinks Will your majesty forgive an excess of zeal on my part Speak freely How about the queen True true I always wish the most entire respect to be shown to her majesty Well then this evening only will I pay Mademoiselle de la Valliere a visit and after to day I will make use of any pretext you like To morrow we will devise all sorts of means to night I have no time Saint Aignan made no reply he descended the steps preceding the king and crossed the different courtyards with a feeling of shame which the distinguished honor of accompanying the king did not remove The reason was that Saint Aignan wished to stand well with Madame as well as with the queens and also that he did not on the other hand want to displease Mademoiselle de la Valliere and in order to carry out so many promising affairs it was difficult to avoid jostling against some obstacle or other Besides the windows of the young queen s rooms those of the queen mother s and of Madame herself looked out upon the courtyard of the maids of honor To be seen therefore accompanying the king would be effectually to quarrel with three great and influential princesses whose authority was unbounded for the purpose of supporting the ephemeral credit of a mistress The unhappy Saint Aignan who had not displayed a very great amount of courage in taking La Valliere s part in the park of Fontainebleau did not feel any braver in the broad day light and found a thousand defects in the poor girl which he was most eager to communicate to the king But his trial soon finished the courtyards were crossed not a curtain was drawn aside nor a window opened The king walked hastily because of his impatience and the long legs of Saint Aignan who preceded him At the door however Saint Aignan wished to retire but the king desired him to remain a delicate consideration on the king s part which the courtier could very well have dispensed with He had to follow Louis into La Valliere s apartment As soon as the king arrived the young girl dried her tears but so precipitately that the king perceived it He questioned her most anxiously and tenderly and pressed her to tell him the cause of her emotion Nothing is the matter sire she said And yet you were weeping Oh no indeed sire Look Saint Aignan and tell me if I am mistaken Saint Aignan ought to have answered but he was too much embarrassed At all events your eyes are red mademoiselle said the king The dust of the road merely sire No no you no longer possess the air of supreme contentment which renders you so beautiful and so attractive You do not look at me Why avoid my gaze he said as she turned aside her head In Heaven s name what is the matter he inquired beginning to lose command over himself Nothing at all sire and I am perfectly ready to assure your majesty that my mind is as free from anxiety as you could possibly wish Your mind at ease when I see you are embarrassed at the slightest thing Has any one annoyed you No no sire I insist upon knowing if such really be the case said the prince his eyes sparkling No one sire no one has in any way offended me In that case pray resume your gentle air of gayety or that sweet melancholy look which I so loved in you this morning for pity s sake do so Yes sire yes The king tapped the floor impatiently with his foot saying Such a change is positively inexplicable And he looked at Saint Aignan who had also remarked La Valliere s peculiar lethargy as well as the king s impatience It was futile for the king to entreat and as useless for him to try to overcome her depression the poor girl was completely overwhelmed the appearance of an angel would hardly have awakened her from her torpor The king saw in her repeated negative replies a mystery full of unkindness he began to look round the apartment with a suspicious air There happened to be in La Valliere s room a miniature of Athos The king remarked that this portrait bore a strong resemblance to Bragelonne for it had been taken when the count was quite a young man He looked at it with a threatening air La Valliere in her misery far indeed from thinking of this portrait could not conjecture the cause of the king s preoccupation And yet the king s mind was occupied with a terrible remembrance which had more than once taken possession of his mind but which he had always driven away He recalled the intimacy existing between the two young people from their birth their engagement and that Athos himself had come to solicit La Valliere s hand for Raoul He therefore could not but suppose that on her return to Paris La Valliere had found news from London awaiting her and that this news had counterbalanced the influence he had been enabled to exert over her He immediately felt himself stung as it were by feelings of the wildest jealousy and again questioned her with increased bitterness La Valliere could not reply unless she were to acknowledge everything which would be to accuse the queen and Madame also and the consequence would be that she would have to enter into an open warfare with these two great and powerful princesses She thought within herself that as she made no attempt to conceal from the king what was passing in her own mind the king ought to be able to read in her heart in spite of her silence and that had he really loved her he would have understood and guessed everything What was sympathy then if not that divine flame which possesses the property of enlightening the heart and of saving lovers the necessity of an expression of their thoughts and feelings She maintained her silence therefore sighing and concealing her face in her hands These sighs and tears which had at first distressed then terrified Louis XIV now irritated him He could not bear opposition the opposition which tears and sighs exhibited any more than opposition of any other kind His remarks therefore became bitter urgent and openly aggressive in their nature This was a fresh cause of distress for the poor girl From that very circumstance therefore which she regarded as an injustice on her lover s part she drew sufficient courage to bear not only her other troubles but this one also The king next began to accuse her in direct terms La Valliere did not even attempt to defend herself she endured all his accusations without according any other reply than that of shaking her head without any other remark than that which escapes the heart in deep distress a prayerful appeal to Heaven for help But this ejaculation instead of calming the king s displeasure rather increased it He moreover saw himself seconded by Saint Aignan for Saint Aignan as we have observed having seen the storm increasing and not knowing the extent of the regard of which Louis XIV was capable felt by anticipation all the collected wrath of the three princesses and the near approach of poor La Valliere s downfall and he was not true knight enough to resist the fear that he himself might be dragged down in the impending ruin Saint Aignan did not reply to the king s questions except by short dry remarks pronounced half aloud and by abrupt gestures whose object was to make things worse and bring about a misunderstanding the result of which would be to free him from the annoyance of having to cross the courtyards in open day in order to follow his illustrious companion to La Valliere s apartments In the meantime the king s anger momentarily increased he made two or three steps towards the door as if to leave the room but returned The young girl did not however raise her head although the sound of his footsteps might have warned her that her lover was leaving her He drew himself up for a moment before her with his arms crossed For the last time mademoiselle he said will you speak Will you assign a reason for this change this fickleness for this caprice What can I say murmured La Valliere Do you not see sire that I am completely overwhelmed at this moment that I have no power of will or thought or speech Is it so difficult then to speak the truth You could have told me the whole truth in fewer words than those in which you have expressed yourself But the truth about what sire About everything La Valliere was just on the point of revealing the truth to the king her arms made a sudden movement as if they were about to open but her lips remained silent and her hands again fell listlessly by her side The poor girl had not yet endured sufficient unhappiness to risk the necessary revelation I know nothing she stammered out Oh exclaimed the king this is no longer mere coquetry or caprice it is treason And this time nothing could restrain him The impulse of his heart was not sufficient to induce him to turn back and he darted out of the room with a gesture full of despair Saint Aignan followed him wishing for nothing better than to quit the place Louis XIV did not pause until he reached the staircase and grasping the balustrade said You see how shamefully I have been duped How sire inquired the favorite De Guiche fought on the Vicomte de Bragelonne s account and this Bragelonne oh Saint Aignan she still loves him I vow to you Saint Aignan that if in three days from now there were to remain but an atom of affection for her in my heart I should die from very shame And the king resumed his way to his own apartments I told your majesty how it would be murmured Saint Aignan continuing to follow the king and timidly glancing up at the different windows Unfortunately their return was not like their arrival unobserved A curtain was suddenly drawn aside Madame was behind it She had seen the king leave the apartments of the maids of honor and as soon as she observed that his majesty had passed she left her own apartments with hurried steps and ran up the staircase that led to the room the king had just left Chapter XXV Despair 
7879-274136-0000	train-other-500	As soon as the king was gone La Valliere raised herself from the ground and stretched out her arms as if to follow and detain him but when having violently closed the door the sound of his retreating footsteps could be heard in the distance
7879-274136-0001	train-other-500	she had hardly sufficient strength left to totter towards and fall at the foot of her crucifix There she remained broken hearted absorbed and overwhelmed by her grief
none	none	 forgetful and indifferent to everything but her profound sorrow 
7879-274136-0002	train-other-500	a grief she only vaguely realized as though by instinct
none	none	 In the midst of this wild tumult of thoughts La Valliere heard her door open again 
7879-274136-0003	train-other-500	she started and turned round thinking it was the king who had returned
none	none	 She was deceived however for it was Madame who appeared at the door 
7879-274136-0004	train-other-500	What did she now care for Madame Again she sank down her head supported by her prie Dieu chair It was Madame agitated angry and threatening But what was that to her
none	none	 Mademoiselle said the princess standing before La Valliere 
7879-274136-0005	train-other-500	this is very fine I admit to kneel and pray and make a pretense of being religious but however submissive you may be in your address to Heaven it is desirable that you should pay some little attention to the wishes of those who reign and rule here below
7879-274136-0006	train-other-500	La Valliere raised her head painfully in token of respect Not long since continued Madame a certain recommendation was addressed to you I believe
7879-274136-0007	train-other-500	La Valliere s fixed and wild gaze showed how complete her forgetfulness or ignorance was The queen recommended you continued Madame to conduct yourself in such a manner that no one could be justified in spreading any reports about you
none	none	 La Valliere darted an inquiring look towards her 
7879-274136-0008	train-other-500	I will not continued Madame allow my household which is that of the first princess of the blood to set an evil example to the court you would be the cause of such an example
7879-274136-0009	train-other-500	I beg you to understand therefore in the absence of any witness of your shame for I do not wish to humiliate you that you are from this moment at perfect liberty to leave and that you can return to your mother at Blois La Valliere could not sink
7879-274136-0010	train-other-500	lower nor could she suffer more than she had already suffered Her countenance did not even change but she remained kneeling with her hands clasped like the figure of the Magdalen Did you hear me said Madame
7879-274136-0011	train-other-500	A shiver which passed through her whole frame was La Valliere s only reply And as the victim gave no other signs of life Madame left the room And then her very respiration suspended and her blood almost congealed as it were in her veins
none	none	 La Valliere by degrees felt that the pulsation of her wrists her neck and temples 
7879-274136-0012	train-other-500	began to throb more and more painfully These pulsations as they gradually increased soon changed into a species of brain fever and in her temporary delirium she saw the figures of her friends contending with her enemies
7879-274136-0013	train-other-500	floating before her vision She heard too mingled together in her deafened ears words of menace and words of fond affection
none	none	 she seemed raised out of her existence as though it were upon the wings of a mighty tempest and in the dim horizon of the path along which her delirium hurried her 
7879-274136-0014	train-other-500	she saw the stone which covered her tomb upraised and the grim appalling texture of eternal night revealed to her distracted gaze But the horror of the dream which possessed her senses faded away
7879-274136-0015	train-other-500	and she was again restored to the habitual resignation of her character A ray of hope penetrated her heart as a ray of sunlight streams into the dungeon of some unhappy captive Her mind reverted to the journey from Fontainebleau she saw the king riding beside her carriage
7879-274136-0016	train-other-500	telling her that he loved her asking for her love in return requiring her to swear and himself to swear too that never should an evening pass by if ever a misunderstanding were to arise between them without a visit a letter
7879-274136-0017	train-other-500	a sign of some kind being sent to replace the troubled anxiety of the evening with the calm repose of the night It was the king who had suggested that who had imposed a promise on her
none	none	 and who had sworn to it himself 
7879-274136-0018	train-other-500	It was impossible therefore she reasoned that the king should fail in keeping the promise which he had himself exacted from her unless indeed Louis was a despot who enforced love as he enforced obedience
7879-274136-0019	train-other-500	unless too the king were so indifferent that the first obstacle in his way was sufficient to arrest his further progress The king that kind protector who by a word a single word could relieve her distress of mind
7879-274136-0020	train-other-500	the king even joined her persecutors Oh his anger could not possibly last Now that he was alone he would be suffering all that she herself was a prey to But he was not tied hand and foot as she was
7879-274136-0021	train-other-500	he could act could move about could come to her while she could do nothing but wait And the poor girl waited and waited with breathless anxiety for she could not believe it possible that the king would not come
7879-274136-0022	train-other-500	It was now about half past ten He would either come to her or write to her
none	none	 or send some kind word by M de Saint Aignan 
7879-274136-0023	train-other-500	If he were to come oh how she would fly to meet him how she would thrust aside that excess of delicacy which she now discovered was misunderstood how eagerly she would explain It is not I who do not love you
7879-274136-0024	train-other-500	it is the fault of others who will not allow me to love you And then it must be confessed that she reflected upon it and also the more she reflected Louis appeared to her to be less guilty In fact he was ignorant of everything
7879-274136-0025	train-other-500	What must he have thought of the obstinacy with which she remained silent Impatient and irritable as the king was known to be it was extraordinary that he had been able to preserve his temper so long
7879-274136-0026	train-other-500	And yet had it been her own case she undoubtedly would not have acted in such a manner she would have understood have guessed everything Yes but she was nothing but a poor simple minded girl and not a great and powerful monarch
7879-274136-0027	train-other-500	Oh if he would but come if he would but come how eagerly she would forgive him for all he had just made her suffer how much more tenderly she would love him because she had so cruelly suffered
7879-274136-0028	train-other-500	And so she sat with her head bent forward in eager expectation towards the door
none	none	 her lips slightly parted as if 
7879-274136-0029	train-other-500	and Heaven forgive her for the mental exclamation they were awaiting the kiss which the king s lips had in the morning so sweetly indicated when he pronounced the word love
7879-274136-0030	train-other-500	If the king did not come at least he would write it was a second chance a chance less delightful certainly than the other but which would show an affection just as strong only more timid in its nature
7879-274136-0031	train-other-500	Oh how she would devour his letter how eager she would be to answer it and when the messenger who had brought it had left her how she would kiss it read it over and over again press to her heart the lucky paper which would have brought her ease of mind
7879-274136-0032	train-other-500	tranquillity and perfect happiness At all events if the king did not come if the king did not write
none	none	 he could not do otherwise than send Saint Aignan or Saint Aignan could not do otherwise than come of his own accord 
7879-274136-0033	train-other-500	Even if it were a third person how openly she would speak to him the royal presence would not be there to freeze her words upon her tongue and then no suspicious feeling would remain a moment longer in the king s heart Everything with La Valliere
7879-274136-0034	train-other-500	heart and look body and mind was concentrated in eager expectation She said to herself that there was an hour left in which to indulge hope that until midnight struck the king might come
none	none	 or write or send that at midnight only would every expectation vanish 
7879-274136-0035	train-other-500	every hope be lost Whenever she heard any stir in the palace the poor girl fancied she was the cause of it whenever she heard any one pass in the courtyard below she imagined they were messengers of the king coming to her
7879-274136-0036	train-other-500	Eleven o clock struck then a quarter past eleven then half past The minutes dragged slowly on in this anxiety and yet they seemed to pass too quickly And now it struck a quarter to twelve Midnight midnight was near
7879-274136-0037	train-other-500	the last the final hope that remained With the last stroke of the clock the last ray of light seemed to fade away and with the last ray faded her final hope And so the king himself had deceived her
7879-274136-0038	train-other-500	it was he who had been the first to fail in keeping the oath which he had sworn that very day twelve hours only between his oath and his perjured vow it was not long alas to have preserved the illusion
7879-274136-0039	train-other-500	And so not only did the king not love her but he despised her whom every one ill treated he despised her to the extent even of abandoning her to the shame of an expulsion which was equivalent to having an ignominious sentence passed on her
7879-274136-0040	train-other-500	and yet it was he the king himself who was the first cause of this ignominy A bitter smile the only symptom of anger which during this long conflict had passed across the angelic face appeared upon her lips
7879-274136-0041	train-other-500	What in fact now remained on earth for her after the king was lost to her Nothing But Heaven still remained and her thoughts flew thither She prayed that the proper course for her to follow might be suggested
7879-274136-0042	train-other-500	It is from Heaven she thought that I expect everything it is from Heaven I ought to expect everything And she looked at her crucifix with a devotion full of tender love There she said hangs before me a Master who never forgets
7879-274136-0043	train-other-500	and never abandons those who neither forget nor abandon Him it is to Him alone that we must sacrifice ourselves And thereupon could any one have gazed into the recesses of that chamber they would have seen the poor despairing girl adopt a final resolution
7879-274136-0044	train-other-500	and determine upon one last plan in her mind Then as her knees were no longer able to support her she gradually sank down upon the prie Dieu and with her head pressed against the wooden cross her eyes fixed
7879-274136-0045	train-other-500	and her respiration short and quick she watched for the earliest rays of approaching daylight At two o clock in the morning she was still in the same bewilderment of mind or rather the same ecstasy of feeling
7879-274136-0046	train-other-500	Her thoughts had almost ceased to hold communion with things of the world And when she saw the pale violet tints of early dawn
none	none	 visible over the roofs of the palace 
7879-274136-0047	train-other-500	and vaguely revealing the outlines of the ivory crucifix which she held embraced she rose from the ground with a new born strength kissed the feet of the divine martyr descended the staircase leading from the room
7879-274136-0048	train-other-500	and wrapped herself from head to foot in a mantle as she went along She reached the wicket at the very moment the guard of the musketeers opened the gate to admit the first relief guard belonging to one of the Swiss regiments
none	none	 And then gliding behind the soldiers she reached the street before the officer in command of the patrol had even thought of asking who the young girl was who was making her escape from the palace at so early an hour Chapter XXVI The Flight La Valliere followed the patrol as it left the courtyard The patrol bent its steps towards the right by the Rue saint Honore and mechanically La Valliere turned to the left Her resolution was taken her determination fixed she wished to betake herself to the convent of the Carmelites at Chaillot the superior of which enjoyed a reputation for severity which made the worldly minded people of the court tremble La Valliere had never seen Paris she had never gone out on foot and so would have been unable to find her way even had she been in a calmer frame of mind than was then the case and this may explain why she ascended instead of descending the Rue saint Honore Her only thought was to get away from the Palais Royal and this she was doing she had heard it said that Chaillot looked out upon the Seine and she accordingly directed her steps towards the Seine She took the Rue de Coq and not being able to cross the Louvre bore towards the church of Saint Germain l Auxerrois proceeding along the site of the colonnade which was subsequently built there by Perrault In a very short time she reached the quays Her steps were rapid and agitated she scarcely felt the weakness which reminded her of having sprained her foot when very young and which obliged her to limp slightly At any other hour in the day her countenance would have awakened the suspicions of the least clear sighted attracted the attention of the most indifferent But at half past two in the morning the streets of Paris are almost if not quite deserted and scarcely is any one to be seen but the hard working artisan on his way to earn his daily bread or the roistering idlers of the streets who are returning to their homes after a night of riot and debauchery for the former the day was beginning and for the latter it was just closing La Valliere was afraid of both faces in which her ignorance of Parisian types did not permit her to distinguish the type of probity from that of dishonesty The appearance of misery alarmed her and all she met seemed either vile or miserable Her dress which was the same she had worn during the previous evening was elegant even in its careless disorder for it was the one in which she had presented herself to the queen mother and moreover when she drew aside the mantle which covered her face in order to enable her to see the way she was going her pallor and her beautiful eyes spoke an unknown language to the men she met and unconsciously the poor fugitive seemed to invite the brutal remarks of the one class or to appeal to the compassion of the other La Valliere still walked on in the same way breathless and hurried until she reached the top of the Place de Greve She stopped from time to time placed her hand upon her heart leaned against a wall until she could breathe freely again and then continued on her course more rapidly than before On reaching the Place de Greve La Valliere suddenly came upon a group of three drunken men reeling and staggering along who were just leaving a boat which they had made fast to the quay the boat was freighted with wines and it was apparent that they had done ample justice to the merchandise They were celebrating their convivial exploits in three different keys when suddenly as they reached the end of the railing leading down to the quay they found an obstacle in their path in the shape of this young girl La Valliere stopped while they on their part at the appearance of the young girl dressed in court costume also halted and seizing each other by the hand they surrounded La Valliere singing Oh all ye weary wights who mope alone Come drink and sing and laugh round Venus throne La Valliere at once understood that the men were insulting her and wished to prevent her passing she tried to do so several times but her efforts were useless Her limbs failed her she felt she was on the point of falling and uttered a cry of terror At the same moment the circle which surrounded her was suddenly broken through in a most violent manner One of her insulters was knocked to the left another fell rolling over and over to the right close to the water s edge while the third could hardly keep his feet An officer of the musketeers stood face to face with the young girl with threatening brow and hand raised to carry out his threat The drunken fellows at sight of the uniform made their escape with what speed their staggering limbs could lend them all the more eagerly for the proof of strength which the wearer of the uniform had just afforded them Is it possible exclaimed the musketeer that it can be Mademoiselle de la Valliere La Valliere bewildered by what had just happened and confounded by hearing her name pronounced looked up and recognized D Artagnan Oh M d Artagnan it is indeed I and at the same moment she seized his arm You will protect me will you not she added in a tone of entreaty Most certainly I will protect you but in Heaven s name where are you going at this hour I am going to Chaillot You are going to Chaillot by way of La Rapee why mademoiselle you are turning your back upon it In that case monsieur be kind enough to put me in the right way and to go with me a short distance Most willingly But how does it happen that I have found you here By what merciful intervention were you sent to my assistance I almost seem to be dreaming or to be losing my senses I happened to be here mademoiselle because I have a house in the Place de Greve at the sign of the Notre Dame the rent of which I went to receive yesterday and where I in fact passed the night And I also wished to be at the palace early for the purposes of inspecting my posts Thank you said La Valliere That is what I was doing said D Artagnan to himself but what is she doing and why is she going to Chaillot at such an hour And he offered her his arm which she took and began to walk with increased precipitation which ill concealed however her weakness D Artagnan perceived it and proposed to La Valliere that she should take a little rest which she refused You are ignorant perhaps where Chaillot is inquired D Artagnan Quite so It is a great distance That matters very little It is at least a league I can walk it D Artagnan did not reply he could tell merely by the tone of a voice when a resolution was real or not He rather bore along rather than accompanied La Valliere until they perceived the elevated ground of Chaillot What house are you going to mademoiselle inquired D Artagnan To the Carmelites monsieur To the Carmelites repeated D Artagnan in amazement Yes and since Heaven has directed you towards me to give me your support on my road accept both my thanks and my adieux To the Carmelites Your adieux Are you going to become a nun exclaimed D Artagnan Yes monsieur What you There was in this you which we have marked by three notes of exclamation in order to render it as expressive as possible there was we repeat in this you a complete poem it recalled to La Valliere her old recollections of Blois and her new recollections of Fontainebleau it said to her You who might be happy with Raoul you who might be powerful with Louis you about to become a nun Yes monsieur she said I am going to devote myself to the service of Heaven and to renounce the world entirely But are you not mistaken with regard to your vocation are you not mistaken in supposing it to be the will of Heaven No since Heaven has been pleased to throw you in my way Had it not been for you I should certainly have sunk from fatigue on the road and since Heaven I repeat has thrown you in my way it is because it has willed that I should carry out my intention Oh said D Artagnan doubtingly that is a rather subtle distinction I think Whatever it may be returned the young girl I have acquainted you with the steps I have taken and with my fixed resolution And now I have one last favor to ask of you even while I return you my thanks The king is entirely ignorant of my flight from the Palais Royal and is ignorant also of what I am about to do The king ignorant you say exclaimed D Artagnan Take care mademoiselle you are not aware of what you are doing No one ought to do anything with which the king is unacquainted especially those who belong to the court I no longer belong to the court monsieur D Artagnan looked at the young girl with increasing astonishment Do not be uneasy monsieur she continued I have well calculated everything and were it not so it would now be too late to reconsider my resolution all is decided Well mademoiselle what do you wish me to do In the name of that sympathy which misfortune inspires by your generous feeling and by your honor as a gentleman I entreat you to promise me one thing Name it Swear to me Monsieur d Artagnan that you will not tell the king that you have seen me and that I am at the Carmelites I will not swear that said D Artagnan shaking his head Why Because I know the king I know you I know myself even nay the whole human race too well no no I will not swear that In that case cried La Valliere with an energy of which one would hardly have thought her capable instead of the blessing which I should have implored for you until my dying day I will invoke a curse for you are rendering me the most miserable creature that ever lived We have already observed that D Artagnan could easily recognize the accents of truth and sincerity and he could not resist this last appeal He saw by her face how bitterly she suffered from a feeling of degradation he remarked her trembling limbs how her whole slight and delicate frame was violently agitated by some internal struggle and clearly perceived that resistance might be fatal I will do as you wish then he said Be satisfied mademoiselle I will say nothing to the king Oh thanks thanks exclaimed La Valliere you are the most generous man breathing And in her extreme delight she seized hold of D Artagnan s hands and pressed them between her own D Artagnan who felt himself quite overcome said This is touching upon my word she begins where others leave off And La Valliere who in the bitterness of her distress had sunk upon the ground rose and walked towards the convent of the Carmelites which could now in the dawning light be perceived just before them D Artagnan followed her at a distance The entrance door was half open she glided in like a shadow and thanking D Artagnan by a parting gesture disappeared from his sight When D Artagnan found himself quite alone he reflected very profoundly upon what had just taken place Upon my word he said this looks very much like what is called a false position To keep such a secret as that is to keep a burning coal in one s breeches pocket and trust that it may not burn the stuff And yet not to keep it when I have sworn to do so is dishonorable It generally happens that some bright idea or other occurs to me as I am going along but I am very much mistaken if I shall not now have to go a long way in order to find the solution of this affair Yes but which way to go Oh towards Paris of course that is the best way after all Only one must make haste and in order to make haste four legs are better than two and I unhappily only have two A horse a horse as I heard them say at the theatre in London my kingdom for a horse And now I think of it it need not cost me so much as that for at the Barriere de la Conference there is a guard of musketeers and instead of the one horse I need I shall find ten there So in pursuance of this resolution which he adopted with his usual rapidity D Artagnan immediately turned his back upon the heights of Chaillot reached the guard house took the fastest horse he could find there and was at the palace in less than ten minutes It was striking five as he reached the Palais Royal The king he was told had gone to bed at his usual hour having been long engaged with M Colbert and in all probability was still sound asleep Come said D Artagnan she spoke the truth the king is ignorant of everything if he only knew one half of what has happened the Palais Royal by this time would be turned upside down five Chapter XXVII Showing How Louis on His Part Had Passed the Time from Ten to Half Past Twelve at Night When the king left the apartments of the maids of honor he found Colbert awaiting him to take directions for the next day s ceremony as the king was then to receive the Dutch and Spanish ambassadors Louis XIV had serious causes of dissatisfaction with the Dutch the States had already been guilty of many mean shifts and evasions with France and without perceiving or without caring about the chances of a rupture they again abandoned the alliance with his Most Christian Majesty for the purpose of entering into all kinds of plots with Spain Louis XIV at his accession that is to say at the death of Cardinal Mazarin had found this political question roughly sketched out the solution was difficult for a young man but as at that time the king represented the whole nation anything that the head resolved upon the body would be found ready to carry out Any sudden impulse of anger the reaction of young hot blood upon the brain would be quite sufficient to change an old form of policy and create another system altogether The part that diplomatists had to play in those days was that of arranging among themselves the different coups d etat which their sovereign masters might wish to effect Louis was not in that calm frame of mind which was necessary to enable him to determine on a wise course of policy Still much agitated from the quarrel he had just had with La Valliere he walked hastily into his cabinet dimly desirous of finding an opportunity of producing an explosion after he had controlled himself for so long a time Colbert as he saw the king enter knew the position of affairs at a glance understood the king s intentions and resolved therefore to maneuver a little When Louis requested to be informed what it would be necessary to say on the morrow Colbert began by expressing his surprise that his majesty had not been properly informed by M Fouquet M Fouquet he said is perfectly acquainted with the whole of this Dutch affair he received the dispatches himself direct The king who was accustomed to hear M Colbert speak in not over scrupulous terms of M Fouquet allowed this remark to pass unanswered and merely listened Colbert noticed the effect it had produced and hastened to back out saying that M Fouquet was not on all occasions as blamable as at the first glance might seem to be the case inasmuch as at that moment he was greatly occupied The king looked up What do you allude to he said Sire men are but men and M Fouquet has his defects as well as his great qualities Ah defects who is without them M Colbert Your majesty hardly said Colbert boldly for he knew how to convey a good deal of flattery in a light amount of blame like the arrow which cleaves the air notwithstanding its weight thanks to the light feathers which bear it up The king smiled What defect has M Fouquet then he said Still the same sire it is said he is in love In love with whom I am not quite sure sire I have very little to do with matters of gallantry At all events you know since you speak of it I have heard a name mentioned Whose I cannot now remember whose but I think it is one of Madame s maids of honor The king started You know more than you like to say M Colbert he murmured I assure you no sire At all events Madame s maids of honor are all known and in mentioning their names to you you will perhaps recollect the one you allude to No sire At least try It would be useless sire Whenever the name of any lady who runs the risk of being compromised is concerned my memory is like a coffer of bronze the key of which I have lost A dark cloud seemed to pass over the mind as well as across the face of the king then wishing to appear as if he were perfect master of himself and his feelings he said And now for the affair concerning Holland In the first place sire at what hour will your majesty receive the ambassadors Early in the morning Eleven o clock That is too late say nine o clock That will be too early sire For friends that would be a matter of no importance one does what one likes with one s friends but for one s enemies in that case nothing could be better than if they were to feel hurt I should not be sorry I confess to have to finish altogether with these marsh birds who annoy me with their cries It shall be precisely as your majesty desires At nine o clock therefore I will give the necessary orders Is it to be a formal audience No I wish to have an explanation with them and not to embitter matters as is always the case when many persons are present but at the same time I wish to clear up everything with them in order not to have to begin over again Your majesty will inform me of the persons whom you wish to be present at the reception I will draw out a list Let us speak of the ambassadors what do they want Allies with Spain they gain nothing allies with France they lose much How is that Allied with Spain they see themselves bounded and protected by the possessions of their allies they cannot touch them however anxious they may be to do so From Antwerp to Rotterdam is but a step and that by the way of the Scheldt and the Meuse If they wish to make a bite at the Spanish cake you sire the son in law of the king of Spain could with your cavalry sweep the earth from your dominions to Brussels in a couple of days Their design is therefore only to quarrel so far with you and only to make you suspect Spain so far as will be sufficient to induce you not to interfere with their own affairs It would be far more simple I should imagine replied the king to form a solid alliance with me by means of which I should gain something while they would gain everything Not so for if by chance they were to have you or France rather as a boundary your majesty is not an agreeable neighbor Young ardent warlike the king of France might inflict some serious mischief on Holland especially if he were to get near her I perfectly understand M Colbert and you have explained it very clearly but be good enough to tell me the conclusion you have arrived at Your majesty s own decisions are never deficient in wisdom What will these ambassadors say to me They will tell your majesty that they are ardently desirous of forming an alliance with you which will be a falsehood they will tell Spain that the three powers ought to unite so as to check the prosperity of England and that will equally be a falsehood for at present the natural ally of your majesty is England who has ships while we have none England who can counteract Dutch influence in India England in fact a monarchical country to which your majesty is attached by ties of relationship Good but how would you answer I should answer sire with the greatest possible moderation of tone that the disposition of Holland does not seem friendly towards the Court of France that the symptoms of public feeling among the Dutch are alarming as regards your majesty that certain medals have been struck with insulting devices Towards me exclaimed the young king excitedly Oh no sire no insulting is not the word I was mistaken I ought to have said immeasurably flattering to the Dutch Oh if that be so the pride of the Dutch is a matter of indifference to me said the king sighing Your majesty is right a thousand times right However it is never a mistake in politics your majesty knows better than myself to exaggerate a little in order to obtain a concession in your own favor If your majesty were to complain as if your susceptibility were offended you would stand in a far higher position with them What are these medals you speak of inquired Louis for if I allude to them I ought to know what to say Upon my word sire I cannot very well tell you some overweeningly conceited device that is the sense of it the words have little to do with the thing itself Very good I will mention the word medal and they can understand it if they like Oh they will understand without any difficulty Your majesty can also slip in a few words about certain pamphlets which are being circulated Never Pamphlets befoul those who write them much more than those against whom they are written M Colbert I thank you You can leave now Do not forget the hour I have fixed and be there yourself Sire I await your majesty s list True returned the king and he began to meditate he had not thought of the list in the least The clock struck half past eleven The king s face revealed a violent conflict between pride and love The political conversation had dispelled a good deal of the irritation which Louis had felt and La Valliere s pale worn features in his imagination spoke a very different language from that of the Dutch medals or the Batavian pamphlets He sat for ten minutes debating within himself whether he should or should not return to La Valliere but Colbert having with some urgency respectfully requested that the list might be furnished him the king was ashamed to be thinking of mere matters of affection where important state affairs required his attention He therefore dictated the queen mother the queen Madame Madame de Motteville Madame de Chatillon Madame de Navailles and for the men M le Prince M de Gramont M de Manicamp M de Saint Aignan and the officers on duty The ministers asked Colbert As a matter of course and the secretaries also Sire I will leave at once in order to get everything prepared the orders will be at the different residences to morrow Say rather to day replied Louis mournfully as the clock struck twelve It was the very hour when poor La Valliere was almost dying from anguish and bitter suffering The king s attendants entered it being the hour of his retirement to his chamber the queen indeed had been waiting for more than an hour Louis accordingly retreated to his bedroom with a sigh but as he sighed he congratulated himself on his courage and applauded himself for having been as firm in love as in affairs of state Chapter XXVIII The Ambassadors D Artagnan had with very few exceptions learned almost all of the particulars of what we have just been relating for among his friends he reckoned all the useful serviceable people in the royal household officious attendants who were proud of being recognized by the captain of the musketeers for the captain s influence was very great and then in addition to any ambitious views they may have imagined he could promote they were proud of being regarded as worth being spoken to by a man as brave as D Artagnan In this manner D Artagnan learned every morning what he had not been able either to see or to ascertain the night before from the simple fact of his not being ubiquitous so that with the information he had been able by his own means to pick up during the day and with what he had gathered from others he succeeded in making up a bundle of weapons which he was in the prudent habit of using only when occasion required In this way D Artagnan s two eyes rendered him the same service as the hundred eyes of Argus Political secrets bedside revelations hints or scraps of conversation dropped by the courtiers on the threshold of the royal ante chamber in this way D Artagnan managed to ascertain and to store away everything in the vast and impenetrable mausoleum of his memory by the side of those royal secrets so dearly bought and faithfully preserved He therefore knew of the king s interview with Colbert and of the appointment made for the ambassadors in the morning and consequently that the question of the medals would be brought up for debate and while he was arranging and constructing the conversation upon a few chance words which had reached his ears he returned to his post in the royal apartments so as to be there at the very moment the king awoke It happened that the king rose very early proving thereby that he too on his side had slept but indifferently Towards seven o clock he half opened his door very gently D Artagnan was at his post His majesty was pale and seemed wearied he had not moreover quite finished dressing Send for M de Saint Aignan he said Saint Aignan was probably awaiting a summons for the messenger when he reached his apartment found him already dressed Saint Aignan hastened to the king in obedience to the summons A moment afterwards the king and Saint Aignan passed by together the king walking first D Artagnan went to the window which looked out upon the courtyard he had no need to put himself to the trouble of watching in what direction the king went for he had no difficulty in guessing beforehand where his majesty was going The king in fact bent his steps towards the apartments of the maids of honor a circumstance which in no way astonished D Artagnan for he more than suspected although La Valliere had not breathed a syllable on the subject that the king had some kind of reparation to make Saint Aignan followed him as he had done the previous evening rather less uneasy in his mind though still slightly agitated for he fervently trusted that at seven o clock in the morning there might be only himself and the king awake amongst the august guests at the palace D Artagnan stood at the window careless and perfectly calm in his manner One could almost have sworn that he noticed nothing and was utterly ignorant who were these two hunters after adventures passing like shadows across the courtyard wrapped up in their cloaks And yet all the while that D Artagnan appeared not to be looking at them at all he did not for one moment lose sight of them and while he whistled that old march of the musketeers which he rarely recalled except under great emergencies he conjectured and prophesied how terrible would be the storm which would be raised on the king s return In fact when the king entered La Valliere s apartment and found the room empty and the bed untouched he began to be alarmed and called out to Montalais who immediately answered the summons but her astonishment was equal to the king s All that she could tell his majesty was that she had fancied she had heard La Valliere s weeping during a portion of the night but knowing that his majesty had paid her a visit she had not dared to inquire what was the matter But inquired the king where do you suppose she is gone Sire replied Montalais Louise is of a very sentimental disposition and as I have often seen her rise at daybreak in order to go out into the garden she may perhaps be there now This appeared probable and the king immediately ran down the staircase in search of the fugitive D Artagnan saw him grow very pale and talking in an excited manner with his companion as he went towards the gardens Saint Aignan following him out of breath D Artagnan did not stir from the window but went on whistling looking as if he saw nothing yet seeing everything Come come he murmured when the king disappeared his majesty s passion is stronger than I thought he is now doing I think what he never did for Mademoiselle de Mancini six In a quarter of an hour the king again appeared he had looked everywhere was completely out of breath and as a matter of course had not discovered anything Saint Aignan who still followed him was fanning himself with his hat and in a gasping voice asking for information about La Valliere from such of the servants as were about in fact from every one he met Among others he came across Manicamp who had arrived from Fontainebleau by easy stages for whilst others had performed the journey in six hours he had taken four and twenty Have you seen Mademoiselle de la Valliere Saint Aignan asked him Whereupon Manicamp dreamy and absent as usual answered thinking that some one was asking him about De Guiche Thank you the comte is a little better And he continued on his way until he reached the ante chamber where D Artagnan was whom he asked to explain how it was that the king looked as he thought so bewildered to which D Artagnan replied that he was quite mistaken that the king on the contrary was as lively and merry as he could possibly be In the midst of all this eight o clock struck It was usual for the king to take his breakfast at this hour for the code of etiquette prescribed that the king should always be hungry at eight o clock His breakfast was laid upon a small table in his bedroom and he ate very fast Saint Aignan of whom he would not lose sight waited on the king He then disposed of several military audiences during which he dispatched Saint Aignan to see what he could find out Then still occupied full of anxiety still watching Saint Aignan s return who had sent out the servants in every direction to make inquires and who had also gone himself the hour of nine struck and the king forthwith passed into his large cabinet As the clock was striking nine the ambassadors entered and as it finished the two queens and Madame made their appearance There were three ambassadors from Holland and two from Spain The king glanced at them and then bowed and at the same moment Saint Aignan entered an entrance which the king regarded as far more important in a different sense however than that of ambassadors however numerous they might be and from whatever country they came and so setting everything aside the king made a sign of interrogation to Saint Aignan which the latter answered by a most decisive negative The king almost entirely lost his courage but as the queens the members of the nobility who were present and the ambassadors had their eyes fixed upon him he overcame his emotion by a violent effort and invited the latter to speak Whereupon one of the Spanish deputies made a long oration in which he boasted the advantages which the Spanish alliance would offer The king interrupted him saying Monsieur I trust that whatever is best for France must be exceedingly advantageous for Spain This remark and particularly the peremptory tone in which it was pronounced made the ambassadors pale and brought the color into the cheeks of the two queens who being Spanish felt wounded in their pride of relationship and nationality by this reply The Dutch ambassador then began to address himself to the king and complained of the injurious suspicions which the king exhibited against the government of his country The king interrupted him saying It is very singular monsieur that you should come with any complaint when it is I rather who have reason to be dissatisfied and yet you see I do not complain Complain sire and in what respect The king smiled bitterly Will you blame me monsieur he said if I should happen to entertain suspicions against a government which authorizes and protects international impertinence Sire I tell you resumed the king exciting himself by a recollection of his own personal annoyance rather than from political grounds that Holland is a land of refuge for all who hate me and especially for all who malign me Oh sire You wish for proofs perhaps Very good they can be had easily enough Whence proceed all those vile and insolent pamphlets which represent me as a monarch without glory and without authority your printing presses groan under their number If my secretaries were here I would mention the titles of the works as well as the names of the printers Sire replied the ambassador a pamphlet can hardly be regarded as the work of a whole nation Is it just is it reasonable that a great and powerful monarch like your majesty should render a whole nation responsible for the crime of a few madmen who are perhaps only scribbling in a garret for a few sous to buy bread for their family That may be the case I admit But when the mint itself at Amsterdam strikes off medals which reflect disgrace upon me is that also the crime of a few madmen Medals stammered out the ambassador Medals repeated the king looking at Colbert Your majesty the ambassador ventured should be quite sure The king still looked at Colbert but Colbert appeared not to understand him and maintained an unbroken silence notwithstanding the king s repeated hints D Artagnan then approached the king and taking a piece of money out of his pocket he placed it in the king s hands saying This is the medal your majesty alludes to The king looked at it and with a look which ever since he had become his own master was ever piercing as the eagle s observed an insulting device representing Holland arresting the progress of the sun with this inscription In conspectu meo stetit sol In my presence the sun stands still exclaimed the king furiously Ah you will hardly deny it now I suppose And the sun said D Artagnan is this as he pointed to the panels of the cabinet where the sun was brilliantly represented in every direction with this motto Nec pluribus impar seven Louis s anger increased by the bitterness of his own personal sufferings hardly required this additional circumstance to foment it Every one saw from the kindling passion in the king s eyes that an explosion was imminent A look from Colbert kept postponed the bursting of the storm The ambassador ventured to frame excuses by saying that the vanity of nations was a matter of little consequence that Holland was proud that with such limited resources she had maintained her rank as a great nation even against powerful monarchs and that if a little smoke had intoxicated his countrymen the king would be kindly disposed and would even excuse this intoxication The king seemed as if he would be glad of some suggestion he looked at Colbert who remained impassible then at D Artagnan who simply shrugged his shoulders a movement which was like the opening of the flood gates whereby the king s anger which he had restrained for so long a period now burst forth As no one knew what direction his anger might take all preserved a dead silence The second ambassador took advantage of it to begin his excuses also While he was speaking and while the king who had again gradually returned to his own personal reflections was automatically listening to the voice full of nervous anxiety with the air of an absent man listening to the murmuring of a cascade D Artagnan on whose left hand Saint Aignan was standing approached the latter and in a voice which was loud enough to reach the king s ears said Have you heard the news What news said Saint Aignan About La Valliere The king started and advanced his head What has happened to La Valliere inquired Saint Aignan in a tone which can easily be imagined Ah poor girl she is going to take the veil The veil exclaimed Saint Aignan The veil cried the king in the midst of the ambassador s discourse but then mindful of the rules of etiquette he mastered himself still listening however with rapt attention What order inquired Saint Aignan The Carmelites of Chaillot Who the deuce told you that She did herself You have seen her then Nay I even went with her to the Carmelites The king did not lose a syllable of this conversation and again he could hardly control his feelings But what was the cause of her flight inquired Saint Aignan Because the poor girl was driven away from the court yesterday replied D Artagnan He had no sooner said this than the king with an authoritative gesture said to the ambassador Enough monsieur enough Then advancing towards the captain he exclaimed Who says Mademoiselle de la Valliere is going to take the religious vows M d Artagnan answered the favorite Is it true what you say said the king turning towards the musketeer As true as truth itself The king clenched his hands and turned pale You have something further to add M d Artagnan he said I know nothing more sire You added that Mademoiselle de la Valliere had been driven away from the court Yes sire Is that true also Ascertain for yourself sire And from whom Ah sighed D Artagnan like a man who is declining to say anything further The king almost bounded from his seat regardless of ambassadors ministers courtiers queens and politics The queen mother rose she had heard everything or if she had not heard everything she had guessed it Madame almost fainting from anger and fear endeavored to rise as the queen mother had done but she sank down again upon her chair which by an instinctive movement she made roll back a few paces Gentlemen said the king the audience is over I will communicate my answer or rather my will to Spain and to Holland and with a proud imperious gesture he dismissed the ambassadors Take care my son said the queen mother indignantly you are hardly master of yourself I think Ah madame returned the young lion with a terrible gesture if I am not master of myself I will be I promise you of those who do me a deadly injury come with me M d Artagnan come And he quitted the room in the midst of general stupefaction and dismay The king hastily descended the staircase and was about to cross the courtyard Sire said D Artagnan your majesty mistakes the way No I am going to the stables That is useless sire for I have horses ready for your majesty The king s only answer was a look but this look promised more than the ambition of three D Artagnans could have dared to hope Chapter XXIX Chaillot Although they had not been summoned Manicamp and Malicorne had followed the king and D Artagnan They were both exceedingly intelligent men except that Malicorne was too precipitate owing to ambition while Manicamp was frequently too tardy owing to indolence On this occasion however they arrived at precisely the proper moment Five horses were in readiness Two were seized upon by the king and D Artagnan two others by Manicamp and Malicorne while a groom belonging to the stables mounted the fifth The cavalcade set off at a gallop D Artagnan had been very careful in his selection of the horses they were the very animals for distressed lovers horses which did not simply run but flew Within ten minutes after their departure the cavalcade amidst a cloud of dust arrived at Chaillot The king literally threw himself off his horse but notwithstanding the rapidity with which he accomplished this maneuver he found D Artagnan already holding his stirrup With a sign of acknowledgement to the musketeer he threw the bridle to the groom and darted into the vestibule violently pushed open the door and entered the reception room Manicamp Malicorne and the groom remained outside D Artagnan alone following him When he entered the reception room the first object which met his gaze was Louise herself not simply on her knees but lying at the foot of a large stone crucifix The young girl was stretched upon the damp flag stones scarcely visible in the gloom of the apartment which was lighted only by means of a narrow window protected by bars and completely shaded by creeping plants When the king saw her in this state he thought she was dead and uttered a loud cry which made D Artagnan hurry into the room The king had already passed one of his arms round her body and D Artagnan assisted him in raising the poor girl whom the torpor of death seemed already to have taken possession of D Artagnan seized hold of the alarm bell and rang with all his might The Carmelite sisters immediately hastened at the summons and uttered loud exclamations of alarm and indignation at the sight of the two men holding a woman in their arms The superior also hurried to the scene of action but far more a creature of the world than any of the female members of the court notwithstanding her austerity of manners she recognized the king at the first glance by the respect which those present exhibited for him as well as by the imperious and authoritative way in which he had thrown the whole establishment into confusion As soon as she saw the king she retired to her own apartments in order to avoid compromising her dignity But by one of the nuns she sent various cordials Hungary water et cetera et cetera and ordered that all the doors should immediately be closed a command which was just in time for the king s distress was fast becoming of a most clamorous and despairing character He had almost decided to send for his own physician when La Valliere exhibited signs of returning animation The first object which met her gaze as she opened her eyes was the king at her feet in all probability she did not recognize him for she uttered a deep sigh full of anguish and distress Louis fixed his eyes devouringly upon her face and when in the course of a few moments she recognized Louis she endeavored to tear herself from his embrace Oh heavens she murmured is not the sacrifice yet made No no exclaimed the king and it shall not be made I swear Notwithstanding her weakness and utter despair she rose from the ground saying It must be made however it must be so do not stay me in my purpose I leave you to sacrifice yourself I never never exclaimed the king Well murmured D Artagnan I may as well go now As soon as they begin to speak we may as well prevent there being any listeners And he quitted the room leaving the lovers alone Sire continued La Valliere not another word I implore you Do not destroy the only future I can hope for my salvation do not destroy the glory and brightness of your own future for a mere caprice A caprice cried the king Oh sire it is now only that I can see clearly into your heart You Louise what mean you An inexplicable impulse foolish and unreasonable in its nature may ephemerally appear to offer a sufficient excuse for your conduct but there are duties imposed upon you which are incompatible with your regard for a poor girl such as I am So forget me I forget you You have already done so once Rather would I die You cannot love one whose peace of mind you hold so lightly and whom you so cruelly abandoned last night to the bitterness of death What can you mean Explain yourself Louise What did you ask me yesterday morning To love you What did you promise me in return Never to let midnight pass without offering me an opportunity of reconciliation if by any chance your anger should be roused against me Oh forgive me Louise forgive me I was mad from jealousy Jealousy is a sentiment unworthy of a king a man You may become jealous again and will end by killing me Be merciful then and leave me now to die Another word mademoiselle in that strain and you will see me expire at your feet No no sire I am better acquainted with my own demerits and believe me that to sacrifice yourself for one whom all despise would be needless Give me the names of those you have cause to complain of I have no complaints sire to prefer against any one no one but myself to accuse Farewell sire you are compromising yourself in speaking to me in such a manner Oh be careful Louise in what you say for you are reducing me to the darkness of despair Oh sire sire leave me at least the protection of Heaven I implore you No no Heaven itself shall not tear you from me Save me then cried the poor girl from those determined and pitiless enemies who are thirsting to annihilate my life and honor too If you have courage enough to love me show at least that you have power enough to defend me But no she whom you say you love others insult and mock and drive shamelessly away And the gentle hearted girl forced by her own bitter distress to accuse others wrung her hands in an uncontrollable agony of tears You have been driven away exclaimed the king This is the second time I have heard that said I have been driven away with shame and ignominy sire You see then that I have no other protector but Heaven no consolation but prayer and this cloister is my only refuge My palace my whole court shall be your park of peace Oh fear nothing further now Louise those be they men or women who yesterday drove you away shall to morrow tremble before you to morrow do I say nay this very day I have already shown my displeasure have already threatened It is in my power even now to hurl the thunderbolt I have hitherto withheld Louise Louise you shall be bitterly revenged tears of blood shall repay you for the tears you have shed Give me only the names of your enemies Never never How can I show any anger then Sire those upon whom your anger would be prepared to fall would force you to draw back your hand upraised to punish Oh you do not know me cried the king exasperated Rather than draw back I would sacrifice my kingdom and would abjure my family Yes I would strike until this arm had utterly destroyed all those who had ventured to make themselves the enemies of the gentlest and best of creatures And as he said these words Louis struck his fist violently against the oaken wainscoting with a force which alarmed La Valliere for his anger owing to his unbounded power had something imposing and threatening in it like the lightning which may at any time prove deadly She who thought that her own sufferings could not be surpassed was overwhelmed by a suffering which revealed itself by menace and by violence Sire she said for the last time I implore you to leave me already do I feel strengthened by the calm seclusion of this asylum and the protection of Heaven has reassured me for all the pretty human meanness of this world are forgotten beneath the Divine protection Once more then sire and for the last time I again implore you to leave me Confess rather cried Louis that you have never loved me admit that my humility and my repentance are flattering to your pride but that my distress affects you not that the king of this wide realm is no longer regarded as a lover whose tenderness of devotion is capable of working out your happiness but as a despot whose caprice has crushed your very heart beneath his iron heel Do not say you are seeking Heaven say rather you are fleeing from the king Louise s heart was wrung within her as she listened to his passionate utterance which made the fever of hope course once more through her every vein But did you not hear me say that I have been driven away scorned despised I will make you the most respected and most adored and the most envied of my whole court Prove to me that you have not ceased to love me In what way By leaving me I will prove it to you by never leaving you again But do you imagine sire that I shall allow that do you imagine that I will let you come to an open rupture with every member of your family do you imagine that for my sake you could abandon mother wife and sister Ah you have named them then at last it is they then who have wrought this grievous injury By the heaven above us then upon them shall my anger fall That is the reason why the future terrifies me why I refuse everything why I do not wish you to revenge me Tears enough have already been shed sufficient sorrow and affliction have already been occasioned I at least will never be the cause of sorrow or affliction or distress to whomsoever it may be for I have mourned and suffered and wept too much myself And do you count my sufferings my tears as nothing In Heaven s name sire do not speak to me in that manner I need all my courage to enable me to accomplish the sacrifice Louise Louise I implore you whatever you desire whatever you command whether vengeance or forgiveness your slightest wish shall be obeyed but do not abandon me Alas sire we must part You do not love me then Heaven knows I do It is false Louise it is false Oh sire if I did not love you I should let you do what you please I should let you revenge me in return for the insult which has been inflicted on me I should accept the brilliant triumph to my pride which you propose and yet you cannot deny that I reject even the sweet compensation which your affection affords that affection which for me is life itself for I wished to die when I thought that you loved me no longer Yes yes I now know I now perceive it you are the sweetest best and purest of women There is no one so worthy as yourself not alone of my respect and devotion but also of the respect and devotion of all who surround me and therefore no one shall be loved like yourself no one shall ever possess the influence over me that you wield You wish me to be calm to forgive be it so you shall find me perfectly unmoved You wish to reign by gentleness and clemency I will be clement and gentle Dictate for me the conduct you wish me to adopt and I will obey blindly In Heaven s name no sire what am I a poor girl to dictate to so great a monarch as yourself You are my life the very spirit and principle of my being Is it not the spirit that rules the body You love me then sire On my knees yes with my hands upraised to you yes with all the strength and power of my being yes I love you so deeply that I would lay down my life for you gladly at your merest wish Oh sire now I know you love me I have nothing to wish for in the world Give me your hand sire and then farewell I have enjoyed in this life all the happiness I was ever meant for Oh no no your happiness is not a happiness of yesterday it is of to day of to morrow ever enduring The future is yours everything which is mine is yours too Away with these ideas of separation away with these gloomy despairing thoughts You will live for me as I will live for you Louise And he threw himself at her feet embracing her knees with the wildest transports of joy and gratitude Oh sire sire all that is but a wild dream Why a wild dream Because I cannot return to the court Exiled how can I see you again Would it not be far better to bury myself in a cloister for the rest of my life with the rich consolation that your affection gives me with the pulses of your heart beating for me and your latest confession of attachment still ringing in my ears Exiled you exclaimed Louis XIV and who dares to exile let me ask when I recall Oh sire something which is greater than and superior to the kings even the world and public opinion Reflect for a moment you cannot love a woman who has been ignominiously driven away love one whom your mother has stained with suspicions one whom your sister has threatened with disgrace such a woman indeed would be unworthy of you Unworthy one who belongs to me Yes sire precisely on that account from the very moment she belongs to you the character of your mistress renders her unworthy You are right Louise every shade of delicacy of feeling is yours Very well you shall not be exiled Ah from the tone in which you speak you have not heard Madame that is very clear I will appeal from her to my mother Again sire you have not seen your mother She too my poor Louise every one s hand then is against you Yes yes poor Louise who was already bending beneath the fury of the storm when you arrived and crushed her beneath the weight of your displeasure Oh forgive me You will not I know be able to make either of them yield believe me the evil cannot be repaired for I will not allow you to use violence or to exercise your authority Very well Louise to prove to you how fondly I love you I will do one thing I will see Madame I will make her revoke her sentence I will compel her to do so Compel Oh no no True you are right I will bend her Louise shook her head I will entreat her if it be necessary said Louis Will you believe in my affection after that Louise drew herself up Oh never never shall you humiliate yourself on my account sooner a thousand times would I die Louis reflected his features assumed a dark expression I will love you as much as you have loved I will suffer as keenly as you have suffered this shall be my expiation in your eyes Come mademoiselle put aside these paltry considerations let us show ourselves as great as our sufferings as strong as our affection for each other And as he said this he took her in his arms and encircled her waist with both his hands saying My own love my own dearest and best beloved follow me She made a final effort in which she concentrated no longer all of her firmness of will for that had long since been overcome but all her physical strength No she replied weakly no no I should die from shame No you shall return like a queen No one knows of your having left except indeed D Artagnan He has betrayed me then In what way He promised faithfully I promised not to say anything to the king said D Artagnan putting his head through the half opened door and I kept my word I was speaking to M de Saint Aignan and it was not my fault if the king overheard me was it sire It is quite true said the king forgive him La Valliere smiled and held out her small white hand to the musketeer Monsieur d Artagnan said the king be good enough to see if you can find a carriage for Mademoiselle de la Valliere Sire said the captain the carriage is waiting at the gate You are a magic mould of forethought exclaimed the king You have taken a long time to find it out muttered D Artagnan notwithstanding he was flattered by the praise bestowed upon him La Valliere was overcome after a little further hesitation she allowed herself to be led away half fainting by her royal lover But as she was on the point of leaving the room she tore herself from the king s grasp and returned to the stone crucifix which she kissed saying Oh Heaven it was thou who drewest me hither thou who has rejected me but thy grace is infinite Whenever I shall again return forget that I have ever separated myself from thee for when I return it will be never to leave thee again The king could not restrain his emotion and D Artagnan even was overcome Louis led the young girl away lifted her into the carriage and directed D Artagnan to seat himself beside her while he mounting his horse spurred violently towards the Palais Royal where immediately on his arrival he sent to request an audience of Madame Chapter XXX Madame From the manner in which the king had dismissed the ambassadors even the least clear sighted persons belonging to the court imagined war would ensue The ambassadors themselves but slightly acquainted with the king s domestic disturbances had interpreted as directed against themselves the celebrated sentence If I be not master of myself I at least will be so of those who insult me Happily for the destinies of France and Holland Colbert had followed them out of the king s presence for the purpose of explaining matters to them but the two queens and Madame who were perfectly aware of every particular that had taken place in their several households having heard the king s remark so full of dark meaning retired to their own apartments in no little fear and chagrin Madame especially felt that the royal anger might fall upon her and as she was brave and exceedingly proud instead of seeking support and encouragement from the queen mother she had returned to her own apartments if not without some uneasiness at least without any intention of avoiding an encounter Anne of Austria from time to time at frequent intervals sent messages to learn if the king had returned The silence which the whole palace preserved upon the matter and upon Louise s disappearance was indicative of a long train of misfortunes to all those who knew the haughty and irritable humor of the king But Madame unmoved in spite of all the flying rumors shut herself up in her apartments sent for Montalais and with a voice as calm as she could possibly command desired her to relate all she knew about the event itself At the moment that the eloquent Montalais was concluding with all kinds of oratorical precautions and was recommending if not in actual language at least in spirit that she should show forbearance towards La Valliere M Malicorne made his appearance to beg an audience of Madame on behalf of the king Montalais s worthy friend bore upon his countenance all the signs of the very liveliest emotion It was impossible to be mistaken the interview which the king requested would be one of the most interesting chapters in the history of the hearts of kings and of men Madame was disturbed by her brother in law s arrival she did not expect it so soon nor had she indeed expected any direct step on Louis s part Besides all women who wage war successfully by indirect means are invariably neither very skillful nor very strong when it becomes a question of accepting a pitched battle Madame however was not one who ever drew back she had the very opposite defect or qualification in whichever light it may be considered she took an exaggerated view of what constituted real courage and therefore the king s message of which Malicorne had been the bearer was regarded by her as the bugle note proclaiming the commencement of hostilities She therefore boldly accepted the gage of battle Five minutes afterwards the king ascended the staircase His color was heightened from having ridden hard His dusty and disordered clothes formed a singular contrast with the fresh and perfectly arranged toilette of Madame who notwithstanding the rouge on her cheeks turned pale as Louis entered the room Louis lost no time in approaching the object of his visit he sat down and Montalais disappeared My dear sister said the king you are aware that Mademoiselle de la Valliere fled from her own room this morning and that she has retired to a cloister overwhelmed by grief and despair As he pronounced these words the king s voice was singularly moved Your majesty is the first to inform me of it replied Madame I should have thought that you might have learned it this morning during the reception of the ambassadors said the king From your emotion sire I imagined that something extraordinary had happened but without knowing what The king with his usual frankness went straight to the point Why did you send Mademoiselle de la Valliere away Because I had reason to be dissatisfied with her conduct she replied dryly The king became crimson and his eyes kindled with a fire which it required all Madame s courage to support He mastered his anger however and continued A stronger reason than that is surely requisite for one so good and kind as you are to turn away and dishonor not only the young girl herself but every member of her family as well You know that the whole city has its eyes fixed upon the conduct of the female portion of the court To dismiss a maid of honor is to attribute a crime to her at the very least a fault What crime what fault has Mademoiselle de la Valliere been guilty of Since you constitute yourself the protector of Mademoiselle de la Valliere replied Madame coldly I will give you those explanations which I should have a perfect right to withhold from every one Even from the king exclaimed Louis as with a sudden gesture he covered his head with his hat You have called me your sister said Madame and I am in my own apartments It matters not said the youthful monarch ashamed at having been hurried away by his anger neither you nor any one else in this kingdom can assert a right to withhold an explanation in my presence Since that is the way you regard it said Madame in a hoarse angry tone of voice all that remains for me to do is bow submission to your majesty and to be silent Not so Let there be no equivocation between us The protection with which you surround Mademoiselle de la Valliere does not impose any respect No equivocation I repeat you are perfectly aware that as the head of the nobility in France I am accountable to all for the honor of every family You dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere or whoever else it may be Madame shrugged her shoulders Or whoever else it may be I repeat continued the king and as acting in that manner you cast a dishonorable reflection upon that person I ask you for an explanation in order that I may confirm or annul the sentence Annul my sentence exclaimed Madame haughtily What when I have discharged one of my attendants do you order me to take her back again The king remained silent This would be a sheer abuse of power sire it would be indecorous and unseemly Madame As a woman I should revolt against an abuse so insulting to me I should no longer be able to regard myself as a princess of your blood a daughter of a monarch I should be the meanest of creatures more humbled and disgraced than the servant I had sent away The king rose from his seat with anger It cannot be a heart he cried you have beating in your bosom if you act in such a way with me I may have reason to act with corresponding severity It sometimes happens that in a battle a chance ball may reach its mark The observation which the king had made without any particular intention struck Madame home and staggered her for a moment some day or other she might indeed have reason to dread reprisals At all events sire she said explain what you require I ask madame what has Mademoiselle de la Valliere done to warrant your conduct toward her She is the most cunning fomenter of intrigues I know she was the occasion of two personal friends engaging in mortal combat and has made people talk of her in such shameless terms that the whole court is indignant at the mere sound of her name She she cried the king Under her soft and hypocritical manner continued Madame she hides a disposition full of foul and dark conceit She You may possibly be deceived sire but I know her right well she is capable of creating dispute and misunderstanding between the most affectionate relatives and the most intimate friends You see that she has already sown discord betwixt us two I do assure you said the king Sire look well into the case as it stands we were living on the most friendly understanding and by the artfulness of her tales and complaints she has set your majesty against me I swear to you said the king that on no occasion has a bitter word ever passed her lips I swear that even in my wildest bursts of passion she would not allow me to menace any one and I swear too that you do not possess a more devoted and respectful friend than she is Friend said Madame with an expression of supreme disdain Take care Madame said the king you forget that you now understand me and that from this moment everything is equalized Mademoiselle de la Valliere will be whatever I may choose her to become and to morrow if I were determined to do so I could seat her on a throne She was not born to a throne at least and whatever you may do can affect the future alone but cannot affect the past Madame towards you I have shown every kind consideration and every eager desire to please you do not remind me that I am master It is the second time sire that you have made that remark and I have already informed you I am ready to submit In that case then you will confer upon me the favor of receiving Mademoiselle de la Valliere back again For what purpose sire since you have a throne to bestow upon her I am too insignificant to protect so exalted a personage Nay a truce to this bitter and disdainful spirit Grant me her forgiveness Never You drive me then to open warfare in my own family I too have a family with whom I can find refuge Do you mean that as a threat and could you forget yourself so far Do you believe that if you push the affront to that extent your family would encourage you I hope sire that you will not force me to take any step which would be unworthy of my rank I hoped that you would remember our recent friendship and that you would treat me as a brother Madame paused for a moment I do not disown you for a brother she said in refusing your majesty an injustice An injustice Oh sire if I informed others of La Valliere s conduct if the queen knew Come come Henrietta let your heart speak remember that for however brief a time you once loved me remember too that human hearts should be as merciful as the heart of a sovereign Master Do not be inflexible with others forgive La Valliere I cannot she has offended me But for my sake Sire it is for your sake I would do anything in the world except that You will drive me to despair you compel me to turn to the last resource of weak people and seek counsel of my angry and wrathful disposition I advise you to be reasonable Reasonable I can be so no longer Nay sire I pray you For pity s sake Henrietta it is the first time I entreated any one and I have no hope in any one but in you Oh sire you are weeping From rage from humiliation That I the king should have been obliged to descend to entreaty I shall hate this moment during my whole life You have made me suffer in one moment more distress and more degradation than I could have anticipated in the greatest extremity in life And the king rose and gave free vent to his tears which in fact were tears of anger and shame Madame was not touched exactly for the best women when their pride is hurt are without pity but she was afraid that the tears the king was shedding might possibly carry away every soft and tender feeling in his heart Give what commands you please sire she said and since you prefer my humiliation to your own although mine is public and yours has been witnessed but by myself alone speak I will obey your majesty No no Henrietta exclaimed Louis transported with gratitude you will have yielded to a brother s wishes I no longer have any brother since I obey All that I have would be too little in return How passionately you love sire when you do love Louis did not answer He had seized upon Madame s hand and covered it with kisses And so you will receive this poor girl back again and will forgive her you will find how gentle and pure hearted she is I will maintain her in my household No you will give her your friendship my sister I never liked her Well for my sake you will treat her kindly will you not Henrietta I will treat her as your mistress The king rose suddenly to his feet By this word which had so infelicitously escaped her Madame had destroyed the whole merit of her sacrifice The king felt freed from all obligations Exasperated beyond measure and bitterly offended he replied I thank you Madame I shall never forget the service you have rendered me And saluting her with an affectation of ceremony he took his leave of her As he passed before a glass he saw that his eyes were red and angrily stamped his foot on the ground But it was too late for Malicorne and D Artagnan who were standing at the door had seen his eyes The king has been crying thought Malicorne D Artagnan approached the king with a respectful air and said in a low tone of voice Sire it would be better to return to your own apartments by the small staircase Why Because the dust of the road has left its traces on your face said D Artagnan By heavens he thought when the king has given way like a child let those look to it who may make the lady weep for whom the king sheds tears Chapter XXXI Mademoiselle de la Valliere s Pocket Handkerchief Madame was not bad hearted she was only hasty and impetuous The king was not imprudent he was simply in love Hardly had they entered into this compact which terminated in La Valliere s recall when they both sought to make as much as they could by their bargain The king wished to see La Valliere every moment of the day while Madame who was sensible of the king s annoyance ever since he had so entreated her would not relinquish her revenge on La Valliere without a contest She planted every conceivable difficulty in the king s path he was in fact obliged in order to get a glimpse of La Valliere to be exceedingly devoted in his attentions to his sister in law and this indeed was Madame s plan of policy As she had chosen some one to second her efforts and as this person was our old friend Montalais the king found himself completely hemmed in every time he paid Madame a visit he was surrounded and was never left a moment alone Madame displayed in her conversation a charm of manner and brilliancy of wit which dazzled everybody Montalais followed her and soon rendered herself perfectly insupportable to the king which was in fact the very thing she expected would happen She then set Malicorne at the king who found means of informing his majesty that there was a young person belonging to the court who was exceedingly miserable and on the king inquiring who this person was Malicorne replied that it was Mademoiselle de Montalais To this the king answered that it was perfectly just that a person should be unhappy when she rendered others so Whereupon Malicorne explained how matters stood for he had received his directions from Montalais The king began to open his eyes he remarked that as soon as he made his appearance Madame made hers too that she remained in the corridors until after he had left that she accompanied him back to his own apartments fearing that he might speak in the ante chambers to one of her maids of honor One evening she went further still The king was seated surrounded by the ladies who were present and holding in his hand concealed by his lace ruffle a small note which he wished to slip into La Valliere s hand Madame guessed both his intention and the letter too It was difficult to prevent the king going wherever he pleased and yet it was necessary to prevent his going near La Valliere or speaking to her as by so doing he could let the note fall into her lap behind her fan or into her pocket handkerchief The king who was also on the watch suspected that a snare was being laid for him He rose and pushed his chair without affectation near Mademoiselle de Chatillon with whom he began to talk in a light tone They were amusing themselves making rhymes from Mademoiselle de Chatillon he went to Montalais and then to Mademoiselle de Tonnay Charente And thus by this skillful maneuver he found himself seated opposite to La Valliere whom he completely concealed Madame pretended to be greatly occupied altering a group of flowers that she was working in tapestry The king showed the corner of his letter to La Valliere and the latter held out her handkerchief with a look that signified Put the letter inside Then as the king had placed his own handkerchief upon his chair he was adroit enough to let it fall on the ground so that La Valliere slipped her handkerchief on the chair The king took it up quietly without any one observing what he did placed the letter within it and returned the handkerchief to the place he had taken it from There was only just time for La Valliere to stretch out her hand to take hold of the handkerchief with its valuable contents But Madame who had observed everything that had passed said to Mademoiselle de Chatillon Chatillon be good enough to pick up the king s handkerchief if you please it has fallen on the carpet The young girl obeyed with the utmost precipitation the king having moved from his seat and La Valliere being in no little degree nervous and confused Ah I beg your majesty s pardon said Mademoiselle de Chatillon you have two handkerchiefs I perceive And the king was accordingly obliged to put into his pocket La Valliere s handkerchief as well as his own He certainly gained that souvenir of Louise who lost however a copy of verses which had cost the king ten hours hard labor and which as far as he was concerned was perhaps as good as a long poem It would be impossible to describe the king s anger and La Valliere s despair but shortly afterwards a circumstance occurred which was more than remarkable When the king left in order to retire to his own apartments Malicorne informed of what had passed one can hardly tell how was waiting in the ante chamber The ante chambers of the Palais Royal are naturally very dark and in the evening they were but indifferently lighted Nothing pleased the king more than this dim light As a general rule love whose mind and heart are constantly in a blaze contemns all light except the sunshine of the soul And so the ante chamber was dark a page carried a torch before the king who walked on slowly greatly annoyed at what had recently occurred Malicorne passed close to the king almost stumbled against him in fact and begged his forgiveness with the profoundest humility but the king who was in an exceedingly ill temper was very sharp in his reproof to Malicorne who disappeared as soon and as quietly as he possibly could Louis retired to rest having had a misunderstanding with the queen and the next day as soon as he entered the cabinet he wished to have La Valliere s handkerchief in order to press his lips to it He called his valet Fetch me he said the coat I wore yesterday evening but be very sure you do not touch anything it may contain The order being obeyed the king himself searched the pocket of the coat he found only one handkerchief and that his own La Valliere s had disappeared Whilst busied with all kinds of conjectures and suspicions a letter was brought to him from La Valliere it ran thus How good and kind of you to have sent me those beautiful verses how full of ingenuity and perseverance your affection is how is it possible to help loving you so dearly What does this mean thought the king there must be some mistake Look well about said he to the valet for a pocket handkerchief must be in one of my pockets and if you do not find it or if you have touched it He reflected for a moment To make a state matter of the loss of the handkerchief would be to act absurdly and he therefore added There was a letter of some importance inside the handkerchief which had somehow got among the folds of it Sire said the valet your majesty had only one handkerchief and that is it True true replied the king setting his teeth hard together Oh poverty how I envy you Happy is the man who can empty his own pockets of letters and handkerchiefs He read La Valliere s letter over again endeavoring to imagine in what conceivable way his verses could have reached their destination There was a postscript to the letter I send you back by your messenger this reply so unworthy of what you sent me So far so good I shall find out something now he said delightedly Who is waiting and who brought me this letter M Malicorne replied the valet de chambre timidly Desire him to come in Malicorne entered You come from Mademoiselle de la Valliere said the king with a sigh Yes sire And you took Mademoiselle de la Valliere something from me I sire Yes you Oh no sire Mademoiselle de la Valliere says so distinctly Oh sire Mademoiselle de la Valliere is mistaken The king frowned What jest is this he said explain yourself Why does Mademoiselle de la Valliere call you my messenger What did you take to that lady Speak monsieur and quickly Sire I merely took Mademoiselle de la Valliere a pocket handkerchief that was all A handkerchief what handkerchief Sire at the very moment when I had the misfortune to stumble against your majesty yesterday a misfortune which I shall deplore to the last day of my life especially after the dissatisfaction which you exhibited I remained sire motionless with despair your majesty being at too great a distance to hear my excuses when I saw something white lying on the ground Ah said the king I stooped down it was a pocket handkerchief For a moment I had an idea that when I stumbled against your majesty I must have been the cause of the handkerchief falling from your pocket but as I felt it all over very respectfully I perceived a cipher at one of the corners and on looking at it closely I found that it was Mademoiselle de la Valliere s cipher I presumed that on her way to Madame s apartment in the earlier part of the evening she had let her handkerchief fall and I accordingly hastened to restore it to her as she was leaving and that is all I gave to Mademoiselle de la Valliere I entreat your majesty to believe Malicorne s manner was so simple so full of contrition and marked with such extreme humility that the king was greatly amused in listening to him He was as pleased with him for what he had done as if he had rendered him the greatest service This is the second fortunate meeting I have had with you monsieur he said you may count upon my good intentions The plain and sober truth was that Malicorne had picked the king s pocket of the handkerchief as dexterously as any of the pickpockets of the good city of Paris could have done Madame never knew of this little incident but Montalais gave La Valliere some idea of the manner in which it had really happened and La Valliere afterwards told the king who laughed exceedingly at it and pronounced Malicorne to be a first rate politician Louis XIV was right and it is well known that he was tolerably well acquainted with human nature Chapter XXXII Which Treats of Gardeners of Ladders and Maids of Honor Miracles unfortunately could not be always happening whilst Madame s ill humor still continued In a week s time matters had reached such a point that the king could no longer look at La Valliere without a look full of suspicion crossing his own Whenever a promenade was proposed Madame in order to avoid the recurrence of similar scenes to that of the thunder storm or the royal oak had a variety of indispositions ready prepared and thanks to them she was unable to go out and her maids of honor were obliged to remain indoors also There was not the slightest chance of means of paying a nocturnal visit for in this respect the king had on the very first occasion experienced a severe check which happened in the following manner As at Fontainebleau he had taken Saint Aignan with him one evening when he wished to pay La Valliere a visit but he had found no one but Mademoiselle de Tonnay Charente who had begun to call out Fire and Thieves in such a manner that a perfect legion of chamber maids attendants and pages ran to her assistance so that Saint Aignan who had remained behind in order to save the honor of his royal master who had fled precipitately was obliged to submit to a severe scolding from the queen mother as well as from Madame herself In addition he had the next morning received two challenges from the De Mortemart family and the king had been obliged to interfere This mistake had been owing to the circumstance of Madame having suddenly ordered a change in the apartments of her maids of honor and directed La Valliere and Montalais to sleep in her own cabinet No gateway therefore was any longer open not even communication by letter to write under the eyes of so ferocious an Argus as Madame whose temper and disposition were so uncertain was to run the risk of exposure to the greatest danger and it can well be conceived into what a state of continuous irritation and ever increasing anger all these petty annoyances threw the young lion The king almost tormented himself to death endeavoring to discover a means of communication and as he did not think proper to call in the aid of Malicorne or D Artagnan the means were not discovered at all Malicorne had indeed occasional brilliant flashes of imagination with which he tried to inspire the king with confidence but whether from shame or suspicion the king who had at first begun to nibble at the bait soon abandoned the hook In this way for instance one evening while the king was crossing the garden and looking up at Madame s windows Malicorne stumbled over a ladder lying beside a border of box and said to Manicamp then walking with him behind the king Did you not see that I just now stumbled against a ladder and was nearly thrown down No said Manicamp as usual very absent minded but it appears you did not fall That doesn t matter but it is not on that account the less dangerous to leave ladders lying about in that manner True one might hurt one s self especially when troubled with fits of absence of mind I don t mean that what I did mean was that it is dangerous to allow ladders to lie about so near the windows of the maids of honor Louis started imperceptibly Why so inquired Manicamp Speak louder whispered Malicorne as he touched him with his arm Why so said Manicamp louder The king listened Because for instance said Malicorne a ladder nineteen feet high is just the height of the cornice of those windows Manicamp instead of answering was dreaming of something else Ask me can t you what windows I mean whispered Malicorne But what windows are you referring to said Manicamp aloud The windows of Madame s apartments Eh Oh I don t say that any one would ever venture to go up a ladder into Madame s room but in Madame s cabinet merely separated by a partition sleep two exceedingly pretty girls Mesdemoiselles de la Valliere and de Montalais By a partition said Manicamp Look you see how brilliantly lighted Madame s apartments are well do you see those two windows Yes And that window close to the others but more dimly lighted Yes Well that is the room of the maids of honor Look there is Mademoiselle de la Valliere opening the window Ah how many soft things could an enterprising lover say to her if he only suspected that there was lying here a ladder nineteen feet long which would just reach the cornice But she is not alone you said Mademoiselle de Montalais is with her Mademoiselle de Montalais counts for nothing she is her oldest friend and exceedingly devoted to her a positive well into which can be thrown all sorts of secrets one might wish to get rid of The king did not lose a single syllable of this conversation Malicorne even remarked that his majesty slackened his pace in order to give him time to finish So when they arrived at the door Louis dismissed every one with the exception of Malicorne a circumstance which excited no surprise for it was known that the king was in love and they suspected he was going to compose some verses by moonlight and although there was no moon that evening the king might nevertheless have some verses to compose Every one therefore took his leave and immediately afterwards the king turned towards Malicorne who respectfully waited until his majesty should address him What were you saying just now about a ladder Monsieur Malicorne he asked Did I say anything about ladders sire said Malicorne looking up as if in search of words which had flown away Yes of a ladder nineteen feet long Oh yes sire I remember but I spoke to M Manicamp and I should not have said a word had I known your majesty was near enough to hear us And why would you not have said a word Because I should not have liked to get the gardener into a scrape who left it there poor fellow Don t make yourself uneasy on that account What is this ladder like If your majesty wishes to see it nothing is easier for there it is In that box hedge Exactly Show it to me Malicorne turned back and led the king up to the ladder saying This is it sire Pull it this way a little When Malicorne had brought the ladder on to the gravel walk the king began to step its whole length Hum he said you say it is nineteen feet long Yes sire Nineteen feet that is rather long I hardly believe it can be so long as that You cannot judge very correctly with the ladder in that position sire If it were upright against a tree or a wall for instance you would be better able to judge because the comparison would assist you a good deal Oh it does not matter M Malicorne but I can hardly believe that the ladder is nineteen feet high I know how accurate your majesty s glance is and yet I would wager The king shook his head There is one unanswerable means of verifying it said Malicorne What is that Every one knows sire that the ground floor of the palace is eighteen feet high True that is very well known Well sire if I place the ladder against the wall we shall be able to ascertain True Malicorne took up the ladder like a feather and placed it upright against the wall And in order to try the experiment he chose or chance perhaps directed him to choose the very window of the cabinet where La Valliere was The ladder just reached the edge of the cornice that is to say the sill of the window so that by standing upon the last round but one of the ladder a man of about the middle height as the king was for instance could easily talk with those who might be in the room Hardly had the ladder been properly placed when the king dropping the assumed part he had been playing in the comedy began to ascend the rounds of the ladder which Malicorne held at the bottom But hardly had he completed half the distance when a patrol of Swiss guards appeared in the garden and advanced straight towards them The king descended with the utmost precipitation and concealed himself among the trees Malicorne at once perceived that he must offer himself as a sacrifice for if he too were to conceal himself the guard would search everywhere until they had found either himself or the king perhaps both It would be far better therefore that he alone should be discovered And consequently Malicorne hid himself so clumsily that he was the only one arrested As soon as he was arrested Malicorne was taken to the guard house and there he declared who he was and was immediately recognized In the meantime by concealing himself first behind one clump of trees and then behind another the king reached the side door of his apartment very much humiliated and still more disappointed More than that the noise made in arresting Malicorne had drawn La Valliere and Montalais to their window and even Madame herself had appeared at her own with a pair of wax candles one in each hand clamorously asking what was the matter In the meantime Malicorne sent for D Artagnan who did not lose a moment in hurrying to him But it was in vain he attempted to make him understand his reasons and in vain also that D Artagnan did understand them and further it was equally in vain that both their sharp and intuitive minds endeavored to give another turn to the adventure there was no other resource left for Malicorne but to let it be supposed that he had wished to enter Mademoiselle de Montalais s apartment as Saint Aignan had passed for having wished to force Mademoiselle de Tonnay Charente s door Madame was inflexible in the first place because if Malicorne had in fact wished to enter her apartment at night through the window and by means of the ladder in order to see Montalais it was a punishable offense on Malicorne s part and he must be punished accordingly and in the second place if Malicorne instead of acting in his own name had acted as an intermediary between La Valliere and a person whose name it was superfluous to mention his crime was in that case even greater since love which is an excuse for everything did not exist in the case as an excuse Madame therefore made the greatest possible disturbance about the matter and obtained his dismissal from Monsieur s household without reflecting poor blind creature that both Malicorne and Montalais held her fast in their clutches in consequence of her visit to De Guiche and in a variety of other ways equally delicate Montalais who was perfectly furious wished to revenge herself immediately but Malicorne pointed out to her that the king s countenance would repay them for all the disgraces in the world and that it was a great thing to have to suffer on his majesty s account Malicorne was perfectly right and therefore although Montalais had the spirit of ten women in her he succeeded in bringing her round to his own opinion And we must not omit to state that the king helped them to console themselves for in the first place he presented Malicorne with fifty thousand francs as a compensation for the post he had lost and in the next place he gave him an appointment in his own household delighted to have an opportunity of revenging himself in such a manner upon Madame for all she had made him and La Valliere suffer But as Malicorne could no longer carry significant handkerchiefs for him or plant convenient ladders the royal lover was in a terrible state There seemed to be no hope therefore of ever getting near La Valliere again so long as she should remain at the Palais Royal All the dignities and all the money in the world could not remedy that Fortunately however Malicorne was on the lookout and this so successfully that he met Montalais who to do her justice it must be admitted was doing her best to meet Malicorne What do you do during the night in Madame s apartment he asked the young girl Why I go to sleep of course she replied But it is very wrong to sleep it can hardly be possible that with the pain you are suffering you can manage to do so And what am I suffering from may I ask Are you not in despair at my absence Of course not since you have received fifty thousand francs and an appointment in the king s household That is a matter of no moment you are exceedingly afflicted at not seeing me as you used to see me formerly and more than all you are in despair at my having lost Madame s confidence come now is not that true Perfectly true Very good your distress of mind prevents you sleeping at night and so you sob and sigh and blow your nose ten times every minute as loud as possible But my dear Malicorne Madame cannot endure the slightest noise near her I know that perfectly well of course she can t endure anything and so I tell you when she hears your deep distress she will turn you out of her rooms without a moment s delay I understand Very fortunate you do Well and what will happen next The next thing that will happen will be that La Valliere finding herself alone without you will groan and utter such loud lamentations that she will exhibit despair enough for two In that case she will be put into another room don t you see Precisely so Yes but which Which Yes that will puzzle you to say mister Inventor General Not at all whenever and whatever the room may be it will always be preferable to Madame s own room That is true Very good so begin your lamentations to night I certainly will not fail to do so And give La Valliere a hint also Oh don t fear her she cries quite enough already to herself Very well all she has to do is cry out loudly And they separated Chapter XXXIII Which Treats of Carpentry Operations and Furnishes Details upon the Mode of Constructing Staircases The advice which had been given to Montalais was communicated by her to La Valliere who could not but acknowledge that it was by no means deficient in judgment and who after a certain amount of resistance rising rather from timidity than indifference to the project resolved to put it into execution This story of the two girls weeping and filling Madame s bedroom with the noisiest lamentations was Malicorne s chef d oeuvre As nothing is so probable as improbability so natural as romance this kind of Arabian Nights story succeeded perfectly with Madame The first thing she did was to send Montalais away and then three days or rather three nights afterwards she had La Valliere removed She gave the latter one of the small rooms on the top story situated immediately over the apartments allotted to the gentlemen of Monsieur s suite One story only that is to say a mere flooring separated the maids of honor from the officers and gentlemen of her husband s household A private staircase which was placed under Madame de Navailles s surveillance was the only means of communication For greater safety Madame de Navailles who had heard of his majesty s previous attempts had the windows of the rooms and the openings of the chimneys carefully barred There was therefore every possible security provided for Mademoiselle de la Valliere whose room now bore more resemblance to a cage than to anything else When Mademoiselle de la Valliere was in her own room and she was there very frequently for Madame scarcely ever had any occasion for her services since she once knew she was safe under Madame de Navailles s inspection Mademoiselle de la Valliere had no better means of amusing herself than looking through the bars of her windows It happened therefore that one morning as she was looking out as usual she perceived Malicorne at one of the windows exactly opposite to her own He held a carpenter s rule in his hand was surveying the buildings and seemed to be adding up some figures on paper La Valliere recognized Malicorne and nodded to him Malicorne in his turn replied by a formal bow and disappeared from the window She was surprised at this marked coolness so different from his usual unfailing good humor but she remembered that he had lost his appointment on her account and that he could hardly be very amiably disposed towards her since in all probability she would never be in a position to make him any recompense for what he had lost She knew how to forgive offenses and with still more readiness could she sympathize with misfortune La Valliere would have asked Montalais her opinion if she had been within hearing but she was absent it being the hour she commonly devoted to her own correspondence Suddenly La Valliere observed something thrown from the window where Malicorne had been standing pass across the open space which separated the iron bars and roll upon the floor She advanced with no little curiosity towards this object and picked it up it was a wooden reel for silk only in this instance instead of silk a piece of paper was rolled round it La Valliere unrolled it and read as follows MADEMOISELLE I am exceedingly anxious to learn two things the first is to know if the flooring of your apartment is wood or brick the second to ascertain at what distance your bed is placed from the window Forgive my importunity and will you be good enough to send me an answer by the same way you receive this letter that is to say by means of the silk winder only instead of throwing into my room as I have thrown it into yours which will be too difficult for you to attempt have the goodness merely to let it fall Believe me mademoiselle your most humble most respectful servant MALICORNE Write the reply if you please upon the letter itself Ah poor fellow exclaimed La Valliere he must have gone out of his mind and she directed towards her correspondent of whom she caught but a faint glimpse in consequence of the darkness of the room a look full of compassionate consideration Malicorne understood her and shook his head as if he meant to say No no I am not out of my mind be quite satisfied She smiled as if still in doubt No no he signified by a gesture my head is right and pointed to his head then after moving his hand like a man who writes very rapidly he put his hands together as if entreating her to write La Valliere even if he were mad saw no impropriety in doing what Malicorne requested her she took a pencil and wrote Wood and then walked slowly from her window to her bed and wrote Six paces and having done this she looked out again at Malicorne who bowed to her signifying that he was about to descend La Valliere understood that it was to pick up the silk winder She approached the window and in accordance with Malicorne s instructions let it fall The winder was still rolling along the flag stones as Malicorne started after it overtook and picked it up and beginning to peel it as a monkey would do with a nut he ran straight towards M de Saint Aignan s apartment Saint Aignan had chosen or rather solicited that his rooms might be as near the king as possible as certain plants seek the sun s rays in order to develop themselves more luxuriantly His apartment consisted of two rooms in that portion of the palace occupied by Louis XIV himself M de Saint Aignan was very proud of this proximity which afforded easy access to his majesty and more than that the favor of occasional unexpected meetings At the moment we are now referring to he was engaged in having both his rooms magnificently carpeted with expectation of receiving the honor of frequent visits from the king for his majesty since his passion for La Valliere had chosen Saint Aignan as his confidant and could not in fact do without him either night or day Malicorne introduced himself to the comte and met with no difficulties because he had been favorably noticed by the king and also because the credit which one man may happen to enjoy is always a bait for others Saint Aignan asked his visitor if he brought any news with him Yes great news replied the latter Ah ah said Saint Aignan what is it Mademoiselle de la Valliere has changed her quarters What do you mean said Saint Aignan opening his eyes very wide She was living in the same apartments as Madame Precisely so but Madame got tired of her proximity and has installed her in a room which is situated exactly above your future apartment What up there exclaimed Saint Aignan with surprise and pointing at the floor above him with his finger No said Malicorne yonder indicating the building opposite What do you mean then by saying that her room is above my apartment Because I am sure that your apartment ought providentially to be under Mademoiselle de la Valliere s room Saint Aignan at this remark gave poor Malicorne a look similar to one of those La Valliere had already given a quarter of an hour before that is to say he thought he had lost his senses Monsieur said Malicorne to him I wish to answer what you are thinking about What do you mean by what I am thinking about My reason is that you have not clearly understood what I want to convey I admit it Well then you are aware that underneath the apartments set for Madame s maids of honor the gentlemen in attendance on the king and on Monsieur are lodged Yes I know that since Manicamp De Wardes and others are living there Precisely Well monsieur admire the singularity of the circumstance the two rooms destined for M de Guiche are exactly the very two rooms situated underneath those which Mademoiselle de Montalais and Mademoiselle de la Valliere occupy Well what then What then do you say Why these two rooms are empty since M de Guiche is now lying wounded at Fontainebleau I assure you my dear fellow I cannot grasp your meaning Well if I had the happiness to call myself Saint Aignan I should guess immediately And what would you do then I should at once change the rooms I am occupying here for those which M de Guiche is not using yonder Can you suppose such a thing said Saint Aignan disdainfully What abandon the chief post of honor the proximity to the king a privilege conceded only to princes of the blood to dukes and peers Permit me to tell you my dear Monsieur de Malicorne that you must be out of your senses Monsieur replied the young man seriously you commit two mistakes My name is Malicorne simply and I am in perfect possession of all my senses Then drawing a paper from his pocket he said Listen to what I am going to say and afterwards I will show you this paper I am listening said Saint Aignan You know that Madame looks after La Valliere as carefully as Argus did after the nymph Io I do You know that the king has sought for an opportunity but uselessly of speaking to the prisoner and that neither you nor myself have yet succeeded in procuring him this piece of good fortune You certainly ought to know something about the subject my poor Malicorne said Saint Aignan smiling Very good what do you suppose would happen to the man whose imagination devised some means of bringing the lovers together Oh the king would set no bounds to his gratitude Let me ask you then M de Saint Aignan whether you would not be curious to taste a little of this royal gratitude Certainly replied Saint Aignan any favor of my master as a recognition of the proper discharge of my duty would assuredly be most precious In that case look at this paper monsieur le comte What is it a plan Yes a plan of M de Guiche s two rooms which in all probability will soon be your two rooms Oh no whatever may happen Why so Because my rooms are the envy of too many gentlemen to whom I certainly shall not give them up M de Roquelaure for instance M de la Ferte and M de Dangeau would all be anxious to get them In that case I shall leave you monsieur le comte and I shall go and offer to one of those gentlemen the plan I have just shown you together with the advantages annexed to it But why do you not keep them for yourself inquired Saint Aignan suspiciously Because the king would never do me the honor of paying me a visit openly whilst he would readily go and see any one of those gentlemen What the king would go and see any one of those gentlemen Go most certainly he would ten times instead of once Is it possible you can ask me if the king would go to an apartment which would bring him nearer to Mademoiselle de la Valliere Yes indeed delightfully near her with a floor between them Malicorne unfolded the piece of paper which had been wrapped round the bobbin Monsieur le comte he said have the goodness to observe that the flooring of Mademoiselle de la Valliere s room is merely a wooden flooring Well Well all you would have to do would be to get hold of a journeyman carpenter lock him up in your apartments without letting him know where you have taken him to and let him make a hole in your ceiling and consequently in the flooring of Mademoiselle de la Valliere s room Good heavens exclaimed Saint Aignan as if dazzled What is the matter said Malicorne Nothing except that you have hit upon a singular bold idea monsieur It will seem a very trifling one to the king I assure you Lovers never think of the risk they run What danger do you apprehend monsieur le comte Why effecting such an opening as that will make a terrible noise it could be heard all over the palace Oh monsieur le comte I am quite sure that the carpenter I shall select will not make the slightest noise in the world He will saw an opening three feet square with a saw covered with tow and no one not even those adjoining will know that he is at work My dear Monsieur Malicorne you astound you positively bewilder me To continue replied Malicorne quietly in the room the ceiling of which you will have cut through you will put up a staircase which will either allow Mademoiselle de la Valliere to descend into your room or the king to ascend into Mademoiselle de la Valliere s room But the staircase will be seen No for in your room it will be hidden by a partition over which you will throw a tapestry similar to that which covers the rest of the apartment and in Mademoiselle de la Valliere s room it will not be seen for the trapdoor which will be a part of the flooring itself will be made to open under the bed Of course said Saint Aignan whose eyes began to sparkle with delight And now monsieur le comte there is no occasion to make you admit that the king will frequently come to the room where such a staircase is constructed I think that M Dangeau particularly will be struck by my idea and I shall now go and explain to him But my dear Monsieur Malicorne you forget that you spoke to me about it the first and that I have consequently the right of priority Do you wish for the preference Do I wish it Of course I do The fact is Monsieur de Saint Aignan I am presenting you with a Jacob s ladder which is better than the promise of an additional step in the peerage perhaps even with a good estate to accompany your dukedom At least replied Saint Aignan it will give me an opportunity of showing the king that he is not mistaken in occasionally calling me his friend an opportunity dear M Malicorne for which I am indebted to you And which you will not forget to remember inquired Malicorne smiling Nothing will delight me more monsieur But I am not the king s friend I am simply his attendant Yes and if you imagine that that staircase is as good as a dukedom for myself I think there will certainly be letters of nobility at the top of it for you Malicorne bowed All I have to do now said Saint Aignan is to move as soon as possible I do not think the king will object to it Ask his permission however I will go and see him this very moment And I will run and get the carpenter I was speaking of When will he be here This very evening Do not forget your precautions He shall be brought with his eyes bandaged And I will send you one of my carriages Without arms And one of my servants without livery But stay what will La Valliere say if she sees what is going on Oh I can assure you she will be very much interested in the operation and I am equally sure that if the king has not courage enough to ascend to her room she will have sufficient curiosity to come down to him We will live in hope said Saint Aignan and now I am off to his majesty At what time will the carpenter be here At eight o clock How long do you suppose he will take to make this opening About a couple of hours only afterwards he must have sufficient time to construct what may be called the hyphen between the two rooms One night and a portion of the following day will do we must not reckon upon less than two days including putting up the staircase Two days that is a very long time Nay when one undertakes to open up communications with paradise itself we must at least take care that the approaches are respectable Quite right so farewell for a short time dear M Malicorne I shall begin to remove the day after to morrow in the evening Chapter XXXIV The Promenade by Torchlight Saint Aignan delighted with what he had just heard and rejoiced at what the future foreshadowed for him bent his steps towards De Guiche s two rooms He who a quarter of an hour previously would hardly yield up his own rooms for a million francs was now ready to expend a million if it were necessary upon the acquisition of the two happy rooms he coveted so eagerly But he did not meet with so many obstacles M de Guiche did not yet know where he was to lodge and besides was still too far ill to trouble himself about his lodgings and so Saint Aignan obtained De Guiche s two rooms without difficulty As for M Dangeau he was so immeasurably delighted that he did not even give himself the trouble to think whether Saint Aignan had any particular reason for removing Within an hour after Saint Aignan s new resolution he was in possession of the two rooms and ten minutes later Malicorne entered followed by the upholsterers During this time the king asked for Saint Aignan the valet ran to his late apartments and found M Dangeau there Dangeau sent him on to De Guiche s and Saint Aignan was found there but a little delay had of course taken place and the king had already exhibited once or twice evident signs of impatience when Saint Aignan entered his royal master s presence quite out of breath You too abandon me then said Louis XIV in a similar tone of lamentation to that with which Caesar eighteen hundred years previously had pronounced the Et tu quoque Sire I am far from abandoning you for on the contrary I am busily occupied in changing my lodgings What do you mean I thought you had finished moving three days ago Yes sire But I don t find myself comfortable where I am so I am going to change to the opposite side of the building Was I not right when I said you were abandoning me exclaimed the king Oh this exceeds all endurance But so it is there was only one woman for whom my heart cared at all and all my family is leagued together to tear her from me and my friend to whom I confided my distress and who helped me to bear up under it has become wearied of my complaints and is going to leave me without even asking my permission Saint Aignan began to laugh The king at once guessed there must be some mystery in this want of respect What is it cried the king full of hope This sire that the friend whom the king calumniates is going to try if he cannot restore to his sovereign the happiness he has lost Are you going to let me see La Valliere said Louis XIV I cannot say so positively but I hope so How how tell me that Saint Aignan I wish to know what your project is and to help you with all my power Sire replied Saint Aignan I cannot even myself tell very well how I must set about attaining success but I have every reason to believe that from to morrow To morrow do you say What happiness But why are you changing your rooms In order to serve your majesty to better advantage How can your moving serve me Do you happen to know where the two rooms destined for De Guiche are situated Yes Well your majesty now knows where I am going Very likely but that does not help me What is it possible that you do not understand sire that above De Guiche s lodgings are two rooms one of which is Mademoiselle Montalais s and the other La Valliere s is it not so Saint Aignan Oh yes yes It is a brilliant idea Saint Aignan a true friend s idea a poet s idea By bringing me nearer her from whom the world seems to unite to separate me you are far more than Pylades was for Orestes or Patroclus for Achilles Sire said Aignan with a smile I question whether if your majesty were to know my projects in their full extent you would continue to pronounce such a pompous eulogium upon me Ah sire I know how very different are the epithets which certain Puritans of the court will not fail to apply to me when they learn of what I intend to do for your majesty Saint Aignan I am dying with impatience I am in a perfect fever I shall never be able to wait until to morrow to morrow why to morrow is an eternity And yet sire I shall require you if you please to go out presently and divert your impatience by a good walk With you agreed we will talk about your projects we will talk of her Nay sire I remain here Whom shall I go out with then With the queen and all the ladies of the court Nothing shall induce me to do that Saint Aignan And yet sire you must Must no no a thousand times no I will never again expose myself to the horrible torture of being close to her of seeing her of touching her dress as I pass by her and yet not be able to say a word to her No I renounce a torture which you suppose will bring me happiness but which consumes and eats away my very life to see her in the presence of strangers and not to tell her that I love her when my whole being reveals my affection and betrays me to every one no I have sworn never to do it again and I will keep my oath Yet sire pray listen to me for a moment I will listen to nothing Saint Aignan In that case I will continue it is most urgent sire pray understand me it is of the greatest importance that Madame and her maids of honor should be absent for two hours from the palace I cannot understand your meaning at all Saint Aignan It is hard for me to give my sovereign directions what to do but under the circumstances I do give you directions sire and either a hunting or a promenade party must be got up But if I were to do what you wish it would be a caprice a mere whim In displaying such an impatient humor I show my whole court that I have no control over my own feelings Do not people already say that I am dreaming of the conquest of the world but that I ought previously to begin by achieving a conquest over myself Those who say so sire are as insolent as they would like to be thought facetious but whomever they may be if your majesty prefers to listen to them I have nothing further to say In such a case that which we have fixed to take place to morrow must be postponed indefinitely Nay Saint Aignan I will go out this evening I will go by torchlight to Saint Germain I will breakfast there to morrow and will return to Paris by three o clock Will that do Admirably In that case I will set out this evening at eight o clock Your majesty has fixed upon the exact minute And you positively will tell me nothing more It is because I have nothing more to tell you Industry counts for something in this world sire but still chance plays so important a part in it that I have been accustomed to leave her the sidewalk confident that she will manage so as to always take the street Well I abandon myself entirely to you And you are quite right Comforted in this manner the king went immediately to Madame to whom he announced the intended expedition Madame fancied at the first moment that she saw in this unexpectedly arranged party a plot of the king s to converse with La Valliere either on the road under cover of the darkness or in some other way but she took especial care not to show any of her fancies to her brother in law and accepted the invitation with a smile upon her lips She gave directions aloud that her maids of honor should accompany her secretly intending in the evening to take the most effectual steps to interfere with his majesty s attachment Then when she was alone and at the very moment the poor lover who had issued orders for the departure was reveling in the idea that Mademoiselle de la Valliere would form one of the party luxuriating in the sad happiness persecuted lovers enjoy of realizing through the sense of sight alone all the transports of possession Madame who was surrounded by her maids of honor was saying Two ladies will be enough for me this evening Mademoiselle de Tonnay Charente and Mademoiselle de Montalais La Valliere had anticipated her own omission and was prepared for it but persecution had rendered her courageous and she did not give Madame the pleasure of seeing on her face the impression of the shock her heart received On the contrary smiling with that ineffable gentleness which gave an angelic expression to her features In that case Madame I shall be at liberty this evening I suppose she said Of course I shall be able to employ it then in progressing with that piece of tapestry which your highness has been good enough to notice and which I have already had the honor of offering to you And having made a respectful obeisance she withdrew to her own apartment Mesdemoiselles de Tonnay Charente and de Montalais did the same The rumor of the intended promenade soon spread all over the palace ten minutes afterwards Malicorne learned Madame s resolution and slipped under Montalais s door a note in the following terms L V must positively pass the night the night with Madame Montalais in pursuance of the compact she had entered into began by burning the letter and then sat down to reflect Montalais was a girl full of expedients and so she very soon arranged her plan Towards five o clock which was the hour for her to repair to Madame s apartment she was running across the courtyard and had reached within a dozen paces of a group of officers when she uttered a cry fell gracefully on one knee rose again with difficulty and walked on limpingly The gentlemen ran forward to her assistance Montalais had sprained her foot Faithful to the discharge of her duty she insisted however notwithstanding her accident upon going to Madame s apartments What is the matter and why do you limp so she inquired I mistook you for La Valliere Montalais related how it had happened that in hurrying on in order to arrive as quickly as possible she had sprained her foot Madame seemed to pity her and wished to have a surgeon sent for immediately but she assuring her that there was nothing really serious in the accident said My only regret Madame is that it will preclude my attendance on you and I should have begged Mademoiselle de la Valliere to take my place with your royal highness but seeing that Madame frowned she added I have not done so Why did you not do so inquired Madame Because poor La Valliere seemed so happy to have her liberty for a whole evening and night too that I did not feel courageous enough to ask her to take my place What is she so delighted as that inquired madame struck by these words She is wild with delight she who is always so melancholy was singing like a bird Besides your highness knows how much she detests going out and also that her character has a spice of wildness in it So thought Madame this extreme delight hardly seems natural to me She has already made all her preparations for dining in her own room tete a tete with one of her favorite books And then as your highness has six other young ladies who would be delighted to accompany you I did not make my proposal to La Valliere Madame did not say a word in reply Have I acted properly continued Montalais with a slight fluttering of the heart seeing the little success that seemed to attend the ruse de guerre which she had relied upon with so much confidence that she had not thought it even necessary to try and find another Does Madame approve of what I have done she continued Madame was reflecting that the king could very easily leave Saint Germain during the night and that as it was only four leagues and a half from Paris to Saint Germain he might readily be in Paris in an hour s time Tell me she said whether La Valliere when she heard of your accident offered at least to bear you company Oh she does not yet know of my accident but even did she know of it I most certainly should not ask her to do anything that might interfere with her own plans I think she wishes this evening to realize quietly by herself that amusement of the late king when he said to M de Cinq Mars Let us amuse ourselves by doing nothing and making ourselves miserable Madame felt convinced that some mysterious love adventure lurked behind this strong desire for solitude The secret might be Louis s return during the night it could not be doubted any longer La Valliere had been informed of his intended return and that was the reason for her delight at having to remain behind at the Palais Royal It was a plan settled and arranged beforehand I will not be their dupe though said Madame and she took a decisive step Mademoiselle de Montalais she said will you have the goodness to inform your friend Mademoiselle de la Valliere that I am exceedingly sorry to disarrange her projects of solitude but that instead of becoming ennuyee by remaining behind alone as she wished she will be good enough to accompany us to Saint Germain and get ennuyee there Ah poor La Valliere said Montalais compassionately but with her heart throbbing with delight oh Madame could there not be some means Enough said Madame I desire it I prefer Mademoiselle la Baume le Blanc s society to that of any one else Go and send her to me and take care of your foot Montalais did not wait for the order to be repeated she returned to her room almost forgetting to feign lameness wrote an answer to Malicorne and slipped it under the carpet The answer simply said She shall A Spartan could not have written more laconically By this means thought Madame I will look narrowly after all on the road she shall sleep near me during the night and his majesty must be very clever if he can exchange a single word with Mademoiselle de la Valliere La Valliere received the order to set off with the same indifferent gentleness with which she had received the order to play Cinderella But inwardly her delight was extreme and she looked upon this change in the princess s resolution as a consolation which Providence had sent her With less penetration than Madame possessed she attributed all to chance While every one with the exception of those in disgrace of those who were ill and those who were suffering from sprains were being driven towards Saint Germain Malicorne smuggled his workman into the palace in one of M de Saint Aignan s carriages and led him into the room corresponding to La Valliere s The man set to work with a will tempted by the splendid reward which had been promised him As the very best tools and implements had been selected from the reserve stock belonging to the engineers attached to the king s household and among others a saw with teeth so sharp and well tempered that it was able under water even to cut through oaken joists as hard as iron the work in question advanced very rapidly and a square portion of the ceiling taken from between two of the joists fell into the arms of the delighted Saint Aignan Malicorne the workman and a confidential valet the latter being one brought into the world to see and hear everything but to repeat nothing In accordance with a new plan indicated by Malicorne the opening was effected in an angle of the room and for this reason As there was no dressing closet adjoining La Valliere s room she had solicited and had that very morning obtained a large screen intended to serve as a partition The screen that had been allotted her was perfectly sufficient to conceal the opening which would besides be hidden by all the artifices skilled cabinet makers would have at their command The opening having been made the workman glided between the joists and found himself in La Valliere s room When there he cut a square opening in the flooring and out of the boards he manufactured a trap so accurately fitting into the opening that the most practised eye could hardly detect the necessary interstices made by its lines of juncture with the floor Malicorne had provided for everything a ring and a couple of hinges which had been bought for the purpose were affixed to the trap door and a small circular stair case packed in sections had been bought ready made by the industrious Malicorne who had paid two thousand francs for it It was higher than what was required but the carpenter reduced the number of steps and it was found to suit exactly This staircase destined to receive so illustrious a burden was merely fastened to the wall by a couple of iron clamps and its base was fixed into the floor of the comte s room by two iron pegs screwed down tightly so that the king and all his cabinet councilors too might pass up and down the staircase without any fear Every blow of the hammer fell upon a thick pad or cushion and the saw was not used until the handle had been wrapped in wool and the blade steeped in oil The noisiest part of the work moreover had taken place during the night and early in the morning that is to say when La Valliere and Madame were both absent When about two o clock in the afternoon the court returned to the Palais Royal La Valliere went up into her own room Everything was in its proper place not the smallest particle of sawdust not the smallest chip was left to bear witness to the violation of her domicile Saint Aignan however wishing to do his utmost in forwarding the work had torn his fingers and his shirt too and had expended no ordinary amount of perspiration in the king s service The palms of his hands were covered with blisters occasioned by his having held the ladder for Malicorne He had moreover brought up one by one the seven pieces of the staircase each consisting of two steps In fact we can safely assert that if the king had seen him so ardently at work his majesty would have sworn an eternal gratitude towards his faithful attendant As Malicorne anticipated the workman had completely finished the job in twenty four hours he received twenty four louis and left overwhelmed with delight for he had gained in one day as much as six months hard work would have procured him No one had the slightest suspicion of what had taken place in the room under Mademoiselle de la Valliere s apartment But in the evening of the second day at the very moment La Valliere had just left Madame s circle and returned to her own room she heard a slight creaking sound in one corner Astonished she looked to see whence it proceeded and the noise began again Who is there she said in a tone of alarm It is I Louise replied the well known voice of the king You you cried the young girl who for a moment fancied herself under the influence of a dream But where You sire Here replied the king opening one of the folds of the screen and appearing like a ghost at the end of the room La Valliere uttered a loud cry and fell trembling into an armchair as the king advanced respectfully towards her Chapter XXXV The Apparition La Valliere very soon recovered from her surprise for owing to his respectful bearing the king inspired her with more confidence by his presence than his sudden appearance had deprived her of But as he noticed that which made La Valliere most uneasy was the means by which he had effected an entrance into her room he explained to her the system of the staircase concealed by the screen and strongly disavowed the notion of his being a supernatural appearance Oh sire said La Valliere shaking her fair head with a most engaging smile present or absent you do not appear to my mind more at one time than at another Which means Louise Oh what you know so well sire that there is not one moment in which the poor girl whose secret you surprised at Fontainebleau and whom you came to snatch from the foot of the cross itself does not think of you Louise you overwhelm me with joy and happiness La Valliere smiled mournfully and continued But sire have you reflected that your ingenious invention could not be of the slightest service to us Why so Tell me I am waiting most anxiously Because this room may be subject to being searched at any moment of the day Madame herself may at any time come here accidentally my companions run in at any moment they please To fasten the door on the inside is to denounce myself as plainly as if I had written above No admittance the king is within Even now sire at this very moment there is nothing to prevent the door opening and your majesty being seen here In that case said the king laughingly I should indeed be taken for a phantom for no one can tell in what way I came here Besides it is only spirits that can pass through brick walls or floors and ceilings Oh sire reflect for a moment how terrible the scandal would be Nothing equal to it could ever have been previously said about the maids of honor poor creatures whom evil report however hardly ever spares And your conclusion from all this my dear Louise come explain yourself Alas it is a hard thing to say but your majesty must suppress staircase plots surprises and all for the evil consequences which would result from your being found here would be far greater than our happiness in seeing each other Well Louise replied the king tenderly instead of removing this staircase by which I have ascended there is a far more simple means of which you have not thought A means another means Yes another Oh you do not love me as I love you Louise since my invention is quicker than yours She looked at the king who held out his hand to her which she took and gently pressed between her own You were saying continued the king that I shall be detected coming here where any one who pleases can enter Stay sire at this very moment even while you are speaking about it I tremble with dread of your being discovered But you would not be found out Louise if you were to descend the staircase which leads to the room underneath Oh sire what do you say cried Louise in alarm You do not quite understand me Louise since you get offended at my very first word first of all do you know to whom the apartments underneath belong To M de Guiche sire I believe Not at all they are M de Saint Aignan s Are you sure cried La Valliere and this exclamation which escaped from the young girl s joyous heart made the king s heart throb with delight Yes to Saint Aignan our friend he said But sire returned La Valliere I cannot visit M de Saint Aignan s rooms any more than I could M de Guiche s It is impossible impossible And yet Louise I should have thought that under the safe conduct of the king you would venture anything Under the safe conduct of the king she said with a look full of tenderness You have faith in my word I hope Louise Yes sire when you are not present but when you are present when you speak to me when I look upon you I have faith in nothing What can possibly be done to reassure you It is scarcely respectful I know to doubt the king but for me you are not the king Thank Heaven I at least hope so most devoutly you see how anxiously I am trying to find or invent a means of removing all difficulty Stay would the presence of a third person reassure you The presence of M de Saint Aignan would certainly Really Louise you wound me by your suspicions Louise did not answer she merely looked steadfastly at him with that clear piercing gaze which penetrates the very heart and said softly to herself Alas alas it is not you of whom I am afraid it is not you upon whom my doubts would fall Well said the king sighing I agree and M de Saint Aignan who enjoys the inestimable privilege of reassuring you shall always be present at our interviews I promise you You promise that sire Upon my honor as a gentleman and you on your side Oh wait sire that is not all yet for such conversations ought at least to have a reasonable motive of some kind for M de Saint Aignan Dear Louise every shade of delicacy of feeling is yours and my only study is to equal you on that point It shall be just as you wish therefore our conversations shall have a reasonable motive and I have already hit upon one so that from to morrow if you like To morrow Do you meant that that is not soon enough exclaimed the king caressing La Valliere s hand between his own At this moment the sound of steps was heard in the corridor Sire sire cried La Valliere some one is coming do you hear Oh fly fly I implore you The king made but one bound from the chair where he was sitting to his hiding place behind the screen He had barely time for as he drew one of the folds before him the handle of the door was turned and Montalais appeared at the threshold As a matter of course she entered quite naturally and without any ceremony for she knew perfectly well that to knock at the door beforehand would be showing a suspicion towards La Valliere which would be displeasing to her She accordingly entered and after a rapid glance round the room in the brief course of which she observed two chairs very close to each other she was so long in shutting the door which seemed to be difficult to close one can hardly tell how or why that the king had ample time to raise the trap door and to descend again to Saint Aignan s room Louise she said to her I want to talk to you and seriously too Good heavens my dear Aure what is the matter now The matter is that Madame suspects everything Explain yourself Is there any occasion for us to enter into explanations and do you not understand what I mean Come you must have noticed the fluctuations in Madame s humor during several days past you must have noticed how she first kept you close beside her then dismissed you and then sent for you again Yes I have noticed it of course Well it seems Madame has now succeeded in obtaining sufficient information for she has now gone straight to the point as there is nothing further left in France to withstand the torrent which sweeps away all obstacles before it you know what I mean by the torrent La Valliere hid her face in her hands I mean continued Montalais pitilessly that torrent which burst through the gates of the Carmelites of Chaillot and overthrew all the prejudices of the court as well at Fontainebleau as at Paris Alas alas murmured La Valliere her face still covered by her hands and her tears streaming through her fingers Oh don t distress yourself in that manner or you have only heard half of your troubles In Heaven s name exclaimed the young girl in great anxiety what is the matter Well then this is how the matter stands Madame who can no longer rely upon any further assistance in France for she has one after the other made use of the two queens of Monsieur and the whole court too now bethinks herself of a certain person who has certain pretended rights over you La Valliere became as white as a marble statue This person continued Madame is not in Paris at this moment but if I am not mistaken is just now in England Yes yes breathed La Valliere almost overwhelmed with terror And is to be found I think at the court of Charles II am I right Yes Well this evening a letter has been dispatched by Madame to Saint James s with directions for the courier to go straight to Hampton Court which I believe is one of the royal residences situated about a dozen miles from London Yes well Well as Madame writes regularly to London once a fortnight and as the ordinary courier left for London not more than three days ago I have been thinking that some serious circumstance alone could have induced her to write again so soon for you know she is a very indolent correspondent Yes This letter has been written therefore something tells me so at least on your account On my account repeated the unhappy girl mechanically And I who saw the letter lying on Madame s desk before she sealed it fancied I could read What did you fancy you could read I might possibly have been mistaken though Tell me what was it The name of Bragelonne La Valliere rose hurriedly from her chair a prey to the most painful agitation Montalais she said her voice broken by sobs all my smiling dreams of youth and innocence have fled already I have nothing now to conceal either from you or any one else My life is exposed to every one s inspection and can be opened like a book in which all the world can read from the king himself to the first passer by Aure dearest Aure what can I do what will become of me Montalais approached close to her and said Consult your own heart of course Well I do not love M de Bragelonne when I say I do not love him understand that I love him as the most affectionate sister could love the best of brothers but that is not what he requires nor what I promised him In fact you love the king said Montalais and that is a sufficiently good excuse Yes I do love the king hoarsely murmured the young girl and I have paid dearly enough for pronouncing those words And now Montalais tell me what can you do either for me or against me in my position You must speak more clearly still What am I to say then And so you have nothing very particular to tell me No said Louise in astonishment Very good and so all you have to ask me is my advice respecting M Raoul Nothing else It is a very delicate subject replied Montalais No it is nothing of the kind Ought I to marry him in order to keep the promise I made or ought I continue to listen to the king You have really placed me in a very difficult position said Montalais smiling you ask me if you ought to marry Raoul whose friend I am and whom I shall mortally offend in giving my opinion against him and then you ask me if you should cease to listen to the king whose subject I am and whom I should offend if I were to advise you in a particular way Ah Louise you seem to hold a difficult position at a very cheap rate You have not understood me Aure said La Valliere wounded by the slightly mocking tone of her companion if I were to marry M de Bragelonne I should be far from bestowing on him the happiness he deserves but for the same reason if I listen to the king he would become the possessor of one indifferent in very many aspects I admit but one whom his affection confers an appearance of value What I ask you then is to tell me some means of disengaging myself honorably either from the one or from the other or rather I ask you from which side you think I can free myself most honorably My dear Louise replied Montalais after a pause I am not one of the seven wise men of Greece and I have no perfectly invariable rules of conduct to govern me but on the other hand I have a little experience and I can assure you that no woman ever asks for advice of the nature which you have just asked me without being in a terrible state of embarrassment Besides you have made a solemn promise which every principle of honor requires you to fulfil if therefore you are embarrassed in consequence of having undertaken such an engagement it is not a stranger s advice every one is a stranger to a heart full of love it is not my advice I repeat that can extricate you from your embarrassment I shall not give it you therefore and for a greater reason still because were I in your place I should feel much more embarrassed after the advice than before it All I can do is to repeat what I have already told you shall I assist you Yes yes Very well that is all Tell me in what way you wish me to help you tell me for and against whom in this way we shall not make any blunders But first of all said La Valliere pressing her companion s hand for whom or against whom do you decide For you if you are really and truly my friend Are you not Madame s confidant A greater reason for being of service to you if I were not to know what is going on in that direction I should not be of any service at all and consequently you would not obtain any advantage from my acquaintance Friendships live and thrive upon a system of reciprocal benefits The result is then that you will remain at the same time Madame s friend also Evidently Do you complain of that I hardly know sighed La Valliere thoughtfully for this cynical frankness appeared to her an offense both to the woman and the friend All well and good then said Montalais for if you did you would be very foolish You wish to serve me then Devotedly if you will serve me in return One would almost say that you do not know my heart said La Valliere looking at Montalais with her eyes wide open Why the fact is that since we have belonged to the court my dear Louise we are very much changed In what way It is very simple Were you the second queen of France yonder at Blois La Valliere hung down her head and began to weep Montalais looked at her in an indefinable manner and murmured Poor girl and then adding Poor king she kissed Louise on the forehead and returned to her apartment where Malicorne was waiting for her Chapter XXXVI The Portrait In that malady which is termed love the paroxysms succeed each other at intervals ever accelerating from the moment the disease declares itself By and by the paroxysms are less frequent in proportion as the cure approaches This being laid down as a general axiom and as the leading article of a particular chapter we will now proceed with our recital The next day the day fixed by the king for the first conversation in Saint Aignan s room La Valliere on opening one of the folds of the screen found upon the floor a letter in the king s handwriting The letter had been passed through a slit in the floor from the lower apartment to her own No indiscreet hand or curious gaze could have brought or did bring this single paper This too was one of Malicorne s ideas Having seen how very serviceable Saint Aignan would become to the king on account of his apartment he did not wish that the courtier should become still more indispensable as a messenger and so he had on his own private account reserved this last post for himself La Valliere most eagerly read the letter which fixed two o clock that same afternoon for the rendezvous and which indicated the way of raising the trap door which was constructed out of the flooring Make yourself look as beautiful as you can added the postscript of the letter words which astonished the young girl but at the same time reassured her The hours passed away very slowly but the time fixed however arrived at last As punctual as the priestess Hero Louise lifted up the trap door at the last stroke of the hour of two and found the king on the steps waiting for her with the greatest respect in order to give her his hand to descend The delicacy and deference shown in this attention affected her very powerfully At the foot of the staircase the two lovers found the comte who with a smile and a low reverence distinguished by the best taste expressed his thanks to La Valliere for the honor she conferred upon him Then turning towards the king he said Sire our man is here La Valliere looked at the king with some uneasiness Mademoiselle said the king if I have begged you to do me the honor of coming down here it was from an interested motive I have procured a most admirable portrait painter who is celebrated for the fidelity of his likenesses and I wish you to be kind enough to authorize him to paint yours Besides if you positively wish it the portrait shall remain in your own possession La Valliere blushed You see said the king to her we shall not be three as you wished but four instead And so long as we are not alone there can be as many present as you please La Valliere gently pressed her royal lover s hand Shall we pass into the next room sire said Saint Aignan opening the door to let his guests precede him The king walked behind La Valliere and fixed his eyes lingeringly and passionately upon that neck as white as snow upon which her long fair ringlets fell in heavy masses La Valliere was dressed in a thick silk robe of pearl gray color with a tinge of rose with jet ornaments which displayed to greater effect the dazzling purity of her skin holding in her slender and transparent hands a bouquet of heartsease Bengal roses and clematis surrounded with leaves of the tenderest green above which uprose like a tiny goblet spilling magic influence a Haarlem tulip of gray and violet tints of a pure and beautiful species which had cost the gardener five years toil of combinations and the king five thousand francs Louis had placed this bouquet in La Valliere s hand as he saluted her In the room the door of which Saint Aignan had just opened a young man was standing dressed in a purple velvet jacket with beautiful black eyes and long brown hair It was the painter his canvas was quite ready and his palette prepared for use He bowed to La Valliere with the grave curiosity of an artist who is studying his model saluted the king discreetly as if he did not recognize him and as he would consequently have saluted any other gentleman Then leading Mademoiselle de la Valliere to the seat he had arranged for her he begged her to sit down The young girl assumed an attitude graceful and unrestrained her hands occupied and her limbs reclining on cushions and in order that her gaze might not assume a vague or affected expression the painter begged her to choose some kind of occupation so as to engage her attention whereupon Louis XIV smiling sat down on the cushions at La Valliere s feet so that she in the reclining posture she had assumed leaning back in the armchair holding her flowers in her hand and he with his eyes raised towards her and fixed devouringly on her face they both together formed so charming a group that the artist contemplated painting it with professional delight while on his side Saint Aignan regarded them with feelings of envy The painter sketched rapidly and very soon beneath the earliest touches of the brush there started into life out of the gray background the gentle poetry breathing face with its soft calm eyes and delicately tinted cheeks enframed in the masses of hair which fell about her neck The lovers however spoke but little and looked at each other a great deal sometimes their eyes became so languishing in their gaze that the painter was obliged to interrupt his work in order to avoid representing an Erycina instead of La Valliere It was on such occasions that Saint Aignan came to the rescue and recited verses or repeated one of those little tales such as Patru related and Tallemant des Reaux wrote so cleverly Or it might be that La Valliere was fatigued and the sitting was therefore suspended for awhile and immediately a tray of precious porcelain laden with the most beautiful fruits which could be obtained and rich wines distilling their bright colors in silver goblets beautifully chased served as accessories to the picture of which the painter could but retrace the most ephemeral resemblance Louis was intoxicated with love La Valliere with happiness Saint Aignan with ambition and the painter was storing up recollections for his old age Two hours passed away in this manner and four o clock having struck La Valliere rose and made a sign to the king Louis also rose approached the picture and addressed a few flattering remarks to the painter Saint Aignan also praised the picture which as he pretended was already beginning to assume an accurate resemblance La Valliere in her turn blushingly thanked the painter and passed into the next room where the king followed her after having previously summoned Saint Aignan Will you not come to morrow he said to La Valliere Oh sire pray think that some one will be sure to come to my room and will not find me there Well What will become of me in that case You are very apprehensive Louise But at all events suppose Madame were to send for me Oh replied the king will the day never come when you yourself will tell me to brave everything so that I may not have to leave you again On that day sire I shall be quite out of my mind and you must not believe me To morrow Louise La Valliere sighed but without the courage to oppose her royal lover s wish she repeated To morrow then since you desire it sire and with these words she ran lightly up the stairs and disappeared from her lover s gaze Well sire inquired Saint Aignan when she had left Well Saint Aignan yesterday I thought myself the happiest of men And does your majesty then regard yourself to day said the comte smiling as the unhappiest of men No but my love for her is an unquenchable thirst in vain do I drink in vain do I swallow the drops of water which your industry procures for me the more I drink the more unquenchable it becomes Sire that is in some degree your own fault and your majesty alone has made the position such as it is You are right In that case therefore the means to be happy is to fancy yourself satisfied and to wait Wait you know that word then There there sire do not despair I have already been at work on your behalf I have still other resources in store The king shook his head in a despairing manner What sire have you not been satisfied hitherto Oh yes indeed yes my dear Saint Aignan but invent for Heaven s sake invent some further project yet Sire I undertake to do my best and that is all that any one can do The king wished to see the portrait again as he was unable to see the original He pointed out several alterations to the painter and left the room and then Saint Aignan dismissed the artist The easel paints and painter himself had scarcely gone when Malicorne showed his head in the doorway He was received by Saint Aignan with open arms but still with a little sadness for the cloud which had passed across the royal sun veiled in its turn the faithful satellite and Malicorne at a glance perceived the melancholy that brooded on Saint Aignan s face Oh monsieur le comte he said how sad you seem And good reason too my dear Monsieur Malicorne Will you believe that the king is still dissatisfied With his staircase do you mean Oh no on the contrary he is delighted with the staircase The decorations of the apartments I suppose don t please him Oh he has not even thought of that No indeed it seems that what has dissatisfied the king I will tell you monsieur le comte he is dissatisfied at finding himself the fourth person at a rendezvous of this kind How is it possible you could not have guessed that Why how is it likely I could have done so dear M Malicorne when I followed the king s instructions to the very letter Did his majesty really insist on your being present Positively And also required that the painter whom I met downstairs just now should be here too He insisted upon it In that case I can easily understand why his majesty is dissatisfied What dissatisfied that I have so punctually and so literally obeyed his orders I don t understand you Malicorne began to scratch his ear as he asked What time did the king fix for the rendezvous in your apartments Two o clock And you were waiting for the king Ever since half past one it would have been a fine thing indeed to have been unpunctual with his majesty Malicorne notwithstanding his respect for Saint Aignan could not help smiling And the painter he said did the king wish him to be here at two o clock also No but I had him waiting here from midday Far better you know for a painter to be kept waiting a couple of hours than the king a single minute Malicorne began to laugh aloud Come dear Monsieur Malicorne said Saint Aignan laugh less at me and speak a little more freely I beg Well then monsieur le comte if you wish the king to be a little more satisfied the next time he comes Ventre saint gris as his grandfather used to say of course I wish it Well all you have to do is when the king comes to morrow to be obliged to go away on a most pressing matter of business which cannot possibly be postponed and stay away for twenty minutes What leave the king alone for twenty minutes cried Saint Aignan in alarm Very well do as you like don t pay any attention to what I say said Malicorne moving towards the door Nay nay dear Monsieur Malicorne on the contrary go on I begin to understand you But the painter Oh the painter must be half an hour late Half an hour do you really think so Yes I do decidedly Very well then I will do as you tell me And my opinion is that you will be doing perfectly right Will you allow me to call upon you for the latest news to morrow Of course I have the honor to be your most respectful servant M de Saint Aignan said Malicorne bowing profoundly and retiring from the room backwards There is no doubt that fellow has more invention than I have said Saint Aignan as if compelled by his conviction to admit it Chapter XXXVII Hampton Court The revelation we have witnessed that Montalais made to La Valliere in a preceding chapter very naturally makes us return to the principal hero of this tale a poor wandering knight roving about at the king s caprice If our readers will be good enough to follow us we will in his company cross that strait more stormy than the Euripus which separates Calais from Dover we will speed across that green and fertile country with its numerous little streams through Maidstone and many other villages and towns each prettier than the other and finally arrive at London From thence like bloodhounds following a track after having ascertained that Raoul had made his first stay at Whitehall his second at saint James s and having learned that he had been warmly received by Monk and introduced to the best society of Charles II s court we will follow him to one of Charles II s summer residences near the lively little village of Kingston at Hampton Court situated on the Thames The river is not at that spot the boastful highway which bears upon its broad bosom its thousands of travelers nor are its waters black and troubled as those of Cocytus as it boastfully asserts I too am cousin of the old ocean No at Hampton Court it is a soft and murmuring stream with moss fringed banks reflecting in its broad mirror the willows and beeches which ornament its sides and on which may occasionally be seen a light bark indolently reclining among the tall reeds in a little creek formed of alders and forget me nots The surrounding country on all sides smiled in happiness and wealth the brick cottages from whose chimneys the blue smoke was slowly ascending in wreaths peeped forth from the belts of green holly which environed them children dressed in red frocks appeared and disappeared amidst the high grass like poppies bowed by the gentler breath of the passing breeze The sheep ruminating with half closed eyes lay lazily about under the shadow of the stunted aspens while far and near the kingfishers plumed with emerald and gold skimmed swiftly along the surface of the water like a magic ball heedlessly touching as he passed the line of his brother angler who sat watching in his boat the fish as they rose to the surface of the sparkling stream High above this paradise of dark shadows and soft light rose the palace of Hampton Court built by Wolsey a residence the haughty cardinal had been obliged timid courtier that he was to offer to his master Henry VIII who had glowered with envy and cupidity at the magnificent new home Hampton Court with its brick walls its large windows its handsome iron gates as well as its curious bell turrets its retired covered walks and interior fountains like those of the Alhambra was a perfect bower of roses jasmine and clematis Every sense sight and smell particularly was gratified and the reception rooms formed a very charming framework for the pictures of love which Charles II unrolled among the voluptuous paintings of Titian of Pordenone and of Van Dyck the same Charles whose father s portrait the martyr king was hanging in his gallery and who could show upon the wainscots of the various apartments the holes made by the balls of the puritanical followers of Cromwell when on the twenty fourth of August sixteen forty eight at the time they had brought Charles I prisoner to Hampton Court There it was that the king intoxicated with pleasure and adventure held his court he who a poet in feeling thought himself justified in redeeming by a whole day of voluptuousness every minute which had been formerly passed in anguish and misery It was not the soft green sward of Hampton Court so soft that it almost resembled the richest velvet in the thickness of its texture nor was it the beds of flowers with their variegated hues which encircled the foot of every tree with rose trees many feet in height embracing most lovingly their trunks nor even the enormous lime trees whose branches swept the earth like willows offering a ready concealment for love or reflection beneath the shade of their foliage it was none of these things for which Charles II loved his palace of Hampton Court Perhaps it might have been that beautiful sheet of water which the cool breeze rippled like the wavy undulations of Cleopatra s hair waters bedecked with cresses and white water lilies whose chaste bulbs coyly unfolding themselves beneath the sun s warm rays reveal the golden gems which lie concealed within their milky petals murmuring waters on the bosom of which black swans majestically floated and the graceful water fowl with their tender broods covered with silken down darted restlessly in every direction in pursuit of the insects among the reeds or the fogs in their mossy retreats Perhaps it might have been the enormous hollies with their dark and tender green foliage or the bridges uniting the banks of the canals in their embrace or the fawns browsing in the endless avenues of the park or the innumerable birds that hopped about the gardens or flew from branch to branch amidst the emerald foliage It might well have been any of these charms for Hampton Court had them all and possessed too almost forests of white roses which climbed and trailed along the lofty trellises showering down upon the ground their snowy leaves rich with soft perfumery But no what Charles II most loved in Hampton Court were the charming figures who when midday was past flitted to and fro along the broad terraces of the gardens like Louis XIV he had their wealth of beauties painted for his gallery by one of the great artists of the period an artist who well knew the secret of transferring to canvas the rays of light which escaped from beaming eyes heavy laden with love and love s delights The day of our arrival at Hampton Court is almost as clear and bright as a summer s day in France the atmosphere is heavy with the delicious perfume of geraniums sweet peas seringas and heliotrope scattered in profusion around It is past midday and the king having dined after his return from hunting paid a visit to Lady Castlemaine the lady who was reputed at the time to hold his heart in bondage and this proof of his devotion discharged he was readily permitted to pursue his infidelities until evening arrived Love and amusement ruled the entire court it was the period when ladies would seriously interrogate their ruder companions as to their opinions upon a foot more or less captivating according to whether it wore a pink or lilac silk stocking for it was the period when Charles II had declared that there was no hope of safety for a woman who wore green silk stockings because Miss Lucy Stewart wore them of that color While the king is endeavoring in all directions to inculcate others with his preferences on this point we will ourselves bend our steps towards an avenue of beech trees opposite the terrace and listen to the conversation of a young girl in a dark colored dress who is walking with another of about her own age dressed in blue They crossed a beautiful lawn from the center of which sprang a fountain with the figure of a siren executed in bronze and strolled on talking as they went towards the terrace along which looking out upon the park and interspersed at frequent intervals were erected summer houses diverse in form and ornament these summer houses were nearly all occupied the two young women passed on the one blushing deeply while the other seemed dreamily silent At last having reached the end of the terrace which looks on the river and finding there a cool retreat they sat down close to each other Where are we going said the younger to her companion My dear we are going where you yourself led the way I Yes you to the extremity of the palace towards that seat yonder where the young Frenchman is seated wasting his time in sighs and lamentations Miss Mary Grafton hurriedly said No no I am not going there Why not Let us go back Lucy Nay on the contrary let us go on and have an explanation What about About how it happens that the Vicomte de Bragelonne always accompanies you in all your walks as you invariably accompany him in his And you conclude either that he loves me or that I love him Why not he is a most agreeable and charming companion No one hears me I hope said Lucy Stewart as she turned round with a smile which indicated moreover that her uneasiness on the subject was not extreme No no said Mary the king is engaged in his summer house with the Duke of Buckingham Oh a propos of the duke Mary it seems he has shown you great attention since his return from France how is your own heart in that direction Mary Grafton shrugged her shoulders with seeming indifference Well well I will ask Bragelonne about it said Stewart laughing let us go and find him at once What for I wish to speak to him Not yet one word before you do come come you who know so many of the king s secrets tell me why M de Bragelonne is in England Because he was sent as an envoy from one sovereign to another That may be but seriously although politics do not much concern us we know enough to be satisfied that M de Bragelonne has no mission of serious import here Well then listen said Stewart with assumed gravity for your sake I am going to betray a state secret Shall I tell you the nature of the letter which King Louis XIV gave M de Bragelonne for King Charles II I will these are the very words My brother the bearer of this is a gentleman attached to my court and the son of one whom you regard most warmly Treat him kindly I beg and try and make him like England Did it say that Word for word or something very like it I will not answer for the form but the substance I am sure of Well and what conclusion do you or rather what conclusion does the king draw from that That the king of France has his own reasons for removing M de Bragelonne and for getting him married anywhere else than in France So that then in consequence of this letter King Charles received M de Bragelonne as you are aware in the most distinguished and friendly manner the handsomest apartments in Whitehall were allotted to him and as you are the most valuable and precious person in his court inasmuch as you have rejected his heart nay do not blush he wished you to take a fancy to this Frenchman and he was desirous to confer upon him so costly a prize And this is the reason why you the heiress of three hundred thousand pounds a future duchess so beautiful so good have been thrown in Bragelonne s way in all the promenades and parties of pleasure to which he was invited In fact it was a plot a kind of conspiracy Mary Grafton smiled with that charming expression which was habitual to her and pressing her companion s arm said Thank the king Lucy Yes yes but the Duke of Buckingham is jealous so take care Hardly had she pronounced these words when the duke appeared from one of the pavilions on the terrace and approaching the two girls with a smile said You are mistaken Miss Lucy I am not jealous and the proof Miss Mary is yonder in the person of M de Bragelonne himself who ought to be the cause of my jealousy but who is dreaming in pensive solitude Poor fellow Allow me to leave you for a few minutes while I avail myself of those few minutes to converse with Miss Lucy Stewart to whom I have something to say And then bowing to Lucy he added Will you do me the honor to accept my hand in order that I may lead you to the king who is waiting for us With these words Buckingham still smiling took Miss Stewart s hand and led her away When by herself Mary Grafton her head gently inclined towards her shoulder with that indolent gracefulness of action which distinguishes young English girls remained for a moment with her eyes fixed on Raoul but as if uncertain what to do At last after first blushing violently and then turning deadly pale thus revealing the internal combat which assailed her heart she seemed to make up her mind to adopt a decided course and with a tolerably firm step advanced towards the seat on which Raoul was reclining buried in the profoundest meditation as we have already said The sound of Miss Mary s steps though they could hardly be heard upon the green sward awakened Raoul from his musing attitude he turned round perceived the young girl and walked forward to meet the companion whom his happy destiny had thrown in his way I have been sent to you monsieur said Mary Grafton will you take care of me To whom is my gratitude due for so great a happiness inquired Raoul To the Duke of Buckingham replied Mary affecting a gayety she did not really feel To the Duke of Buckingham do you say he who so passionately seeks your charming society Am I really to believe you are serious mademoiselle The fact is monsieur you perceive that everything seems to conspire to make us pass the best or rather the longest part of our days together Yesterday it was the king who desired me to beg you to seat yourself next to me at dinner to day it is the Duke of Buckingham who begs me to come and place myself near you on this seat And he has gone away in order to leave us together asked Raoul with some embarrassment Look yonder at the turning of that path he is just out of sight with Miss Stewart Are these polite attentions usual in France monsieur le vicomte I cannot very precisely say what people do in France mademoiselle for I can hardly be called a Frenchman I have resided in many countries and almost always as a soldier and then I have spent a long period of my life in the country I am almost a savage You do not like your residence in England I fear I scarcely know said Raoul inattentively and sighing deeply at the same time What you do not know Forgive me said Raoul shaking his head and collecting his thoughts I did not hear you Oh said the young girl sighing in her turn how wrong the duke was to send me here Wrong said Raoul perhaps so for I am but a rude uncouth companion and my society annoys you The duke did indeed very wrong to send you It is precisely replied Mary Grafton in a clear calm voice because your society does not annoy me that the duke was wrong to send me to you It was now Raoul s turn to blush But he resumed how happens it that the Duke of Buckingham should send you to me and why did you come the duke loves you and you love him No replied Mary seriously the duke does not love me because he is in love with the Duchesse d Orleans and as for myself I have no affection for the duke Raoul looked at the young lady with astonishment Are you a friend of the Duke of Buckingham she inquired The duke has honored me by calling me so ever since we met in France You are simple acquaintances then No for the duke is the most intimate friend of one whom I regard as a brother The Duc de Guiche Yes He who is in love with Madame la Duchesse d Orleans Oh What is that you are saying And who loves him in return continued the young girl quietly Raoul bent down his head and Mary Grafton sighing deeply continued They are very happy But leave me Monsieur de Bragelonne for the Duke of Buckingham has given you a very troublesome commission in offering me as a companion for your promenade Your heart is elsewhere and it is with the greatest difficulty you can be charitable enough to lend me your attention Confess truly it would be unfair on your part vicomte not to admit it Madame I do confess it She looked at him steadily He was so noble and so handsome in his bearing his eyes revealed so much gentleness candor and resolution that the idea could not possibly enter her mind that he was either rudely discourteous or a mere simpleton She only perceived clearly enough that he loved another woman and not herself with the whole strength of his heart Ah I now understand you she said you have left your heart behind you in France Raoul bowed The duke is aware of your affection No one knows it replied Raoul Why therefore do you tell me Nay answer me I cannot It is for me then to anticipate an explanation you do not wish to tell me anything because you are now convinced that I do not love the duke because you see that I possibly might have loved you because you are a gentleman of noble and delicate sentiments and because instead of accepting even were it for the mere amusement of the passing hour a hand which is almost pressed upon you and because instead of meeting my smiles with a smiling lip you who are young have preferred to tell me whom men have called beautiful My heart is over the sea it is in France For this I thank you Monsieur de Bragelonne you are indeed a noble hearted noble minded man and I regard you all the more for it as a friend only And now let us cease speaking of myself and talk of your own affairs Forget that I have ever spoken to you of myself tell me why you are sad and why you have become more than usually so during these past four days Raoul was deeply and sensibly moved by these sweet and melancholy tones and as he could not at the moment find a word to say the young girl again came to his assistance Pity me she said My mother was born in France and I can truly affirm that I too am French in blood as well as in feeling but the leaden atmosphere and characteristic gloom of England seem to weigh upon me Sometimes my dreams are golden hued and full of wonderful enjoyments when suddenly a mist rises and overspreads my fancy blotting them out forever Such indeed is the case at the present moment Forgive me I have now said enough on that subject give me your hand and relate your griefs to me as a friend You say you are French in heart and soul Yes not only I repeat it that my mother was French but further as my father a friend of King Charles I was exiled in France I during the trial of that prince as well as during the Protector s life was brought up in Paris at the Restoration of King Charles II my poor father returned to England where he died almost immediately afterwards and then the king created me a duchess and has dowered me according to my rank Have you any relations in France Raoul inquired with the deepest interest I have a sister there my senior by seven or eight years who was married in France and was early left a widow her name is Madame de Belliere Do you know her she added observing Raoul start suddenly I have heard her name She too loves with her whole heart and her last letters inform me she is happy and her affection is I conclude returned I told you Monsieur de Bragelonne that although I possess half of her nature I do not share her happiness But let us now speak of yourself whom do you love in France A young girl as soft and pure as a lily But if she loves you why are you sad I have been told that she ceases to love me You do not believe it I trust He who wrote me so does not sign his letter An anonymous denunciation some treachery be assured said Miss Grafton Stay said Raoul showing the young girl a letter which he had read over a thousand times she took it from his hand and read as follows VICOMTE You are perfectly right to amuse yourself yonder with the lovely faces of Charles II s court for at Louis XIV s court the castle in which your affections are enshrined is being besieged Stay in London altogether poor vicomte or return without delay to Paris There is no signature said Miss Mary None Believe it not then Very good but here is a second letter from my friend De Guiche which says I am lying here wounded and ill Return Raoul oh return What do you intend doing inquired the young girl with a feeling of oppression at her heart My intention as soon as I received this letter was immediately to take my leave of the king When did you receive it The day before yesterday It is dated Fontainebleau A singular circumstance do you not think for the court is now at Paris At all events I would have set off but when I mentioned my intention to the king he began to laugh and said to me How comes it monsieur l amassadeur that you think of leaving Has your sovereign recalled you I colored naturally enough for I was confused by the question for the fact is the king himself sent me here and I have received no order to return Mary frowned in deep thought and said Do you remain then I must mademoiselle Do you ever receive any letters from her to whom you are so devoted Never Never do you say Does she not love you then At least she has not written to me since my departure although she used occasionally to write to me before I trust she may have been prevented Hush the duke is coming And Buckingham at that moment was seen at the end of the walk approaching towards them alone and smiling he advanced slowly and held out his hands to them both Have you arrived at an understanding he said About what About whatever might render you happy dear Mary and make Raoul less miserable I do not understand you my lord said Raoul That is my view of the subject Miss Mary do you wish me to mention it before M de Bragelonne he added with a smile If you mean replied the young girl haughtily that I was not indisposed to love M de Bragelonne that is useless for I have told him so myself Buckingham reflected for a moment and without seeming in any way discountenanced as she expected he said My reason for leaving you with M de Bragelonne was that I thoroughly knew your refined delicacy of feeling no less than the perfect loyalty of your mind and heart and I hoped that M de Bragelonne s cure might be effected by the hands of a physician such as you are But my lord before you spoke of M de Bragelonne s heart you spoke to me of your own Do you mean to effect the cure of two hearts at the same time Perfectly true madame but you will do me the justice to admit that I have long discontinued a useless pursuit acknowledging that my own wound is incurable My lord said Mary collecting herself for a moment before she spoke M de Bragelonne is happy for he loves and is beloved He has no need of such a physician as I can be M de Bragelonne said Buckingham is on the very eve of experiencing a serious misfortune and he has greater need than ever of sympathy and affection Explain yourself my lord inquired Raoul anxiously No gradually I will explain myself but if you desire it I can tell Miss Grafton what you may not listen to yourself My lord you are putting me to the torture you know something you wish to conceal from me I know that Miss Mary Grafton is the most charming object that a heart ill at ease could possibly meet with in its way through life I have already told you that the Vicomte de Bragelonne loves elsewhere said the young girl He is wrong then Do you assume to know my lord that I am wrong Yes Whom is it that he loves then exclaimed the young girl He loves a lady who is unworthy of him said Buckingham with that calm collected manner peculiar to Englishmen Miss Grafton uttered a cry which together with the remark that Buckingham had that moment made spread oover De Bragelonne s features a deadly paleness arising from the sudden surprise and also from a vague fear of impending misfortune My lord he exclaimed you have just pronounced words which compel me without a moment s delay to seek their explanation in Paris You will remain here said Buckingham because you have no right to leave and no one has the right to quit the service of the king for that of any woman even were she as worthy of being loved as Mary Grafton is You will tell me all then I will on condition that you will remain I will remain if you will promise to speak openly and without reserve Thus far had their conversation proceeded and Buckingham in all probability was on the point of revealing not indeed all that had taken place but at least all he was aware of when one of the king s attendants appeared at the end of the terrace and advanced towards the summer house where the king was sitting with Lucy Stewart A courier followed him covered with dust from head to foot and who seemed as if he had but a few moments before dismounted from his horse The courier from France Madame s courier exclaimed Raoul recognizing the princess s livery and while the attendant and the courier advanced towards the king Buckingham and Miss Grafton exchanged a look full of intelligence with each other Chapter XXXVIII The Courier from Madame Charles II was busily engaged in proving or in endeavoring to prove to Miss Stewart that she was the only person for whom he cared at all and consequently was avowing to her an affection similar to that which his ancestor Henry IV had entertained for Gabrielle Unfortunately for Charles II he had hit upon an unlucky day the very day Miss Stewart had taken it into her head to make him jealous and therefore instead of being touched by his offer as the king had hoped she laughed heartily Oh sire sire she cried laughing all the while if I were to be unfortunate enough to ask you for a proof of the affection you possess how easy it would be to see that you are telling a falsehood Nay listen to me said Charles you know my cartoons by Raphael you know whether I care for them or not the whole world envies me their possession as you well know also my father commissioned Van Dyck to purchase them Would you like me to send them to your house this very day Oh no replied the young girl pray keep them yourself sire my house is far too small to accommodate such visitors In that case you shall have Hampton Court to put the cartoons in Be less generous sire and learn to love a little while longer that is all I have to ask you I shall never cease to love you is not that enough You are smiling sire Do you wish me to weep No but I should like to see you a little more melancholy Thank Heaven I have been so long enough fourteen years of exile poverty and misery I think I may well regard it as a debt discharged besides melancholy makes people look so plain Far from that for look at the young Frenchman What the Vicomte de Bragelonne are you smitten too By Heaven they will all grow mad over him one after the other but he on the contrary has a reason for being melancholy Why so Oh indeed you wish me to betray state secrets do you If I wish it you must do so for you told me you were quite ready to do everything I wished Well then he is bored in his own country Does that satisfy you Bored Yes a proof that he is a simpleton I allow him to fall in love with Miss Mary Grafton and he feels bored Can you believe it Very good it seems then that if you were to find Miss Lucy Stewart indifferent to you you would console yourself by falling in love with Miss Mary Grafton I don t say that in the first place you know that Mary Grafton does not care for me besides a man can only console himself for a lost affection by the discovery of a new one Again however I repeat the question is not of myself but of that young man One might almost be tempted to call the girl he has left behind him a Helen a Helen before the little ceremony she went through with Paris of course He has left some one then That is to say some one has left him Poor fellow so much the worse Why do you mean by so much the worse Why not why did he leave Do you think it was of his own wish or will that he left Was he obliged to leave then He left Paris under orders my dear Stewart and prepare to be surprised by express orders of the king Ah I begin to see now At least say nothing at all about it You know very well that I am just as discreet as anybody else And so the king sent him away Yes And during his absence he takes his sweetheart from him Yes and will you believe it the silly fellow instead of thanking the king is making himself miserable What thank the king for depriving him of the woman he loves Really sire yours is a most ungallant speech But pray understand me If she whom the king had run off with was either a Miss Grafton or a Miss Stewart I should not be of his opinion nay I should even think him not half wretched enough but she is a little thin lame thing Deuce take such fidelity as that Surely one can hardly understand how a man can refuse a girl who is rich for one who is poverty itself a girl who loves him for one who deceives and betrays him Do you think that Mary seriously wishes to please the vicomte sire I do indeed Very good the vicomte will settle down in England for Mary has a clear head and when she fixes her mind upon anything she does so thoroughly Take care my dear Miss Stewart if the vicomte has any idea of adopting our country he has not long to do so for it was only the day before yesterday that he again asked me for permission to leave Which you refused him I suppose I should think so indeed my royal brother is far too anxious for his absence and for myself my amour propre is enlisted on his side for I will never have it said that I had held out as a bait to this young man the noblest and gentlest creature in England You are very gallant sire said Miss Stewart with a pretty pout I do not allude to Miss Stewart for she is worthy of a king s devotion and since she has captivated me I trust that no one else will be caught by her I say therefore finally that the attention I have shown this young man will not have been thrown away he will stay with us here he will marry here or I am very much mistaken And I hope that when he is once married and settled instead of being angry with your majesty he will be grateful to you for every one tries his utmost to please him even the Duke of Buckingham whose brilliancy which is incredible seems to pale before that of this young Frenchman Including Miss Stewart even who calls him the most finished gentleman she ever saw Stay sire you have spoken quite enough and quite highly enough of Miss Grafton to overlook what I may have said about De Bragelonne But by the by sire your kindness for some time past astonishes me you think of those who are absent you forgive those who have done you a wrong in fact you are as nearly as possible perfect How does it happen It is because you allow yourself to be loved he said beginning to laugh Oh there must be some other reason Well I am doing all I can to oblige my brother Louis XIV Nay I must have another reason Well then the true motive is that Buckingham strongly recommended the young man to me saying Sire I begin by yielding up all claim to Miss Grafton I pray you follow my example The duke is indeed a true gentleman Oh of course of course it is Buckingham s turn now I suppose to turn your head You seem determined to cross me in everything to day At this moment some one rapped at the door Who is it who presumes to interrupt us exclaimed Charles impatiently Really sire you are extremely vain with your who is it who presumes and in order to punish you for it She went to the door and opened it It is a courier from France said Miss Stewart A courier from France exclaimed Charles from my sister perhaps Yes sire said the usher a special messenger Let him come in at once said Charles You have a letter for me said the king to the courier as he entered from the Duchess of Orleans Yes sire replied the courier and so urgent in its nature that I have only been twenty six hours in bringing it to your majesty and yet I lost three quarters of an hour at Calais Your zeal shall not be forgotten said the king as he opened the letter When he had read it he burst out laughing and exclaimed Upon my word I am at a loss to understand anything about it He then read the letter a second time Miss Stewart assuming a manner marked by the greatest reserve and doing her utmost to restrain her ardent curiosity Francis said the king to his valet see that this excellent fellow is well taken care of and sleeps soundly and that on waking to morrow he finds a purse of fifty sovereigns by his bedside Sire said the courier amazed Begone begone my sister was perfectly right in desiring you to use the utmost diligence the affair was most pressing And he again began to laugh louder than ever The courier the valet and Miss Stewart hardly knew what sort of countenance to assume Ah said the king throwing himself back in his armchair When I think that you have knocked up how many horses Two Two horses to bring this intelligence to me That will do you can leave us now The courier retired with the valet Charles went to the window which he opened and leaning forward called out Duke Buckingham come here there s a good fellow The duke hurried to him in obedience to the summons but when he reached the door and perceived Miss Stewart he hesitated to enter Come in and shut the door said the king The duke obeyed and perceiving in what an excellent humor the king was he advanced smiling towards him Well my dear duke how do you get on with your Frenchman Sire I am in the most perfect state of utter despair about him Why so Because charming Miss Grafton is willing to marry him but he is unwilling Why he is a perfect Boeotian cried Miss Stewart Let him say either Yes or No and let the affair end But said Buckingham seriously you know or you ought to know madame that M de Bragelonne is in love in another direction In that case said the king coming to Miss Stewart s help nothing is easier let him say No then Very true and I have proved to him he was wrong not to say Yes You told him candidly I suppose that La Valliere was deceiving him Yes without the slightest reserve and as soon as I had done so he gave a start as if he were going to clear the Channel at a bound At all events said Miss Stewart he has done something and a very good thing too upon my word But said Buckingham I stopped him I have left him and Miss Mary in conversation together and I sincerely trust that now he will not leave as he seemed to have an idea of doing An idea of leaving England cried the king I at one moment hardly thought that any human power could have prevented him but Miss Mary s eyes are now bent fully on him and he will remain Well that is the very thing which deceives you Buckingham said the king with a peal of laughter the poor fellow is predestined Predestined to what If it were to be simply deceived that is nothing but to look at him it is a great deal At a distance and with Miss Grafton s aid the blow will be warded off Far from it far from it neither distance nor Miss Grafton s help will be of the slightest avail Bragelonne will set off for Paris within an hour s time Buckingham started and Miss Stewart opened her eyes very wide in astonishment But sire said the duke your majesty knows that it is impossible That is to say my dear Buckingham that it is impossible until it happens Do not forget sire that the young man is a perfect lion and that his wrath is terrible I don t deny it my dear duke And that if he sees that his misfortune is certain so much the worse for the author of it I don t deny it but what the deuce am I to do Were it the king himself cried Buckingham I would not answer for him Oh the king has his musketeers to take care of him said Charles quietly I know that perfectly well for I was kept dancing attendance in his ante chamber at Blois He has M d Artagnan and what better guardian could the king have than M d Artagnan I should make myself perfectly easy with twenty storms of passion such as Bragelonne might display if I had four guardians like D Artagnan But I entreat your majesty who is so good and kind to reflect a little Stay said Charles II presenting the letter to the duke read and answer yourself what you would do in my place Buckingham slowly took hold of Madame s letter and trembling with emotion read the following words For your own sake for mine for the honor and safety of every one send M de Bragelonne back to France immediately Your devoted sister HENRIETTA Well Villiers what do you say Really sire I have nothing to say replied the duke stupefied Nay would you of all persons said the king artfully advise me not to listen to my sister when she writes so urgently Oh no no sire and yet You have not read the postscript Villiers it is under the fold of the letter and escaped me at first read it And as the duke turned down a fold of the letter he read A thousand kind remembrances to those who love me The duke s head sank gradually on his breast the paper trembled in his fingers as if it had been changed to lead The king paused for a moment and seeing that Buckingham did not speak He must follow his destiny as we ours continued the king every man has his own share of grief in this world I have had my own I have had that of others who belong to me and have thus had a double weight of woe to endure But the deuce take all my cares now Go and bring our friend here Villiers The duke opened the trellised door of the summer house and pointing at Raoul and Mary who were walking together side by side said What a cruel blow sire for poor Miss Grafton Nonsense call him said Charles II knitting his black brows together every one seems to be sentimental here There look at Miss Stewart who is wiping her eyes now deuce take the French fellow The duke called to Raoul and taking Miss Grafton by the hand he led her towards the king Monsieur de Bragelonne said Charles II did you not ask me the day before yesterday for permission to return to Paris Yes sire replied Raoul greatly puzzled by this address And I refused you I think Yes sire For which you were angry with me No sire your majesty had no doubt excellent reasons for withholding it for you are so wise and so good that everything you do is well done I alleged I believe as a reason that the king of France had not recalled you Yes sire that was the reason you assigned Well M de Bragelonne I have reflected over the matter since if the king did not in fact fix your return he begged me to render your sojourn in England as agreeable as possible since however you ask my permission to return it is because your longer residence in England is no longer agreeable to you I do not say that sire No but your request at least said the king signified that another place of residence would be more agreeable to you than this At this moment Raoul turned towards the door against which Miss Grafton was leaning pale and sorrow stricken her other hand was passed through the duke s arm You do not reply pursued Charles the proverb is plain enough that silence gives consent Very good Monsieur de Bragelonne I am now in a position to satisfy you whenever you please therefore you can leave for Paris for which you have my authority Sire exclaimed Raoul while Mary stifled an exclamation of grief which rose to her lips unconsciously pressing Buckingham s arm You can be at Dover this evening continued the king the tide serves at two o clock in the morning Raoul astounded stammered out a few broken sentences which equally answered the purpose both of thanks and of excuse I therefore bid you adieu Monsieur de Bragelonne and wish you every sort of prosperity said the king rising you will confer a pleasure on me by keeping this diamond in remembrance of me I had intended it as a marriage gift Miss Grafton felt her limbs almost giving way and as Raoul received the ring from the king s hand he too felt his strength and courage failing him He addressed a few respectful words to the king a passing compliment to Miss Stewart and looked for Buckingham to bid him adieu The king profited by this moment to disappear Raoul found the duke engaged in endeavoring to encourage Miss Grafton Tell him to remain I implore you said Buckingham to Mary No I will tell him to go replied Miss Grafton with returning animation I am not one of those women who have more pride than heart if she whom he loves is in France let him return thither and bless me for having advised him to go and seek his happiness there If on the contrary she shall have ceased to love him let him come back here again I shall still love him and his unhappiness will not have lessened him in my regard In the arms of my house you will find that which Heaven has engraven on my heart Habenti parum egenti cuncta To the rich is accorded little to the poor everything I do not believe Bragelonne that you will find yonder the equivalent of what you leave behind you here I think or at least hope said Raoul with a gloomy air that she whom I love is worthy of my affection but if it be true she is unworthy of me as you have endeavored to make me believe I will tear her image from my heart duke even if my heart breaks in the attempt Mary Grafton gazed upon him with an expression of the most indefinable pity and Raoul returned her look with a sweet sorrowful smile saying Mademoiselle the diamond which the king has given me was destined for you give me leave to offer it for your acceptance if I marry in France you will send it me back if I do not marry keep it And he bowed and left her What does he mean thought Buckingham while Raoul pressed Mary s icy hand with marks of the most reverential respect Mary understood the look that Buckingham fixed upon her If it were a wedding ring I would not accept it she said And yet you were willing to ask him to return to you Oh duke cried the young girl in heart broken accents a woman such as I am is never accepted as a consolation by a man like him You do not think he will return then Never said Miss Grafton in a choking voice And I grieve to tell you Mary that he will find yonder his happiness destroyed his mistress lost to him His honor even has not escaped What will be left him then Mary equal to your affection Answer Mary you who know yourself so well Miss Grafton placed her white hand on Buckingham s arm and while Raoul was hurrying away with headlong speed she repeated in dying accents the line from Romeo and Juliet I must be gone and live or stay and die As she finished the last word Raoul disappeared Miss Grafton returned to her own apartments paler than death Buckingham availed himself of the arrival of the courier who had brought the letter to the king to write to Madame and to the Comte de Guiche The king had not been mistaken for at two in the morning the tide was at full flood and Raoul had embarked for France Chapter XXXIX Saint Aignan Follows Malicorne s Advice The king most assiduously followed the progress which was made in La Valliere s portrait and did so with a care and attention arising as much from a desire that it should resemble her as from the wish that the painter should prolong the period of its completion as much as possible It was amusing to observe him follow the artist s brush awaiting the completion of a particular plan or the result of a combination of colors and suggesting various modifications to the painter which the latter consented to adopt with the most respectful docility And again when the artist following Malicorne s advice was a little late in arriving and when Saint Aignan had been obliged to be absent for some time it was interesting to observe though no one witnessed them those moments of silence full of deep expression which united in one sigh two souls most disposed to understand each other and who by no means objected to the quiet meditation they enjoyed together The minutes flew rapidly by as if on wings and as the king drew closer to Louise and bent his burning gaze upon her a noise was suddenly heard in the ante room It was the artist who had just arrived Saint Aignan too had returned full of apologies and the king began to talk and La Valliere to answer him very hurriedly their eyes revealing to Saint Aignan that they had enjoyed a century of happiness during his absence In a word Malicorne philosopher that he was though he knew it not had learned how to inspire the king with an appetite in the midst of plenty and with desire in the assurance of possession La Valliere s fears of interruption had never been realized and no one imagined she was absent from her apartment two or three hours every day she pretended that her health was very uncertain those who went to her room always knocked before entering and Malicorne the man of so many ingenious inventions had constructed an acoustic piece of mechanism by means of which La Valliere when in Saint Aignan s apartment was always forewarned of any visits which were paid to the room she usually inhabited In this manner therefore without leaving her room and having no confidante she was able to return to her apartment thus removing by her appearance a little tardy perhaps the suspicions of the most determined skeptics Malicorne having asked Saint Aignan the next morning what news he had to report the latter was obliged to confess that the quarter of an hour s liberty had made the king in most excellent humor We must double the dose replied Malicorne but by insensible degrees wait until they seem to wish it They were so desirous for it however that on the evening of the fourth day at the moment when the painter was packing up his implements during Saint Aignan s continued absence Saint Aignan on his return noticed upon La Valliere s face a shade of disappointment and vexation which she could not conceal The king was less reserved and exhibited his annoyance by a very significant shrug of the shoulders at which La Valliere could not help blushing Very good thought Saint Aignan to himself M Malicorne will be delighted this evening as he in fact was when it was reported to him It is very evident he remarked to the comte that Mademoiselle de la Valliere hoped that you would be at least ten minutes later And the king that I should be half an hour later dear Monsieur Malicorne You would show but very indifferent devotion to the king replied the latter if you were to refuse his majesty that half hour s satisfaction But the painter objected Saint Aignan I will take care of him said Malicorne only I must study faces and circumstances a little better before I act those are my magical inventions and contrivances and while sorcerers are enabled by means of their astrolabe to take the altitude of the sun moon and stars I am satisfied merely by looking into people s faces in order to see if their eyes are encircled with dark lines and if the mouth describes a convex or concave arc And the cunning Malicorne had every opportunity of watching narrowly and closely for the very same evening the king accompanied the queen to Madame s apartments and made himself so remarked by his serious face and his deep sigh and looked at La Valliere with such a languishing expression that Malicorne said to Montalais during the evening To morrow And he went off to the painter s house in the street of the Jardins Saint Paul to request him to postpone the next sitting for a couple of days Saint Aignan was not within when La Valliere who was now quite familiar with the lower story lifted up the trap door and descended The king as usual was waiting for her on the staircase and held a bouquet in his hand as soon as he saw her he clasped her tenderly in his arms La Valliere much moved at the action looked around the room but as she saw the king was alone she did not complain of it They sat down the king reclining near the cushions on which Louise was seated with his head supported by her knees placed there as in an asylum whence no one could banish him he gazed ardently upon her and as if the moment had arrived when nothing could interpose between their two hearts she too gazed with similar passion upon him and from her eyes so softly pure emanated a flame whose rays first kindled and then inflamed the heart of the king who trembling with happiness as Louise s hand rested on his head grew giddy from excess of joy and momentarily awaited either the painter s or Saint Aignan s return to break the sweet illusion But the door remained closed and neither Saint Aignan nor the painter appeared nor did the hangings even move A deep mysterious silence reigned in the room a silence which seemed to influence even the song birds in their gilded prisons The king completely overcome turned round his head and buried his burning lips in La Valliere s hands who herself faint with excess of emotion pressed her trembling hands against her lover s lips Louis threw himself upon his knees and as La Valliere did not move her head the king s forehead being within reach of her lips she furtively passed her lips across the perfumed locks which caressed her cheeks The king seized her in his arms and unable to resist the temptation they exchanged their first kiss that burning kiss which changes love into delirium Suddenly a noise upon the upper floor was heard which had in fact continued though it had remained unnoticed for some time it had at last aroused La Valliere s attention though but slowly so As the noise however continued as it forced itself upon the attention and recalled the poor girl from her dreams of happiness to the sad realities of life she rose in a state of utter bewilderment though beautiful in her disorder saying Some one is waiting for me above Louis Louis do you not hear Well and am I not waiting for you also said the king with infinite tenderness of tone Let others henceforth wait for you But she gently shook her head as she replied Happiness hidden power concealed my pride should be as silent as my heart The noise was again resumed I hear Montalais s voice she said and she hurried up the staircase the king followed her unable to let her leave his sight and covering her hand with his kisses Yes yes repeated La Valliere who had passed half way through the opening Yes it is Montalais who is calling me something important must have happened Go then dearest love said the king but return quickly No no not to day sire Adieu adieu she said as she stooped down once more to embrace her lover and escaped Montalais was in fact waiting for her very pale and agitated Quick quick he is coming she said Who who is coming Raoul murmured Montalais It is I I said a joyous voice upon the last steps of the grand staircase La Valliere uttered a terrible shriek and threw herself back I am here dear Louise said Raoul running towards her I knew but too well that you had not ceased to love me La Valliere with a gesture partly of extreme terror and partly as if invoking a blessing attempted to speak but could not articulate one word No no she said as she fell into Montalais s arms murmuring Do not touch me do not come near me Montalais made a sign to Raoul who stood almost petrified at the door and did not even attempt to advance another step into the room Then looking towards the side of the room where the screen was she exclaimed Imprudent girl she has not even closed the trap door And she advanced towards the corner of the room to close the screen and also behind the screen the trap door But suddenly the king who had heard Louise s exclamation darted through the opening and hurried forward to her assistance He threw himself on his knees before her as he overwhelmed Montalais with questions who hardly knew where she was At the moment however when the king threw himself on his knees a cry of utter despair rang through the corridor accompanied by the sound of retreating footsteps The king wished to see who had uttered the cry and whose were the footsteps he had heard and it was in vain that Montalais sought to retain him for Louis quitting his hold of La Valliere hurried towards the door too late however for Raoul was already at a distance and the king only beheld a shadow that quickly vanished in the silent corridor eight Chapter XL Two Old Friends Whilst every one at court was busily engaged with his own affairs a man mysteriously took up his post behind the Place de Greve in the house which we once saw besieged by D Artagnan on the occasion of the emeute The principal entrance of the house was in the Place Baudoyer it was tolerably large surrounded by gardens inclosed in the Rue Saint Jean by the shops of toolmakers which protected it from prying looks and was walled in by a triple rampart of stone noise and verdure like an embalmed mummy in its triple coffin The man we have just alluded to walked along with a firm step although he was no longer in his early prime His dark cloak and long sword plainly revealed one who seemed in search of adventures and judging from his curling mustache his fine smooth skin which could be seen beneath his sombrero it would not have been difficult to pronounce that gallantry had not a little share in his adventures In fact hardly had the cavalier entered the house when the clock struck eight and ten minutes afterwards a lady followed by a servant armed to the teeth approached and knocked at the same door which an old woman immediately opened for her The lady raised her veil as she entered though no longer beautiful or young she was still active and of an imposing carriage She concealed beneath a rich toilette and the most exquisite taste an age which Ninon de l Enclos alone could have smiled at with impunity Hardly had she reached the vestibule when the cavalier whose features we have only roughly sketched advanced towards her holding out his hand Good day my dear duchesse he said How do you do my dear Aramis replied the duchesse He led her to a most elegantly furnished apartment on whose high windows were reflected the expiring rays of the setting sun which filtered gaudily through the dark green needles of the adjacent firs They sat down side by side Neither of them thought of asking for additional light in the room and they buried themselves as it were in the shadow as if they wished to bury themselves in forgetfulness Chevalier said the duchesse you have never given me a single sign of life since our interview at Fontainebleau and I confess that your presence there on the day of the Franciscan s death and your initiation in certain secrets caused me the liveliest astonishment I ever experienced in my whole life I can explain my presence there to you as well as my initiation said Aramis But let us first of all said the duchess talk a little of ourselves for our friendship is by no means of recent date Yes madame and if Heaven wills it we shall continue to be friends I will not say for a long time but forever That is quite certain chevalier and my visit is a proof of it Our interests duchess are no longer the same as they used to be said Aramis smiling without apprehension in the growing gloom by which the room was overcast for it could not reveal that his smile was less agreeable and not so bright as formerly No chevalier at the present day we have other interests Every period of life brings its own and as we now understand each other in conversing as perfectly as we formerly did without saying a word let us talk if you like I am at your orders duchesse Ah I beg your pardon how did you obtain my address and what was your object You ask me why I have told you Curiosity in the first place I wished to know what you could have to do with the Franciscan with whom I had certain business transactions and who died so singularly You know that on the occasion of our interview at Fontainebleau in the cemetery at the foot of the grave so recently closed we were both so much overcome by our emotions that we omitted to confide to each other what we may have to say Yes madame Well then I had no sooner left you than I repented and have ever since been most anxious to ascertain the truth You know that Madame de Longueville and myself are almost one I suppose I was not aware said Aramis discreetly I remembered therefore continued the duchesse that neither of us said anything to the other in the cemetery that you did not speak of the relationship in which you stood to the Franciscan whose burial you superintended and that I did not refer to the position in which I stood to him all which seemed very unworthy of two such old friends as ourselves and I have sought an opportunity of an interview with you in order to give you some information that I have recently acquired and to assure you that Marie Michon now no more has left behind her one who has preserved her recollection of events Aramis bowed over the duchess s hand and pressed his lips upon it You must have had some trouble to find me again he said Yes she answered annoyed to find the subject taking a turn which Aramis wished to give it but I knew you were a friend of M Fouquet s and so I inquired in that direction A friend oh exclaimed the chevalier I can hardly pretend to be that A poor priest who has been favored by a generous protector and whose heart is full of gratitude and devotion is all that I pretend to be to M Fouquet He made you a bishop Yes duchesse A very good retiring pension for so handsome a musketeer Yes in the same way that political intrigue is for yourself thought Aramis And so he added you inquired after me at M Fouquet s Easily enough You had been to Fontainebleau with him and had undertaken a voyage to your diocese which is Belle Ile en Mer I believe No madame said Aramis My diocese is Vannes I meant that I only thought that Belle Ile en Mer Is a property belonging to M Fouquet nothing more Ah I had been told that Belle Isle was fortified besides I know how great the military knowledge is you possess I have forgotten everything of the kind since I entered the Church said Aramis annoyed Suffice it to know that I learned you had returned from Vannes and I sent off to one of our friends M le Comte de la Fere who is discretion itself in order to ascertain it but he answered that he was not aware of your address So like Athos thought the bishop the really good man never changes Well then you know that I cannot venture to show myself here and that the queen mother has always some grievance or other against me Yes indeed and I am surprised at it Oh there are various reasons for it But to continue being obliged to conceal myself I was fortunate enough to meet with M d Artagnan who was formerly one of your old friends I believe A friend of mine still duchesse He gave me certain information and sent me to M Baisemeaux the governor of the Bastile Aramis was somewhat agitated at this remark and a light flashed from his eyes in the darkness of the room which he could not conceal from his keen sighted friend M de Baisemeaux he said why did D Artagnan send you to M de Baisemeaux I cannot tell you What can this possibly mean said the bishop summoning all the resources of his mind to his aid in order to carry on the combat in a befitting manner M de Baisemeaux is greatly indebted to you D Artagnan told me True he is so And the address of a creditor is as easily ascertained as that of a debtor Very true and so Baisemeaux indicated to you Saint Mande where I forwarded a letter to you Which I have in my hand and which is most precious to me said Aramis because I am indebted to it for the pleasure of seeing you here The duchesse satisfied at having successfully overcome the various difficulties of so delicate an explanation began to breathe freely again which Aramis however could not succeed in doing We had got as far as your visit to M Baisemeaux I believe Nay she said laughing farther than that In that case we must have been speaking about the grudge you have against the queen mother Further still she returned further still we were talking of the connection Which existed between you and the Franciscan said Aramis interrupting her eagerly well I am listening to you very attentively It is easily explained returned the duchesse You know that I am living at Brussels with M de Laicques I heard so You know that my children have ruined and stripped me of everything How terrible dear duchesse Terrible indeed this obliged me to resort to some means of obtaining a livelihood and particularly to avoid vegetating for the remainder of my existence I had old hatreds to turn to account old friendships to make use of I no longer had either credit or protectors You who had extended protection towards so many persons said Aramis softly It is always the case chevalier Well at the present time I am in the habit of seeing the king of Spain very frequently Ah Who has just nominated a general of the Jesuits according to the usual custom Is it usual indeed Were you not aware of it I beg your pardon I was inattentive You must be aware of that you who were on such good terms with the Franciscan With the general of the Jesuits you mean Exactly Well then I have seen the king of Spain who wished to do me a service but was unable He gave me recommendations however to Flanders both for myself and for Laicques too and conferred a pension on me out of the funds belonging to the order Of Jesuits Yes The general I mean the Franciscan was sent to me and for the purpose of conforming with the requisitions of the statues of the order and of entitling me to the pension I was reputed to be in a position to render certain services You are aware that that is the rule No I did not know it said Aramis Madame de Chevreuse paused to look at Aramis but it was perfectly dark Well such is the rule however she resumed I had therefore to appear to possess a power of usefulness of some kind or other and I proposed to travel for the order and I was placed on the list of affiliated travelers You understand it was a formality by means of which I received my pension which was very convenient for me Good heavens duchesse what you tell me is like a dagger thrust You obliged to receive a pension from the Jesuits No chevalier from Spain Except for a conscientious scruple duchesse you will admit that it is pretty nearly the same thing No not at all But surely of your magnificent fortune there must remain Dampierre is all that remains And that is handsome enough Yes but Dampierre is burdened mortgaged and almost fallen to ruin like its owner And can the queen mother know and see all that without shedding a tear said Aramis with a penetrating look which encountered nothing but darkness Yes She has forgotten everything You I believe attempted to get restored to favor Yes but most singularly the young king inherits the antipathy his dear father had for me You will perhaps tell me that I am indeed a woman to be hated and that I am no longer one who can be loved Dear duchesse pray come quickly to the cause that brought you here for I think we can be of service to each other Such has been my own thought I came to Fontainebleau with a double object in view In the first place I was summoned there by the Franciscan whom you knew By the by how did you know him for I have told you my story and have not yet heard yours I knew him in a very natural way duchesse I studied theology with him at Parma We became fast friends and it happened from time to time that business or travel or war separated us from each other You were of course aware that he was the general of the Jesuits I suspected it But by what extraordinary chance did it happen that you were at the hotel when the affiliated travelers met together Oh said Aramis in a calm voice it was the merest chance in the world I was going to Fontainebleau to see M Fouquet for the purpose of obtaining an audience of the king I was passing by unknown I saw the poor dying monk in the road and recognized him immediately You know the rest he died in my arms Yes but bequeathing to you so vast a power that you issue your sovereign orders and directions like a monarch He certainly did leave me a few commissions to settle And what for me I have told you a sum of twelve thousand livres was to be paid to you I thought I had given you the necessary signature to enable you to receive it Did you not get the money Oh yes yes You give your orders I am informed with so much mystery and such a majestic presence that it is generally believed you are the successor of the defunct chief Aramis colored impatiently and the duchesse continued I have obtained my information she said from the king of Spain himself and he cleared up some of my doubts on the point Every general of the Jesuits is nominated by him and must be a Spaniard according to the statutes of the order You are not a Spaniard nor have you been nominated by the king of Spain Aramis did not reply to this remark except to say You see duchesse how greatly you were mistaken since the king of Spain told you that Yes my dear Aramis but there was something else which I have been thinking of What is that You know I believe something about most things and it occurred to me that you know the Spanish language Every Frenchman who has been actively engaged in the Fronde knows Spanish You have lived in Flanders Three years And have stayed at Madrid Fifteen months You are in a position then to become a naturalized Spaniard when you like Really said Aramis with a frankness which deceived the duchesse Undoubtedly Two years residence and an acquaintance with the language are indispensable You have upwards of four years more than double the time necessary What are you driving at duchesse At this I am on good terms with the king of Spain And I am not on bad terms thought Aramis to himself Shall I ask the king continued the duchesse to confer the succession to the Franciscan s post upon you Oh duchesse You have it already perhaps she said No upon my honor Very well then I can render you that service Why did you not render the same service to M de Laicques duchesse He is a very talented man and one you love besides Yes no doubt but at all events putting Laicques aside will you have it No I thank you duchesse She paused He is nominated she thought and then resumed aloud If you refuse me in this manner it is not very encouraging for me supposing I should have something to ask of you Oh ask pray ask Ask I cannot do so if you have not the power to grant what I want However limited my power and ability ask all the same I need a sum of money to restore Dampierre Ah replied Aramis coldly money Well duchesse how much would you require Oh a tolerably round sum So much the worse you know I am not rich No no but the order is and if you had been the general You know I am not the general I think In that case you have a friend who must be very wealthy M Fouquet M Fouquet He is more than half ruined madame So it is said but I did not believe it Why duchesse Because I have or rather Laicques has certain letters in his possession from Cardinal Mazarin which establish the existence of very strange accounts What accounts Relative to various sums of money borrowed and disposed of I cannot very distinctly remember what they are but they establish the fact that the superintendent according to these letters which are signed by Mazarin had taken thirteen millions of francs from the coffers of the state The case is a very serious one Aramis clenched his hands in anxiety and apprehension Is it possible he said that you have such letters as you speak of and have not communicated them to M Fouquet Ah replied the duchesse I keep such trifling matters as these in reserve The day may come when they will be of service and they can be withdrawn from the safe custody in which they now remain And that day has arrived said Aramis Yes And you are going to show those letters to M Fouquet I prefer to talk about them with you instead You must be in sad want of money my poor friend to think of such things as these you too who held M de Mazarin s prose effusions in such indifferent esteem The fact is I am in want of money And then continued Aramis in cold accents it must have been very distressing to you to be obliged to have recourse to such a means It is cruel Oh if had wished to do harm instead of good said Madame de Chevreuse instead of asking the general of the order or M Fouquet for the five hundred thousand francs I require I Five hundred thousand francs Yes no more Do you think it much I require at least as much as that to restore Dampierre Yes madame I say therefore that instead of asking for this amount I should have gone to see my old friend the queen mother the letters from her husband Signor Mazarini would have served me as an introduction and I should have begged this mere trifle of her saying to her I wish madame to have the honor of receiving you at Dampierre Permit me to put Dampierre in a fit state for that purpose Aramis did not return a single word Well she said what are you thinking about I am making certain additions said Aramis And M Fouquet subtractions I on the other hand am trying my hand at the art of multiplication What excellent calculators we all three are How well we might understand one another Will you allow me to reflect said Aramis No for with such an opening between people like ourselves yes or no is the only answer and that an immediate one It is a snare thought the bishop it is impossible that Anne of Austria would listen to such a woman as this Well said the duchesse Well madame I should be very much astonished if M Fouquet had five hundred thousand francs at his disposal at the present moment It is no use speaking of it then said the duchesse and Dampierre must get restored how best it may Oh you are not embarrassed to such an extent as that I suppose No I am never embarrassed And the queen continued the bishop will certainly do for you what the superintendent is unable to do Oh certainly But tell me do you think it would be better that I should speak myself to M Fouquet about these letters Nay duchesse you will do precisely whatever you please in that respect M Fouquet either feels or does not feel himself to be guilty if he really be so I know he is proud enough not to confess it if he be not so he will be exceedingly offended at your menace As usual you reason like an angel said the duchesse as she rose from her seat And so you are now going to denounce M Fouquet to the queen said Aramis Denounce Oh what a disagreeable word I shall not denounce my dear friend you know matters of policy too well to be ignorant how easily these affairs are arranged I shall merely side against M Fouquet and nothing more and in a war of party against party a weapon is always a weapon No doubt And once on friendly terms again with the queen mother I may be dangerous towards some persons You are at liberty to prove so duchesse A liberty of which I shall avail myself You are not ignorant I suppose duchesse that M Fouquet is on the best terms with the king of Spain I suppose so If therefore you begin a party warfare against M Fouquet he will reply in the same way for he too is at perfect liberty to do so is he not Oh certainly And as he is on good terms with Spain he will make use of that friendship as a weapon of attack You mean that he is naturally on good terms with the general of the order of the Jesuits my dear Aramis That may be the case duchesse And that consequently the pension I have been receiving from the order will be stopped I am greatly afraid it might be Well I must contrive to console myself in the best way I can for after Richelieu after the Fronde after exile what is there left for Madame de Chevreuse to be afraid of The pension you are aware is forty eight thousand francs Alas I am quite aware of it Moreover in party contests you know the friends of one s enemy do not escape Ah you mean that poor Laicques will have to suffer I am afraid it is almost inevitable duchesse Oh he only receives twelve thousand francs pension Yes but the king of Spain has some influence left advised by M Fouquet he might get M Laicques shut up in prison for a little while I am not very nervous on that point my dear friend because once reconciled with Anne of Austria I will undertake that France would insist upon M Laicques s liberation True In that case you will have something else to apprehend What can that be said the duchesse pretending to be surprised and terrified You will learn indeed you must know it already that having once been an affiliated member of the order it is not easy to leave it for the secrets that any particular member may have acquired are unwholesome and carry with them the germs of misfortune for whosoever may reveal them The duchesse paused and reflected for a moment and then said That is more serious I will think it over And notwithstanding the profound obscurity Aramis seemed to feel a basilisk glance like a white hot iron escape from his friend s eyes and plunge into his heart Let us recapitulate said Aramis determined to keep himself on his guard and gliding his hand into his breast where he had a dagger concealed Exactly let us recapitulate short accounts make long friends The suppression of your pension Forty eight thousand francs and that of Laicques s twelve make together sixty thousand francs that is what you mean I suppose Precisely and I was trying to find out what would be your equivalent for that Five hundred thousand francs which I shall get from the queen Or which you will not get I know a means of procuring them said the duchesse thoughtlessly This remark made the chevalier prick up his ears and from the moment his adversary had committed this error his mind was so thoroughly on its guard that he seemed every moment to gain the advantage more and more and she consequently to lose it I will admit for argument s sake that you obtain the money he resumed you will lose twice as much having a hundred thousand francs pension to receive instead of sixty thousand and that for a period of ten years Not so for I shall only be subjected to this reduction of my income during the period of M Fouquet s remaining in power a period which I estimate at two months Ah said Aramis I am frank you see I thank you for it duchesse but you would be wrong to suppose that after M Fouquet s disgrace the order would resume the payment of your pension I know a means of making the order pay as I know a means of forcing the queen mother to concede what I require In that case duchesse we are all obliged to strike our flags to you The victory is yours and the triumph also Be clement I entreat you But is it possible resumed the duchesse without taking notice of the irony that you really draw back from a miserable sum of five hundred thousand francs when it is a question of sparing you I mean your friend I beg your pardon I ought rather to say your protector the disagreeable consequences which a party contest produces Duchesse I tell you why supposing the five hundred thousand francs were to be given you M Laicques will require his share which will be another five hundred thousand francs I presume and then after M de Laicques s and your own portions have been arranged the portions which your children your poor pensioners and various other persons will require will start up as fresh claims and these letters however compromising they may be in their nature are not worth from three to four millions Can you have forgotten the queen of France s diamonds they were surely worth more than these bits of waste paper signed by Mazarin and yet their recovery did not cost a fourth part of what you ask for yourself Yes that is true but the merchant values his goods at his own price and it is for the purchaser to buy or refuse Stay a moment duchesse would you like me to tell you why I will not buy your letters Pray tell me Because the letters you claim to be Mazarin s are false What an absurdity I have no doubt of it for it would to say the least be very singular that after you had quarreled with the queen through M Mazarin s means you should have kept up any intimate acquaintance with the latter it would look as if you had been acting as a spy and upon my word I do not like to make use of the word Oh pray do You great complacence would seem suspicions at all events That is quite true but the contents of the letters are even more so I pledge you my word duchesse that you will not be able to make use of it with the queen Oh yes indeed I can make use of everything with the queen Very good thought Aramis Croak on old owl hiss beldame viper But the duchesse had said enough and advanced a few steps towards the door Aramis however had reserved one exposure which she did not expect He rang the bell candles immediately appeared in the adjoining room and the bishop found himself completely encircled by lights which shone upon the worn haggard face of the duchesse revealing every feature but too clearly Aramis fixed a long ironical look upon her pale thin withered cheeks her dim dull eyes and upon her lips which she kept carefully closed over her discolored scanty teeth He however had thrown himself into a graceful attitude with his haughty and intelligent head thrown back he smiled so as to reveal teeth still brilliant and dazzling The antiquated coquette understood the trick that had been played her She was standing immediately before a large mirror in which her decrepitude so carefully concealed was only made more manifest And thereupon without even saluting Aramis who bowed with the ease and grace of the musketeer of early days she hurried away with trembling steps which her very precipitation only the more impeded Aramis sprang across the room like a zephyr to lead her to the door Madame de Chevreuse made a sign to her servant who resumed his musket and she left the house where such tender friends had not been able to understand each other only because they had understood each other too well Chapter XLI Wherein May Be Seen that a Bargain Which Cannot Be Made with One Person Can Be Carried Out with Another Aramis had been perfectly correct in his supposition for hardly had she left the house in the Place Baudoyer than Madame de Chevreuse proceeded homeward She was doubtless afraid of being followed and by this means thought she might succeed in throwing those who might be following her off their guard but scarcely had she arrived within the door of the hotel and hardly had assured herself that no one who could cause her any uneasiness was on her track when she opened the door of the garden leading into another street and hurried towards the Rue Croix des Petits Champs where M Colbert resided We have already said that evening or rather night had closed in it was a dark thick night besides Paris had once more sunk into its calm quiescent state enshrouding alike within its indulgent mantle the high born duchesse carrying out her political intrigue and the simple citizen s wife who having been detained late by a supper in the city was making her way slowly homewards hanging on the arm of a lover by the shortest possible route Madame de Chevreuse had been too well accustomed to nocturnal political intrigues to be ignorant that a minister never denies himself even at his own private residence to any young and beautiful woman who may chance to object to the dust and confusion of a public office or to old women as full of experience as of years who dislike the indiscreet echo of official residences A valet received the duchesse under the peristyle and received her it must be admitted with some indifference of manner he intimated after having looked at her face that it was hardly at such an hour that one so advanced in years as herself could be permitted to disturb Monsieur Colbert s important occupations But Madame de Chevreuse without looking or appearing to be annoyed wrote her name upon a leaf of her tablets a name which had but too frequently sounded so disagreeably in the ears of Louis XIII and of the great cardinal She wrote her name in the large ill formed characters of the higher classes of that period handed it to the valet without uttering a word but with so haughty and imperious a gesture that the fellow well accustomed to judge of people from their manners and appearance perceived at once the quality of the person before him bowed his head and ran to M Colbert s room The minister could not control a sudden exclamation as he opened the paper and the valet gathering from it the interest with which his master regarded the mysterious visitor returned as fast as he could to beg the duchesse to follow him She ascended to the first floor of the beautiful new house very slowly rested herself on the landing place in order not to enter the apartment out of breath and appeared before M Colbert who with his own hands held both the folding doors open The duchesse paused at the threshold for the purpose of well studying the character of the man with whom she was about to converse At the first glance the round large heavy head thick brows and ill favored features of Colbert who wore thrust low down on his head a cap like a priest s calotte seemed to indicate that but little difficulty was likely to be met with in her negotiations with him but also that she was to expect as little interest in the discussion of particulars for there was scarcely any indication that the rough and uncouth nature of the man was susceptible to the impulses of a refined revenge or of an exalted ambition But when on closer inspection the duchesse perceived the small piercingly black eyes the longitudinal wrinkles of his high and massive forehead the imperceptible twitching of the lips on which were apparent traces of rough good humor Madame de Chevreuse altered her opinion of him and felt she could say to herself I have found the man I want What is the subject madame which procures me the honor of a visit from you he inquired The need I have of you monsieur returned the duchesse as well as that which you have of me I am delighted madame with the first portion of your sentence but as far as the second portion is concerned Madame de Chevreuse sat down in the armchair which M Colbert advanced towards her Monsieur Colbert you are the intendant of finances and are ambitious of becoming the superintendent Madame Nay do not deny it that would only unnecessarily prolong our conversation and that is useless And yet madame however well disposed and inclined to show politeness I may be towards a lady of your position and merit nothing will make me confess that I have ever entertained the idea of supplanting my superior I said nothing about supplanting Monsieur Colbert Could I accidentally have made use of that word I hardly think that likely The word replace is less aggressive in its signification and more grammatically suitable as M de Voiture would say I presume therefore that you are ambitious of replacing M Fouquet M Fouquet s fortune madame enables him to withstand all attempts The superintendent in this age plays the part of the Colossus of Rhodes the vessels pass beneath him and do not overthrow him I ought to have availed myself precisely of that very comparison It is true M Fouquet plays the part of the Colossus of Rhodes but I remember to have heard it said by M Conrart a member of the academy I believe that when the Colossus of Rhodes fell from its lofty position the merchant who had cast it down a merchant nothing more M Colbert loaded four hundred camels with the ruins A merchant and that is considerably less than an intendant of finances Madame I can assure you that I shall never overthrow M Fouquet Very good Monsieur Colbert since you persist in showing so much sensitiveness with me as if you were ignorant that I am Madame de Chevreuse and also that I am somewhat advanced in years in other words that you have to do with a woman who has had political dealings with the Cardinal Richelieu and who has no time to lose as I repeat you do not hesitate to commit such an imprudence I shall go and find others who are more intelligent and more desirous of making their fortunes How madame how You give me a very poor idea of negotiations of the present day I assure you that if in my earlier days a woman had gone to M de Cinq Mars who was not moreover a man of a very high order of intellect and had said to him about the cardinal what I have just said to you of M Fouquet M de Cinq Mars would by this time have already set actively to work Nay madame show a little indulgence I entreat you Well then do you really consent to replace M Fouquet Certainly I do if the king dismisses M Fouquet Again a word too much it is quite evident that if you have not yet succeeded in driving M Fouquet from his post it is because you have not been able to do so Therefore I should be the greatest simpleton possible if in coming to you I did not bring the very thing you require I am distressed to be obliged to persist madame said Colbert after a silence which enabled the duchesse to sound the depths of his dissimulation but I must warn you that for the last six years denunciation after denunciation has been made against M Fouquet and he has remained unshaken and unaffected by them There is a time for everything Monsieur Colbert those who were the authors of those denunciations were not called Madame de Chevreuse and they had no proofs equal to the six letters from M de Mazarin which establish the offense in question The offense The crime if you like it better The crime committed by M Fouquet Nothing less It is rather strange M Colbert but your face which just now was cold and indifferent is now positively the very reverse A crime I am delighted to see that it makes an impression upon you It is because that word madame embraces so many things It embraces the post of superintendent of finance for yourself and a letter of exile or the Bastile for M Fouquet Forgive me madame la duchesse but it is almost impossible that M Fouquet can be exiled to be imprisoned or disgraced that is already a great deal Oh I am perfectly aware of what I am saying returned Madame de Chevreuse coldly I do not live at such a distance from Paris as not to know what takes place there The king does not like M Fouquet and he would willingly sacrifice M Fouquet if an opportunity were only given him It must be a good one though Good enough and one I estimate to be worth five hundred thousand francs In what way said Colbert I mean monsieur that holding this opportunity in my own hands I will not allow it to be transferred to yours except for a sum of five hundred thousand francs I understand you perfectly madame But since you have fixed a price for the sale let me now see the value of the articles to be sold Oh a mere trifle six letters as I have already told you from M de Mazarin and the autographs will most assuredly not be regarded as too highly priced if they establish in an irrefutable manner that M Fouquet has embezzled large sums of money from the treasury and appropriated them to his own purposes In an irrefutable manner do you say observed Colbert whose eyes sparkled with delight Perfectly so would you like to read the letters With all my heart Copies of course Of course the copies said the duchesse as she drew from her bosom a small packet of papers flattened by her velvet bodice Read she said Colbert eagerly snatched the papers and devoured them Excellent he said It is clear enough is it not Yes madame yes M Mazarin must have handed the money to M Fouquet who must have kept it for his own purposes but the question is what money Exactly what money if we come to terms I will join to these six letters a seventh which will supply you with the fullest particulars Colbert reflected And the originals of these letters A useless question to ask exactly as if I were to ask you Monsieur Colbert whether the money bags you will give me will be full or empty Very good madame Is it concluded No for there is one circumstance to which neither of us has given any attention Name it M Fouquet can be utterly ruined under the legal circumstances you have detailed only by means of legal proceedings Well A public scandal for instance and yet neither the legal proceedings nor the scandal can be commenced against him Why not Because he is procureur general of the parliament because too in France all public administrators the army justice itself and commerce are intimately connected by ties of good fellowship which people call esprit de corps In such a case madame the parliament will never permit its chief to be dragged before a public tribunal and never even if he be dragged there by royal authority never I say will he be condemned Well Monsieur Colbert I do not see what I have to do with that I am aware of that madame but I have to do with it and it consequently diminishes the value of what you have brought to show me What good can a proof of a crime be to me without the possibility of obtaining a condemnation Even if he be only suspected M Fouquet will lose his post of superintendent Is that all exclaimed Colbert whose dark gloomy features were momentarily lighted up by an expression of hate and vengeance Ah ah Monsieur Colbert said the duchesse forgive me but I did not think you were so impressionable Very good in that case since you need more than I have to give you there is no occasion to speak of the matter at all Yes madame we will go on talking of it only as the value of your commodities had decreased you must lower your pretensions You are bargaining then Every man who wishes to deal loyally is obliged to do so How much will you offer me Two hundred thousand francs said Colbert The duchesse laughed in his face and then said suddenly Wait a moment I have another arrangement to propose will you give me three hundred thousand francs No no Oh you can either accept or refuse my terms besides that is not all More still you are becoming too impracticable to deal with madame Less so than you think perhaps for it is not money I am going to ask you for What is it then A service you know that I have always been most affectionately attached to the queen and I am desirous of having an interview with her majesty With the queen Yes Monsieur Colbert with the queen who is I admit no longer my friend and who has ceased to be so for a long time past but who may again become so if the opportunity be only given her Her majesty has ceased to receive any one madame She is a great sufferer and you may be aware that the paroxysms of her disease occur with greater frequency than ever That is the very reason why I wish to have an interview with her majesty for in Flanders there is a great variety of these kinds of complaints What cancers a fearful incurable disorder Do not believe that Monsieur Colbert The Flemish peasant is somewhat a man of nature and his companion for life is not alone a wife but a female laborer also for while he is smoking his pipe the woman works it is she who draws the water from the well she who loads the mule or the ass and even bears herself a portion of the burden Taking but little care of herself she gets knocked about first in one direction and then in another and very often is beaten by her husband and cancers frequently rise from contusions True true said Colbert The Flemish women do not die the sooner on that account When they are great sufferers from this disease they go in search of remedies and the Beguines of Bruges are excellent doctors for every kind of disease They have precious waters of one sort or another specifics of various kinds and they give a bottle of it and a wax candle to the sufferer whereby the priests are gainers and Heaven is served by the disposal of both their wares I will take the queen some of this holy water which I will procure from the Beguines of Bruges her majesty will recover and will burn as many wax candles as she may see fit You see Monsieur Colbert to prevent my seeing the queen is almost as bad as committing the crime of regicide You are undoubtedly madame la duchesse a woman of exceedingly great abilities and I am more than astounded at their display still I cannot but suppose that this charitable consideration towards the queen in some measure covers a slight personal interest for yourself I have not given myself the trouble to conceal it that I am aware of Monsieur Colbert You said I believe that I had a slight personal interest On the contrary it is a very great interest and I will prove it to you by resuming what I was saying If you procure me a personal interview with her majesty I will be satisfied with the three hundred thousand francs I have claimed if not I shall keep my letters unless indeed you give me on the spot five hundred thousand francs And rising from her seat with this decisive remark the old duchesse plunged M Colbert into a disagreeable perplexity To bargain any further was out of the question and not to bargain was to pay a great deal too dearly for them Madame he said I shall have the pleasure of handing over a hundred thousand crowns but how shall I get the actual letters themselves In the simplest manner in the world my dear Monsieur Colbert whom will you trust The financier began to laugh silently so that his large eyebrows went up and down like the wings of a bat upon the deep lines of his yellow forehead No one he said You surely will make an exception in your own favor Monsieur Colbert In what way madame I mean that if you would take the trouble to accompany me to the place where the letters are they would be delivered into your own hands and you would be able to verify and check them Quite true You would bring the hundred thousand crowns with you at the same time for I too do not trust any one Colbert colored to the tips of his ears Like all eminent men in the art of figures he was of an insolent and mathematical probity I will take with me madame he said two orders for the amount agreed upon payable at my treasury Will that satisfy you Would that the orders on your treasury were for two millions monsieur l intendant I shall have the pleasure of showing you the way then Allow me to order my carriage I have a carriage below monsieur Colbert coughed like an irresolute man He imagined for a moment that the proposition of the duchesse was a snare that perhaps some one was waiting at the door and that she whose secret had just been sold to Colbert for a hundred thousand crowns had already offered it to Fouquet for the same sum As he still hesitated the duchesse looked at him full in the face You prefer your own carriage she said I admit I do You suppose I am going to lead you into a snare or trap of some sort or other Madame la duchesse you have the character of being somewhat inconsiderate at times as I am reputed a sober solemn character a jest or practical joke might compromise me Yes the fact is you are afraid Well then take your own carriage as many servants as you like only think well of what I am going to say What we two may arrange between ourselves we are the only persons who will know if a third person is present we might as well tell the whole world about it After all I do not make a point of it my carriage shall follow yours and I shall be satisfied to accompany you in your own carriage to the queen To the queen Have you forgotten that already Is it possible that one of the clauses of the agreement of so much importance to me can have escaped you so soon How trifling it seems to you indeed if I had known it I should have asked double what I have done I have reflected madame and I shall not accompany you Really and why not Because I have the most perfect confidence in you You overpower me But provided I receive the hundred thousand crowns Here they are madame said Colbert scribbling a few lines on a piece of paper which he handed to the duchesse adding You are paid The trait is a fine one Monsieur Colbert and I will reward you for it she said beginning to laugh Madame de Chevreuse s laugh was a very sinister sound a man with youth faith love life itself throbbing in his heart would prefer a sob to such a lamentable laugh The duchesse opened the front of her dress and drew forth from her bosom somewhat less white than it once had been a small packet of papers tied with a flame colored ribbon and still laughing she said There Monsieur Colbert are the originals of Cardinal Mazarin s letters they are now your own property she added refastening the body of her dress your fortune is secured And now accompany me to the queen No madame if you are again about to run the chance of her majesty s displeasure and it were known at the Palais Royal that I had been the means of introducing you there the queen would never forgive me while she lived No there are certain persons at the palace who are devoted to me who will procure you an admission without my being compromised Just as you please provided I enter What do you term those religious women at Bruges who cure disorders Beguines Good are you one As you please but I must soon cease to be one That is your affair Excuse me but I do not wish to be exposed to a refusal That is again your own affair madame I am going to give directions to the head valet of the gentleman in waiting on the queen to allow admission to a Beguine who brings an effectual remedy for her majesty s sufferings You are the bearer of my letter you will undertake to be provided with the remedy and will give every explanation on the subject I admit a knowledge of a Beguine but I deny all knowledge of Madame de Chevreuse Here madame then is your letter of introduction Chapter XLII The Skin of the Bear Colbert handed the duchesse the letter and gently drew aside the chair behind which she was standing Madame de Chevreuse with a very slight bow immediately left the room Colbert who had recognized Mazarin s handwriting and had counted the letters rang to summon his secretary whom he enjoined to go in immediate search of M Vanel a counselor of the parliament The secretary replied that according to his usual practice M Vanel had just that moment entered the house in order to give the intendant an account of the principal details of the business which had been transacted during the day in parliament Colbert approached one of the lamps read the letters of the deceased cardinal over again smiled repeatedly as he recognized the great value of the papers Madame de Chevreuse had just delivered and burying his head in his hands for a few minutes reflected profoundly In the meantime a tall loosely made man entered the room his spare thin face steady look and hooked nose as he entered Colbert s cabinet with a modest assurance of manner revealed a character at once supple and decided supple towards the master who could throw him the prey firm towards the dogs who might possibly be disposed to dispute its possession M Vanel carried a voluminous bundle of papers under his arm and placed it on the desk on which Colbert was leaning both his elbows as he supported his head Good day M Vanel said the latter rousing himself from his meditation Good day monseigneur said Vanel naturally You should say monsieur and not monseigneur replied Colbert gently We give the title of monseigneur to ministers returned Vanel with extreme self possession and you are a minister Not yet You are so in point of fact and I call you monseigneur accordingly besides you are seigneur for me and that is sufficient if you dislike my calling you monseigneur before others allow me at least to call you so in private Colbert raised his head as if to read or try to read upon Vanel s face how much or how little sincerity entered into this protestation of devotion But the counselor knew perfectly well how to sustain the weight of such a look even backed with the full authority of the title he had conferred Colbert sighed he could not read anything in Vanel s face and Vanel might possibly be honest in his professions but Colbert recollected that this man inferior to himself in every other respect was actually his master in virtue of the fact of his having a wife As he was pitying this man s lot Vanel coldly drew from his pocket a perfumed letter sealed with Spanish wax and held it towards Colbert saying A letter from my wife monseigneur Colbert coughed took opened and read the letter and then put it carefully away in his pocket while Vanel turned over the leaves of the papers he had brought with him with an unmoved and unconcerned air Vanel he said suddenly to his protege you are a hard working man I know would twelve hours daily labor frighten you I work fifteen hours every day Impossible A counselor need not work more than three hours a day in parliament Oh I am working up some returns for a friend of mine in the department of accounts and as I still have spare time on my hands I am studying Hebrew Your reputation stands high in the parliament Vanel I believe so monseigneur You must not grow rusty in your post of counselor What must I do to avoid it Purchase a high place Mean and low ambitions are very difficult to satisfy Small purses are the most difficult ones to fill monseigneur What post have you in view said Colbert I see none not one There is one certainly but one need be almost the king himself to be able to buy it without inconvenience and the king will not be inclined I suppose to purchase the post of procureur general At these words Vanel fixed his peculiar humble dull look upon Colbert who could hardly tell whether Vanel comprehended him or not Why do you speak to me monseigneur said Vanel of the post of procureur general to the parliament I know no other post than the one M Fouquet fills Exactly so my dear counselor You are not over fastidious monseigneur but before the post can be bought it must be offered for sale I believe Monsieur Vanel that it will be for sale before long For sale What M Fouquet s post of procureur general So it is said The post which renders him so perfectly invincible for sale Ha ha said Vanel beginning to laugh Would you be afraid then of the post said Colbert gravely Afraid no but Are you desirous of obtaining it You are laughing at me monseigneur replied Vanel Is it likely that a counselor of the parliament would not be desirous of becoming procureur general Well Monsieur Vanel since I tell you that the post as report goes will be shortly for sale I cannot help repeating monseigneur that it is impossible a man never throws away the buckler behind which he maintains his honor his fortune his very life There are certain men mad enough Vanel to fancy themselves out of the reach of all mischances Yes monseigneur but such men never commit their mad acts for the advantage of the poor Vanels of the world Why not For the very reason that those Vanels are poor It is true that M Fouquet s post might cost a good round sum What would you bid for it Monsieur Vanel Everything I am worth Which means Three or four hundred thousand francs And the post is worth A million and a half at the very lowest I know persons who have offered one million seven hundred thousand francs without being able to persuade M Fouquet to sell Besides supposing it were to happen that M Fouquet wished to sell which I do not believe in spite of what I have been told Ah you have heard something about it then who told you M de Gourville M Pelisson and others Very good if therefore M Fouquet did wish to sell I could not buy it just yet since the superintendent will only sell for ready money and no one has a million and a half to put down at once Colbert suddenly interrupted the counselor by an imperious gesture he had begun to meditate Observing his superior s serious attitude and his perseverance in continuing the conversation on this subject Vanel awaited the solution without venturing to precipitate it Explain to me the privileges which this post confers The right of impeaching every French subject who is not a prince of the blood the right of quashing all proceedings taken against any Frenchman who is neither king nor prince The procureur general is the king s right hand to punish the guilty the office is the means whereby also he can evade the administration of justice M Fouquet therefore would be able by stirring up parliament to maintain himself even against the king and the king could as easily by humoring M Fouquet get his edicts registered in spite of every opposition and objection The procureur general can be made a very useful or a very dangerous instrument Vanel would you like to be procureur general said Colbert suddenly softening both his look and his voice I exclaimed the latter I have already had the honor to represent to you that I want about eleven hundred thousand francs to make up the amount Borrow that sum from your friends I have no friends richer than myself You are an honest and honorable man Vanel Ah monseigneur if the world would only think as you do I think so and that is quite enough and if it should be needed I will be your security Do not forget the proverb monseigneur What is it That he who becomes responsible for another has to pay for his fancy Let that make no difference Vanel rose bewildered by this offer which had been so suddenly and unexpectedly made to him You are not trifling with me monseigneur he said Stay you say that M Gourville has spoken to you about M Fouquet s post Yes and M Pelisson also Officially so or only through their own suggestion These were their very words The parliament members are as proud as they are wealthy they ought to club together two or three millions among themselves to present to their protector and leader M Fouquet And what did you reply I said that for my own part I would give ten thousand francs if necessary Ah you like M Fouquet then exclaimed Colbert with a look of hatred No but M Fouquet is our chief He is in debt is on the high road to ruin and we ought to save the honor of the body of which we are members Exactly and that explains why M Fouquet will be always safe and sound so long as he occupies his present post replied Colbert Thereupon said Vanel M Gourville added If we were to do anything out of charity to M Fouquet it could not be otherwise than most humiliating to him and he would be sure to refuse it Let the parliament subscribe among themselves to purchase in a proper manner the post of procureur general in that case all would go well the honor of our body would be saved and M Fouquet s pride spared That is an opening I considered it so monseigneur Well Monsieur Vanel you will go at once and find out either M Gourville or M Pelisson Do you know any other friend of M Fouquet I know M de la Fontaine very well La Fontaine the rhymester Yes he used to write verses to my wife when M Fouquet was one of our friends Go to him then and try and procure an interview with the superintendent Willingly but the sum itself On the day and hour you arrange to settle the matter Monsieur Vanel you shall be supplied with the money so do not make yourself uneasy on that account Monseigneur such munificence You eclipse kings even you surpass M Fouquet himself Stay a moment do not let us mistake each other I do not make you a present of fourteen hundred thousand francs Monsieur Vanel for I have children to provide for but I will lend you that sum Ask whatever interest whatever security you please monseigneur I am quite ready And when all your requisitions are satisfied I will still repeat that you surpass kings and M Fouquet in munificence What conditions do you impose The repayment in eight years and a mortgage upon the appointment itself Certainly Is that all Wait a moment I reserve to myself the right of purchasing the post from you at one hundred and fifty thousand francs profit for yourself if in your mode of filling the office you do not follow out a line of conduct in conformity with the interests of the king and with my projects Ah h said Vanel in an altered tone Is there anything in that which can possibly be objectionable to you Monsieur Vanel said Colbert coldly Oh no no replied Vanel nervously Very good We will sign an agreement to that effect whenever you like And now go as quickly as you can to M Fouquet s friend obtain an interview with the superintendent do not be too difficult in making whatever concessions may be required of you and when once the arrangements are all made I will press him to sign Be most careful to do nothing of the kind do not speak of signatures with M Fouquet nor of deeds nor even ask him to pass his word Understand this otherwise you will lose everything All you have to do is to get M Fouquet to give you his hand on the matter Go go Chapter XLIII An Interview with the Queen Mother The queen mother was in the bedroom at the Palais Royal with Madame de Motteville and Senora Molina King Louis who had been impatiently expected the whole day had not made his appearance and the queen who was growing impatient had often sent to inquire about him The moral atmosphere of the court seemed to indicate an approaching storm the courtiers and the ladies of the court avoided meeting in the ante chambers and the corridors in order not to converse on compromising subjects Monsieur had joined the king early in the morning for a hunting party Madame remained in her own apartment cool and distant to every one and the queen mother after she had said her prayers in Latin talked of domestic matters with her two friends in pure Castilian Madame de Motteville who understood the language perfectly answered her in French When the three ladies had exhausted every form of dissimulation and of politeness as a circuitous mode of expressing that the king s conduct was making the queen and the queen mother pine away through sheer grief and vexation and when in the most guarded and polished phrases they had fulminated every variety of imprecation against Mademoiselle de la Valliere the queen mother terminated her attack by an exclamation indicative of her own reflections and character Estos hijos said she to Molina which means These children words full of meaning on a mother s lips words full of terrible significance in the mouth of a queen who like Anne of Austria hid many curious secrets in her soul Yes said Molina children children for whom every mother becomes a sacrifice Yes replied the queen a mother sacrifices everything certainly She did not finish her phrase for she fancied when she raised her eyes towards the full length portrait of the pale Louis XIII that light once more flashed from her husband s dull eyes and his nostrils grew livid with wrath The portrait seemed animated by a living expression speak it did not but it seemed to threaten A profound silence succeeded the queen s last remark La Molina began to turn over ribbons and laces on a large work table Madame de Motteville surprised at the look of mutual intelligence which had been exchanged between the confidant and her mistress cast down her eyes like a discreet woman and pretending to be observant of nothing that was passing listened with the utmost attention to every word She heard nothing however but a very insignificant hum on the part of the Spanish duenna who was the incarnation of caution and a profound sigh on that of the queen She looked up immediately You are suffering she said No Motteville no why do you say that Your majesty almost groaned just now You are right I did sigh in truth Monsieur Valot is not far off I believe he is in Madame s apartment Why is he with Madame Madame is troubled with nervous attacks A very fine disorder indeed There is little good in M Valot being there when a very different physician would quickly cure Madame Madame de Motteville looked up with an air of great surprise as she replied Another doctor instead of M Valot whom do you mean Occupation Motteville occupation If any one is really ill it is my poor daughter And your majesty too Less so this evening though Do not believe that too confidently madame said De Motteville And as if to justify her caution a sharp acute pain seized the queen who turned deadly pale and threw herself back in the chair with every symptom of a sudden fainting fit Molina ran to a richly gilded tortoise shell cabinet from which she took a large rock crystal bottle of scented salts and held it to the queen s nostrils who inhaled it wildly for a few minutes and murmured It is hastening my death but Heaven s will be done Your majesty s death is not so near at hand added Molina replacing the smelling bottle in the cabinet Does your majesty feel better now inquired Madame de Motteville Much better returned the queen placing her finger on her lips to impose silence on her favorite It is very strange remarked Madame de Motteville after a pause What is strange said the queen Does your majesty remember the day when this pain attacked you for the first time I remember only that it was a grievously sad day for me Motteville But your majesty did not always regard that day as a sad one Why Because three and twenty years ago on that very day his present majesty your own glorious son was born at the very same hour The queen uttered a loud cry buried her face in her hands and seemed utterly prostrated for some minutes but whether from recollections which arose in her mind or from reflection or even with sheer pain was doubtful La Molina darted a look at Madame de Motteville so full of bitter reproach that the poor woman perfectly ignorant of its meaning was in her own exculpation on the point of asking an explanation when suddenly Anne of Austria arose and said Yes the fifth of September my sorrow began on the fifth of September The greatest joy one day the deepest sorrow the next the sorrow she added the bitter expiation of a too excessive joy And from that moment Anne of Austria whose memory and reason seemed to be suspended for the time remained impenetrable with vacant look mind almost wandering and hands hanging heavily down as if life had almost departed We must put her to bed said La Molina Presently Molina Let us leave the queen alone added the Spanish attendant Madame de Motteville rose large tears were rolling down the queen s pallid face and Molina having observed this sign of weakness fixed her black vigilant eyes upon her Yes yes replied the queen Leave us Motteville go The word us produced a disagreeable effect upon the ears of the French favorite for it signified that an interchange of secrets or of revelations of the past was about to be made and that one person was de trop in the conversation which seemed likely to take place Will Molina alone be sufficient for your majesty to night inquired the French woman Yes replied the queen Madame de Motteville bowed in submission and was about to withdraw when suddenly an old female attendant dressed as if she had belonged to the Spanish court of the year sixteen twenty opened the door and surprised the queen in her tears The remedy she cried delightedly to the queen as she unceremoniously approached the group What remedy said Anne of Austria For your majesty s sufferings the former replied Who brings it asked Madame de Motteville eagerly Monsieur Valot No a lady from Flanders From Flanders Is she Spanish inquired the queen I don t know Who sent her M Colbert Her name She did not mention it Her position in life She will answer that herself Who is she She is masked Go Molina go and see cried the queen It is needless suddenly replied a voice at once firm and gentle in its tone which proceeded from the other side of the tapestry hangings a voice which made the attendants start and the queen tremble excessively At the same moment a masked female appeared through the hangings and before the queen could speak a syllable she added I am connected with the order of the Beguines of Bruges and do indeed bring with me the remedy which is certain to effect a cure of your majesty s complaint No one uttered a sound and the Beguine did not move a step Speak said the queen I will when we are alone was the answer Anne of Austria looked at her attendants who immediately withdrew The Beguine thereupon advanced a few steps towards the queen and bowed reverently before her The queen gazed with increasing mistrust at this woman who in her turn fixed a pair of brilliant eyes upon her through her mask The queen of France must indeed be very ill said Anne of Austria if it is known at the Beguinage of Bruges that she stands in need of being cured Your majesty is not irremediably ill But tell me how you happen to know I am suffering Your majesty has friends in Flanders Since these friends then sent you mention their names Impossible madame since your majesty s memory has not been awakened by your heart Anne of Austria looked up endeavoring to discover through the mysterious mask and this ambiguous language the name of her companion who expressed herself with such familiarity and freedom then suddenly wearied by a curiosity which wounded every feeling of pride in her nature she said You are ignorant perhaps that royal personages are never spoken to with the face masked Deign to excuse me madame replied the Beguine humbly I cannot excuse you I may possibly forgive you if you throw your mask aside I have made a vow madame to attend and aid all afflicted and suffering persons without ever permitting them to behold my face I might have been able to administer some relief to your body and to your mind too but since your majesty forbids me I will take my leave Adieu madame adieu These words were uttered with a harmony of tone and respect of manner that disarmed the queen of all anger and suspicion but did not remove her feeling of curiosity You are right she said it ill becomes those who are suffering to reject the means of relief Heaven sends them Speak then and may you indeed be able as you assert to administer relief to my body Let us first speak a little of the mind if you please said the Beguine of the mind which I am sure must also suffer My mind There are cancers so insidious in their nature that their very pulsations cannot be felt Such cancers madame leave the ivory whiteness of the skin unblemished and putrefy not the firm fair flesh with their blue tints the physician who bends over the patient s chest hears not though he listens the insatiable teeth of the disease grinding onward through the muscles and the blood flows freely on the knife has never been able to destroy and rarely even temporarily to disarm the rage of these mortal scourges their home is in the mind which they corrupt they gnaw the whole heart until it breaks Such madame are the cancers fatal to queens are you too free from their scourge Anne slowly raised her arm dazzling in its perfect whiteness and pure in its rounded outlines as it was in the time of her earlier days The evils to which you allude she said are the condition of the lives of the high in rank upon earth to whom Heaven has imparted mind When those evils become too heavy to be borne Heaven lightens their burdens by penitence and confession Thus only we lay down our burden and the secrets that oppress us But forget not that the same gracious Heaven in its mercy apportions to their trials the strength of the feeble creatures of its hand and my strength has enabled me to bear my burden For the secrets of others the silence of Heaven is more than sufficient for my own secrets that of my confessor is enough You are as courageous madame I see as ever against your enemies You do not acknowledge your confidence in your friends Queens have no friends if you have nothing further to say to me if you feel yourself inspired by Heaven as a prophetess leave me I pray for I dread the future I should have supposed said the Beguine resolutely that you would rather have dreaded the past Hardly had these words escaped her lips than the queen rose up proudly Speak she cried in a short imperious tone of voice explain yourself briefly quickly entirely or if not Nay do not threaten me your majesty said the Beguine gently I came here to you full of compassion and respect I came here on the part of a friend Prove that to me Comfort instead of irritating me Easily enough and your majesty will see who is friendly to you What misfortune has happened to your majesty during these three and twenty years past Serious misfortunes indeed have I not lost the king I speak not of misfortunes of that kind I wish to ask you if since the birth of the king any indiscretion on a friend s part has caused your majesty the slightest serious anxiety or distress I do not understand you replied the queen clenching her teeth in order to conceal her emotion I will make myself understood then Your majesty remembers that the king was born on the fifth of September sixteen thirty eight at a quarter past eleven o clock Yes stammered out the queen At half past twelve continued the Beguine the dauphin who had been baptized by Monseigneur de Meaux in the king s and your own presence was acknowledged as the heir of the crown of France The king then went to the chapel of the old Chateau de Saint Germain to hear the Te Deum chanted Quite true quite true murmured the queen Your majesty s conferment took place in the presence of Monsieur his majesty s late uncle of the princes and of the ladies attached to the court The king s physician Bouvard and Honore the surgeon were stationed in the ante chamber your majesty slept from three o clock until seven I believe Yes yes but you tell me no more than every one else knows as well as you and myself I am now madame approaching that which very few persons are acquainted with Very few persons did I say alas I might say two only for formerly there were but five in all and for many years past the secret has been well preserved by the deaths of the principal participators in it The late king sleeps now with his ancestors Perronnette the midwife soon followed him Laporte is already forgotten The queen opened her lips as though to reply she felt beneath her icy hand with which she kept her face half concealed the beads of perspiration on her brow It was eight o clock pursued the Beguine the king was seated at supper full of joy and happiness around him on all sides arose wild cries of delight and drinking of healths the people cheered beneath the balconies the Swiss guards the musketeers and the royal guards wandered through the city borne about in triumph by the drunken students Those boisterous sounds of general joy disturbed the dauphin the future king of France who was quietly lying in the arms of Madame de Hausac his nurse and whose eyes as he opened them and stared about might have observed two crowns at the foot of his cradle Suddenly your majesty uttered a piercing cry and Dame Perronnette immediately flew to your bedside The doctors were dining in a room at some distance from your chamber the palace deserted from the frequency of the irruptions made into it was without either sentinels or guards The midwife having questioned and examined your majesty gave a sudden exclamation as if in wild astonishment and taking you in her arms bewildered almost out of her senses from sheer distress of mind dispatched Laporte to inform the king that her majesty the queen mother wished to see him in her room Laporte you are aware madame was a man of the most admirable calmness and presence of mind He did not approach the king as if he were the bearer of alarming intelligence and wished to inspire the terror he himself experienced besides it was not a very terrifying intelligence which awaited the king Therefore Laporte appeared with a smile upon his lips and approached the king s chair saying to him Sire the queen is very happy and would be still more so to see your majesty On that day Louis XIII would have given his crown away to the veriest beggar for a God bless you Animated light hearted and full of gayety the king rose from the table and said to those around him in a tone that Henry IV might have adopted Gentlemen I am going to see my wife He came to your beside madame at the very moment Dame Perronnette presented to him a second prince as beautiful and healthy as the former and said Sire Heaven will not allow the kingdom of France to fall into the female line The king yielding to a first impulse clasped the child in his arms and cried Oh Heaven I thank Thee At this part of her recital the Beguine paused observing how intensely the queen was suffering she had thrown herself back in her chair and with her head bent forward and her eyes fixed listened without seeming to hear and her lips moving convulsively either breathing a prayer to Heaven or imprecations on the woman standing before her Ah I do not believe that if because there could be but one dauphin in France exclaimed the Beguine the queen allowed that child to vegetate banished from his royal parents presence she was on that account an unfeeling mother Oh no no there are those alive who have known and witnessed the passionate kisses she imprinted on that innocent creature in exchange for a life of misery and gloom to which state policy condemned the twin brother of Louis XIV Oh Heaven murmured the queen feebly It is admitted continued the Beguine quickly that when the king perceived the effect which would result from the existence of two sons equal in age and pretensions he trembled for the welfare of France for the tranquillity of the state and it is equally well known that Cardinal de Richelieu by the direction of Louis XIII thought over the subject with deep attention and after an hour s meditation in his majesty s cabinet he pronounced the following sentence One prince means peace and safety for the state two competitors civil war and anarchy The queen rose suddenly from her seat pale as death and her hands clenched together You know too much she said in a hoarse thick voice since you refer to secrets of state As for the friends from whom you have acquired this secret they are false and treacherous You are their accomplice in the crime which is being now committed Now throw aside your mask or I will have you arrested by my captain of the guards Do not think that this secret terrifies me You have obtained it you shall restore it to me Never shall it leave your bosom for neither your secret nor your own life belong to you from this moment Anne of Austria joining gesture to the threat advanced a couple of steps towards the Beguine Learn said the latter to know and value the fidelity the honor and secrecy of the friends you have abandoned And then suddenly she threw aside her mask Madame de Chevreuse exclaimed the queen With your majesty the sole living confidante of the secret Ah murmured Anne of Austria come and embrace me duchesse Alas you kill your friend in thus trifling with her terrible distress And the queen leaning her head upon the shoulder of the old duchesse burst into a flood of bitter tears How young you are still said the latter in a hollow voice you can weep Chapter XLIV Two Friends The queen looked steadily at Madame de Chevreuse and said I believe you just now made use of the word happy in speaking of me Hitherto duchesse I had thought it impossible that a human creature could anywhere be found more miserable than the queen of France Your afflictions madame have indeed been terrible enough But by the side of those great and grand misfortunes to which we two old friends separated by men s malice were just now alluding you possess sources of pleasure slight enough in themselves it may be but greatly envied by the world What are they said Anne of Austria bitterly What can induce you to pronounce the word pleasure duchesse you who just now admitted that my body and my mind both stood in need of remedies Madame de Chevreuse collected herself for a moment and then murmured How far removed kings are from other people What do you mean I mean that they are so far removed from the vulgar herd that they forget that others often stand in need of the bare necessities of life They are like the inhabitant of the African mountains who gazing from the verdant tableland refreshed by the rills of melted snow cannot comprehend that the dwellers in the plains below are perishing from hunger and thirst in the midst of the desert burnt up by the heat of the sun The queen colored for she now began to perceive the drift of her friend s remark It was very wrong she said to have neglected you Oh madame I know the king has inherited the hatred his father bore me The king would exile me if he knew I were in the Palais Royal I cannot say that the king is very well disposed towards you duchesse replied the queen but I could secretly you know The duchesse s disdainful smile produced a feeling of uneasiness in the queen s mind Duchesse she hastened to add you did perfectly right to come here even were it only to give us the happiness of contradicting the report of your death Has it been rumored then that I was dead Everywhere And yet my children did not go into mourning Ah you know duchesse the court is very frequently moving about from place to place we see M Albert de Luynes but seldom and many things escape our minds in the midst of the preoccupations that constantly beset us Your majesty ought not to have believed the report of my death Why not Alas we are all mortal and you may perceive how rapidly I your younger sister as we used formerly to say am approaching the tomb If your majesty believed me dead you ought in that case to have been astonished not to have received the news Death not unfrequently takes us by surprise duchesse Oh your majesty those who are burdened with secrets such as we have just now discussed must as a necessity of their nature satisfy their craving desire to divulge them and they feel they must gratify that desire before they die Among the various preparations for their final journey the task of placing their papers in order is not omitted The queen started Your majesty will be sure to learn in a particular manner the day of my death In what way Because your majesty will receive the next day under several coverings everything connected with our mysterious correspondence of former times Did you not burn them cried Anne in alarm Traitors only replied the duchesse destroy a royal correspondence Traitors do you say Yes certainly or rather they pretend to destroy instead of which they keep or sell it Faithful friends on the contrary most carefully secrete such treasures for it may happen that some day or other they would wish to seek out their queen in order to say to her Madame I am getting old my health is fast failing me in the presence of the danger of death for there is the risk for your majesty that this secret may be revealed take therefore this paper so fraught with menace for yourself and trust not to another to burn it for you What paper do you refer to As far as I am concerned I have but one it is true but that is indeed most dangerous in its nature Oh duchesse tell me what it is A letter dated Tuesday the twod of August sixteen forty four in which you beg me to go to Noisy le Sec to see that unhappy child In your own handwriting madame there are those words that unhappy child A profound silence ensued the queen s mind was busy in the past Madame de Chevreuse was watching the progress of her scheme Yes unhappy most unhappy murmured Anne of Austria how sad the existence he led poor child to finish it in so cruel a manner Is he dead cried the duchesse suddenly with a curiosity whose genuine accents the queen instinctively detected He died of consumption died forgotten died withered and blighted like the flowers a lover has given to his mistress which she leaves to die secreted in a drawer where she had hid them from the gaze of others Died repeated the duchesse with an air of discouragement which would have afforded the queen the most unfeigned delight had it not been tempered in some measure with a mixture of doubt Died at Noisy le Sec Yes in the arms of his tutor a poor honest man who did not long survive him That can easily be understood it is so difficult to bear up under the weight of such a loss and such a secret said Madame de Chevreuse the irony of which reflection the queen pretended not to perceive Madame de Chevreuse continued Well madame I inquired some years ago at Noisy le Sec about this unhappy child I was told that it was not believed he was dead and that was my reason for not having at first condoled with your majesty for most certainly if I could have thought it were true never should I have made the slightest allusion to so deplorable an event and thus have re awakened your majesty s most natural distress You say that it is not believed the child died at Noisy No madame What did they say about him then They said but no doubt they were mistaken Nay speak speak They said that one evening about the year sixteen forty five a lady beautiful and majestic in her bearing which was observed notwithstanding the mask and the mantle that concealed her figure a lady of rank of very high rank no doubt came in a carriage to the place where the road branches off the very same spot you know where I awaited news of the young prince when your majesty was graciously pleased to send me there Well well That the boy s tutor or guardian took the child to this lady Well what next That both the child and his tutor left that part of the country the very next day There you see there is some truth in what you relate since in point of fact the poor child died from a sudden attack of illness which makes the lives of all children as doctors say suspended as it were by a thread What your majesty says is quite true no one knows it better than yourself no one believes it more strongly than myself But yet how strange it is What can it now be thought the queen The person who gave me these details who was sent to inquire after the child s health Did you confide such a charge to any one else Oh duchesse Some one as dumb as your majesty as dumb as myself we will suppose it was myself Madame this some one some months after passing through Touraine Touraine Recognized both the tutor and the child too I am wrong thought he recognized them both living cheerful happy and flourishing the one in a green old age the other in the flower of his youth Judge after that what truth can be attributed to the rumors which are circulated or what faith after that placed in anything that may happen in the world But I am fatiguing your majesty it was not my intention however to do so and I will take my leave of you after renewing to you the assurance of my most respectful devotion Stay duchesse let us first talk a little about yourself Of myself madame I am not worthy that you should bend your looks upon me Why not indeed Are you not the oldest friend I have Are you angry with me duchesse I indeed what motive could I have If I had reason to be angry with your majesty should I have come here Duchesse age is fast creeping on us both we should be united against that death whose approach cannot be far off You overpower me madame with the kindness of your language No one has ever loved or served me as you have done duchesse Your majesty is too kind in remembering it Not so Give me a proof of your friendship duchesse My whole being is devoted to you madame The proof I require is that you should ask something of me Ask Oh I know you well no one is more disinterested more noble and truly loyal Do not praise me too highly madame said the duchesse somewhat anxiously I could never praise you as much as you deserve to be praised And yet age and misfortune effect a terrible change in people madame So much the better for the beautiful the haughty the adored duchesse of former days might have answered me ungratefully I do not wish for anything from you Heaven be praised The misfortunes you speak of have indeed worked a change in you for you will now perhaps answer me I accept The duchesse s look and smile soon changed at this conclusion and she no longer attempted to act a false part Speak dearest what do you want I must first explain to you Do so unhesitatingly Well then your majesty can confer the greatest the most ineffable pleasure upon me What is it said the queen a little distant in her manner from an uneasiness of feeling produced by this remark But do not forget my good Chevreuse that I am quite as much under my son s influence as I was formerly under my husband s I will not be too hard madame Call me as you used to do it will be a sweet echo of our happy youth Well then my dear mistress my darling Anne Do you know Spanish still Yes Ask me in Spanish then Will your majesty do me the honor to pass a few days with me at Dampierre Is that all said the queen stupefied Nothing more than that Good heavens can you possibly imagine that in asking you that I am not asking you the greatest conceivable favor If that really be the case you do not know me Will you accept Yes gladly And I shall be happy continued the queen with some suspicion if my presence can in any way be useful to you Useful exclaimed the duchesse laughing oh no no agreeable delightful if you like and you promise me then I swear it said the queen whereupon the duchesse seized her beautiful hand and covered it with kisses The queen could not help murmuring to herself She is a good hearted woman and very generous too Will your majesty consent to wait a fortnight before you come Certainly but why Because said the duchesse knowing me to be in disgrace no one would lend me the hundred thousand francs which I require to put Dampierre into a state of repair But when it is known that I require that sum for the purpose of receiving your majesty at Dampierre properly all the money in Paris will be at my disposal Ah said the queen gently nodding her head in sign of intelligence a hundred thousand francs you want a hundred thousand francs to put Dampierre into repair Quite as much as that And no one will lend you them No one I will lend them to you if you like duchesse Oh I hardly dare accept such a sum You would be wrong if you did not Besides a hundred thousand francs is really not much I know but too well that you never set a right value upon your silence and secrecy Push that table a little towards me duchesse and I will write you an order on M Colbert no on M Fouquet who is a far more courteous and obliging man Will he pay it though If he will not pay it I will but it will be the first time he will have refused me The queen wrote and handed the duchesse the order and afterwards dismissed her with a warm embrace Chapter XLV How Jean de La Fontaine Came to Write His First Tale All these intrigues are exhausted the human mind so variously complicated has been enabled to develop itself at its ease in the three outlines with which our recital has supplied it It is not unlikely that in the future we are now preparing a question of politics and intrigues may still arise but the springs by which they work will be so carefully concealed that no one will be able to see aught but flowers and paintings just as at a theater where a colossus appears upon the scene walking along moved by the small legs and slender arms of a child concealed within the framework We now return to Saint Mande where the superintendent was in the habit of receiving his select confederacy of epicureans For some time past the host had met with nothing but trouble Every one in the house was aware of and felt for the minister s distress No more magnificent or recklessly improvident reunions Money had been the pretext assigned by Fouquet and never was any pretext as Gourville said more fallacious for there was not even a shadow of money to be seen M Vatel was resolutely painstaking in keeping up the reputation of the house and yet the gardeners who supplied the kitchens complained of ruinous delays The agents for the supply of Spanish wines sent drafts which no one honored fishermen whom the superintendent engaged on the coast of Normandy calculated that if they were paid all that was due to them the amount would enable them to retire comfortably for life fish which at a later period was the cause of Vatel s death did not arrive at all However on the ordinary reception days Fouquet s friends flocked in more numerously than ever Gourville and the Abbe Fouquet talked over money matters that is to say the abbe borrowed a few pistoles from Gourville Pelisson seated with his legs crossed was engaged in finishing the peroration of a speech with which Fouquet was to open the parliament and this speech was a masterpiece because Pelisson wrote it for his friend that is to say he inserted all kinds of clever things the latter would most certainly never have taken the trouble to say of his own accord Presently Loret and La Fontaine would enter from the garden engaged in a dispute about the art of making verses The painters and musicians in their turn were hovering near the dining room As soon as eight o clock struck the supper would be announced for the superintendent never kept any one waiting It was already half past seven and the appetites of the guests were beginning to declare themselves in an emphatic manner As soon as all the guests were assembled Gourville went straight up to Pelisson awoke him out of his reverie and led him into the middle of a room and closed the doors Well he said anything new Pelisson raised his intelligent and gentle face and said I have borrowed five and twenty thousand francs of my aunt and I have them here in good sterling money Good replied Gourville we only what one hundred and ninety five thousand livres for the first payment The payment of what asked La Fontaine What absent minded as usual Why it was you who told us the small estate at Corbeli was going to be sold by one of M Fouquet s creditors and you also who proposed that all his friends should subscribe more than that it was you who said that you would sell a corner of your house at Chateau Thierry in order to furnish your own proportion and you come and ask The payment of what This remark was received with a general laugh which made La Fontaine blush I beg your pardon he said I had not forgotten it oh no only Only you remembered nothing about it replied Loret That is the truth and the fact is he is quite right there is a great difference between forgetting and not remembering Well then added Pelisson you bring your mite in the shape of the price of the piece of land you have sold Sold no Have you not sold the field then inquired Gourville in astonishment for he knew the poet s disinterestedness My wife would not let me replied the latter at which there were fresh bursts of laughter And yet you went to Chateau Thierry for that purpose said some one Certainly I did and on horseback Poor fellow I had eight different horses and I was almost bumped to death You are an excellent fellow And you rested yourself when you arrived there Rested Oh of course I did for I had an immense deal of work to do How so My wife had been flirting with the man to whom I wished to sell the land The fellow drew back from his bargain and so I challenged him Very good and you fought It seems not You know nothing about it I suppose No my wife and her relations interfered in the matter I was kept a quarter of an hour with my sword in my hand but I was not wounded And your adversary Oh he wasn t wounded either for he never came on the field Capital cried his friends from all sides you must have been terribly angry Exceedingly so I caught cold I returned home and then my wife began to quarrel with me In real earnest Yes in real earnest She threw a loaf of bread at my head a large loaf And what did you do Oh I upset the table over her and her guests and then I got on my horse again and here I am Every one had great difficulty in keeping his countenance at the exposure of this heroi comedy and when the laughter had subsided one of the guests present said to La Fontaine Is that all you have brought back Oh no I have an excellent idea in my head What is it Have you noticed that there is a good deal of sportive jesting poetry written in France Yes of course replied every one And pursued La Fontaine only a very small portion of it is printed The laws are strict you know That may be but a rare article is a dear article and that is the reason why I have written a small poem excessively free in its style very broad and extremely cynical in its tone The deuce you have Yes continued the poet with assumed indifference and I have introduced the greatest freedom of language I could possibly employ Peals of laughter again broke forth while the poet was thus announcing the quality of his wares And he continued I have tried to excel everything that Boccaccio Aretin and other masters of their craft have written in the same style Its fate is clear said Pelisson it will be suppressed and forbidden Do you think so said La Fontaine simply I assure you I did not do it on my own account so much as M Fouquet s This wonderful conclusion again raised the mirth of all present And I have sold the first edition of this little book for eight hundred livres exclaimed La Fontaine rubbing his hands together Serious and religions books sell at about half that rate It would have been better said Gourville to have written two religious books instead It would have been too long and not amusing enough replied La Fontaine tranquilly my eight hundred livres are in this little bag and I beg to offer them as my contribution As he said this he placed his offering in the hands of their treasurer it was then Loret s turn who gave a hundred and fifty livres the others stripped themselves in the same way and the total sum in the purse amounted to forty thousand livres The money was still being counted over when the superintendent noiselessly entered the room he had heard everything and then this man who had possessed so many millions who had exhausted all the pleasures and honors the world had to bestow this generous heart this inexhaustible brain which had like two burning crucibles devoured the material and moral substance of the first kingdom in Europe was seen to cross the threshold with tears in his eyes and pass his fingers through the gold and silver which the bag contained Poor offering he said in a softened and affected tone of voice you will disappear into the smallest corner of my empty purse but you have filled to overflowing that which no one can ever exhaust my heart Thank you my friends thank you And as he could not embrace every one present who were all tearful too philosophers as they were he embraced La Fontaine saying to him Poor fellow so you have on my account been beaten by your wife and censured by your confessor Oh it is a mere nothing replied the poet if your creditors will only wait a couple of years I shall have written a hundred other tales which at two editions each will pay off the debt Chapter XLVI La Fontaine in the Character of a Negotiator Fouquet pressed La Fontaine s hand most warmly saying to him My dear poet write a hundred other tales not only for the eighty pistoles which each of them will produce you but still more to enrich our language with a hundred new masterpieces of composition Oh said La Fontaine with a little air of pride you must not suppose that I have only brought this idea and the eighty pistoles to the superintendent Oh indeed was the general acclamation from all parts of the room M de la Fontaine is in funds to day Exactly replied La Fontaine Quick quick cried the assembly Take care said Pelisson in La Fontaine s ear you have had a most brilliant success up to the present moment do not go beyond your depth Not at all Monsieur Pelisson and you who are a man of decided taste will be the first to approve of what I have done We are talking of millions remember said Gourville I have fifteen hundred thousand francs here Monsieur Gourville he replied striking himself on the chest The deuce take this Gascon from Chateau Thierry cried Loret It is not the pocket you must tap but the brain said Fouquet Stay a moment monsieur le surintendant added La Fontaine you are not procureur general you are a poet True true cried Loret Conrart and every person present connected with literature You are I repeat a poet and a painter a sculptor a friend of the arts and sciences but acknowledge that you are no lawyer Oh I do acknowledge it replied M Fouquet smiling If you were to be nominated at the Academy you would refuse I think I think I should with all due deference to the academicians Very good if therefore you do not wish to belong to the Academy why do you allow yourself to form one of the parliament Oh said Pelisson we are talking politics I wish to know whether the barrister s gown does or does not become M Fouquet There is no question of the gown at all retorted Pelisson annoyed at the laughter of those who were present On the contrary it is the gown said Loret Take the gown away from the procureur general said Conrart and we have M Fouquet left us still of whom we have no reason to complain but as he is no procureur general without his gown we agree with M de la Fontaine and pronounce the gown to be nothing but a bugbear Fugiunt risus leporesque said Loret The smiles and the graces said some one present That is not the way said Pelisson gravely that I translate lepores How do you translate it said La Fontaine Thus The hares run away as soon as they see M Fouquet A burst of laughter in which the superintendent joined followed this sally But why hares objected Conrart vexed Because the hare will be the very one who will not be over pleased to see M Fouquet surrounded by all the attributes which his parliamentary strength and power confer on him Oh oh murmured the poets Quo non ascendam said Conrart seems impossible to me when one is fortunate enough to wear the gown of the procureur general nine On the contrary it seems so to me without that gown said the obstinate Pelisson what is your opinion Gourville I think the gown in question is a very good thing replied the latter but I equally think that a million and a half is far better than the gown And I am of Gourville s opinion exclaimed Fouquet stopping the discussion by the expression of his own opinion which would necessarily bear down all the others A million and a half Pelisson grumbled out now I happen to know an Indian fable Tell it to me said La Fontaine I ought to know it too Tell it tell it said the others There was a tortoise which was as usual well protected by its shell said Pelisson whenever its enemies threatened it it took refuge within its covering One day some one said to it You must feel very hot in such a house as that in the summer and you are altogether prevented showing off your graces there is a snake here who will give you a million and a half for your shell Good said the superintendent laughing Well what next said La Fontaine more interested in the apologue than in the moral The tortoise sold his shell and remained naked and defenseless A vulture happened to see him and being hungry broke the tortoise s back with a blow of his beak and devoured it The moral is that M Fouquet should take very good care to keep his gown La Fontaine understood the moral seriously You forget Aeschylus he said to his adversary What do you mean Aeschylus was bald headed and a vulture your vulture probably who was a great amateur in tortoises mistook at a distance his head for a block of stone and let a tortoise which was shrunk up in his shell fall upon it Yes yes La Fontaine is right resumed Fouquet who had become very thoughtful whenever a vulture wishes to devour a tortoise he well knows how to break his shell but happy is that tortoise a snake pays a million and a half for his envelope If any one were to bring me a generous hearted snake like the one in your fable Pelisson I would give him my shell Rara avis in terres cried Conrart ten And like a black swan is he not added La Fontaine well then the bird in question black and rare is already found Do you mean to say that you have found a purchaser for my post of procureur general exclaimed Fouquet I have monsieur But the superintendent never said that he wished to sell resumed Pelisson I beg your pardon said Conrart you yourself spoke about it even Yes I am a witness to that said Gourville He seems very tenacious about his brilliant idea said Fouquet laughing Well La Fontaine who is the purchaser A perfect blackbird for he is a counselor belonging to the parliament an excellent fellow What is his name Vanel Vanel exclaimed Fouquet Vanel the husband of Precisely her husband yes monsieur Poor fellow said Fouquet with an expression of great interest He wishes to be everything that you have been monsieur said Gourville and to do everything that you have done It is very agreeable tell us all about it La Fontaine It is very simple I see him occasionally and a short time ago I met him walking about on the Place de la Bastile at the very moment when I was about to take the small carriage to come down here to Saint Mande He must have been watching his wife interrupted Loret Oh no said La Fontaine he is far from being jealous He accosted me embraced me and took me to the inn called L Image Saint Fiacre and told me all about his troubles He has his troubles then Yes his wife wants to make him ambitious Well and he told you That some one had spoken to him about a post in parliament that M Fouquet s name had been mentioned that ever since Madame Vanel dreams of nothing else than being called madame la procureur generale and that it makes her ill and kills her every night she does not dream about it The deuce Poor woman said Fouquet Wait a moment Conrart is always telling me that I do not know how to conduct matters of business you will see how I managed this one Well go on I suppose you know said I to Vanel that the value of a post such as that which M Fouquet holds is by no means trifling How much do you imagine it to be he said M Fouquet I know has refused seventeen hundred thousand francs My wife replied Vanel had estimated it at about fourteen hundred thousand Ready money I said Yes she has sold some property of hers in Guienne and has received the purchase money That s a pretty sum to touch all at once said the Abbe Fouquet who had not hitherto said a word Poor Madame Vanel murmured Fouquet Pelisson shrugged his shoulders as he whispered in Fouquet s ear That woman is a perfect fiend That may be and it will be delightful to make use of this fiend s money to repair the injury which an angel has done herself for me Pelisson looked with a surprised air at Fouquet whose thoughts were from that moment fixed upon a fresh object in view Well inquired La Fontaine what about my negotiation Admirable my dear poet Yes said Gourville but there are some people who are anxious to have the steed who have not even money enough to pay for the bridle And Vanel would draw back from his offer if he were to be taken at his word continued the Abbe Fouquet I do not believe it said La Fontaine What do you know about it Why you have not yet heard the denouement of my story If there is a denouement why do you beat about the bush so much Semper ad eventum Is that correct said Fouquet with the air of a nobleman who condescends to barbarisms To which the Latinists present answered with loud applause eleven My denouement cried La Fontaine is that Vanel that determined blackbird knowing that I was coming to Saint Mande implored me to bring him with me and if possible to present him to M Fouquet So that So that he is here I left him in that part of the ground called Bel Air Well M Fouquet what is your reply Well it is not respectful towards Madame Vanel that her husband should run the risk of catching cold outside my house send for him La Fontaine since you know where he is I will go myself And I will accompany you said the Abbe Fouquet I will carry the money bags No jesting said Fouquet seriously let the business be a serious one if it is to be one at all But first of all let us show we are hospitable Make my apologies La Fontaine to M Vanel and tell him how distressed I am to have kept him waiting but that I was not aware he was there La Fontaine set off at once fortunately accompanied by Gourville for absorbed in his own calculations the poet would have mistaken the route and was hurrying as fast as he could towards the village of Saint Mande Within a quarter of an hour afterwards M Vanel was introduced into the superintendent s cabinet a description of which has already been given at the beginning of this story When Fouquet saw him enter he called to Pelisson and whispered a few words in his ear Do not lose a single word of what I am going to say let all the silver and gold plate together with my jewels of every description be packed up in the carriage You will take the black horses the jeweler will accompany you and you will postpone the supper until Madame de Belliere s arrival Will it be necessary to inform Madame de Belliere of it said Pelisson No that will be useless I will do that So away with you my dear friend Pelisson set off not quite clear as to his friend s meaning or intention but confident like every true friend in the judgment of the man he was blindly obeying It is that which constitutes the strength of such men distrust only arises in the minds of inferior natures Vanel bowed lowly to the superintendent and was about to begin a speech Do not trouble yourself monsieur said Fouquet politely I am told you wish to purchase a post I hold How much can you give me for it It is for you monseigneur to fix the amount you require I know that offers of purchase have already been made to you for it Madame Vanel I have been told values it at fourteen hundred thousand livres That is all we have Can you give me the money immediately I have not the money with me said Vanel frightened almost by the unpretending simplicity amounting to greatness of the man for he had expected disputes difficulties opposition of every kind When will you be able to bring it Whenever you please monseigneur for he began to be afraid that Fouquet was trifling with him If it were not for the trouble you would have in returning to Paris I would say at once but we will arrange that the payment and the signature shall take place at six o clock to morrow morning Very good said Vanel as cold as ice and feeling quite bewildered Adieu Monsieur Vanel present my humblest respects to Madame Vanel said Fouquet as he rose upon which Vanel who felt the blood rushing to his head for he was quite confounded by his success said seriously to the superintendent Will you give me your word monseigneur upon this affair Fouquet turned round his head saying Pardieu and you monsieur Vanel hesitated trembled all over and at last finished by hesitatingly holding out his hand Fouquet opened and nobly extended his own this loyal hand lay for a moment in Vanel s most hypocritical palm and he pressed it in his own in order the better to convince himself of the compact The superintendent gently disengaged his hand as he again said Adieu And then Vanel ran hastily to the door hurried along the vestibule and fled as quickly as he could Chapter XLVII Madame de Belliere s Plate and Diamonds Fouquet had no sooner dismissed Vanel than he began to reflect for a few moments A man never can do too much for the woman he has once loved Marguerite wishes to be the wife of a procureur general and why not confer this pleasure upon her And now that the most scrupulous and sensitive conscience will be unable to reproach me with anything let my thoughts be bestowed on her who has shown so much devotion for me Madame de Belliere ought to be there by this time he said as he turned towards the secret door After he had locked himself in he opened the subterranean passage and rapidly hastened towards the means of communicating between the house at Vincennes and his own residence He had neglected to apprise his friend of his approach by ringing the bell perfectly assured that she would never fail to be exact at the rendezvous as indeed was the case for she was already waiting The noise the superintendent made aroused her she ran to take from under the door the letter he had thrust there and which simply said Come marquise we are waiting supper for you With her heart filled with happiness Madame de Belliere ran to her carriage in the Avenue de Vincennes and in a few minutes she was holding out her hand to Gourville who was standing at the entrance where in order the better to please his master he had stationed himself to watch her arrival She had not observed that Fouquet s black horse arrived at the same time all steaming and foam flaked having returned to Saint Mande with Pelisson and the very jeweler to whom Madame de Belliere had sold her plate and her jewels Pelisson introduced the goldsmith into the cabinet which Fouquet had not yet left The superintendent thanked him for having been good enough to regard as a simple deposit in his hands the valuable property which he had every right to sell and he cast his eyes on the total of the account which amounted to thirteen hundred thousand francs Then going for a few moments to his desk he wrote an order for fourteen hundred thousand francs payable at sight at his treasury before twelve o clock the next day A hundred thousand francs profit cried the goldsmith Oh monseigneur what generosity Nay nay not so monsieur said Fouquet touching him on the shoulder there are certain kindnesses which can never be repaid This profit is only what you have earned but the interest of your money still remains to be arranged And saying this he unfastened from his sleeve a diamond button which the goldsmith himself had often valued at three thousand pistoles Take this he said to the goldsmith in remembrance of me Farewell you are an honest man And you monseigneur cried the goldsmith completely overcome are the noblest man that ever lived Fouquet let the worthy goldsmith pass out of the room by a secret door and then went to receive Madame de Belliere who was already surrounded by all the guests The marquise was always beautiful but now her loveliness was more dazzling than ever Do you not think gentlemen said Fouquet that madame is more than usually beautiful this evening And do you happen to know why Because madame is really the most beautiful of all women said some one present No but because she is the best And yet Yet said the marquise smiling And yet all the jewels which madame is wearing this evening are nothing but false stones At this remark the marquise blushed most painfully Oh oh exclaimed all the guests that can very well be said of one who has the finest diamonds in Paris Well said Fouquet to Pelisson in a low tone Well at last I have understood you returned the latter and you have done exceedingly well Supper is ready monseigneur said Vatel with majestic air and tone The crowd of guests hurried more quickly than is usually the case with ministerial entertainments towards the banqueting room where a magnificent spectacle presented itself Upon the buffets upon the side tables upon the supper table itself in the midst of flowers and light glittered most dazzlingly the richest and most costly gold and silver plate that could possibly be seen relics of those ancient magnificent productions the Florentine artists whom the Medici family patronized sculptured chased and moulded for the purpose of holding flowers at a time when gold existed still in France These hidden marvels which had been buried during the civil wars timidly reappeared during the intervals of that war of good taste called La Fronde at a time when noblemen fighting against nobleman killed but did not pillage each other All the plate present had Madame de Belliere s arms engraved upon it Look cried La Fontaine here is a P and a B But the most remarkable object present was the cover which Fouquet had assigned to the marquise Near her was a pyramid of diamonds sapphires emeralds antique cameos sardonyx stones carved by the old Greeks of Asia Minor with mountings of Mysian gold curious mosaics of ancient Alexandria set in silver massive Egyptian bracelets lay heaped on a large plate of Palissy ware supported by a tripod of gilt bronze sculptured by Benvenuto Cellini The marquise turned pale as she recognized what she had never expected to see again A profound silence fell on every one of the restless and excited guests Fouquet did not even make a sign in dismissal of the richly liveried servants who crowded like bees round the huge buffets and other tables in the room Gentlemen he said all this plate which you behold once belonged to Madame de Belliere who having observed one of her friends in great distress sent all this gold and silver together with the heap of jewels now before her to her goldsmith This noble conduct of a devoted friend can well be understood by such friends as you Happy indeed is that man who sees himself loved in such a manner Let us drink to the health of Madame de Belliere A tremendous burst of applause followed his words and made poor Madame de Belliere sink back dumb and breathless in her seat And then added Pelisson who was always affected by a noble action as he was invariably impressed by beauty let us also drink to the health of him who inspired madame s noble conduct for such a man is worthy of being worthily loved It was now the marquise s turn She rose pale and smiling and as she held out her glass with a faltering hand and her trembling fingers touched those of Fouquet her look full of love found its mirror in that of her ardent and generous hearted lover Begun in this manner the supper soon became a fete no one tried to be witty but no one failed in being so La Fontaine forgot his Gorgny wine and allowed Vatel to reconcile him to the wines of the Rhone and those from the shores of Spain The Abbe Fouquet became so kind and good natured that Gourville said to him Take care monsieur l abbe if you are so tender you will be carved and eaten The hours passed away so joyously that contrary to his usual custom the superintendent did not leave the table before the end of the dessert He smiled upon his friends delighted as a man is whose heart becomes intoxicated before his head and for the first time looked at the clock Suddenly a carriage rolled into the courtyard and strange to say it was heard high above the noise of the mirth which prevailed Fouquet listened attentively and then turned his eyes towards the ante chamber It seemed as if he could hear a step passing across it a step that instead of pressing the ground weighed heavily upon his heart M d Herblay bishop of Vannes the usher announced And Aramis s grave and thoughtful face appeared upon the threshold of the door between the remains of two garlands of which the flame of a lamp had just burnt the thread that once united them Chapter XLVIII M de Mazarin s Receipt Fouquet would have uttered an exclamation of delight on seeing another friend arrive if the cold air and averted aspect of Aramis had not restored all his reserve Are you going to join us at dessert he asked And yet you would be frightened perhaps at the noise which our wild friends here are making Monseigneur replied Aramis respectfully I will begin by begging you to excuse me for having interrupted this merry meeting and then I will beg you to give me as soon as your pleasure is attended to a moment s audience on matters of business As the word business had aroused the attention of some of the epicureans present Fouquet rose saying Business first of all Monsieur d Herblay we are too happy when matters of business arrive only at the end of a meal As he said this he took the hand of Madame de Belliere who looked at him with a kind of uneasiness and then led her to an adjoining salon after having recommended her to the most reasonable of his guests And then taking Aramis by the arm he led him towards his cabinet As soon as Aramis was there throwing aside the respectful air he had assumed he threw himself into a chair saying Guess whom I have seen this evening My dear chevalier every time you begin in that manner I am sure to hear you announce something disagreeable Well and this time you will not be mistaken either my dear friend replied Aramis Do not keep me in suspense added Fouquet phlegmatically Well then I have seen Madame de Chevreuse The old duchesse do you mean Yes Her ghost perhaps No no the old she wolf herself Without teeth Possibly but not without claws Well what harm can she meditate against me I am no miser with women who are not prudes A quality always prized even by the woman who no longer presumes to look for love Madame de Chevreuse knows very well that you are not avaricious since she wishes to draw some money of you Indeed under what pretext Oh pretexts are never wanting with her Let me tell you what it is it seems that the duchesse has a good many letters of M de Mazarin s in her possession I am not surprised at that for the prelate was gallant enough Yes but these letters have nothing whatever to do with the prelate s love affairs They concern it is said financial matters rather And accordingly they are less interesting Do you not suspect what I mean Not at all Have you never heard speak of a prosecution being instituted for an embezzlement or appropriation rather of public funds Yes a hundred nay a thousand times Ever since I have been engaged in public matters I have hardly heard of anything else It is precisely your own case when as a bishop people reproach you for impiety or as a musketeer for your cowardice the very thing of which they are always accusing ministers of finance is the embezzlement of public funds Very good but take a particular instance for the duchesse asserts that M de Mazarin alludes to certain particular instances What are they Something like a sum of thirteen millions of francs of which it would be very difficult for you to define the precise nature of the employment Thirteen millions said the superintendent stretching himself in his armchair in order to enable him the more comfortably to look up towards the ceiling Thirteen millions I am trying to remember out of all those I have been accused of having stolen Do not laugh my dear monsieur for it is very serious It is positive that the duchesse has certain letters in her possession and that these letters must be as she represents them since she wished to sell them to me for five hundred thousand francs Oh one can have a very tolerable calumny got up for such a sum as that replied Fouquet Ah now I know what you mean and he began to laugh very heartily So much the better said Aramis a little reassured I remember the story of those thirteen millions now Yes yes I remember them quite well I am delighted to hear it tell me about them Well then one day Signor Mazarin Heaven rest his soul made a profit of thirteen millions upon a concession of lands in the Valtelline he canceled them in the registry of receipts sent them to me and then made me advance them to him for war expenses Very good then there is no doubt of their proper destination No the cardinal made me invest them in my own name and gave me a receipt You have the receipt Of course said Fouquet as he quietly rose from his chair and went to his large ebony bureau inlaid with mother of pearl and gold What I most admire in you said Aramis with an air of great satisfaction is your memory in the first place then your self possession and finally the perfect order which prevails in your administration you of all men too who are by nature a poet Yes said Fouquet I am orderly out of a spirit of idleness to save myself the trouble of looking after things and so I know that Mazarin s receipt is in the third drawer under the letter M I open the drawer and place my hand upon the very paper I need In the night without a light I could find it And with a confident hand he felt the bundle of papers which were piled up in the open drawer Nay more than that he continued I remember the paper as if I saw it it is thick somewhat crumpled with gilt edges Mazarin had made a blot upon the figure of the date Ah he said the paper knows we are talking about it and that we want it very much and so it hides itself out of the way And as the superintendent looked into the drawer Aramis rose from his seat This is very singular said Fouquet Your memory is treacherous my dear monseigneur look in another drawer Fouquet took out the bundle of papers and turned them over once more he then grew very pale Don t confine your search to that drawer said Aramis look elsewhere Quite useless I have never made a mistake no one but myself arranges any papers of mine of this nature no one but myself ever opens this drawer of which besides no one myself excepted is aware of the secret What do you conclude then said Aramis agitated That Mazarin s receipt has been stolen from me Madame de Chevreuse was right chevalier I have appropriated the public funds I have robbed the state coffers of thirteen millions of money I am a thief Monsieur d Herblay Nay nay do not get irritated do not get excited And why not chevalier surely there is every reason for it If legal proceedings are well arranged and a judgment given in accordance with them your friend the superintendent will soon follow Montfaucon his colleague Enguerrand de Marigny and his predecessor Semblancay Oh said Aramis smiling not so fast as that And why not why not so fast What do you suppose Madame de Chevreuse has done with those letters for you refused them I suppose Yes at once I suppose that she went and sold them to M Colbert Well I said I supposed so I might have said I was sure of it for I had her followed and when she left me she returned to her own house went out by a back door and proceeded straight to the intendant s house in the Rue Croix des Petits Champs Legal proceedings will be instituted then scandal and dishonor will follow and all will fall upon me like a thunderbolt blindly pitilessly Aramis approached Fouquet who sat trembling in his chair close to the open drawers he placed his hand on his shoulder and in an affectionate tone of voice said Do not forget that the position of M Fouquet can in no way be compared to that of Semblancay or of Marigny And why not in Heaven s name Because the proceedings against those ministers were determined completed and the sentence carried out whilst in your case the same thing cannot take place Another blow why not A peculator is under any circumstances a criminal Criminals who know how to find a safe asylum are never in danger What make my escape Fly No I do not mean that you forget that all such proceedings originate in the parliament that they are instituted by the procureur general and that you are the procureur general You see that unless you wish to condemn yourself Oh cried Fouquet suddenly dashing his fist upon the table Well what what is the matter I am procureur general no longer Aramis at this reply became as livid as death he pressed his hands together convulsively and with a wild haggard look which almost annihilated Fouquet he said laying a stress on every distinct syllable You are procureur general no longer do you say No Since when Since the last four or five hours Take care interrupted Aramis coldly I do not think you are in the full possession of your senses my friend collect yourself I tell you returned Fouquet that a little while ago some one came to me brought by my friends to offer me fourteen hundred thousand francs for the appointment and that I sold it Aramis looked as though he had been struck by lightning the intelligent and mocking expression of his countenance assumed an aspect of such profound gloom and terror that it had more effect upon the superintendent than all the exclamations and speeches in the world You had need of money then he said at last Yes to discharge a debt of honor And in a few words he gave Aramis an account of Madame de Belliere s generosity and the manner in which he had thought it but right to discharge that act of generosity Yes said Aramis that is indeed a fine trait What has it cost Exactly the fourteen hundred thousand francs the price of my appointment Which you received in that manner without reflection Oh imprudent man I have not yet received the amount but I shall to morrow It is not yet completed then It must be carried out though for I have given the goldsmith for twelve o clock to morrow an order upon my treasury into which the purchaser s money will be paid at six or seven o clock Heaven be praised cried Aramis clapping his hands together nothing is yet completed since you have not yet been paid But the goldsmith You shall receive the fourteen hundred thousand francs from me at a quarter before twelve Stay a moment it is at six o clock this very morning that I am to sign Oh I will answer that you do not sign I have given my word chevalier If you have given it you will take it back again that is all Can I believe what I hear cried Fouquet in a most expressive tone Fouquet recall his word after it has once been pledged Aramis replied to the almost stern look of the minister by a look full of anger Monsieur he said I believe I have deserved to be called a man of honor As a soldier I have risked my life five hundred times as a priest I have rendered still greater services both to the state and to my friends The value of a word once passed is estimated according to the worth of the man who gives it So long as it is in his own keeping it is of the purest finest gold when his wish to keep it has passed away it is a two edged sword With that word therefore he defends himself as with an honorable weapon considering that when he disregards his word he endangers his life and incurs an amount of risk far greater than that which his adversary is likely to derive of profit In such a case monsieur he appeals to Heaven and to justice Fouquet bent down his head as he replied I am a poor self determined man a true Breton born my mind admires and fears yours I do not say that I keep my word from a proper feeling only I keep it if you like from custom practice pride or what you will but at all events the ordinary run of men are simple enough to admire this custom of mine it is my sole good quality leave me such honor as it confers And so you are determined to sign the sale of the very appointment which can alone defend you against all your enemies Yes I shall sign You will deliver yourself up then bound hand and foot from a false notion of honor which the most scrupulous casuists would disdain I shall sign repeated Fouquet Aramis sighed deeply and looked all round him with the impatient gesture of a man who would gladly dash something to pieces as a relief to his feelings We have still one means left he said and I trust you will not refuse me to make use of that Certainly not if it be loyal and honorable as everything is in fact which you propose I know nothing more loyal than the renunciation of your purchaser Is he a friend of yours Certainly but But if you allow me to manage the affair I do not despair Oh you shall be absolutely master to do what you please Whom are you in treaty with What manner of man is it I am not aware whether you know the parliament Most of its members One of the presidents perhaps No only a counselor of the name of Vanel Aramis became perfectly purple Vanel he cried rising abruptly from his seat Vanel the husband of Marguerite Vanel Exactly Of your former mistress Yes my dear fellow she is anxious to be the wife of the procureur general I certainly owed poor Vanel that slight concession and I am a gainer by it since I at the same time can confer a pleasure on his wife Aramis walked straight up to Fouquet and took hold of his hand Do you know he said very calmly the name of Madame Vanel s new lover Ah she has a new lover then I was not aware of it no I have no idea what his name is His name is M Jean Baptiste Colbert he is intendant of the finances he lives in the Rue Croix des Petits Champs where Madame de Chevreuse has been this evening to take him Mazarin s letters which she wishes to sell Gracious Heaven murmured Fouquet passing his hand across his forehead from which the perspiration was starting You now begin to understand do you not That I am utterly lost yes Do you now think it worth while to be so scrupulous with regard to keeping your word Yes said Fouquet These obstinate people always contrive matters in such a way that one cannot but admire them all the while murmured Aramis Fouquet held out his hand to him and at the very moment a richly ornamented tortoise shell clock supported by golden figures which was standing on a console table opposite to the fireplace struck six The sound of a door being opened in the vestibule was heard and Gourville came to the door of the cabinet to inquire if Fouquet would received M Vanel Fouquet turned his eyes from the gaze of Aramis and then desired that M Vanel should be shown in Chapter XLIX Monsieur Colbert s Rough Draft Vanel who entered at this stage of the conversation was nothing less for Aramis and Fouquet than the full stop which completes a phrase But for Vanel Aramis s presence in Fouquet s cabinet had quite another signification and therefore at his first step into the room he paused as he looked at the delicate yet firm features of the bishop of Vannes and his look of astonishment soon became one of scrutinizing attention As for Fouquet a perfect politician that is to say complete master of himself he had already by the energy of his own resolute will contrived to remove from his face all traces of the emotion which Aramis s revelation had occasioned He was no longer therefore a man overwhelmed by misfortune and reduced to resort to expedients he held his head proudly erect and indicated by a gesture that Vanel could enter He was now the first minister of the state and in his own palace Aramis knew the superintendent well the delicacy of the feelings of his heart and the exalted nature of his mind no longer surprised him He confined himself then for the moment intending to resume later an active part in the conversation to the performance of the difficult part of a man who looks on and listens in order to learn and understand Vanel was visibly overcome and advanced into the middle of the cabinet bowing to everything and everybody I am here he said You are punctual Monsieur Vanel returned Fouquet In matters of business monseigneur replied Vanel I look upon exactitude as a virtue No doubt monsieur I beg your pardon interrupted Aramis indicating Vanel with his finger but addressing himself to Fouquet this is the gentleman I believe who has come about the purchase of your appointment Yes I am replied Vanel astonished at the extremely haughty tone in which Aramis had put the question but in what way am I to address you who do me the honor Call me monseigneur replied Aramis dryly Vanel bowed Come gentlemen a truce to these ceremonies let us proceed to the matter itself Monseigneur sees said Vanel that I am waiting your pleasure On the contrary I am waiting replied Fouquet What for may I be permitted to ask monseigneur I thought that you had perhaps something to say Oh said Vanel to himself he has reflected on the matter and I am lost But resuming his courage he continued No monseigneur nothing absolutely nothing more than what I said to you yesterday and which I am again ready to repeat to you now Come now tell me frankly Monsieur Vanel is not the affair rather a burdensome one for you Certainly monseigneur fourteen hundred thousand francs is an important sum So important indeed said Fouquet that I have reflected You have been reflecting do you say monseigneur exclaimed Vanel anxiously Yes that you might not yet be in a position to purchase Oh monseigneur Do not make yourself uneasy on that score Monsieur Vanel I shall not blame you for a failure in your word which evidently may arise from inability on your part Oh yes monseigneur you would blame me and you would be right in doing so said Vanel for a man must either be very imprudent or a fool to undertake engagements which he cannot keep and I at least have always regarded a thing agreed on as a thing actually carried out Fouquet colored while Aramis uttered a Hum of impatience You would be wrong to exaggerate such notions as those monsieur said the superintendent for a man s mind is variable and full of these very excusable caprices which are however sometimes estimable enough and a man may have wished for something yesterday of which he repents to day Vanel felt a cold sweat trickle down his face Monseigneur he muttered Aramis who was delighted to find the superintendent carry on the debate with such clearness and precision stood leaning his arm upon the marble top of a console table and began to play with a small gold knife with a malachite handle Fouquet did not hasten to reply but after a moment s pause Come my dear Monsieur Vanel he said I will explain to you how I am situated Vanel began to tremble Yesterday I wished to sell Monseigneur did more than wish to sell he actually sold Well well that may be so but to day I ask you the favor to restore me my word which I pledged you I received your word as a satisfactory assurance that it would be kept I know that and that is the reason why I now entreat you do you understand me I entreat you to restore it to me Fouquet suddenly paused The words I entreat you the effect of which he did not immediately perceive seemed almost to choke him as he uttered it Aramis still playing with his knife fixed a look upon Vanel which seemed as if he wished to penetrate the recesses of his heart Vanel simply bowed as he said I am overcome monseigneur at the honor you do me to consult me upon a matter of business which is already completed but Nay do not say but dear Monsieur Vanel Alas monseigneur you see he said as he opened a large pocket book I have brought the money with me the whole sum I mean And here monseigneur is the contract of sale which I have just effected of a property belonging to my wife The order is authentic in every particular the necessary signatures have been attached to it and it is made payable at sight it is ready money in fact and in one word the whole affair is complete My dear Monsieur Vanel there is not a matter of business in this world however important it may be which cannot be postponed in order to oblige a man who by that means might and would be made a devoted friend Certainly said Vanel awkwardly And much more justly acquired would that friend become Monsieur Vanel since the value of the service he had received would have been so considerable Well what do you say what do you decide Vanel preserved a perfect silence In the meantime Aramis had continued his close observation of the man Vanel s narrow face his deeply sunken eyes his arched eyebrows had revealed to the bishop of Vannes the type of an avaricious and ambitious character Aramis s method was to oppose one passion by another He saw that M Fouquet was defeated morally subdued and so he came to his rescue with fresh weapons in his hands Excuse me monseigneur he said you forgot to show M Vanel that his own interests are diametrically opposed to this renunciation of the sale Vanel looked at the bishop with astonishment he had hardly expected to find an auxiliary in him Fouquet also paused to listen to the bishop Do you not see continued Aramis that M Vanel in order to purchase your appointment has been obliged to sell a property belonging to his wife well that is no slight matter for one cannot displace as he has done fourteen or fifteen hundred thousand francs without some considerable loss and very serious inconvenience Perfectly true said Vanel whose secret Aramis had with keen sighted gaze wrung from the bottom of his heart Inconveniences such as these are matters of great expense and calculation and whenever a man has money matters to deal with the expenses are generally the very first thing thought of Yes yes said Fouquet who began to understand Aramis s meaning Vanel remained perfectly silent he too had understood him Aramis observed his coldness of manner and his silence Very good he said to himself you are waiting I see until you know the amount but do not fear I shall send you such a flight of crowns that you cannot but capitulate on the spot We must offer M Vanel a hundred thousand crowns at once said Fouquet carried away by his generous feelings The sum was a good one A prince even would have been satisfied with such a bonus A hundred thousand crowns at that period was the dowry of a king s daughter Vanel however did not move He is a perfect rascal thought the bishop well we must offer the five hundred thousand francs at once and he made a sign to Fouquet accordingly You seem to have spent more than that dear Monsieur Vanel said the superintendent The price of ready money is enormous You must have made a great sacrifice in selling your wife s property Well what can I have been thinking of I ought to have offered to sign you an order for five hundred thousand francs and even in that case I shall feel that I am greatly indebted to you There was not a gleam of delight or desire on Vanel s face which remained perfectly impassible not a muscle of it changed in the slightest degree Aramis cast a look almost of despair at Fouquet and then going straight up to Vanel and taking hold of him by the coat in a familiar manner he said Monsieur Vanel it is neither the inconvenience nor the displacement of your money nor the sale of your wife s property even that you are thinking of at this moment it is something more important still I can well understand it so pay particular attention to what I am going to say Yes monseigneur Vanel replied beginning to tremble in every limb as the prelate s eyes seemed almost ready to devour him I offer you therefore in the superintendent s name not three hundred thousand livres nor five hundred thousand but a million A million do you understand me he added as he shook him nervously A million repeated Vanel as pale as death A million in other words at the present rate of interest an income of seventy thousand francs Come monsieur said Fouquet you can hardly refuse that Answer do you accept Impossible murmured Vanel Aramis bit his lips and something like a cloud seemed to pass over his face The thunder behind this cloud could easily be imagined He still kept his hold on Vanel You have purchased the appointment for fifteen hundred thousand francs I think Well you will receive these fifteen hundred thousand francs back again by paying M Fouquet a visit and shaking hands with him on the bargain you will have become a gainer of a million and a half You get honor and profit at the same time Monsieur Vanel I cannot do it said Vanel hoarsely Very well replied Aramis who had grasped Vanel so tightly by the coat that when he let go his hold Vanel staggered back a few paces very well one can now see clearly enough your object in coming here Yes said Fouquet one can easily see that But said Vanel attempting to stand erect before the weakness of these two men of honor Does the fellow presume to speak said Aramis with the tone of an emperor Fellow repeated Vanel The scoundrel I meant to say added Aramis who had now resumed his usual self possession Come monsieur produce your deed of sale you have it about you I suppose in one of your pockets already prepared as an assassin holds his pistol or his dagger concealed under his cloak Vanel began to mutter something Enough cried Fouquet Where is this deed Vanel tremblingly searched in his pockets and as he drew out his pocket book a paper fell out of it while Vanel offered the other to Fouquet Aramis pounced upon the paper which had fallen out as soon as he recognized the handwriting I beg your pardon said Vanel that is a rough draft of the deed I see that very clearly retorted Aramis with a smile more cutting than a lash of a whip and what I admire most is that this draft is in M Colbert s handwriting Look monseigneur look And he handed the draft to Fouquet who recognized the truth of the fact for covered with erasures with inserted words the margins filled with additions this deed a living proof of Colbert s plot had just revealed everything to its unhappy victim Well murmured Fouquet Vanel completely humiliated seemed as if he were looking for some hole wherein to hide himself Well said Aramis if your name were not Fouquet and if your enemy s name were not Colbert if you had not this mean thief before you I should say to you Repudiate it such a proof as this absolves you from your word but these fellows would think you were afraid they would fear you less than they do therefore sign the deed at once And he held out a pen towards him Fouquet pressed Aramis s hand but instead of the deed which Vanel handed to him he took the rough draft of it No not that paper said Aramis hastily this is the one The other is too precious a document for you to part with No no replied Fouquet I will sign under M Colbert s own handwriting even and I write The handwriting is approved of He then signed and said Here it is Monsieur Vanel And the latter seized the paper dashed down the money and was about to make his escape One moment said Aramis Are you quite sure the exact amount is there It ought to be counted over Monsieur Vanel particularly since M Colbert makes presents of money to ladies I see Ah that worthy M Colbert is not so generous as M Fouquet And Aramis spelling every word every letter of the order to pay distilled his wrath and his contempt drop by drop upon the miserable wretch who had to submit to this torture for a quarter of an hour He was then dismissed not in words but by a gesture as one dismisses or discharges a beggar or a menial As soon as Vanel had gone the minister and the prelate their eyes fixed on each other remained silent for a few moments Well said Aramis the first to break the silence to what can that man be compared who at the very moment he is on the point of entering into a conflict with an enemy armed from head to foot panting for his life presents himself for the contest utterly defenseless throws down his arms and smiles and kisses his hands to his adversary in the most gracious manner Good faith M Fouquet is a weapon which scoundrels frequently make use of against men of honor and it answers their purpose Men of honor ought in their turn also to make use of dishonest means against such scoundrels You would soon see how strong they would become without ceasing to be men of honor What they did would be termed the acts of a scoundrel replied Fouquet Far from that it would be merely coquetting or playing with the truth At all events since you have finished with this Vanel since you have deprived yourself of the happiness of confounding him by repudiating your word and since you have given up for the purpose of being used against yourself the only weapon which can ruin you My dear friend said Fouquet mournfully you are like the teacher of philosophy whom La Fontaine was telling us about the other day he saw a child drowning and began to read him a lecture divided into three heads Aramis smiled as he said Philosophy yes teacher yes a drowning child yes but a child can be saved you shall see But first of all let us talk about business Did you not some time ago he continued as Fouquet looked at him with a bewildered air speak to me about an idea you had of giving a fete at Vaux Oh said Fouquet that was when affairs were flourishing A fete I believe to which the king invited himself of his own accord No no my dear prelate a fete to which M Colbert advised the king to invite himself Ah exactly as it would be a fete of so costly a character that you would be ruined in giving it Precisely so In happier days as I said just now I had a kind of pride in showing my enemies how inexhaustible my resources were I felt it a point of honor to strike them with amazement by creating millions under circumstances where they imagined nothing but bankruptcies and failures would follow But at present I am arranging my accounts with the state with the king with myself and I must now become a mean stingy man I shall be able to prove to the world that I can act or operate with my deniers as I used to do with my bags of pistoles and from to morrow my equipages shall be sold my mansions mortgaged my expenses curtailed From to morrow interrupted Aramis quietly you will occupy yourself without the slightest delay with your fete at Vaux which must hereafter be spoken of as one of the most magnificent productions of your most prosperous days Are you mad Chevalier d Herblay I do you think so What do you mean then Do you not know that a fete at Vaux one of the very simplest possible character would cost four or five millions I do not speak of a fete of the very simplest possible character my dear superintendent But since the fete is to be given to the king replied Fouquet who misunderstood Aramis s idea it cannot be simple Just so it ought to be on a scale of the most unbounded magnificence In that case I shall have to spend ten or twelve millions You shall spend twenty if you require it said Aramis in a perfectly calm voice Where shall I get them exclaimed Fouquet That is my affair monsieur le surintendant and do not be uneasy for a moment about it The money shall be placed at once at your disposal the moment you have arranged the plans of your fete Chevalier chevalier said Fouquet giddy with amazement whither are you hurrying me Across the gulf into which you were about to fall replied the bishop of Vannes Take hold of my cloak and throw fear aside Why did you not tell me that sooner Aramis There was a day when with one million only you could have saved me whilst to day Whilst to day I can give you twenty said the prelate Such is the case however the reason is very simple On the day you speak of I had not the million which you had need of at my disposal whilst now I can easily procure the twenty millions we require May Heaven hear you and save me Aramis resumed his usual smile the expression of which was so singular Heaven never fails to hear me he said I abandon myself to you unreservedly Fouquet murmured No no I do not understand it in that manner I am unreservedly devoted to you Therefore as you have the clearest the most delicate and the most ingenious mind of the two you shall have entire control over the fete even to the very smallest details Only Only said Fouquet as a man accustomed to understand and appreciate the value of a parenthesis Well then leaving the entire invention of the details to you I shall reserve to myself a general superintendence over the execution In what way I mean that you will make of me on that day a major domo a sort of inspector general or factotum something between a captain of the guard and manager or steward I will look after the people and will keep the keys of the doors You will give your orders of course but will give them to no one but me They will pass through my lips to reach those for whom they are intended you understand No I am very far from understanding But you agree Of course of course my friend That is all I care about then Thanks and now go and prepare your list of invitations Whom shall I invite Everybody you know Chapter L In Which the Author Thinks It Is High Time to Return to the Vicomte de Bragelonne Our readers will have observed in this story the adventures of the new and of the past generation being detailed as it were side by side He will have noticed in the former the reflection of the glory of earlier years the experience of the bitter things of this world in the former also that peace which takes possession of the heart and that healing of the scars which were formerly deep and painful wounds In the latter the conflicts of love and vanity bitter disappointments ineffable delights life instead of memory If therefore any variety has been presented to the reader in the different episodes of this tale it is to be attributed to the numerous shades of color which are presented on this double tablet where two pictures are seen side by side mingling and harmonizing their severe and pleasing tones The repose of the emotions of one is found in harmonious contrast with the fiery sentiments of the other After having talked reason with older heads one loves to talk nonsense with youth Therefore if the threads of the story do not seem very intimately to connect the chapter we are now writing with the one we have just written we do not intend to give ourselves any more thought or trouble about it than Ruysdael took in painting an autumn sky after having finished a spring time scene We accordingly resume Raoul de Bragelonne s story at the very place where our last sketch left him In a state of frenzy and dismay or rather without power or will of his own hardly knowing what he was doing he fled swiftly after the scene in La Valliere s chamber that strange exclusion Louise s grief Montalais s terror the king s wrath all seemed to indicate some misfortune But what He had arrived from London because he had been told of the existence of a danger and almost on his arrival this appearance of danger was manifest Was not this sufficient for a lover Certainly it was but it was insufficient for a pure and upright heart such as his And yet Raoul did not seek for explanations in the very quarter where more jealous or less timid lovers would have done He did not go straightaway to his mistress and say Louise is it true that you love me no longer Is it true that you love another Full of courage full of friendship as he was full of love a religious observer of his word and believing blindly the word of others Raoul said within himself Guiche wrote to put me on my guard Guiche knows something I will go and ask Guiche what he knows and tell him what I have seen The journey was not a long one Guiche who had been brought from Fontainebleau to Paris within the last two days was beginning to recover from his wounds and to walk about a little in his room He uttered a cry of joy as he saw Raoul with the eagerness of friendship enter the apartment Raoul was unable to refrain from a cry of grief when he saw De Guiche so pale so thin so melancholy A very few words and a simple gesture which De Guiche made to put aside Raoul s arm were sufficient to inform the latter of the truth Ah so it is said Raoul seating himself beside his friend one loves and dies No no not dies replied Guiche smiling since I am now recovering and since too I can press you in my arms Ah I understand And I understand you too You fancy I am unhappy Raoul Alas No I am the happiest of men My body suffers but not my mind or my heart If you only knew Oh I am indeed the very happiest of men So much the better said Raoul so much the better provided it lasts It is over I have had enough happiness to last me to my dying day Raoul I have no doubt you have had but she Listen I love her because but you are not listening to me I beg your pardon Your mind is preoccupied Yes your health in the first place It is not that I know My dear friend you would be wrong I think to ask me any questions you of all persons in the world and he laid so much weight upon the you that he completely enlightened his friend upon the nature of the evil and the difficulty of remedying it You say that Raoul on account of what I wrote to you Certainly We will talk over that matter a little when you have finished telling me of all your own pleasures and your pains My dear friend I am entirely at your service Thank you I have hurried I have flown here I came in half the time the government couriers usually take Now tell me my dear friend what did you want Nothing whatever but to make you come Well then I am here All is quite right then There must have been something else I suppose No indeed De Guiche Upon my honor You cannot possibly have crushed all my hopes so violently or have exposed me to being disgraced by the king for my return which is in disobedience of his orders you cannot I say have planted jealousy in my heart merely to say to me It is all right be perfectly easy I do not say to you Raoul Be perfectly easy but pray understand me I never will nor can I indeed tell you anything else What sort of person do you take me for What do you mean If you know anything why conceal it from me If you do not know anything why did you write so warningly True true I was very wrong and I regret having done so Raoul It seems nothing to write to a friend and say Come but to have this friend face to face to feel him tremble and breathlessly and anxiously wait to hear what one hardly dare tell him is very difficult Dare I have courage enough if you have not exclaimed Raoul in despair See how unjust you are and how soon you forget you have to do with a poor wounded fellow such as your unhappy friend is So calm yourself Raoul I said to you Come you are here so ask me nothing further Your object in telling me to come was your hope that I should see with my own eyes was it not Nay do not hesitate for I have seen all Oh exclaimed De Guiche Or at least I thought There now you see you are not sure But if you have any doubt my poor friend what remains for me to do I saw Louise much agitated Montalais in a state of bewilderment the king The king Yes You turn your head aside The danger is there the evil is there tell me is it not so is it not the king I say nothing Oh you say a thousand times more than nothing Give me facts for pity s sake give me proofs My friend the only friend I have speak tell me all My heart is crushed wounded to death I am dying from despair If that really be so as I see it is indeed dear Raoul replied De Guiche you relieve me from my difficulty and I will tell you all perfectly sure that I can tell you nothing but what is consoling compared to the despair from which I see you suffering Go on go on I am listening Well then I can only tell you what you might learn from every one you meet From every one do you say It is talked about then Before you say people talk about it learn what it is that people have to talk about I assure you solemnly that people only talk about what may in truth be very innocent perhaps a walk Ah a walk with the king Yes certainly a walk with the king and I believe the king has already very frequently before taken walks with ladies without on that account You would not have written to me shall I say again if there had been nothing unusual in this promenade I know that while the storm lasted it would have been far better if the king had taken shelter somewhere else than to have remained with his head uncovered before La Valliere but the king is so very courteous and polite Oh De Guiche De Guiche you are killing me Do not let us talk any more then Nay let us continue This walk was followed by others I suppose No I mean yes there was the adventure of the oak I think But I know nothing about the matter at all Raoul rose De Guiche endeavored to imitate him notwithstanding his weakness Well I will not add another word I have said either too much or not enough Let others give you further information if they will or if they can my duty was to warn you and that I have done Watch over your own affairs now yourself Question others Alas you are no true friend to speak to me in that manner said the young man in utter distress The first man I meet may be either evilly disposed or a fool if the former he will tell me a lie to make me suffer more than I do now if the latter he will do worse still Ah De Guiche De Guiche before two hours are over I shall have been told ten falsehoods and shall have as many duels on my hands Save me then is it not best to know the worst always But I know nothing I tell you I was wounded attacked by fever out of my senses and I have only a very faint recollection of it all But there is no reason why we should search very far when the very man we want is close at hand Is not D Artagnan your friend Oh true true Got to him then He will be able to throw sufficient light upon the subject At this moment a lackey entered the room What is it said De Guiche Some one is waiting for monseigneur in the Cabinet des Porcelaines Very well Will you excuse me my dear Raoul I am so proud since I have been able to walk again I would offer you my arm De Guiche if I did not guess that the person in question is a lady I believe so said De Guiche smiling as he quitted Raoul Raoul remained motionless absorbed in grief overwhelmed like the miner upon whom a vault has just fallen in who wounded his life blood welling fast his thoughts confused endeavors to recover himself to save his life and to retain his reason A few minutes were all Raoul needed to dissipate the bewildering sensations occasioned by these two revelations He had already recovered the thread of his ideas when suddenly through the door he fancied he recognized Montalais s voice in the Cabinet des Porcelaines She he cried Yes it is indeed her voice She will be able to tell me the whole truth but shall I question her here She conceals herself even from me she is coming no doubt from Madame I will see her in her own apartment She will explain her alarm her flight the strange manner in which I was driven out she will tell me all that after M d Artagnan who knows everything shall have given me a fresh strength and courage Madame a coquette I fear and yet a coquette who is herself in love has her moments of kindness a coquette who is as capricious and uncertain as life or death but who tells De Guiche that he is the happiest of men He at least is lying on roses And so he hastily quitted the comte s apartments reproaching himself as he went for having talked of nothing but his own affairs to De Guiche and soon reached D Artagnan s quarters Chapter LI Bragelonne Continues His Inquiries The captain sitting buried in his leathern armchair his spurs fixed in the floor his sword between his legs was reading a number of letters as he twisted his mustache D Artagnan uttered a welcome full of pleasure when he perceived his friend s son Raoul my boy he said by what lucky accident does it happen that the king has recalled you These words did not sound agreeably in the young man s ears who as he seated himself replied Upon my word I cannot tell you all that I know is I have come back Hum said D Artagnan folding up his letters and directing a look full of meaning at him what do you say my boy that the king has not recalled you and you have returned I do not understand that at all Raoul was already pale enough and he now began to turn his hat round and round in his hand What the deuce is the matter that you look as you do and what makes you so dumb said the captain Do people nowadays assume that sort of airs in England I have been in England and came here again as lively as a chaffinch Will you not say something I have too much to say Ah how is your father Forgive me my dear friend I was going to ask you that D Artagnan increased the sharpness of his penetrating gaze which no secret was capable of resisting You are unhappy about something he said I am indeed and you know the reason very well Monsieur d Artagnan I Of course Nay do not pretend to be astonished I am not pretending to be astonished my friend Dear captain I know very well that in all trials of finesse as well as in all trials of strength I shall be beaten by you You can see that at the present moment I am an idiot an absolute noodle I have neither head nor arm do not despise but help me In two words I am the most wretched of living beings Oh oh why that inquired D Artagnan unbuckling his belt and thawing the asperity of his smile Because Mademoiselle de la Valliere is deceiving me She is deceiving you said D Artagnan not a muscle of whose face had moved those are big words Who makes use of them Every one Ah if every one says so there must be some truth in it I begin to believe there is fire when I see smoke It is ridiculous perhaps but it is so Therefore you do believe me exclaimed Bragelonne quickly I never mix myself up in affairs of that kind you know that very well What not for a friend for a son Exactly If you were a stranger I should tell you I will tell you nothing at all How is Porthos do you know Monsieur cried Raoul pressing D Artagnan s hand I entreat you in the name of the friendship you vowed my father The deuce take it you are really ill from curiosity No it is not from curiosity it is from love Good Another big word If you were really in love my dear Raoul you would be very different What do you mean I mean that if you were really so deeply in love that I could believe I was addressing myself to your heart but it is impossible I tell you I love Louise to distraction D Artagnan could read to the very bottom of the young man s heart Impossible I tell you he said You are like all young men you are not in love you are out of your senses Well suppose it were only that No sensible man ever succeeded in making much of a brain when the head was turned I have completely lost my senses in the same way a hundred times in my life You would listen to me but you would not hear me you would hear but you would not understand me you would understand but you would not obey me Oh try try I go far Even if I were unfortunate enough to know something and foolish enough to communicate it to you You are my friend you say Indeed yes Very good I should quarrel with you You would never forgive me for having destroyed your illusion as people say in love affairs Monsieur d Artagnan you know all and yet you plunge me in perplexity and despair in death itself There there now I never complain as you know but as Heaven and my father would never forgive me for blowing out my brains I will go and get the first person I meet to give me the information which you withhold I will tell him he lies and And you would kill him And a fine affair that would be So much the better What should I care Kill any one you please my boy if it gives you any pleasure It is exactly like a man with a toothache who keeps on saying Oh what torture I am suffering I could bite a piece of iron in half My answer always is Bite my friend bite the tooth will remain all the same I shall not kill any one monsieur said Raoul gloomily Yes yes you now assume a different tone instead of killing you will get killed yourself I suppose you mean Very fine indeed How much I should regret you Of course I should go about all day saying Ah what a fine stupid fellow that Bragelonne was as great a stupid as I ever met with I have passed my whole life almost in teaching him how to hold and use his sword properly and the silly fellow has got himself spitted like a lark Go then Raoul go and get yourself disposed of if you like I hardly know who can have taught you logic but deuce take me if your father has not been regularly robbed of his money Raoul buried his face in his hands murmuring No no I have not a single friend in the world Oh bah said D Artagnan I meet with nothing but raillery or indifference Idle fancies monsieur I do not laugh at you although I am a Gascon And as for being indifferent if I were so I should have sent you about your business a quarter of an hour ago for you would make a man who was out of his senses with delight as dull as possible and would be the death of one who was out of spirits How now young man do you wish me to disgust you with the girl you are attached to and to teach you to execrate the whole sex who constitute the honor and happiness of human life Oh tell me monsieur and I will bless you Do you think my dear fellow that I can have crammed into my brain all about the carpenter and the painter and the staircase and a hundred other similar tales of the same kind A carpenter what do you mean Upon my word I don t know some one told me there was a carpenter who made an opening through a certain flooring In La Valliere s room Oh I don t know where In the king s apartment perhaps Of course if it were in the king s apartment I should tell you I suppose In whose room then I have told you for the last hour that I know nothing of the whole affair But the painter then the portrait It seems that the king wished to have the portrait of one of the ladies belonging to the court La Valliere Why you seem to have only that name in your mouth Who spoke to you of La Valliere If it be not her portrait then why do you suppose it would concern me I do not suppose it will concern you But you ask me all sorts of questions and I answer you You positively will learn all the scandal of the affair and I tell you make the best you can of it Raoul struck his forehead with his hand in utter despair It will kill me he said So you have said already Yes you are right and he made a step or two as if he were going to leave Where are you going To look for some one who will tell me the truth Who is that A woman Mademoiselle de la Valliere herself I suppose you mean said D Artagnan with a smile Ah a famous idea that You wish to be consoled by some one and you will be so at once She will tell you nothing ill of herself of course So be off You are mistaken monsieur replied Raoul the woman I mean will tell me all the evil she possibly can You allude to Montalais I suppose her friend a woman who on that account will exaggerate all that is either bad or good in the matter Do not talk to Montalais my good fellow You have some reasons for wishing me not to talk with Montalais Well I admit it And in point of fact why should I play with you as a cat does with a poor mouse You distress me you do indeed And if I wish you not to speak to Montalais just now it is because you will be betraying your secret and people will take advantage of it Wait if you can I cannot So much the worse Why you see Raoul if I had an idea but I have not got one Promise me that you will pity me my friend that is all I need and leave me to get out of the affair by myself Oh yes indeed in order that you may get deeper into the mire A capital idea truly go and sit down at that table and take a pen in your hand What for To write and ask Montalais to give you an interview Ah said Raoul snatching eagerly at the pen which the captain held out to him Suddenly the door opened and one of the musketeers approaching D Artagnan said Captain Mademoiselle de Montalais is here and wishes to speak to you To me murmured D Artagnan Ask her to come in I shall soon see he said to himself whether she wishes to speak to me or not The cunning captain was quite right in his suspicions for as soon as Montalais entered she exclaimed Oh monsieur monsieur I beg your pardon Monsieur d Artagnan Oh I forgive you mademoiselle said D Artagnan I know that at my age those who are looking for me generally need me for something or another I was looking for M de Bragelonne replied Montalais How very fortunate that is he was looking for you too Raoul will you accompany Mademoiselle de Montalais Oh certainly Go along then he said as he gently pushed Raoul out of the cabinet and then taking hold of Montalais s hand he said in a low voice Be kind towards him spare him and spare her too if you can Ah she said in the same tone of voice it is not I who am going to speak to him Who then It is Madame who has sent for him Very good cried D Artagnan it is Madame is it In an hour s time then the poor fellow will be cured Or else dead said Montalais in a voice full of compassion Adieu Monsieur d Artagnan she said and she ran to join Raoul who was waiting for her at a little distance from the door very much puzzled and thoroughly uneasy at the dialogue which promised no good augury for him Chapter LII Two Jealousies 
7879-274163-0000	train-other-500	Lovers are tender towards everything that forms part of the daily life of the object of their affection Raoul no sooner found himself alone with Montalais than he kissed her hand with rapture There there said the young girl sadly
7879-274163-0001	train-other-500	you are throwing your kisses away I will guarantee that they will not bring you back any interest How so Why Will you explain to me my dear Aure Madame will explain everything to you I am going to take you to her apartments
7879-274163-0002	train-other-500	What Silence and throw away your dark and savage looks The windows here have eyes the walls have ears Have the kindness not to look at me any longer be good enough to speak to me aloud of the rain
7879-274163-0003	train-other-500	of the fine weather and of the charms of England At all events interrupted Raoul I tell you I warn you that wherever people may be I know not how Madame is sure to have eyes and ears open
7879-274163-0004	train-other-500	I am not very desirous you can easily believe of being dismissed or thrown in to the Bastile Let us talk I tell you or rather do not let us talk at all
7879-274163-0005	train-other-500	Raoul clenched his hands and tried to assume the look and gait of a man of courage it is true but of a man of courage on his way to the torture chamber Montalais glancing in every direction walking along with an easy swinging gait
7879-274163-0006	train-other-500	and holding up her head pertly in the air preceded him to Madame s apartments where he was at once introduced Well he thought this day will pass away without my learning anything Guiche showed too much consideration for my feelings
7879-274163-0007	train-other-500	he had no doubt come to an understanding with Madame and both of them by a friendly plot agreed to postpone the solution of the problem Why have I not a determined inveterate enemy
none	none	 that serpent De Wardes 
7879-274163-0008	train-other-500	for instance that he would bite is very likely but I should not hesitate any more To hesitate to doubt better far to die The next moment Raoul was in Madame s presence
7879-274163-0009	train-other-500	Henrietta more charming than ever was half lying half reclining in her armchair her small feet upon an embroidered velvet cushion she was playing with a kitten with long silky fur
7879-274163-0010	train-other-500	which was biting her fingers and hanging by the lace of her collar Madame seemed plunged in deep thought so deep indeed that it required both Montalais and Raoul s voice to disturb her from her reverie Your highness sent for me
7879-274163-0011	train-other-500	repeated Raoul Madame shook her head as if she were just awakening and then said
none	none	 Good morning Monsieur de Bragelonne 
7879-274163-0012	train-other-500	yes I sent for you so you have returned from England Yes Madame and am at your royal highness s commands Thank you leave us Montalais and the latter immediately left the room
none	none	 You have a few minutes to give me Monsieur de Bragelonne have you not 
7879-274163-0013	train-other-500	My life is at your royal highness s disposal Raoul returned with respect guessing that there was something serious in these unusual courtesies nor was he displeased indeed to observe the seriousness of her manner
7879-274163-0014	train-other-500	feeling persuaded that there was some sort of affinity between Madame s sentiments and his own In fact every one at court of any perception at all
7879-274163-0015	train-other-500	knew perfectly well the capricious fancy and absurd despotism of the princess s singular character Madame had been flattered beyond all bounds by the king s attention she had made herself talked about
7879-274163-0016	train-other-500	she had inspired the queen with that mortal jealousy which is the stinging scorpion at the heel of every woman s happiness Madame in a word in her attempts to cure a wounded pride found that her heart had become deeply and passionately attached
none	none	 We know what Madame had done to recall Raoul who had been sent out of the way by Louis XIV Raoul did not know of her letter to Charles II 
7879-274163-0017	train-other-500	although D Artagnan had guessed its contents Who will undertake to account for that seemingly inexplicable mixture of love and vanity that passionate tenderness of feeling that prodigious duplicity of conduct
7879-274163-0018	train-other-500	No one can indeed not even the bad angel who kindles the love of coquetry in the heart of a woman
none	none	 Monsieur de Bragelonne said the princess after a moment s pause 
7879-274163-0019	train-other-500	have you returned satisfied Bragelonne looked at Madame Henrietta and seeing how pale she was not alone from what she was keeping back but also from what she was burning to say said Satisfied
7879-274163-0020	train-other-500	what is there for me to be satisfied or dissatisfied about Madame
none	none	 But what are those things with which a man of your age and of your appearance is usually either satisfied or dissatisfied 
7879-274163-0021	train-other-500	How eager she is thought Raoul almost terrified what venom is it she is going to distil into my heart and then frightened at what she might possibly be going to tell him and wishing to put off the opportunity of having everything explained
7879-274163-0022	train-other-500	which he had hitherto so ardently wished for yet had dreaded so much he replied I left Madame a dear friend in good health and on my return I find him very ill
none	none	 You refer to M de Guiche replied Madame Henrietta 
7879-274163-0023	train-other-500	with imperturbable self possession I have heard he is a very dear friend of yours He is indeed Madame Well it is quite true he has been wounded but he is better now Oh
none	none	 M de Guiche is not to be pitied she said hurriedly 
7879-274163-0024	train-other-500	and then recovering herself added But has he anything to complain of Has he complained of anything Is there any cause of grief or sorrow that we are not acquainted with I allude only to his wound Madame
none	none	 So much the better then for in other respects M de Guiche seems to be very happy 
7879-274163-0025	train-other-500	he is always in very high spirits
none	none	 I am sure that you Monsieur de Bragelonne would far prefer to be like him wounded only in the body 
7879-274163-0026	train-other-500	for what in deed is such a wound after all Raoul started Alas he said to himself she is returning to it What did you say she inquired I did not say anything Madame
7879-274163-0027	train-other-500	You did not say anything you disapprove of my observation then you are perfectly satisfied I suppose Raoul approached closer to her Madame he said your royal highness wishes to say something to me
7879-274163-0028	train-other-500	and your instinctive kindness and generosity of disposition induce you to be careful and considerate as to your manner of conveying it Will your royal highness throw this kind forbearance aside I am able to bear everything and I am listening
7879-274163-0029	train-other-500	Ah replied Henrietta what do you understand then That which your royal highness wishes me to understand said Raoul trembling notwithstanding his command over himself as he pronounced these words
7879-274163-0030	train-other-500	In point of fact murmured the princess it seems cruel but since I have begun Yes Madame once your highness has deigned to begin will you condescend to finish Henrietta rose hurriedly and walked a few paces up and down her room
none	none	 What did M de Guiche tell you she said suddenly 
7879-274163-0031	train-other-500	Nothing Madame Nothing Did he say nothing Ah how well I recognize him in that No doubt he wished to spare me And that is what friends call friendship
none	none	 But surely M d Artagnan whom you have just left must have told you 
7879-274163-0032	train-other-500	No more than De Guiche Madame Henrietta made a gesture full of impatience as she said At least you know all the court knows I know nothing at all Madame
none	none	 Not the scene in the storm No Madame Not the tete a tete in the forest No Madame Nor the flight to Chaillot 
7879-274163-0033	train-other-500	Raoul whose head dropped like a blossom cut down by the reaper made an almost superhuman effort to smile as he replied with the greatest gentleness
none	none	 I have had the honor of telling your royal highness that I am absolutely ignorant of everything 
7879-274163-0034	train-other-500	that I am a poor unremembered outcast who has this moment arrived from England There have rolled so many stormy waves between myself and those I left behind me here that the rumor of none of the circumstances your highness refers to
7879-274163-0035	train-other-500	has been able to reach me Henrietta was affected by his extreme pallor his gentleness and his great courage The principal feeling in her heart at that moment was an eager desire to hear the nature of the remembrance
none	none	 which the poor lover retained of the woman who had made him suffer so much Monsieur de Bragelonne she said that which your friends have refused to do I will do for you 
7879-274163-0036	train-other-500	whom I like and esteem very much I will be your friend on this occasion You hold your head high as a man of honor should and I deeply regret that you may have to bow before ridicule and in a few days it might be contempt
7879-274163-0037	train-other-500	Ah exclaimed Raoul perfectly livid It is as bad as that then If you do not know said the princess I see that you guess you were affianced I believe to Mademoiselle de la Valliere Yes Madame
7879-274163-0038	train-other-500	By that right you deserve to be warned about her as some day or another I shall be obliged to dismiss Mademoiselle de la Valliere from my service
none	none	 Dismiss La Valliere cried Bragelonne 
7879-274163-0039	train-other-500	Of course Do you suppose I shall always be amenable to the tears and protestations of the king No no my house shall no longer be made a convenience for such practices but you tremble you cannot stand
none	none	 No Madame no said Bragelonne making an effort over himself 
7879-274163-0040	train-other-500	I thought I should have died just now that was all Your royal highness did me the honor to say that the king wept and implored you Yes but in vain returned the princess
none	none	 who then related to Raoul the scene that took place at Chaillot 
7879-274163-0041	train-other-500	and the king s despair on his return she told him of his indulgence to herself and the terrible word with which the outraged princess the humiliated coquette had quashed the royal anger Raoul stood with his head bent down
7879-274163-0042	train-other-500	What do you think of it all she said The king loves her he replied But you seem to think she does not love him Alas Madame I was thinking of the time when she loved me
7879-274163-0043	train-other-500	Henrietta was for a moment struck with admiration at this sublime disbelief and then shrugging her shoulders she said You do not believe me I see How deeply you must love her And you doubt if she loves the king
7879-274163-0044	train-other-500	I do until I have a proof of it Forgive me Madame but she has given me her word
none	none	 and her mind and heart are too upright to tell a falsehood You require a proof Be it so Come with me then Chapter LIII A Domiciliary Visit The princess preceding Raoul led him through the courtyard towards that part of the building La Valliere inhabited and ascending the same staircase which Raoul himself had ascended that very morning she paused at the door of the room in which the young man had been so strangely received by Montalais The opportunity was remarkably well chosen to carry out the project Madame Henrietta had conceived for the chateau was empty The king the courtiers and the ladies of the court had set off for Saint Germain Madame Henrietta was the only one who knew of Bragelonne s return and thinking over the advantages which might be drawn from this return she had feigned indisposition in order to remain behind Madame was therefore confident of finding La Valliere s room and Saint Aignan s apartment perfectly empty She took a pass key from her pocket and opened the door of her maid of honor s apartment Bragelonne s gaze was immediately fixed upon the interior of the room which he recognized at once and the impression which the sight of it produced upon him was torture The princess looked at him and her practiced eye at once detected what was passing in the young man s heart You asked for proofs she said do not be astonished then if I give you them But if you do not think you have courage enough to confront them there is still time to withdraw I thank you Madame said Bragelonne but I came here to be convinced You promised to convince me do so Enter then said Madame and shut the door behind you Bragelonne obeyed and then turned towards the princess whom he interrogated by a look You know where you are I suppose inquired Madame Henrietta Everything leads me to believe I am in Mademoiselle de la Valliere s room You are But I would observe to your highness that this room is a room and is not a proof Wait said the princess as she walked to the foot of the bed folded up the screen into its several compartments and stooped down towards the floor Look here she continued stoop down and lift up this trap door yourself A trap door said Raoul astonished for D Artagnan s words began to return to his memory and he had an indistinct recollection that D Artagnan had made use of the same word He looked but uselessly for some cleft or crevice which might indicate an opening or a ring to assist in lifting up the planking Ah I forgot said Madame Henrietta I forgot the secret spring the fourth plank of the flooring press on the spot where you will observe a knot in the wood Those are the instructions press vicomte press I say yourself Raoul pale as death pressed his finger on the spot which had been indicated to him at the same moment the spring began to work and the trap rose of its own accord It is ingenious enough certainly said the princess and one can see that the architect foresaw that a woman s hand only would have to make use of this spring for see how easily the trap door opened without assistance A staircase cried Raoul Yes and a very pretty one too said Madame Henrietta See vicomte the staircase has a balustrade intended to prevent the falling of timid persons who might be tempted to descend the staircase and I will risk myself on it accordingly Come vicomte follow me But before following you madame may I ask where this staircase leads to Ah true I forgot to tell you You know perhaps that formerly M de Saint Aignan lived in the very next apartment to the king Yes Madame I am aware of that that was the arrangement at least before I left and more than once I had the honor of visiting his rooms Well he obtained the king s leave to change his former convenient and beautiful apartment for the two rooms to which this staircase will conduct us and which together form a lodging for him half the size and at ten times greater the distance from the king a close proximity to whom is by no means disdained in general by the gentlemen belonging to the court Very good Madame returned Raoul but go on I beg for I do not understand yet Well then it accidentally happened continued the princess that M de Saint Aignan s apartment is situated underneath the apartments of my maids of honor and by a further coincidence exactly underneath the room of La Valliere But what was the motive of this trap door and this staircase That I cannot tell you Would you like to go down to Monsieur de Saint Aignan s rooms Perhaps we shall be able to find the solution of the enigma there And Madame set the example by going down herself while Raoul sighing deeply followed her At every step Bragelonne took he advanced further into that mysterious apartment which had witnessed La Valliere s sighs and still retained the perfume of her presence Bragelonne fancied he perceived as he inhaled the atmosphere that the young girl must have passed through Then succeeded to these emanations of herself which he regarded as invisible though certain proofs flowers she preferred to all others books of her own selection If Raoul retained a single doubt on the subject it would have vanished at the secret harmony of tastes and connection of the mind with the ordinary objects of life La Valliere in Bragelonne s eyes was present there in each article of furniture in the color of the hangings in all that surrounded him Dumb and now completely overwhelmed there was nothing further for him now to learn and he followed his pitiless conductress as blindly as the culprit follows the executioner while Madame as cruel as women of overstrung temperaments generally are did not spare him the slightest detail But it must be admitted that notwithstanding the kind of apathy into which he had fallen none of these details even had he been left alone would have escaped him The happiness of the woman who loves when that happiness is derived from a rival is a living torture for a jealous man but for a jealous man such as Raoul was for one whose heart for the first time in its existence was being steeped in gall and bitterness Louise s happiness was in reality an ignominious death a death of body and soul He guessed all he fancied he could see them with their hands clasped in each other s their faces drawn close together and reflected side by side in loving proximity and they gazed upon the mirrors around them so sweet an occupation for lovers who as they thus see themselves twice over imprint the picture still more deeply on their memories He could guess too the stolen kiss snatched as they separated from each other s loved society The luxury the studied elegance eloquent of the perfection of indolence of ease the extreme care shown either to spare the loved object every annoyance or to occasion her a delightful surprise that might and majesty of love multiplied by the majesty and might of royalty itself seemed like a death blow to Raoul If there be anything which can in any way assuage or mitigate the tortures of jealousy it is the inferiority of the man who is preferred to yourself whilst on the very contrary if there be one anguish more bitter than another a misery for which language lacks a word it is the superiority of the man preferred to yourself superior perhaps in youth beauty grace It is in such moments as these that Heaven almost seems to have taken part against the disdained and rejected lover One final pang was reserved for poor Raoul Madame Henrietta lifted up a silk curtain and behind the canvas he perceived La Valliere s portrait Not only the portrait of La Valliere but of La Valliere radiant with youth beauty and happiness inhaling life and enjoyment at every pore because at eighteen years of age love itself is life Louise murmured Bragelonne Louise is it true then Oh you have never loved me for never have you looked at me in that manner And he felt as if his heart were crushed within his bosom Madame Henrietta looked at him almost envious of his extreme grief although she well knew there was nothing to envy in it and that she herself was as passionately loved by De Guiche as Louise by Bragelonne Raoul interpreted Madame Henrietta s look Oh forgive me forgive me Madame in your presence I know I ought to have greater self control But Heaven grant that you may never be struck by similar misery to that which crushes me at this moment for you are but a woman and would not be able to endure so terrible an affliction Forgive me I again entreat you Madame I am but a man without rank or position while you belong to a race whose happiness knows no bounds whose power acknowledges no limit Monsieur de Bragelonne replied Henrietta a mind such as your merits all the consideration and respect which a queen s heart even can bestow Regard me as your friend monsieur and as such indeed I would not allow your whole life to be poisoned by perfidy and covered with ridicule It was I indeed who with more courage than any of your pretended friends I except M de Guiche was the cause of your return from London it is I also who now give you the melancholy proofs necessary however for your cure if you are a lover with courage in his heart and not a weeping Amadis Do not thank me pity me even and do not serve the king less faithfully than you have done Raoul smiled bitterly Ah true true I was forgetting that the king is my master Your liberty nay your very life is in danger A steady penetrating look informed Madame Henrietta that she was mistaken and that her last argument was not a likely one to affect the young man Take care Monsieur de Bragelonne she said for if you do not weigh well all your actions you might throw into an extravagance of wrath a prince whose passions once aroused exceed the bounds of reason and you would thereby involve your friends and family in the deepest distress you must bend you must submit and you must cure yourself I thank you Madame I appreciate the advice your royal highness is good enough to give me and I will endeavor to follow it but one final word I beg Name it Should I be indiscreet in asking you the secret of this staircase of this trap door a secret which it seems you have discovered Nothing more simple For the purpose of exercising a surveillance over the young girls who are attached to my service I have duplicate keys of their doors It seemed very strange to me that M de Saint Aignan should change his apartments It seemed very strange that the king should come to see M de Saint Aignan every day and finally it seemed very strange that so many things should be done during your absence that the very habits and customs of the court appeared changed I do not wish to be trifled with by the king nor to serve as a cloak for his love affairs for after La Valliere who weeps incessantly he will take a fancy to Montalais who is always laughing and then to Tonnay Charente who does nothing but sing all day to act such a part as that would be unworthy of me I thrust aside the scruples which my friendship for you suggested I discovered the secret I have wounded your feelings I know and I again entreat you to pardon me but I had a duty to fulfil I have discharged it You are now forewarned the tempest will soon burst protect yourself accordingly You naturally expect however that a result of some kind must follow replied Bragelonne with firmness for you do not suppose I shall silently accept the shame thus thrust upon me or the treachery which has been practiced against me You will take whatever steps in the matter you please Monsieur Raoul only do not betray the source whence you derived the truth That is all I have to ask the only price I require for the service I have rendered you Fear nothing Madame said Bragelonne with a bitter smile I bribed the locksmith in whom the lovers confided You can just as well have done so as myself can you not Yes Madame Your royal highness however has no other advice or caution to give me except that of not betraying you None I am about therefore to beg your royal highness to allow me to remain here for one moment Without me Oh no Madame It matters very little for what I have to do can be done in your presence I only ask one moment to write a line to some one It is dangerous Monsieur de Bragelonne Take care No one can possibly know that your royal highness has done me the honor to conduct me here Besides I shall sign the letter I am going to write Do as you please then Raoul drew out his tablet and wrote rapidly on one of the leaves the following words MONSIEUR LE COMTE Do not be surprised to find this paper signed by me the friend I shall very shortly send to call on you will have the honor to explain the object of my visit VICOMTE RAOUL DE BRAGELONNE He rolled up the paper slipped it into the lock of the door which communicated with the room set apart for the two lovers and satisfied himself that the missive was so apparent that Saint Aignan could not but see it as he entered he rejoined the princess who had already reached the top of the staircase They then separated Raoul pretending to thank her highness Henrietta pitying or seeming to pity with all her heart the wretched young man she had just condemned to such fearful torture Oh she said as she saw him disappear pale as death and his eyes bursting with blood if I had foreseen this I would have hid the truth from that poor gentleman Chapter LIV Porthos s Plan of Action The great number of individuals we have introduced into this long story is the reason why each of them has been forced to appear only in turn according to the exigencies of the recital The result is that our readers have had no opportunity of meeting our friend Porthos since his return from Fontainebleau The honors which he had received from the king had not changed the easy affectionate character of that excellent hearted man he may perhaps have held up his head a little higher than usual and a majesty of demeanor as it were may have betrayed itself since the honor of dining at the king s table had been accorded him His majesty s banqueting room had produced a certain effect on Porthos Le Seigneur de Bracieux et de Pierrefonds delighted to remember that during that memorable dinner the numerous array of servants and the large number of officials in attendance on the guests gave a certain tone and effect to the repast and seemed as it were to furnish the room Porthos undertook to confer upon Mouston a position of some kind or other in order to establish a sort of hierarchy among his other domestics and to create a military household which was not unusual among the great captains of the age since in the preceding century this luxury had been greatly encouraged by Messieurs de Treville de Schomberg de la Vieuville without alluding to M de Richelieu M de Conde and de Bouillon Turenne And therefore why should not he Porthos the friend of the king and of M Fouquet a baron and engineer et cetera why should not he indeed enjoy all the delightful privileges which large possessions and unusual merit invariably confer Somewhat neglected by Aramis who we know was greatly occupied with M Fouquet neglected also on account of his being on duty by D Artagnan tired of Truchen and Planchet Porthos was surprised to find himself dreaming without precisely knowing why but if any one had said to him Do you want anything Porthos he would most certainly have replied Yes After one of those dinners during which Porthos attempted to recall to his recollection all the details of the royal banquet gently joyful thanks to the excellence of the wines gently melancholy thanks to his ambitious ideas Porthos was gradually falling off into a placid doze when his servant entered to announce that M de Bragelonne wished to speak to him Porthos passed into an adjoining room where he found his young friend in the disposition of mind we are already aware of Raoul advanced towards Porthos and shook him by the hand Porthos surprised at his seriousness of aspect offered him a seat Dear M du Vallon said Raoul I have a service to ask of you Nothing could happen more fortunately my young friend replied Porthos I have eight thousand livres sent me this morning from Pierrefonds and if you want any money No I thank you it is not money So much the worse then I have always heard it said that that is the rarest service but the easiest to render The remark struck me I like to cite remarks that strike me Your heart is as good as your mind is sound and true You are much too kind I declare You will dine here of course No I am not hungry Eh not dine What a dreadful country England is Not too much so indeed but Well if such excellent fish and meat were not to be procured there it would hardly be endurable Yes I came to I am listening Only just allow me to take a little sip One gets thirsty in Paris and he ordered a bottle of champagne to be brought and having first filled Raoul s glass he filled his own drank it down at a gulp and then resumed I needed that in order to listen to you with proper attention I am now entirely at your service What do you wish to ask me dear Raoul What do you want Give me your opinion on quarrels in general my dear friend My opinion Well but Explain your idea a little more coherently replied Porthos rubbing his forehead I mean you are generally good humored good tempered whenever any misunderstanding arises between a friend of yours and a stranger for instance Oh in the best of tempers Very good but what do you do in such a case Whenever any friend of mine gets into a quarrel I always act on one principle What is that That lost time is irreparable and one never arranges an affair so well as when everything has been done to embroil the disputants as much as possible Ah indeed is that the principle on which you proceed Precisely so as soon as a quarrel takes place I bring the two parties together Exactly You understand that by this means it is impossible for an affair not to be arranged I should have thought that treated in this manner an affair would on the contrary Oh not the least in the world Just fancy now I have had in my life something like a hundred and eighty to a hundred and ninety regular duels without reckoning hasty encounters or chance meetings It is a very handsome aggregate said Raoul unable to resist a smile A mere nothing but I am so gentle D Artagnan reckons his duels by hundreds It is very true he is a little too hard and sharp I have often told him so And so resumed Raoul you generally arrange the affairs of honor your friends confide to you There is not a single instance in which I have not finished by arranging every one of them said Porthos with a gentleness and confidence that surprised Raoul But the way in which you settle them is at least honorable I suppose Oh rely upon that and at this stage I will explain my other principle to you As soon as my friend has intrusted his quarrel to me this is what I do I go to his adversary at once armed with a politeness and self possession absolutely requisite under such circumstances That is the way then said Raoul bitterly that you arrange affairs so safely I believe you I go to the adversary then and say to him It is impossible monsieur that you are ignorant of the extent to which you have insulted my friend Raoul frowned at this remark It sometimes happens very often indeed pursued Porthos that my friend has not been insulted at all he has even been the first to give offense you can imagine therefore whether my language is or is not well chosen And Porthos burst into a peal of laughter Decidedly said Raoul to himself while the merry thunder of Porthos s laughter was resounding in his ears I am very unfortunate De Guiche treats me with coolness D Artagnan with ridicule Porthos is too tame no one will settle this affair in the only way I wish it to be settled And I came to Porthos because I wanted to find a sword instead of cold reasoning at my service My ill luck dogs me Porthos who had recovered himself continued By one simple expression I leave my adversary without an excuse That is as it may happen said Raoul absently Not at all it is quite certain I have not left him an excuse and then it is that I display all my courtesy in order to attain the happy issue of my project I advance therefore with an air of great politeness and taking my adversary by the hand I say to him Now that you are convinced of having given the offense we are sure of reparation between my friend and yourself the future can only offer an exchange of mutual courtesies of conduct and consequently my mission now is to acquaint you with the length of my friend s sword What said Raoul Wait a minute The length of my friend s sword My horse is waiting below my friend is in such and such a spot and is impatiently awaiting your agreeable society I will take you with me we can call upon your second as we go along and the affair is arranged And so said Raoul pale with vexation you reconcile the two adversaries on the ground I beg your pardon interrupted Porthos Reconcile What for You said that the affair was arranged Of course since my friend is waiting for him Well what then If he is waiting Well if he is waiting it is merely to stretch his legs a little The adversary on the contrary is stiff from riding they place themselves in proper order and my friend kills the opponent and the affair is ended Ah he kills him then cried Raoul I should think so said Porthos Is it likely I should ever have as a friend a man who allows himself to get killed I have a hundred and one friends at the head of the list stand your father Aramis and D Artagnan all of whom are living and well I believe Oh my dear baron exclaimed Raoul as he embraced Porthos You approve of my method then said the giant I approve of it so thoroughly that I shall have recourse to it this very day without a moment s delay at once in fact You are the very man I have been looking for Good here I am then you want to fight I suppose Absolutely It is very natural With whom With M de Saint Aignan I know him a most agreeable man who was exceedingly polite to me the day I had the honor of dining with the king I shall certainly acknowledge his politeness in return even if it had not happened to be my usual custom So he has given you an offense A mortal offense The deuce I can say so I suppose More than that even if you like That is a very great convenience I may look upon it as one of your arranged affairs may I not said Raoul smiling As a matter of course Where will you be waiting for him Ah I forgot it is a very delicate matter M de Saint Aignan is a very great friend of the king s So I have heard it said So that if I kill him Oh you will kill him certainly you must take every precaution to do so But there is no difficulty in these matters now if you had lived in our early days ah those were days worth living for My dear friend you do not quite understand me I mean that M de Saint Aignan being a friend of the king the affair will be more difficult to manage since the king might learn beforehand Oh no that is not likely You know my method Monsieur you have just injured my friend and Yes I know it And then Monsieur I have horses below I carry him off before he can have spoken to any one Will he allow himself to be carried off like that I should think so I should like to see it fail It would be the first time if it did It is true though that the young men of the present day Bah I would carry him off bodily if that were all and Porthos adding gesture to speech lifted Raoul and the chair he was sitting on off the ground and carried them round the room Very good said Raoul laughing All we have to do is to state the grounds of the quarrel with M de Saint Aignan Well but that is done it seems No my dear M du Vallon the usage of the present day requires that the cause of the quarrel should be explained Very good Tell me what it is then The fact is Deuce take it how troublesome all this is In former days we had no occasion to say anything about the matter People fought for the sake of fighting and I for one know no better reason than that You are quite right M du Vallon However tell me what the cause is It is too long a story to tell only as one must particularize to a certain extent and as on the other hand the affair is full of difficulties and requires the most absolute secrecy you will have the kindness merely to tell M de Saint Aignan that he has in the first place insulted me by changing his lodgings By changing his lodgings Good said Porthos who began to count on his fingers next Then in getting a trap door made in his new apartments I understand said Porthos a trap door upon my word that is very serious you ought to be furious at that What the deuce does the fellow mean by getting trap doors made without first consulting you Trap doors mordioux I haven t got any except in my dungeons at Bracieux And you will please add said Raoul that my last motive for considering myself insulted is the existence of the portrait that M de Saint Aignan well knows Is it possible A portrait too A change of residence a trap door and a portrait Why my dear friend with but one of these causes of complaint there is enough and more than enough for all the gentlemen in France and Spain to cut each other s throats and that is saying but very little Well my dear friend you are furnished with all you need I suppose I shall take a second horse with me Select your own rendezvous and while you are waiting there you can practice some of the best passes so as to get your limbs as elastic as possible Thank you I shall be waiting for you in the wood of Vincennes close to Minimes All goes well then Where am I to find this M de Saint Aignan At the Palais Royal Porthos ran a huge hand bell My court suit he said to the servant who answered the summons my horse and a led horse to accompany me Then turning to Raoul as soon as the servant had quitted the room he said Does your father know anything about this No I am going to write to him And D Artagnan No nor D Artagnan either He is very cautious you know and might have diverted me from my purpose D Artagnan is a sound adviser though said Porthos astonished that in his own loyal faith in D Artagnan any one could have thought of himself so long as there was a D Artagnan in the world Dear M du Vallon said Raoul do not question me any more I implore you I have told you all that I had to say it is prompt action I now expect sharp and decided as you know how to arrange it That indeed is my reason for having chosen you You will be satisfied with me replied Porthos Do not forget either that except ourselves no one must know anything of this meeting People generally find these things out said Porthos dryly when a dead body is discovered in a wood But I promise everything my dear friend except the concealment of the dead body There it is and it must be seen as a matter of course It is a principle of mine not to bury bodies That has a smack of the assassin about it Every risk has its peculiarities To work then my dear friend Rely upon me said the giant finishing the bottle while a servant spread out upon a sofa the gorgeously decorated dress trimmed with lace Raoul left the room saying to himself with a secret delight Perfidious king traitorous monarch I cannot reach thee I do not wish it for kings are sacred objects But your friend your accomplice your panderer the coward who represents you shall pay for your crime I will kill him in thy name and afterwards we will bethink ourselves of Louise Chapter LV The Change of Residence the Trap Door and the Portrait Porthos intrusted to his great delight with this mission which made him feel young again took half an hour less than his usual time to put on his court suit To show that he was a man acquainted with the usages of high society he had begun by sending his lackey to inquire if Monsieur de Saint Aignan were at home and heard in answer that M le Comte de Saint Aignan had had the honor of accompanying the king to Saint Germain as well as the whole court but that monsieur le comte had just that moment returned Immediately upon this reply Porthos made as much haste as possible and reached Saint Aignan s apartments just as the latter was having his boots taken off The promenade had been delightful The king who was in love more than ever and of course happier than ever behaved in the most charming manner to every one Nothing could possibly equal his kindness M de Saint Aignan it may be remembered was a poet and fancied that he had proved that he was so under too many a memorable circumstance to allow the title to be disputed by any one An indefatigable rhymester he had during the whole of the journey overwhelmed with quatrains sextains and madrigals first the king and then La Valliere The king on his side was in a similarly poetical mood and had made a distich while La Valliere delighting in poetry as most women do who are in love had composed two sonnets The day then had not been a bad one for Apollo and so as soon as he had returned to Paris Saint Aignan who knew beforehand that his verse would be sure to be extensively circulated in court circles occupied himself with a little more attention than he had been able to bestow during the promenade with the composition as well as with the idea itself Consequently with all the tenderness of a father about to start his children in life he candidly interrogated himself whether the public would find these offsprings of his imagination sufficiently elegant and graceful and in order to make his mind easy on the subject M de Saint Aignan recited to himself the madrigal he had composed and which he had repeated from memory to the king and had promised to write out for him on his return All the time he was committing these words to memory the comte was engaged in undressing himself more completely He had just taken off his coat and was putting on his dressing gown when he was informed that Monsieur le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds was waiting to be received Eh he said what does that bunch of names mean I don t know anything about him It is the same gentleman replied the lackey who had the honor of dining with you monseigneur at the king s table when his majesty was staying at Fontainebleau Introduce him then at once cried Saint Aignan Porthos in a few minutes entered the room M de Saint Aignan had an excellent recollection of persons and at the first glance he recognized the gentleman from the country who enjoyed so singular a reputation and whom the king had received so favorably at Fontainebleau in spite of the smiles of some of those who were present He therefore advanced towards Porthos with all the outward signs of consideration of manner which Porthos thought but natural considering that he himself whenever he called upon an adversary hoisted a standard of the most refined politeness Saint Aignan desired the servant to give Porthos a chair and the latter who saw nothing unusual in this act of politeness sat down gravely and coughed The ordinary courtesies having been exchanged between the two gentlemen the comte to whom the visit was paid said May I ask monsieur le baron to what happy circumstance I am indebted for the favor of a visit from you The very thing I am about to have the honor of explaining to you monsieur le comte but I beg your pardon What is the matter monsieur inquired Saint Aignan I regret to say that I have broken your chair Not at all monsieur said Saint Aignan not at all It is the fact though monsieur le comte I have broken it so much so indeed that if I do not move I shall fall down which would be an exceedingly disagreeable position for me in the discharge of the very serious mission which has been intrusted to me with regard to yourself Porthos rose and but just in time for the chair had given way several inches Saint Aignan looked about him for something more solid for his guest to sit upon Modern articles of furniture said Porthos while the comte was looking about are constructed in a ridiculously flimsy manner In my early days when I used to sit down with far more energy than is now the case I do not remember ever to have broken a chair except in taverns with my arms Saint Aignan smiled at this remark But said Porthos as he settled himself down on a couch which creaked but did not give way beneath his weight that unfortunately has nothing whatever to do with my present visit Why unfortunately Are you the bearer of a message of ill omen monsieur le baron Of ill omen for a gentleman Certainly not monsieur le comte replied Porthos nobly I have simply come to say that you have seriously insulted a friend of mine I monsieur exclaimed Saint Aignan I have insulted a friend of yours do you say May I ask his name M Raoul de Bragelonne I have insulted M Raoul de Bragelonne cried Saint Aignan I really assure you monsieur that it is quite impossible for M de Bragelonne whom I know but very slightly nay whom I know hardly at all is in England and as I have not seen him for a long time past I cannot possibly have insulted him M de Bragelonne is in Paris monsieur le comte said Porthos perfectly unmoved and I repeat it is quite certain you have insulted him since he himself told me you had Yes monsieur you have seriously insulted him mortally insulted him I repeat It is impossible monsieur le baron I swear quite impossible Besides added Porthos you cannot be ignorant of the circumstance since M de Bragelonne informed me that he had already apprised you of it by a note I give you my word of honor monsieur that I have received no note whatever This is most extraordinary replied Porthos I will convince you said Saint Aignan that have received nothing in any way from him And he rang the bell Basque he said to the servant who entered how many letters or notes were sent here during my absence Three monsieur le comte a note from M de Fiesque one from Madame de Laferte and a letter from M de las Fuentes Is that all Yes monsieur le comte Speak the truth before this gentleman the truth you understand I will take care you are not blamed There was a note also from from Well from whom From Mademoiselle de Out with it De Laval That is quite sufficient interrupted Porthos I believe you monsieur le comte Saint Aignan dismissed the valet and followed him to the door in order to close it after him and when he had done so looking straight before him he happened to see in the keyhole of the adjoining apartment the paper which Bragelonne had slipped in there as he left What is this he said Porthos who was sitting with his back to the room turned round Aha he said A note in the keyhole exclaimed Saint Aignan That is not unlikely to be the missing letter monsieur le comte said Porthos Saint Aignan took out the paper A note from M de Bragelonne he exclaimed You see monsieur I was right Oh when I say a thing Brought here by M de Bragelonne himself the comte murmured turning pale This is infamous How could he possibly have come here And the comte rang again Who has been here during my absence with the king No one monsieur That is impossible Some one must have been here No one could possibly have entered monsieur since the keys have never left my pocket And yet I find the letter in yonder lock some one must have put it there it could not have come here of its own accord Basque opened his arms as if signifying the most absolute ignorance on the subject Probably it was M de Bragelonne himself who placed it there said Porthos In that case he must have entered here How could that have been since I have the key in my own pocket returned Basque perseveringly Saint Aignan crumpled the letter in his palm after having read it There is something mysterious about this he murmured absorbed in thought Porthos left him to his reflections but after a while returned to the mission he had undertaken Shall we return to our little affair Porthos resumed addressing Saint Aignan after a brief pause I think I can now understand it from this note which has arrived here in so singular a manner Monsieur de Bragelonne says that a friend will call I am his friend I am the person he alludes to For the purpose of giving me a challenge Precisely And he complains that I have insulted him Mortally In what way may I ask for his conduct is so mysterious that at least it needs some explanation Monsieur replied Porthos my friend cannot but be right and as far as his conduct is concerned if it be mysterious as you say you have only yourself to blame for it Porthos pronounced these words with an amount of confidence which for a man who was unaccustomed to his ways must have revealed an infinity of sense Mystery so be it but what is all the mystery about said Saint Aignan You will think it the best perhaps Porthos replied with a low bow if I do not enter in to particulars Oh I perfectly understand We will touch very lightly upon it then so speak monsieur I am listening In the first place monsieur said Porthos you have changed your apartments Yes that is quite true said Saint Aignan You admit it said Porthos with an air of satisfaction Admit it of course I admit it Why should I not admit it do you suppose You have admitted it Very good said Porthos lifting up one finger But how can my having moved my lodgings have done M de Bragelonne any harm Have the goodness to tell me that for I positively do not comprehend a word of what you are saying Porthos stopped him and then said with great gravity Monsieur this is the first of M de Bragelonne s complaints against you If he makes a complaint it is because he feels himself insulted Saint Aignan began to beat his foot impatiently on the ground This looks like a spurious quarrel he said No one can possibly have a spurious quarrel with the Vicomte de Bragelonne returned Porthos but at all events you have nothing to add on the subject of your changing your apartments I suppose Nothing And what is the next point Ah the next You will observe monsieur that the one I have already mentioned is a most serious injury to which you have given no answer or rather have answered very indifferently Is it possible monsieur that you have changed your lodgings M de Bragelonne feels insulted at your having done so and you do not attempt to excuse yourself What cried Saint Aignan who was getting annoyed at the perfect coolness of his visitor what am I to consult M de Bragelonne whether I am to move or not You can hardly be serious monsieur I am And it is absolutely necessary monsieur but under any circumstances you will admit that it is nothing in comparison with the second ground of complaint Well what is that Porthos assumed a very solemn expression as he said How about the trap door monsieur Saint Aignan turned exceedingly pale He pushed back his chair so abruptly that Porthos simple as he was perceived that the blow had told The trap door murmured Saint Aignan Yes monsieur explain that if you can said Porthos shaking his head Saint Aignan held down his head as he murmured I have been betrayed everything is known Everything replied Porthos who knew nothing You see me perfectly overwhelmed pursued Saint Aignan overwhelmed to a degree that I hardly know what I am about A guilty conscience monsieur Your affair is a bad one and when the public learns all about it it will judge Oh monsieur exclaimed the count hurriedly such a secret ought not to be known even by one s confessor That we will think about said Porthos the secret will not go far in fact Surely monsieur returned Saint Aignan since M de Bragelonne has penetrated the secret he must be aware of the danger he as well as others run the risk of incurring M de Bragelonne runs no danger monsieur nor does he fear any either as you if it please Heaven will find out very soon This fellow is a perfect madman thought Saint Aignan What in Heaven s name does he want He then said aloud Come monsieur let us hush up this affair You forget the portrait said Porthos in a voice of thunder which made the comte s blood freeze in his veins As the portrait in question was La Valliere s portrait and no mistake could any longer exist on the subject Saint Aignan s eyes were completely opened Ah he exclaimed ah monsieur I remember now that M de Bragelonne was engaged to be married to her Porthos assumed an imposing air all the majesty of ignorance in fact as he said It matters nothing whatever to me nor to yourself indeed whether or not my friend was as you say engaged to be married I am even astonished that you should have made use of so indiscreet a remark It may possibly do your cause harm monsieur Monsieur replied Saint Aignan you are the incarnation of intelligence delicacy and loyalty of feeling united I see the whole matter now clearly enough So much the better said Porthos And pursued Saint Aignan you have made me comprehend it in the most ingenious and the most delicate manner possible I beg you to accept my best thanks Porthos drew himself up unable to resist the flattery of the remark Only now that I know everything permit me to explain Porthos shook his head as a man who does not wish to hear but Saint Aignan continued I am in despair I assure you at all that has happened but how would you have acted in my place Come between ourselves tell me what you would have done Porthos drew himself up as he answered There is now no question at all of what I should have done young man you have been made acquainted with the three causes of complaint against you I believe As for the first my change of rooms and I now address myself to you as a man of honor and of great intelligence could I when the desire of so august a personage was so urgently expressed that I should move ought I to have disobeyed Porthos was about to speak but Saint Aignan did not give him time to answer Ah my frankness I see convinces you he said interpreting the movement according to his own fancy You feel that I am right Porthos did not reply and so Saint Aignan continued I pass by that unfortunate trap door he said placing his hand on Porthos s arm that trap door the occasion and means of so much unhappiness and which was constructed for you know what Well then in plain truth do you suppose that it was I who of my own accord in such a place too had that trap door made Oh no you do not believe it and here again you feel you guess you understand the influence of a will superior to my own You can conceive the infatuation the blind irresistible passion which has been at work But thank Heaven I am fortunate in speaking to a man who has so much sensitiveness of feeling and if it were not so indeed what an amount of misery and scandal would fall upon her poor girl and upon him whom I will not name Porthos confused and bewildered by the eloquence and gestures of Saint Aignan made a thousand efforts to stem this torrent of words of which by the by he did not understand a single one he remained upright and motionless on his seat and that was all he could do Saint Aignan continued and gave a new inflection to his voice and an increasing vehemence to his gesture As for the portrait for I readily believe the portrait is the principal cause of complaint tell me candidly if you think me to blame Who was it who wished to have her portrait Was it I Who is in love with her Is it I Who wishes to gain her affection Again is it I Who took her likeness I do you think No a thousand times no I know M de Bragelonne must be in a state of despair I know these misfortunes are most cruel But I too am suffering as well and yet there is no possibility of offering any resistance Suppose we were to fight we would be laughed at If he obstinately persist in his course he is lost You will tell me I know that despair is ridiculous but then you are a sensible man You have understood me I perceived by your serious thoughtful embarrassed air even that the importance of the situation we are placed in has not escaped you Return therefore to M de Bragelonne thank him as I have indeed reason to thank him for having chosen as an intermediary a man of your high merit Believe me that I shall on my side preserve an eternal gratitude for the man who has so ingeniously so cleverly arranged the misunderstanding between us And since ill luck would have it that the secret should be known to four instead of three why this secret which might make the most ambitious man s fortune I am delighted to share with you monsieur from the bottom of my heart I am delighted at it From this very moment you can make use of me as you please I place myself entirely at your mercy What can I possibly do for you What can I solicit nay require even You have only to speak monsieur only to speak And according to the familiarly friendly fashion of that period Saint Aignan threw his arms round Porthos and clasped him tenderly in his embrace Porthos allowed him to do this with the most perfect indifference Speak resumed Saint Aignan what do you require Monsieur said Porthos I have a horse below be good enough to mount him he is a very good one and will play you no tricks Mount on horseback what for inquired Saint Aignan with no little curiosity To accompany me to where M de Bragelonne is waiting us Ah he wishes to speak to me I suppose I can well believe that he wishes to have the details very likely alas it is a very delicate matter but at the present moment I cannot for the king is waiting for me The king must wait then said Porthos What do you say the king must wait interrupted the finished courtier with a smile of utter amazement for he could not understand that the king could under any circumstances be supposed to have to wait It is merely the affair of a very short hour returned Porthos But where is M de Bragelonne waiting for me At the Minimes at Vincennes Ah indeed but are we going to laugh over the affair when we get there I don t think it likely said Porthos as his face assumed a look of utter hardness But the Minimes is a rendezvous where duels take place and what can I have to do at the Minimes Porthos slowly drew his sword and said That is the length of my friend s sword Why the man is mad cried Saint Aignan The color mounted to Porthos s face as he replied If I had not the honor of being in your own apartment monsieur and of representing M de Bragelonne s interests I would throw you out of the window It will be merely a pleasure postponed and you will lose nothing by waiting Will you come with me to the Minimes monsieur of your own free will But Take care I will carry you if you do not come quickly Basque cried Saint Aignan As soon as Basque appeared he said The king wishes to see monsieur le comte That is very different said Porthos the king s service before anything else We will wait until this evening monsieur And saluting Saint Aignan with his usual courtesy Porthos left the room delighted at having arranged another affair Saint Aignan looked after him as he left and then hastily putting on his court dress again he ran off arranging his costume as he went along muttering to himself The Minimes the Minimes We shall see how the king will fancy this challenge for it is for him after all that is certain Chapter LVI Rivals in Politics On his return from the promenade which had been so prolific in poetical effusions and in which every one had paid his or her tribute to the Muses as the poets of the period used to say the king found M Fouquet waiting for an audience M Colbert had lain in wait for his majesty in the corridor and followed him like a jealous and watchful shadow M Colbert with his square head his vulgar and untidy though rich costume somewhat resembled a Flemish gentleman after he had been over indulging in his national drink beer Fouquet at sight of his enemy remained perfectly unmoved and during the whole of the scene which followed scrupulously resolved to observe a line of conduct particularly difficult to the man of superior mind who does not even wish to show his contempt for fear of doing his adversary too much honor Colbert made no attempt to conceal his insolent expression of the vulgar joy he felt In his opinion M Fouquet s was a game very badly played and hopelessly lost although not yet finished Colbert belonged to that school of politicians who think cleverness alone worthy of their admiration and success the only thing worth caring for Colbert moreover who was not simply an envious and jealous man but who had the king s interest really at heart because he was thoroughly imbued with the highest sense of probity in all matters of figures and accounts could well afford to assign as a pretext for his conduct that in hating and doing his utmost to ruin M Fouquet he had nothing in view but the welfare of the state and the dignity of the crown None of these details escaped Fouquet s observation through his enemy s thick bushy brows and despite the restless movement of his eyelids he could by merely looking at his eyes penetrate to the very bottom of Colbert s heart and he read to what an unbounded extent hate towards himself and triumph at his approaching fall existed there But as in observing everything he wished to remain himself impenetrable he composed his features smiled with the charmingly sympathetic smile that was peculiarly his own and saluted the king with the most dignified and graceful ease and elasticity of manner Sire he said I perceive by your majesty s joyous air that you have been gratified with the promenade Most gratified indeed monsieur le surintendant most gratified You were very wrong not to come with us as I invited you to do I was working sire replied the superintendent who did not even seem to take the trouble to turn aside his head in merest respect of Colbert s presence Ah M Fouquet cried the king there is nothing like the country I should be delighted to live in the country always in the open air and under the trees I should hope that your majesty is not yet weary of the throne said Fouquet No but thrones of soft turf are very pleasant Your majesty gratifies my utmost wishes in speaking in that manner for I have a request to submit to you On whose behalf monsieur Oh behalf of the nymphs of Vaux sire Ah ah said Louis XIV Your majesty too once deigned to make me a promise said Fouquet Yes I remember it The fete at Vaux the celebrated fete I think it was sire said Colbert endeavoring to show his importance by taking part in the conversation Fouquet with the profoundest contempt did not take the slightest notice of the remark as if as far as he was concerned Colbert had not even thought or said a word Your majesty is aware he said that I destine my estate at Vaux to receive the most amiable of princes the most powerful of monarchs I have given you my promise monsieur said Louis XIV smiling and a king never departs from his word And I have come now sire to inform your majesty that I am ready to obey your orders in every respect Do you promise me many wonders monsieur le surintendant said Louis looking at Colbert Wonders Oh no sire I do not undertake that I hope to be able to procure your majesty a little pleasure perhaps even a little forgetfulness of the cares of state Nay nay M Fouquet returned the king I insist upon the word wonders You are a magician I believe we all know the power you wield we also know that you can find gold even when there is none to be found elsewhere so much so indeed that people say you coin it Fouquet felt that the shot was discharged from a double quiver and that the king had launched an arrow from his own bow as well as one from Colbert s Oh said he laughingly the people know perfectly well out of what mine I procure the gold and they know it only too well perhaps besides he added I can assure your majesty that the gold destined to pay the expenses of the fete at Vaux will cost neither blood nor tears hard labor it may perhaps but that can be paid for Louis paused quite confused He wished to look at Colbert Colbert too wished to reply to him a glance as swift as an eagle s a king like glance indeed which Fouquet darted at the latter arrested the words upon his lips The king who had by this time recovered his self possession turned towards Fouquet saying I presume therefore I am now to consider myself formally invited Yes sire if your majesty will condescend so far as to accept my invitation What day have you fixed Any day your majesty may find most convenient You speak like an enchanter who has but to conjure up in actuality the wildest fancies Monsieur Fouquet I could not say so much indeed myself Your majesty will do whenever you please everything that a monarch can and ought to do The king of France has servants at his bidding who are able to do anything on his behalf to accomplish everything to gratify his pleasures Colbert tried to look at the superintendent in order to see whether this remark was an approach to less hostile sentiments on his part but Fouquet had not even looked at his enemy and Colbert hardly seemed to exist as far as he was concerned Very good then said the king Will a week hence suit you Perfectly well sire This is Tuesday if I give you until next Sunday week will that be sufficient The delay which your majesty deigns to accord me will greatly aid the various works which my architects have in hand for the purpose of adding to the amusement of your majesty and your friends By the by speaking of my friends resumed the king how do you intend to treat them The king is master everywhere sire your majesty will draw up your own list and give your own orders All those you may deign to invite will be my guests my honored guests indeed I thank you returned the king touched by the noble thought expressed in so noble a tone Fouquet therefore took leave of Louis XIV after a few words had been added with regard to the details of certain matters of business He felt that Colbert would remain behind with the king that they would both converse about him and that neither of them would spare him in the least degree The satisfaction of being able to give a last and terrible blow to his enemy seemed to him almost like a compensation for everything they were about to subject him to He turned back again immediately as soon indeed as he had reached the door and addressing the king said I was forgetting that I had to crave your majesty s forgiveness In what respect said the king graciously For having committed a serious fault without perceiving it A fault You Ah Monsieur Fouquet I shall be unable to do otherwise than forgive you In what way or against whom have you been found wanting Against every sense of propriety sire I forgot to inform your majesty of a circumstance that has lately occurred of some little importance What is it Colbert trembled he fancied that he was about to frame a denunciation against him His conduct had been unmasked A single syllable from Fouquet a single proof formally advanced and before the youthful loyalty of feeling which guided Louis XIV Colbert s favor would disappear at once the latter trembled therefore lest so daring a blow might overthrow his whole scaffold in point of fact the opportunity was so admirably suited to be taken advantage of that a skillful practiced player like Aramis would not have let it slip Sire said Fouquet with an easy unconcerned air since you have had the kindness to forgive me I am perfectly indifferent about my confession this morning I sold one of the official appointments I hold One of your appointments said the king which Colbert turned perfectly livid That which conferred upon me sire a grand gown and a stern air of gravity the appointment of procureur general The king involuntarily uttered a loud exclamation and looked at Colbert who with his face bedewed with perspiration felt almost on the point of fainting To whom have you sold this department Monsieur Fouquet inquired the king Colbert was obliged to lean against a column of the fireplace To a councilor belonging to the parliament sire whose name is Vanel Vanel Yes sire a particular friend of the intendant Colbert added Fouquet letting every word fall from his lips with the most inimitable nonchalance and with an admirably assumed expression of forgetfulness and ignorance And having finished and having overwhelmed Colbert beneath the weight of this superiority the superintendent again saluted the king and quitted the room partially revenged by the stupefaction of the king and the humiliation of the favorite Is it really possible said the king as soon as Fouquet had disappeared that he has sold that office Yes sire said Colbert meaningly He must be mad the king added Colbert this time did not reply he had penetrated the king s thought a thought which amply revenged him for the humiliation he had just been made to suffer his hatred was augmented by a feeling of bitter jealousy of Fouquet and a threat of disgrace was now added to the plan he had arranged for his ruin Colbert felt perfectly assured that for the future between Louis XIV and himself their hostile feelings and ideas would meet with no obstacles and that at the first fault committed by Fouquet which could be laid hold of as a pretext the chastisement so long impending would be precipitated Fouquet had thrown aside his weapons of defense and hate and jealousy had picked them up Colbert was invited by the king to the fete at Vaux he bowed like a man confident in himself and accepted the invitation with the air of one who almost confers a favor The king was about writing down Saint Aignan s name on his list of royal commands when the usher announced the Comte de Saint Aignan As soon as the royal Mercury entered Colbert discreetly withdrew Chapter LVII Rivals in Love Saint Aignan had quitted Louis XIV hardly a couple of hours before but in the first effervescence of his affection whenever Louis XIV was out of sight of La Valliere he was obliged to talk about her Besides the only person with whom he could speak about her at his ease was Saint Aignan and thus Saint Aignan had become an indispensable Ah is that you comte he exclaimed as soon as he perceived him doubly delighted not only to see him again but also to get rid of Colbert whose scowling face always put him out of humor So much the better I am very glad to see you You will make one of the best traveling party I suppose Of what traveling part are you speaking sire inquired Saint Aignan The one we are making up to go to the fete the superintendent is about to give at Vaux Ah Saint Aignan you will at last see a fete a royal fete by the side of which all our amusements at Fontainebleau are petty contemptible affairs At Vaux the superintendent going to give a fete in your majesty s honor Nothing more than that Nothing more than that do you say It is very diverting to find you treating it with so much disdain Are you who express such an indifference on the subject aware that as soon as it is known that M Fouquet is going to receive me at Vaux next Sunday week people will be striving their very utmost to get invited to the fete I repeat Saint Aignan you shall be one of the invited guests Very well sire unless I shall in the meantime have undertaken a longer and a less agreeable journey What journey do you allude to The one across the Styx sire Bah said Louis XIV laughing No seriously sire replied Saint Aignan I am invited and in such a way in truth that I hardly know what to say or how to act in order to refuse the invitation I do not understand you I know that you are in a poetical vein but try not to sink from Apollo to Phoebus Very well if your majesty will deign to listen to me I will not keep your mind on the rack a moment longer Speak Your majesty knows the Baron du Vallon Yes indeed a good servant to my father the late king and an admirable companion at table for I think you are referring to the gentleman who dined with us at Fontainebleau Precisely so but you have omitted to add to his other qualifications sire that he is a most charming polisher off of other people What Does M du Vallon wish to polish you off Or to get me killed which is much the same thing The deuce Do not laugh sire for I am not saying one word beyond the exact truth And you say he wishes to get you killed Such is that excellent person s present idea Be easy I will defend you if he be in the wrong Ah There is an if Of course answer me as candidly as if it were some one else s affair instead of your own my poor Saint Aignan is he right or wrong Your majesty shall be the judge What have you done to him To him personally nothing at all but it seems to one of his friends I have It is all the same Is his friend one of the celebrated four No It is the son of one of the celebrated four though What have you done to the son Come tell me Why it seems that I have helped some one to take his mistress from him You confess it then I cannot help confessing it for it is true In that case you are wrong and if he were to kill you he would be doing perfectly right Ah that is your majesty s way of reasoning then Do you think it a bad way It is a very expeditious way at all events Good justice is prompt so my grandfather Henry IV used to say In that case your majesty will perhaps be good enough to sign my adversary s pardon for he is now waiting for me at the Minimes for the purpose of putting me out of my misery His name and a parchment There is a parchment upon your majesty s table and for his name Well what is it The Vicomte de Bragelonne sire The Vicomte de Bragelonne exclaimed the king changing from a fit of laughter to the most profound stupor and then after a moment s silence while he wiped his forehead which was bedewed with perspiration he again murmured Bragelonne No other sire Bragelonne who was affianced to Yes sire But he has been in London Yes but I can assure you sire he is there no longer Is he in Paris then He is at Minimes sire where he is waiting for me as I have already had the honor of telling you Does he know all Yes and many things besides Perhaps your majesty would like to look at the letter I have received from him and Saint Aignan drew from his pocket the note we are already acquainted with When your majesty has read the letter I will tell you how it reached me The king read it in a great agitation and immediately said Well Well sire your majesty knows a certain carved lock closing a certain door of carved ebony which separates a certain apartment from a certain blue and white sanctuary Of course Louise s boudoir Yes sire Well it was in the keyhole of that lock that I found yonder note Who placed it there Either M de Bragelonne or the devil himself but inasmuch as the note smells of musk and not of sulphur I conclude that it must be not the devil but M de Bragelonne Louis bent his head and seemed absorbed in sad and bitter thought Perhaps something like remorse was at that moment passing through his heart The secret is discovered he said Sire I shall do my utmost that the secret dies in the breast of the man who possesses it said Saint Aignan in a tone of bravado as he moved towards the door but a gesture of the king made him pause Where are you going he inquired Where they await me sire What for To fight in all probability You fight exclaimed the king One moment if you please monsieur le comte Saint Aignan shook his head as a rebellious child does whenever any one interferes to prevent him throwing himself into a well or playing with a knife But sire he said In the first place continued the king I want to be enlightened a little further Upon all points if your majesty will be pleased to interrogate me replied Saint Aignan I will throw what light I can Who told you that M de Bragelonne had penetrated into that room The letter which I found in the keyhole told me Who told you that it was De Bragelonne who put it there Who but himself would have dared to undertake such a mission You are right How was he able to get into your rooms Ah that is very serious inasmuch as all the doors were closed and my lackey Basque had the keys in his pocket Your lackey must have been bribed Impossible sire for if he had been bribed those who did so would not have sacrificed the poor fellow whom it is not unlikely they might want to turn to further use by and by in showing so clearly that it was he whom they had made use of Quite true And now I can only form one conjecture Tell me what it is sire and we shall see if it is the same that has presented itself to my mind That he effected an entrance by means of the staircase Alas sire that seems to me more than probable There is no doubt that some one must have sold the secret of the trap door Either sold it or given it Why do you make that distinction Because there are certain persons sire who being above the price of treason give and do not sell What do you mean Oh sire Your majesty s mind is too clear sighted not to guess what I mean and you will save me the embarrassment of naming the person I allude to You are right you mean Madame I suppose her suspicions were aroused by your changing your lodgings Madame has keys of the apartments of her maids of honor and she is powerful enough to discover what no one but yourself could do or she would not be able to discover anything And you suppose then that my sister must have entered into an alliance with Bragelonne and has informed him of all the details of the affair Possibly even better still for she perhaps accompanied him there Which way through your own apartments You think it impossible sire Well listen to me Your majesty knows that Madame is very fond of perfumes Yes she acquired that taste from my mother Vervain particularly Yes it is the scent she prefers to all others Very good sire my apartments happen to smell very strongly of vervain The king remained silent and thoughtful for a few moments and then resumed But why should Madame take Bragelonne s part against me Saint Aignan could very easily have replied A woman s jealousy The king probed his friend to the bottom of his heart to ascertain if he had learned the secret of his flirtation with his sister in law But Saint Aignan was not an ordinary courtier he did not lightly run the risk of finding out family secrets and he was too a friend of the Muses not to think very frequently of poor Ovidius Naso whose eyes shed so many tears in expiation of his crime for having once beheld something one hardly knows what in the palace of Augustus He therefore passed by Madame s secret very skillfully But as he had shown no ordinary sagacity in indicating Madame s presence in his rooms in company with Bragelonne it was necessary of course for him to repay with interest the king s amour propre and reply plainly to the question which had been put to him of Why has Madame taken Bragelonne s part against me Why replied Saint Aignan Your majesty forgets I presume that the Comte de Guiche is the intimate friend of the Vicomte de Bragelonne I do not see the connection however said the king Ah I beg your pardon then sire but I thought the Comte de Guiche was a very great friend of Madame s Quite true the king returned there is no occasion to search any further the blow came from that direction And is not your majesty of opinion that in order to ward it off it will be necessary to deal another blow Yes but not one of the kind given in the Bois de Vincennes replied the king You forget sire said Saint Aignan that I am a gentleman and that I have been challenged The challenge neither concerns nor was it intended for you But I am the man sire who has been expected at the Minimes sire during the last hour and more and I shall be dishonored if I do not go The first honor and duty of a gentleman is obedience to his sovereign Sire I order you to remain Sire Obey monsieur As your majesty pleases Besides I wish to have the whole of this affair explained I wish to know how it is that I have been so insolently trifled with as to have the sanctuary of my affections pried into It is not you Saint Aignan whose business it is to punish those who have acted in this manner for it is not your honor they have attacked but my own I implore your majesty not to overwhelm M de Bragelonne with your wrath for although in the whole of this affair he may have shown himself deficient in prudence he has not been so in his feelings of loyalty Enough I shall know how to decide between the just and the unjust even in the height of my anger But take care that not a word of this is breathed to Madame But what am I to do with regard to M de Bragelonne He will be seeking me in every direction and I shall either have spoken to him or taken care that he has been spoken to before the evening is over Let me once more entreat your majesty to be indulgent towards him I have been indulgent long enough comte said Louis XIV frowning severely it is now quite time to show certain persons that I am master in my own palace The king had hardly pronounced these words which betokened that a fresh feeling of irritation was mingling with the recollections of old when an usher appeared at the door of the cabinet What is the matter inquired the king and why do you presume to come when I have not summoned you Sire said the usher your majesty desired me to permit M le Comte de la Fere to pass freely on any and every occasion when he might wish to speak to your majesty Well monsieur M le Comte de la Fere is now waiting to see your majesty The king and Saint Aignan at this reply exchanged a look which betrayed more uneasiness than surprise Louis hesitated for a moment but immediately afterwards seeming to make up his mind he said Go Saint Aignan and find Louise inform her of the plot against us do not let her be ignorant that Madame will return to her system of persecutions against her and that she has set those to work who would have found it far safer to remain neuter Sire If Louise gets nervous and frightened reassure her as much as you can tell her that the king s affection is an impenetrable shield over her if which I suspect is the case she already knows everything or if she has already been herself subjected to an attack of some kind or other from any quarter tell her be sure to tell her Saint Aignan added the king trembling with passion tell her I say that this time instead of defending her I will avenge her and that too so terribly that no one will in future even dare to raise his eyes towards her Is that all sire Yes all Go as quickly as you can and remain faithful for you who live in the midst of this stake of infernal torments have not like myself the hope of the paradise beyond it Saint Aignan exhausted himself in protestations of devotion took the king s hand kissed it and left the room radiant with delight Chapter LVIII King and Noble The king endeavored to recover his self possession as quickly as possible in order to meet M de la Fere with an untroubled countenance He clearly saw it was not mere chance that had induced the comte s visit he had some vague impression of its importance but he felt that to a man of Athos s tone of mind to one of such a high order of intellect his first reception ought not to present anything either disagreeable or otherwise than kind and courteous As soon as the king had satisfied himself that as far as appearances went he was perfectly calm again he gave directions to the ushers to introduce the comte A few minutes afterwards Athos in full court dress and with his breast covered with the orders that he alone had the right to wear at the court of France presented himself with so grave and solemn an air that the king perceived at the first glance that he was not deceived in his anticipations Louis advanced a step towards the comte and with a smile held out his hand to him over which Athos bowed with the air of the deepest respect Monsieur le Comte de la Fere said the king rapidly you are so seldom here that it is a real piece of good fortune to see you Athos bowed and replied I should wish always to enjoy the happiness of being near your majesty The tone however in which this reply was conveyed evidently signified I should wish to be one of your majesty s advisers to save you the commission of faults The king felt it so and determined in this man s presence to preserve all the advantages which could be derived from his command over himself as well as from his rank and position I see you have something to say to me he said Had it not been so I should not have presumed to present myself before your majesty Speak quickly I am anxious to satisfy you returned the king seating himself I am persuaded replied Athos in a somewhat agitated tone of voice that your majesty will give me every satisfaction Ah said the king with a certain haughtiness of manner you have come to lodge a complaint here then It would be a complaint returned Athos only in the event of your majesty but if you will deign to permit me sire I will begin the conversation from the very commencement Do so I am listening Your majesty will remember that at the period of the Duke of Buckingham s departure I had the honor of an interview with you At or about that period I think I remember you did only with regard to the subject of the conversation I have quite forgotten it Athos started as he replied I shall have the honor to remind your majesty of it It was with regard to a formal demand I had addressed to you respecting a marriage which M de Bragelonne wished to contract with Mademoiselle de la Valliere Ah thought the king we have come to it now I remember he said aloud At that period pursued Athos your majesty was so kind and generous towards M de Bragelonne and myself that not a single word which then fell from your lips has escaped my memory and when I asked your majesty to accord me Mademoiselle de la Valliere s hand for M de Bragelonne you refused Quite true said Louis dryly Alleging Athos hastened to say that the young lady had no position in society Louis could hardly force himself to listen with an appearance of royal propriety That added Athos she had but little fortune The king threw himself back in his armchair That her extraction was indifferent A renewed impatience on the part of the king And little beauty added Athos pitilessly This last bolt buried itself deep in the king s heart and made him almost bound from his seat You have a good memory monsieur he said I invariably have on occasions when I have had the distinguished honor of an interview with your majesty retorted the comte without being in the least disconcerted Very good it is admitted that I said all that And I thanked your majesty for your remarks at the time because they testified an interest in M de Bragelonne which did him much honor And you may possibly remember said the king very deliberately that you had the greatest repugnance for this marriage Quite true sire And that you solicited my permission much against your own inclination Yes sire And finally I remember for I have a memory nearly as good as your own I remember I say that you observed at the time I do not believe that Mademoiselle de la Valliere loves M de Bragelonne Is that true The blow told well but Athos did not draw back Sire he said I have already begged your majesty s forgiveness but there are certain particulars in that conversation which are only intelligible from the denouement Well what is the denouement monsieur This that your majesty then said that you would defer the marriage out of regard for M de Bragelonne s own interests The king remained silent M de Bragelonne is now so exceedingly unhappy that he cannot any longer defer asking your majesty for a solution of the matter The king turned pale Athos looked at him with fixed attention And what said the king with considerable hesitation does M de Bragelonne request Precisely the very thing that I came to ask your majesty for at my last audience namely your majesty s consent to his marriage The king remained perfectly silent The questions which referred to the different obstacles in the way are all now quite removed for us continued Athos Mademoiselle de la Valliere without fortune birth or beauty is not the less on that account the only good match in the world for M de Bragelonne since he loves this young girl The king pressed his hands impatiently together Does your majesty hesitate inquired the comte without losing a particle of either his firmness of his politeness I do not hesitate I refuse replied the king Athos paused a moment as if to collect himself I have had the honor he said in a mild tone to observe to your majesty that no obstacle now interferes with M de Bragelonne s affections and that his determination seems unalterable There is my will and that is an obstacle I should imagine That is the most serious of all Athos replied quickly Ah And may we therefore be permitted to ask your majesty with the greatest humility your reason for this refusal The reason A question to me exclaimed the king A demand sire The king leaning with both his hands upon the table said in a deep tone of concentrated passion You have lost all recollection of what is usual at court At court please to remember no one ventures to put a question to the king Very true sire but if men do not question they conjecture Conjecture What may that mean monsieur Very frequently sire conjecture with regard to a particular subject implies a want of frankness on the part of the king Monsieur And a want of confidence on the part of the subject pursued Athos intrepidly You forget yourself said the king hurried away by anger in spite of all his self control Sire I am obliged to seek elsewhere for what I thought I should find in your majesty Instead of obtaining a reply from you I am compelled to make one for myself The king rose Monsieur le comte he said I have now given you all the time I had at my disposal This was a dismissal Sire replied the comte I have not yet had time to tell your majesty what I came with the express object of saying and I so rarely see your majesty that I ought to avail myself of the opportunity Just now you spoke rudely of conjectures you are now becoming offensive monsieur Oh sire offend your majesty I never All my life through I have maintained that kings are above all other men not only from their rank and power but from their nobleness of heart and their true dignity of mind I never can bring myself to believe that my sovereign he who passed his word to me did so with a mental reservation What do you mean what mental reservation do you allude to I will explain my meaning said Athos coldly If in refusing Mademoiselle de la Valliere to Monsieur de Bragelonne your majesty had some other object in view than the happiness and fortune of the vicomte You perceive monsieur that you are offending me If in requiring the vicomte to delay his marriage your majesty s only object was to remove the gentleman to whom Mademoiselle de la Valliere was engaged Monsieur monsieur I have heard it said so in every direction sire Your majesty s affection for Mademoiselle de la Valliere is spoken of on all sides The king tore his gloves which he had been biting for some time Woe to those he cried who interfere in my affairs I have made up my mind to take a particular course and I will break through every obstacle in my way What obstacle said Athos The king stopped short like a horse which having taken the bit between his teeth and run away finds it has slipped it back again and that his career is checked I love Mademoiselle de la Valliere he said suddenly with mingled nobleness of feeling and passion But interrupted Athos that does not preclude your majesty from allowing M de Bragelonne to marry Mademoiselle de la Valliere The sacrifice is worthy of so great a monarch it is fully merited by M de Bragelonne who has already rendered great service to your majesty and who may well be regarded as a brave and worthy man Your majesty therefore in renouncing the affection you entertain offers a proof at once of generosity gratitude and good policy Mademoiselle de la Valliere does not love M de Bragelonne said the king hoarsely Does your majesty know that to be the case remarked Athos with a searching look I do know it Since a very short time then for doubtless had your majesty known it when I first preferred my request you would have taken the trouble to inform me of it Since a very short time it is true monsieur Athos remained silent for a moment and then resumed In that case I do not understand why your majesty should have sent M de Bragelonne to London That exile and most properly so too is a matter of astonishment to every one who regards your majesty s honor with sincere affection Who presumes to impugn my honor Monsieur de la Fere The king s honor sire is made up of the honor of his whole nobility Whenever the king offends one of his gentlemen that is whenever he deprives him of the smallest particle of his honor it is from him from the king himself that that portion of honor is stolen Monsieur de la Fere said the king haughtily Sire you sent M de Bragelonne to London either before you were Mademoiselle de la Valliere s lover or since you have become so The king irritated beyond measure especially because he felt that he was being mastered endeavored to dismiss Athos by a gesture Sire replied the comte I will tell you all I will not leave your presence until I have been satisfied by your majesty or by myself satisfied if you prove to me that you are right satisfied if I prove to you that you are wrong Nay sire you can but listen to me I am old now and I am attached to everything that is really great and really powerful in your kingdom I am of those who have shed their blood for your father and for yourself without ever having asked a single favor either from yourself or from your father I have never inflicted the slightest wrong or injury on any one in this world and even kings are still my debtors You can but listen to me I repeat I have come to ask you for an account of the honor of one of your servants whom you have deceived by a falsehood or betrayed by want of heart of judgment I know that these words irritate your majesty but the facts themselves are killing us I know that you are endeavoring to find some means whereby to chastise me for my frankness but I know also the chastisement I will implore God to inflict upon you when I relate to Him your perjury and my son s unhappiness The king during these remarks was walking hurriedly to and fro his hand thrust into the breast of his coat his head haughtily raised his eyes blazing with wrath Monsieur he cried suddenly if I acted towards you as a king you would be already punished but I am only a man and I have the right to love in this world every one who loves me a happiness which is so rarely found You cannot pretend to such a right as a man any more than as a king sire or if you intend to exercise that right in a loyal manner you should have told M de Bragelonne so and not have exiled him It is too great a condescension monsieur to discuss these things with you interrupted Louis XIV with that majesty of air and manner he alone seemed able to give his look and his voice I was hoping that you would reply to me said the comte You shall know my reply monsieur You already know my thoughts on the subject was the Comte de la Fere s answer You have forgotten you are speaking to the king monsieur It is a crime You have forgotten you are destroying the lives of two men sire It is a mortal sin Leave the room Not until I have said this Son of Louis XIII you begin your reign badly for you begin it by abduction and disloyalty My race myself too are now freed from all that affection and respect towards you which I made my son swear to observe in the vaults of Saint Denis in the presence of the relics of your noble forefathers You are now become our enemy sire and henceforth we have nothing to do save with Heaven alone our sole master Be warned be warned sire What do you threaten Oh no said Athos sadly I have as little bravado as fear in my soul The God of whom I spoke to you is now listening to me He knows that for the safety and honor of your crown I would even yet shed every drop of blood twenty years of civil and foreign warfare have left in my veins I can well say then that I threaten the king as little as I threaten the man but I tell you sire you lose two servants for you have destroyed faith in the heart of the father and love in the heart of the son the one ceases to believe in the royal word the other no longer believes in the loyalty of the man or the purity of woman the one is dead to every feeling of respect the other to obedience Adieu Thus saying Athos broke his sword across his knee slowly placed the two pieces upon the floor and saluting the king who was almost choking from rage and shame he quitted the cabinet Louis who sat near the table completely overwhelmed was several minutes before he could collect himself but he suddenly rose and rang the bell violently Tell M d Artagnan to come here he said to the terrified ushers Chapter LIX After the Storm Our readers will doubtlessly have been asking themselves how it happened that Athos of whom not a word has been said for some time past arrived so very opportunely at court We will without delay endeavor to satisfy their curiosity Porthos faithful to his duty as an arranger of affairs had immediately after leaving the Palais Royal set off to join Raoul at the Minimes in the Bois de Vincennes and had related everything even to the smallest details which had passed between Saint Aignan and himself He finished by saying that the message which the king had sent to his favorite would probably not occasion more than a short delay and that Saint Aignan as soon as he could leave the king would not lose a moment in accepting the invitation Raoul had sent him But Raoul less credulous than his old friend had concluded from Porthos s recital that if Saint Aignan was going to the king Saint Aignan would tell the king everything and that the king would most assuredly forbid Saint Aignan to obey the summons he had received to the hostile meeting The consequence of his reflections was that he had left Porthos to remain at the place appointed for the meeting in the very improbable case that Saint Aignan would come there having endeavored to make Porthos promise that he would not remain there more than an hour or an hour and a half at the very longest Porthos however formally refused to do anything of the kind but on the contrary installed himself in the Minimes as if he were going to take root there making Raoul promise that when he had been to see his father he would return to his own apartments in order that Porthos s servant might know where to find him in case M de Saint Aignan should happen to come to the rendezvous Bragelonne had left Vincennes and proceeded at once straight to the apartments of Athos who had been in Paris during the last two days the comte having been already informed of what had taken place by a letter from D Artagnan Raoul arrived at his father s Athos after having held out his hand to him and embraced him most affectionately made a sign for him to sit down I know you come to me as a man would go to a friend vicomte whenever he is suffering tell me therefore what is it that brings you now The young man bowed and began his recital more than once in the course of it his tears almost choked his utterance and a sob checked in his throat compelled him to suspend his narrative for a few minutes Athos most probably already knew how matters stood as we have just now said D Artagnan had already written to him but preserving until the conclusion that calm unruffled composure of manner which constituted the almost superhuman side of his character he replied Raoul I do not believe there is a word of truth in these rumors I do not believe in the existence of what you fear although I do not deny that persons best entitled to the fullest credit have already conversed with me on the subject In my heart and soul I think it utterly impossible that the king could be guilty of such an outrage on a gentleman I will answer for the king therefore and will soon bring you back the proof of what I say Raoul wavering like a drunken man between what he had seen with his own eyes and the imperturbable faith he had in a man who had never told a falsehood bowed and simply answered Go then monsieur le comte I will await your return And he sat down burying his face in his hands Athos dressed and then left him in order to wait upon the king the result of that interview is already known to our readers When he returned to his lodgings Raoul pale and dejected had not quitted his attitude of despair At the sound however of the opening doors and of his father s footsteps as he approached him the young man raised his head Athos s face was very pale his head uncovered and his manner full of seriousness he gave his cloak and hat to the lackey dismissed him with a gesture and sat down near Raoul Well monsieur inquired the young man are you convinced yet I am Raoul the king loves Mademoiselle de la Valliere He confesses it then cried Raoul Yes replied Athos And she I have not seen her No but the king spoke to you about her What did he say He says that she loves him Oh you see you see monsieur said the young man with a gesture of despair Raoul resumed the comte I told the king believe me all that you yourself could possibly have urged and I believe I did so in becoming language though sufficiently firm And what did you say to him monsieur I told him Raoul that everything was now at an end between him and ourselves that you would never serve him again I told him that I too should remain aloof Nothing further remains for me then but to be satisfied of one thing What is that monsieur Whether you have determined to adopt any steps Any steps Regarding what With reference to your disappointed affection and your ideas of vengeance Oh monsieur with regard to my affection I shall perhaps some day or other succeed in tearing it from my heart I trust I shall do so aided by Heaven s merciful help and your own wise exhortations As far as vengeance is concerned it occurred to me only when under the influence of an evil thought for I could not revenge myself upon the one who is actually guilty I have therefore already renounced every idea of revenge And you no longer think of seeking a quarrel with M de Saint Aignan No monsieur I sent him a challenge if M de Saint Aignan accepts it I will maintain it if he does not take it up I will leave things as they are And La Valliere You cannot I know have seriously thought that I should dream of revenging myself upon a woman replied Raoul with a smile so sad that a tear started even to the eyes of his father who had so many times in the course of his life bowed beneath his own sorrows and those of others He held out his hand to Raoul which the latter seized most eagerly And so monsieur le comte you are quite satisfied that the misfortune is one beyond all remedy inquired the young man Poor boy he murmured You think that I still live in hope said Raoul and you pity me Oh it is indeed horrible suffering for me to despise as I am bound to do the one I have loved so devotedly If I had but some real cause of complaint against her I should be happy I should be able to forgive her Athos looked at his son with a profoundly sorrowful air for the words Raoul had just pronounced seemed to have issued out of his own heart At this moment the servant announced M d Artagnan This name sounded very differently to the ears of Athos and Raoul The musketeer entered the room with a vague smile on his lips Raoul paused Athos walked towards his friend with an expression of face that did not escape Bragelonne D Artagnan answered Athos s look by an imperceptible movement of the eyelid and then advancing towards Raoul whom he took by the hand he said addressing both father and son Well you are trying to console this poor boy it seems And you kind and good as usual have come to help me in my difficult task As he said this Athos pressed D Artagnan s hand between both his own Raoul fancied he observed in this pressure something beyond the sense his mere words conveyed Yes replied the musketeer smoothing his mustache with the hand that Athos had left free yes I have come too You are most welcome chevalier not for the consolation you bring with you but on your own account I am already consoled said Raoul and he attempted to smile but the effort was more sad than any tears D Artagnan had ever seen shed That is all well and good then said D Artagnan Only continued Raoul you have arrived just as the comte was about to give me the details of his interview with the king You will allow the comte to continue added the young man as with his eyes fixed on the musketeer he seemed to read the very depths of his heart His interview with the king said D Artagnan in a tone so natural and unassumed that there was no means of suspecting that his astonishment was feigned You have seen the king then Athos Athos smiled as he said Yes I have seen him Ah indeed you were unaware then that the comte had seen his majesty inquired Raoul half reassured Yes indeed quite so In that case I am less uneasy said Raoul Uneasy and about what inquired Athos Forgive me monsieur said Raoul but knowing so well the regard and affection you have for me I was afraid you might possibly have expressed somewhat plainly to his majesty my own sufferings and your indignation and that the king had consequently And that the king had consequently repeated D Artagnan well go on finish what you were going to say I have now to ask you to forgive me Monsieur d Artagnan said Raoul For a moment and I cannot help confessing it I trembled lest you had come here not as M d Artagnan but as captain of the musketeers You are mad my poor boy cried D Artagnan with a burst of laughter in which an exact observer might perhaps have wished to have heard a little more frankness So much the better said Raoul Yes mad and do you know what I would advise you to do Tell me monsieur for the advice is sure to be good as it comes from you Very good then I advise you after your long journey from England after your visit to M de Guiche after your visit to Madame after your visit to Porthos after your journey to Vincennes I advise you I say to take a few hours rest go and lie down sleep for a dozen hours and when you wake up go and ride one of my horses until you have tired him to death And drawing Raoul towards him he embraced him as he would have done his own child Athos did the like only it was very visible that the kiss was still more affectionate and the pressure of his lips even warmer with the father than with the friend The young man again looked at both his companions endeavoring to penetrate their real meaning or their real feelings with the utmost strength of his intelligence but his look was powerless upon the smiling countenance of the musketeer or upon the calm and composed features of the Comte de la Fere Where are you going Raoul inquired the latter seeing that Bragelonne was preparing to go out To my own apartments replied the latter in his soft sad voice We shall be sure to find you there then if we should have anything to say to you Yes monsieur but do you suppose it likely you will have something to say to me How can I tell said Athos Yes something fresh to console you with said D Artagnan pushing him towards the door Raoul observing the perfect composure which marked every gesture of his two friends quitted the comte s room carrying away with him nothing but the individual feeling of his own particular distress Thank Heaven he said since that is the case I need only think of myself And wrapping himself up in his cloak in order to conceal from the passers by in the streets his gloomy and sorrowful face he quitted them for the purpose of returning to his own rooms as he had promised Porthos The two friends watched the young man as he walked away with a feeling of genuine disinterested pity only each expressed it in a different way Poor Raoul said Athos sighing deeply Poor Raoul said D Artagnan shrugging his shoulders Chapter LX Heu Miser Poor Raoul had said Athos Poor Raoul had said D Artagnan and in point of fact to be pitied by both these men Raoul must indeed have been most unhappy And therefore when he found himself alone face to face as it were with his own troubles leaving behind him the intrepid friend and the indulgent father when he recalled the avowal of the king s affection which had robbed him of Louise de la Valliere whom he loved so deeply he felt his heart almost breaking as indeed we all have at least once in our lives at the first illusion destroyed the first affection betrayed Oh he murmured all is over then Nothing is now left me in this world Nothing to look forward to nothing to hope for Guiche has told me so my father has told me so M d Artagnan has told me so All life is but an idle dream The future which I have been hopelessly pursuing for the last ten years is a dream the union of hearts a dream a life of love and happiness a dream Poor fool that I am he continued after a pause to dream away my existence aloud publicly and in the face of others friends and enemies and for what purpose too in order that my friends may be saddened by my troubles and my enemies may laugh at my sorrows And so my unhappiness will soon become a notorious disgrace a public scandal and who knows but that to morrow I may even be a public laughing stock And despite the composure which he had promised his father and D Artagnan to observe Raoul could not resist uttering a few words of darkest menace And yet he continued if my name were De Wardes and if I had the pliancy of character and strength of will of M d Artagnan I should laugh with my lips at least I should convince other women that this perfidious girl honored by the affection I have wasted on her leaves me only one regret that of having been abused and deceived by her seemingly modest and irreproachable conduct a few might perhaps fawn on the king by jesting at my expense I should put myself on the track of some of those buffoons I should chastise a few of them perhaps the men would fear me and by the time I had laid three dying or dead at my feet I should be adored by the women Yes yes that indeed would be the proper course to adopt and the Comte de la Fere himself would not object to it Has not he also been tried in his earlier days in the same manner as I have just been tried myself Did he not replace affection by intoxication He has often told me so Why should I not replace love by pleasure He must have suffered as much as I suffer even more if that is possible The history of one man is the history of all a dragging trial more or less prolonged more or less bitter sorrowful The note of human nature is nothing but one sustained cry But what are the sufferings of others compared to those from which I am now suffering Does the open wound in another s breast soften the anguish of the gaping ulcer in our own Does the blood which is welling from another man s side stanch that which is pouring from our own Does the general grief of our fellow creatures lessen our own private and particular woe No no each suffers on his own account each struggles with his own grief each sheds his own tears And besides he went on what has my life been up to the present moment A cold barren sterile arena in which I have always fought for others never for myself Sometimes for a king sometimes for a woman The king has betrayed the woman disdained me Miserable unlucky wretch that I am Women Can I not make all expiate the crime of one of their sex What does that need To have a heart no longer or to forget that I ever had one to be strong even against weakness itself to lean always even when one feels that the support is giving way What is needed to attain or succeed in all that To be young handsome strong valiant rich I am or shall be all that But honor he still continued and what is honor after all A theory which every man understands in his own way My father tells me Honor is the consideration of what is due to others and particularly what is due to oneself But Guiche and Manicamp and Saint Aignan particularly would say to me What s honor Honor consists in studying and yielding to the passions and pleasures of one s king Honor such as that indeed is easy and productive enough With honor like that I can keep my post at the court become a gentleman of the chamber and accept the command of a regiment which may at any time be presented to me With honor such as that I can be duke and peer The stain which that woman has stamped upon me the grief that has broken my heart the heart of the friend and playmate of her childhood in no way affects M de Bragelonne an excellent officer a courageous leader who will cover himself with glory at the first encounter and who will become a hundred times greater than Mademoiselle de la Valliere is to day the mistress of the king for the king will not marry her and the more publicly he will proclaim her as his mistress the more opaque will grow the shadow of shame he casts upon her face in the guise of a crown and in proportion as others despise as I despise her I shall be gleaning honors in the field Alas we had walked together side by side she and I during the earliest the brightest the most angelic portion of our existence hand in hand along the charming path of life covered with the blossoms of youth and then alas we reach a cross road where she separates herself from me in which we have to follow a different route whereby we become more and more widely separated from each other And to attain the end of this path oh Heaven I am now alone in utter despair and crushed to the very earth Such were the sinister reflections in which Raoul indulged when his foot mechanically paused at the door of his own dwelling He had reached it without remarking the streets through which he passed without knowing how he had come he pushed open the door continued to advance and ascended the staircase The staircase as in most of the houses at that period was very dark and the landings most obscure Raoul lived on the first floor he paused in order to ring Olivain appeared took his sword and cloak from his hands Raoul himself opened the door which from the ante chamber led into a small salon richly furnished enough for the salon of a young man and completely filled with flowers by Olivain who knowing his master s tastes had shown himself studiously attentive in gratifying them without caring whether his master perceived his attention or not There was a portrait of La Valliere in the salon which had been drawn by herself and given by her to Raoul This portrait fastened above a large easy chair covered with dark colored damask was the first point towards which Raoul bent his steps the first object on which he fixed his eyes It was moreover Raoul s usual habit to do so every time he entered his room this portrait before anything else attracted his attention This time as usual he walked straight up to the portrait placed his knees upon the arm chair and paused to look at it sadly His arms were crossed upon his breast his head slightly thrown back his eyes filled with tears his mouth worked into a bitter smile He looked at the portrait of the one he had so tenderly loved and then all that he had said passed before his mind again all that he had suffered seemed again to assail his heart and after a long silence he murmured for the third time Miserable unhappy wretch that I am He had hardly pronounced these words when he heard the sound of a sigh and a groan behind him He turned sharply round and perceived in the angle of the salon standing up a bending veiled female figure which he had been the means of concealing behind the door as he opened it and which he had not perceived as he entered He advanced towards the figure whose presence in his room had not been announced to him and as he bowed and inquired at the same moment who she was she suddenly raised her head and removed the veil from her face revealing her pale and sorrow stricken features Raoul staggered back as if he had seen a ghost Louise he cried in a tone of such absolute despair one could hardly have thought the human voice was capable of so desponding a cry without the snapping of the human heart Chapter LXI Wounds within Wounds Mademoiselle de la Valliere for it was indeed she advanced a few steps towards him Yes Louise she murmured But this interval short as it had been was quite sufficient for Raoul to recover himself You mademoiselle he said and then added in an indefinable tone You here Yes Raoul the young girl replied I have been waiting for you I beg your pardon When I came into the room I was not aware I know but I entreated Olivain not to tell you She hesitated and as Raoul did not attempt to interrupt her a moment s silence ensued during which the sound of their throbbing hearts might have been heard not in unison with each other but the one beating as violently as the other It was for Louise to speak and she made an effort to do so I wished to speak to you she said It was absolutely necessary that I should see you myself alone I have not hesitated to adopt a step which must remain secret for no one except yourself could understand my motive Monsieur de Bragelonne In fact mademoiselle Raoul stammered out almost breathless from emotion as far as I am concerned and despite the good opinion you have of me I confess Will you do me the great kindness to sit down and listen to me said Louise interrupting him with her soft sweet voice Bragelonne looked at her for a moment then mournfully shaking his head he sat or rather fell down on a chair Speak he said She cast a glance all round her This look was a timid entreaty and implored secrecy far more effectually than her expressed words had done a few minutes before Raoul rouse and went to the door which he opened Olivain he said I am not within for any one And then turning towards Louise he added Is not that what you wished Nothing could have produced a greater effect upon Louise than these few words which seemed to signify You see that I still understand you She passed a handkerchief across her eyes in order to remove a rebellious tear which she could not restrain and then having collected herself for a moment she said Raoul do not turn your kind frank look away from me You are not one of those men who despise a woman for having given her heart to another even though her affection might render him unhappy or might wound his pride Raoul did not reply Alas continued La Valliere it is only too true my cause is a bad one and I cannot tell in what way to begin It will be better for me I think to relate to you very simply everything that has befallen me As I shall speak but the pure and simple truth I shall always find my path clear before me in spite of the obscurity and obstacles I have to brave in order to solace my heart which is full to overflowing and wishes to pour itself out at your feet Raoul continued to preserve the same unbroken silence La Valliere looked at him with an air that seemed to say Encourage me for pity s sake but a single word But Raoul did not open his lips and the young girl was obliged to continue Just now she said M de Saint Aignan came to me by the king s directions She cast down her eyes as she said this while Raoul on his side turned his away in order to avoid looking at her M de Saint Aignan came to me from the king she repeated and told me that you knew all and she attempted to look Raoul in the face after inflicting this further wound upon him in addition to the many others he had already received but it was impossible to meet Raoul s eyes He told me you were incensed with me and justly so I admit This time Raoul looked at the young girl and a smile full of disdain passed across his lips Oh she continued I entreat you do not say that you have had any other feeling against me than that of anger merely Raoul wait until I have told you all wait until I have said to you all that I had to say all that I came to say Raoul by the strength of his iron will forced his features to assume a calmer expression and the disdainful smile upon his lip passed away In the first place said La Valliere in the first place with my hands raised in entreaty towards you with my forehead bowed to the ground before you I entreat you as the most generous as the noblest of men to pardon to forgive me If I have left you in ignorance of what was passing in my own bosom never at least would I have consented to deceive you Oh I entreat you Raoul I implore you on my knees answer me one word even though you wrong me in doing so Better far better an injurious word from your lips than suspicion resting in your heart I admire your subtlety of expression mademoiselle said Raoul making an effort to remain calm To leave another in ignorance that you are deceiving him is loyal but to deceive him it seems that would be very wrong and that you would not do it Monsieur for a long time I thought that I loved you better than anything else and so long as I believed in my affection for you I told you that loved you I could have sworn it on the altar but a day came when I was undeceived Well on that day mademoiselle knowing that I still continued to love you true loyalty of conduct should have forced you to inform me you had ceased to love me But on that day Raoul on that day when I read in the depths of my own heart when I confessed to myself that you no longer filled my mind entirely when I saw another future before me than that of being your friend your life long companion your wife on that day Raoul you were not alas any more beside me But you knew where I was mademoiselle you could have written to me Raoul I did not dare to do so Raoul I have been weak and cowardly I knew you so thoroughly I knew how devotedly you loved me that I trembled at the bare idea of the grief I was about to cause you and that is so true Raoul that this very moment I am now speaking to you bending thus before you my heart crushed in my bosom my voice full of sighs my eyes full of tears it is so perfectly true that I have no other defense than my frankness I have no other sorrow greater than that which I read in your eyes Raoul attempted to smile No said the young girl with a profound conviction no no you will not do me so foul a wrong as to disguise your feelings before me now You loved me you were sure of your affection for me you did not deceive yourself you do not lie to your own heart whilst I I And pale as death her arms thrown despairingly above her head she fell upon her knees Whilst you said Raoul you told me you loved me and yet you loved another Alas yes cried the poor girl alas yes I do love another and that other oh for Heaven s sake let me say it Raoul for it is my only excuse that other I love better than my own life better than my own soul even Forgive my fault or punish my treason Raoul I came here in no way to defend myself but merely to say to you You know what it is to love in such a case am I I love to that degree that I would give my life my very soul to the man I love If he should ever cease to love me I shall die of grief and despair unless Heaven come to my assistance unless Heaven does show pity upon me Raoul I came here to submit myself to your will whatever it might be to die if it were your wish I should die Kill me then Raoul if in your heart you believe I deserve death Take care mademoiselle said Raoul the woman who invites death is one who has nothing but her heart s blood to offer to her deceived and betrayed lover You are right she said Raoul uttered a deep sigh as he exclaimed And you love without being able to forget I love without a wish to forget without a wish ever to love any one else replied La Valliere Very well said Raoul You have said to me in fact all you had to say all I could possibly wish to know And now mademoiselle it is I who ask your forgiveness for it is I who have almost been an obstacle in your life I too who have been wrong for in deceiving myself I helped to deceive you Oh said La Valliere I do not ask you so much as that Raoul I only am to blame mademoiselle continued Raoul better informed than yourself of the difficulties of this life I should have enlightened you I ought not to have relied upon uncertainty I ought to have extracted an answer from your heart whilst I hardly even sought an acknowledgement from your lips Once more mademoiselle it is I who ask your forgiveness Impossible impossible she cried you are mocking me How impossible Yes it is impossible to be so good and kind ah perfect to such a degree as that Take care said Raoul with a bitter smile for presently you may say perhaps I did not love you Oh you love me like an affectionate brother let me hope that Raoul As a brother undeceive yourself Louise I love you as a lover as a husband with the deepest the truest the fondest affection Raoul Raoul As a brother Oh Louise I love you so deeply that I would have shed my blood for you drop by drop I would oh how willingly have suffered myself to be torn to pieces for your sake have sacrificed my very future for you I love you so deeply Louise that my heart feels dead and crushed within me my faith in human nature all is gone my eyes have lost their light I loved you so deeply that I now no longer see think of care for anything either in this world or the next Raoul dear Raoul spare me I implore you cried La Valliere Oh if I had but known It is too late Louise you love you are happy in your affection I read your happiness through your tears behind the tears which the loyalty of your nature makes you shed I feel the sighs your affection breathes forth Louise Louise you have made me the most abjectly wretched man living leave me I entreat you Adieu adieu Forgive me oh forgive me Raoul for what I have done Have I not done much much more Have I not told you that I love you still She buried her face in her hands And to tell you that do you hear me Louise to tell you that at such a moment as this to tell you that as I have told you is to pronounce my own sentence of death Adieu La Valliere held out her hands to him in vain We ought not to see each other again in this world he said and as she was on the point of crying out in bitter agony at this remark he placed his hand on her mouth to stifle the exclamation She pressed her lips upon it and fell fainting to the ground Olivain said Raoul take this young lady and bear her to the carriage which is waiting for her at the door As Olivain lifted her up Raoul made a movement as if to dart towards La Valliere in order to give her a first and last kiss but stopping abruptly he said No she is not mine I am no thief as is the king of France And he returned to his room whilst the lackey carried La Valliere still fainting to the carriage Chapter LXII What Raoul Had Guessed As soon as Raoul had quitted Athos and D Artagnan as the two exclamations that had followed his departure escaped their lips they found themselves face to face alone Athos immediately resumed the earnest air that he had assumed at D Artagnan s arrival Well he said what have you come to announce to me my friend I inquired D Artagnan Yes I do not see you in this way without some reason for it said Athos smiling The deuce said D Artagnan I will place you at your ease The king is furious I suppose Well I must say he is not altogether pleased And you have come to arrest me then My dear friend you have hit the very mark Oh I expected it I am quite ready to go with you Deuce take it said D Artagnan what a hurry you are in I am afraid of delaying you said Athos smiling I have plenty of time Are you not curious besides to know how things went on between the king and me If you will be good enough to tell me I will listen with the greatest of pleasure said Athos pointing out to D Artagnan a large chair into which the latter threw himself assuming the easiest possible attitude Well I will do so willingly enough continued D Artagnan for the conversation is rather curious I must say In the first place the king sent for me As soon as I had left You were just going down the last steps of the staircase as the musketeers told me I arrived My dear Athos he was not red in the face merely he was positively purple I was not aware of course of what had passed only on the ground lying on the floor I saw a sword broken in two Captain d Artagnan cried the king as soon as he saw me Sire I replied M de la Fere has just left me he is an insolent man An insolent man I exclaimed in such a tone that the king stopped suddenly short Captain d Artagnan resumed the king with his teeth clenched you will be good enough to listen to and hear me That is my duty sire I have out of consideration for M de la Fere wished to spare him he is a man of whom I still retain some kind recollections the discredit of being arrested in my palace You will therefore take a carriage At this I made a slight movement If you object to arrest him yourself continued the king send me my captain of the guards Sire I replied there is no necessity for the captain of the guards since I am on duty I should not like to annoy you said the king kindly for you have always served me well Monsieur D Artagnan You do not annoy me sire I replied I am on duty that is all But said the king in astonishment I believe the comte is your friend If he were my father sire it would not make me less on duty than I am The king looked at me he saw how unmoved my face was and seemed satisfied You will arrest M le Comte de la Fere then he inquired Most certainly sire if you give me the order to do so Very well I order you to do so I bowed and replied Where is the comte sire You will look for him And am I to arrest him wherever he may be Yes but try that he may be at his own house If he should have started for his own estate leave Paris at once and arrest him on his way thither I bowed but as I did not move he said Well what are you waiting for For the order to arrest the comte signed by yourself The king seemed annoyed for in point of fact it was the exercise of a fresh act of authority a repetition of the arbitrary act if indeed it is to be considered as such He took hold of his pen slowly and evidently in no very good temper and then he wrote Order for M le Chevalier d Artagnan captain of my musketeers to arrest M le Comte de la Fere wherever he is to be found He then turned towards me but I was looking on without moving a muscle of my face In all probability he thought he perceived something like bravado in my tranquil manner for he signed hurriedly and then handing me the order he said Go monsieur I obeyed and here I am Athos pressed his friend s hand Well let us set off he said Oh surely said D Artagnan you must have some trifling matters to arrange before you leave your apartments in this manner I not at all Why not Why you know D Artagnan that I have always been a very simple traveler on this earth ready to go to the end of the world by the order of my sovereign ready to quit it at the summons of my Maker What does a man who is thus prepared require in such a case a portmanteau or a shroud I am ready at this moment as I have always been my dear friend and can accompany you at once But Bragelonne I have brought him up in the same principles I laid down for my own guidance and you observed that as soon as he perceived you he guessed that very moment the motive of your visit We have thrown him off his guard for a moment but do not be uneasy he is sufficiently prepared for my disgrace not to be too much alarmed at it So let us go Very well let us go said D Artagnan quietly As I broke my sword in the king s presence and threw the pieces at his feet I presume that will dispense with the necessity of delivering it over to you You are quite right and besides that what the deuce do you suppose I could do with your sword Am I to walk behind or before you inquired Athos laughing You will walk arm in arm with me replied D Artagnan as he took the comte s arm to descend the staircase and in this manner they arrived at the landing Grimaud whom they had met in the ante room looked at them as they went out together in this manner with some little uneasiness his experience of affairs was quite sufficient to give him good reason to suspect that there was something wrong Ah is that you Grimaud said Athos kindly We are going To take a turn in my carriage interrupted D Artagnan with a friendly nod of the head Grimaud thanked D Artagnan by a grimace which was evidently intended for a smile and accompanied both the friends to the door Athos entered first into the carriage D Artagnan followed him without saying a word to the coachman The departure had taken place so quietly that it excited no disturbance or attention even in the neighborhood When the carriage had reached the quays You are taking me to the Bastile I perceive said Athos I said D Artagnan I take you wherever you may choose to go nowhere else I can assure you What do you mean said the comte surprised Why surely my dear friend said D Artagnan you quite understand that I undertook the mission with no other object in view than that of carrying it out exactly as you liked You surely did not expect that I was going to get you thrown into prison like that brutally and without any reflection If I had anticipated that I should have let the captain of the guards undertake it And so said Athos And so I repeat again we will go wherever you may choose My dear friend said Athos embracing D Artagnan how like you that is Well it seems simple enough to me The coachman will take you to the barrier of the Cours la Reine you will find a horse there which I have ordered to be kept ready for you with that horse you will be able to do three posts without stopping and I on my side will take care not to return to the king to tell him that you have gone away until the very moment it will be impossible to overtake you In the meantime you will have reached Le Havre and from Le Havre across to England where you will find the charming residence of which M Monk made me a present without speaking of the hospitality which King Charles will not fail to show you Well what do you think of this project Athos shook his head and then said smiling as he did so No no take me to the Bastile You are an obstinate fellow my dear Athos returned D Artagnan reflect for a few moments On what subject That you are no longer twenty years of age Believe me I speak according to my own knowledge and experience A prison is certain death for men who are at our time of life No no I will never allow you to languish in prison in such a way Why the very thought of it makes my head turn giddy Dear D Artagnan Athos replied Heaven most fortunately made my body as strong powerful and enduring as my mind and rely upon it I shall retain my strength up to the very last moment But this is not strength of mind or character it is sheer madness No D Artagnan it is the highest order of reasoning Do not suppose that I should in the slightest degree in the world discuss the question with you whether you would not be ruined in endeavoring to save me I should have done precisely as you propose if flight had been part of my plan of action I should therefore have accepted from you what without any doubt you would have accepted from me No I know you too well even to breathe a word upon the subject Ah if you would only let me do it said D Artagnan what a dance we would give his most gracious majesty Still he is the king do not forget that my dear friend Oh that is all the same to me and king though he be I would plainly tell him Sire imprison exile kill every one in France and Europe order me to arrest and poniard even whom you like even were it Monsieur your own brother but do not touch one of the four musketeers or if so mordioux My dear friend replied Athos with perfect calmness I should like to persuade you of one thing namely that I wish to be arrested that I desire above all things that my arrest should take place D Artagnan made a slight movement of his shoulders Nay I wish it I repeat more than anything if you were to let me escape it would be only to return of my own accord and constitute myself a prisoner I wish to prove to this young man who is dazzled by the power and splendor of his crown that he can be regarded as the first and chiefest among men only on the one condition of his proving himself to be the most generous and the wisest He may punish me imprison torture me it matters not He abuses his opportunities and I wish him to learn the bitterness of remorse while Heaven teaches him what chastisement is Well well replied D Artagnan I know only too well that when you have once said no you mean no I do not insist any longer you wish to go to the Bastile I do wish to go there Let us go then To the Bastile cried D Artagnan to the coachman And throwing himself back in the carriage he gnawed the ends of his mustache with a fury which for Athos who knew him well signified a resolution either already taken or in course of formation A profound silence ensued in the carriage which continued to roll on but neither faster nor slower than before Athos took the musketeer by the hand You are not angry with me D Artagnan he said I oh no certainly not of course not What you do for heroism I should have done from obstinacy But you are quite of opinion are you not that Heaven will avenge me D Artagnan And I know one or two on earth who will not fail to lend a helping hand said the captain Chapter LXIII Three Guests Astonished to Find Themselves at Supper Together The carriage arrived at the outside of the gate of the Bastile A soldier on guard stopped it but D Artagnan had only to utter a single word to procure admittance and the carriage passed on without further difficulty Whilst they were proceeding along the covered way which led to the courtyard of the governor s residence D Artagnan whose lynx eyes saw everything even through the walls suddenly cried out What is that out yonder Well said Athos quietly what is it Look yonder Athos In the courtyard Yes yes make haste Well a carriage very likely conveying a prisoner like myself That would be too droll I do not understand you Make haste and look again and look at the man who is just getting out of that carriage At that very moment a second sentinel stopped D Artagnan and while the formalities were being gone through Athos could see at a hundred paces from him the man whom his friend had pointed out to him He was in fact getting out of the carriage at the door of the governor s house Well inquired D Artagnan do you see him Yes he is a man in a gray suit What do you say of him I cannot very well tell he is as I have just now told you a man in a gray suit who is getting out of a carriage that is all Athos I will wager anything that it is he He who Aramis Aramis arrested Impossible I do not say he is arrested since we see him alone in his carriage Well then what is he doing here Oh he knows Baisemeaux the governor replied the musketeer slyly so we have arrived just in time What for In order to see what we can see I regret this meeting exceedingly When Aramis sees me he will be very much annoyed in the first place at seeing me and in the next at being seen Very well reasoned Unfortunately there is no remedy for it whenever any one meets another in the Bastile even if he wished to draw back to avoid him it would be impossible Athos I have an idea the question is to spare Aramis the annoyance you were speaking of is it not What is to be done I will tell you or in order to explain myself in the best possible way let me relate the affair in my own manner I will not recommend you to tell a falsehood for that would be impossible for you to do but I will tell falsehoods enough for both it is easy to do that when one is born to the nature and habits of a Gascon Athos smiled The carriage stopped where the one we have just now pointed out had stopped namely at the door of the governor s house It is understood then said D Artagnan in a low voice to his friend Athos consented by a gesture They ascended the staircase There will be no occasion for surprise at the facility with which they had entered into the Bastile if it be remembered that before passing the first gate in fact the most difficult of all D Artagnan had announced that he had brought a prisoner of state At the third gate on the contrary that is to say when he had once fairly entered the prison he merely said to the sentinel To M Baisemeaux and they both passed on In a few minutes they were in the governor s dining room and the first face which attracted D Artagnan s observation was that of Aramis who was seated side by side with Baisemeaux awaiting the announcement of a meal whose odor impregnated the whole apartment If D Artagnan pretended surprise Aramis did not pretend at all he started when he saw his two friends and his emotion was very apparent Athos and D Artagnan however complimented him as usual and Baisemeaux amazed completely stupefied by the presence of his three guests began to perform a few evolutions around them By what lucky accident We were just going to ask you retorted D Artagnan Are we going to give ourselves up as prisoners cried Aramis with an affection of hilarity Ah ah said D Artagnan it is true the walls smell deucedly like a prison Monsieur de Baisemeaux you know you invited me to sup with you the other day I cried Baisemeaux Yes of course you did although you now seem so struck with amazement Don t you remember it Baisemeaux turned pale and then red looked at Aramis who looked at him and finished by stammering out Certainly I am delighted but upon my honor I have not the slightest Ah I have such a wretched memory Well I am wrong I see said D Artagnan as if he were offended Wrong what for Wrong to remember anything about it it seems Baisemeaux hurried towards him Do not stand on ceremony my dear captain he said I have the worst memory in the world I no sooner leave off thinking of my pigeons and their pigeon house than I am no better than the rawest recruit At all events you remember it now said D Artagnan boldly Yes yes replied the governor hesitating I think I do remember It was when you came to the palace to see me you told me some story or other about your accounts with M de Louviere and M de Tremblay Oh yes perfectly And about M d Herblay s kindness towards you Ah exclaimed Aramis looking at the unhappy governor full in the face and yet you just now said you had no memory Monsieur de Baisemeaux Baisemeaux interrupted the musketeer in the middle of his revelations Yes yes you re quite right how could I have forgotten I remember it now as well as possible I beg you a thousand pardons But now once for all my dear M d Artagnan be sure that at this present time as at any other whether invited or not you are perfectly at home here you and M d Herblay your friend he said turning towards Aramis and this gentleman too he added bowing to Athos Well I thought it would be sure to turn out so replied D Artagnan and that is the reason I came Having nothing to do this evening at the Palais Royal I wished to judge for myself what your ordinary style of living was like and as I was coming along I met the Comte de la Fere Athos bowed The comte who had just left his majesty handed me an order which required immediate attention We were close by here I wished to call in even if it were for no other object than that of shaking hands with you and of presenting the comte to you of whom you spoke so highly that evening at the palace when Certainly certainly M le Comte de la Fere Precisely The comte is welcome I am sure And he will sup with you two I suppose whilst I unfortunate dog that I am must run off on a matter of duty Oh what happy beings you are compared to myself he added sighing as loud as Porthos might have done And so you are going away then said Aramis and Baisemeaux together with the same expression of delighted surprise the tone of which was immediately noticed by D Artagnan I leave you in my place he said a noble and excellent guest And he touched Athos gently on the shoulder who astonished also could not help exhibiting his surprise a little which was noticed by Aramis only for M de Baisemeaux was not quite equal to the three friends in point of intelligence What are you going to leave us resumed the governor I shall only be about an hour or an hour and a half I will return in time for dessert Oh we will wait for you said Baisemeaux No no that would be really disobliging me You will be sure to return though said Athos with an expression of doubt Most certainly he said pressing his friend s hand confidently and he added in a low voice Wait for me Athos be cheerful and lively as possible and above all don t allude even to business affairs for Heaven s sake And with a renewed pressure of the hand he seemed to warn the comte of the necessity of keeping perfectly discreet and impenetrable Baisemeaux led D Artagnan to the gate Aramis with many friendly protestations of delight sat down by Athos determined to make him speak but Athos possessed every virtue and quality to the very highest degree If necessity had required it he would have been the finest orator in the world but on other occasions he would rather have died than have opened his lips Ten minutes after D Artagnan s departure the three gentlemen sat down to table which was covered with the most substantial display of gastronomic luxury Large joints exquisite dishes preserves the greatest variety of wines appeared successively upon the table which was served at the king s expense and of which expense M Colbert would have found no difficulty in saving two thirds without any one in the Bastile being the worse for it Baisemeaux was the only one who ate and drank with gastronomic resolution Aramis allowed nothing to pass by him but merely touched everything he took Athos after the soup and three hors d oeuvres ate nothing more The style of conversation was such as might have been anticipated between three men so opposite in temper and ideas Aramis was incessantly asking himself by what extraordinary chance Athos was there at Baisemeaux s when D Artagnan was no longer there and why D Artagnan did not remain when Athos was there Athos sounded all the depths of the mind of Aramis who lived in the midst of subterfuge evasion and intrigue he studied his man well and thoroughly and felt convinced that he was engaged upon some important project And then he too began to think of his own personal affair and to lose himself in conjectures as to D Artagnan s reason for having left the Bastile so abruptly and for leaving behind him a prisoner so badly introduced and so badly looked after by the prison authorities But we shall not pause to examine into the thoughts and feelings of these personages but will leave them to themselves surrounded by the remains of poultry game and fish which Baisemeaux s generous knife and fork had so mutilated We are going to follow D Artagnan instead who getting into the carriage which had brought him said to the coachman Return to the palace as fast as the horses can gallop Chapter LXIV What Took Place at the Louvre During the Supper at the Bastile M de Saint Aignan had executed the commission with which the king had intrusted him for La Valliere as we have already seen in one of the preceding chapters but whatever his eloquence he did not succeed in persuading the young girl that she had in the king a protector powerful enough for her under any combination of circumstances and that she had no need of any one else in the world when the king was on her side In point of fact at the very first word which the favorite mentioned of the discovery of the famous secret Louise in a passion of tears abandoned herself in utter despair to a sorrow which would have been far from flattering for the king if he had been a witness of it from one of the corners of the room Saint Aignan in his character of ambassador felt almost as greatly offended at it as his master himself would have been and returned to inform the king what he had seen and heard and it is thus we find him in a state of great agitation in the presence of the king who was if possible in a state of even greater flurry than himself But said the king to the courtier when the latter had finished his report what did she decide to do Shall I at least see her presently before supper Will she come to me or shall I be obliged to go to her room I believe sire that if your majesty wishes to see her you will not only have to take the first step in advance but will have to go the whole way That I do not mind Do you think she has yet a secret fancy for young Bragelonne muttered the king between his teeth Oh sire that is not possible for it is you alone I am convinced Mademoiselle de la Valliere loves and that too with all her heart But you know that De Bragelonne belongs to that proud race who play the part of Roman heroes The king smiled feebly he knew how true the illustration was for Athos had just left him As for Mademoiselle de la Valliere Saint Aignan continued she was brought up under the care of the Dowager Madame that is to say in the greatest austerity and formality This young engaged couple coldly exchanged their little vows in the prim presence of the moon and stars and now when they find they have to break those vows asunder it plays the very deuce with them Saint Aignan thought to have made the king laugh but on the contrary from a mere smile Louis passed to the greatest seriousness of manner He already began to experience that remorse which the comte had promised D Artagnan he would inflict upon him He reflected that in fact these young persons had loved and sworn fidelity to each other that one of the two had kept his word and that the other was too conscientious not to feel her perjury most bitterly And his remorse was not unaccompanied for bitter pangs of jealousy began to beset the king s heart He did not say another word and instead of going to pay a visit to his mother or the queen or Madame in order to amuse himself a little and make the ladies laugh as he himself used to say he threw himself into the huge armchair in which his august father Louis XIII had passed so many weary days and years in company with Barradat and Cinq Mars Saint Aignan perceived the king was not to be amused at that moment he tried a last resource and pronounced Louise s name which made the king look up immediately What does your majesty intend to do this evening shall Mademoiselle de la Valliere be informed of your intention to see her It seems she is already aware of that replied the king No no Saint Aignan he continued after a moment s pause we will both of us pass our time in thinking and musing and dreaming when Mademoiselle de la Valliere shall have sufficiently regretted what she now regrets she will deign perhaps to give us some news of herself Ah sire is it possible you can so misunderstand her heart which is so full of devotion The king rose flushed from vexation and annoyance he was a prey to jealousy as well as to remorse Saint Aignan was just beginning to feel that his position was becoming awkward when the curtain before the door was raised The king turned hastily round his first idea was that a letter from Louise had arrived but instead of a letter of love he only saw his captain of musketeers standing upright and perfectly silent in the doorway M d Artagnan he said ah Well monsieur D Artagnan looked at Saint Aignan the king s eyes took the same direction as those of his captain these looks would have been clear to any one and for a still greater reason they were so for Saint Aignan The courtier bowed and quitted the room leaving the king and D Artagnan alone Is it done inquired the king Yes sire replied the captain of the musketeers in a grave voice it is done The king was unable to say another word Pride however obliged him not to pause at what he had done whenever a sovereign has adopted a decisive course even though it be unjust he is compelled to prove to all witnesses and particularly to prove it to himself that he was quite right all through A good means for effecting that an almost infallible means indeed is to try and prove his victim to be in the wrong Louis brought up by Mazarin and Anne of Austria knew better than any one else his vocation as a monarch he therefore endeavored to prove it on the present occasion After a few moment s pause which he had employed in making silently to himself the same reflections which we have just expressed aloud he said in an indifferent tone What did the comte say Nothing at all sire Surely he did not allow himself to be arrested without saying something He said he expected to be arrested sire The king raised his head haughtily I presume he said that M le Comte de la Fere has not continued to play his obstinate and rebellious part In the first place sire what do you wish to signify by rebellious quietly asked the musketeer A rebel in the eyes of the king is a man who not only allows himself to be shut up in the Bastile but still more who opposes those who do not wish to take him there Who do not wish to take him there exclaimed the king What do you say captain Are you mad I believe not sire You speak of persons who did not wish to arrest M de la Fere Who are those persons may I ask I should say those whom your majesty intrusted with that duty But it was you whom I intrusted with it exclaimed the king Yes sire it was I And yet you say that despite my orders you had the intention of not arresting the man who had insulted me Yes sire that was really my intention I even proposed to the comte to mount a horse that I had prepared for him at the Barriere de la Conference And what was your object in getting this horse ready Why sire in order that M le Comte de la Fere might be able to reach Le Havre and from that place make his escape to England You betrayed me then monsieur cried the king kindling with a wild pride Exactly so There was nothing to say in answer to statements made in such a tone the king was astounded at such an obstinate and open resistance on the part of D Artagnan At least you had a reason Monsieur d Artagnan for acting as you did said the king proudly I have always a reason for everything sire Your reason cannot be your friendship for the comte at all events the only one that can be of any avail the only one that could possibly excuse you for I placed you perfectly at your ease in that respect Me sire Did I not give you the choice to arrest or not to arrest M le Comte de la Fere Yes sire but But what exclaimed the king impatiently But you warned me sire that if I did not arrest him your captain of the guard should do so Was I not considerate enough towards you from the very moment I did not compel you to obey me To me sire you were but not to my friend for my friend would be arrested all the same whether by myself or by the captain of the guards And this is your devotion monsieur a devotion which argues and reasons You are no soldier monsieur I wait for your majesty to tell me what I am Well then you are a Frondeur And since there is no longer any Fronde sire in that case But if what you say is true What I say is always true sire What have you come to say to me monsieur I have come to say to your majesty Sire M de la Fere is in the Bastile That is not your fault it would seem That is true sire but at all events he is there and since he is there it is important that your majesty should know it Ah Monsieur d Artagnan so you set your king at defiance Sire Monsieur d Artagnan I warn you that you are abusing my patience On the contrary sire What do you mean by on the contrary I have come to get myself arrested too To get yourself arrested you Of course My friend will get wearied to death in the Bastile by himself and I have come to propose to your majesty to permit me to bear him company if your majesty will but give me the word I will arrest myself I shall not need the captain of the guards for that I assure you The king darted towards the table and seized hold of a pen to write the order for D Artagnan s imprisonment Pay attention monsieur that this is forever cried the king in tones of sternest menace I can quite believe that returned the musketeer for when you have once done such an act as that you will never be able to look me in the face again The king dashed down his pen violently Leave the room monsieur he said Not so if it please your majesty What is that you say Sire I came to speak gently and temperately to your majesty your majesty got into a passion with me that is a misfortune but I shall not the less on that account say what I had to say to you Your resignation monsieur your resignation cried the king Sire you know whether I care about my resignation or not since at Blois on the very day when you refused King Charles the million which my friend the Comte de la Fere gave him I then tendered my resignation to your majesty Very well monsieur do it at once No sire for there is no question of my resignation at the present moment Your majesty took up your pen just now to send me to the Bastile why should you change your intention D Artagnan Gascon that you are who is king allow me to ask you or myself You sire unfortunately What do you mean by unfortunately Yes sire for if it were I If it were you you would approve of M d Artagnan s rebellious conduct I suppose Certainly Really said the king shrugging his shoulders And I should tell my captain of the musketeers continued D Artagnan I should tell him looking at him all the while with human eyes and not with eyes like coals of fire M d Artagnan I had forgotten that I was the king for I descended from my throne in order to insult a gentleman Monsieur said the king do you think you can excuse your friend by exceeding him in insolence Oh sire I should go much further than he did said D Artagnan and it would be your own fault I should tell you what he a man full of the finest sense of delicacy did not tell you I should say Sire you have sacrificed his son and he defended his son you sacrificed himself he addressed you in the name of honor of religion of virtue you repulsed drove him away imprisoned him I should be harder than he was for I should say to you Sire it is for you to choose Do you wish to have friends or lackeys soldiers or slaves great men or mere puppets Do you wish men to serve you or to bend and crouch before you Do you wish men to love you or to be afraid of you If you prefer baseness intrigue cowardice say so at once sire and we will leave you we who are the only individuals who are left nay I will say more the only models of the valor of former times we who have done our duty and have exceeded perhaps in courage and in merit the men already great for posterity Choose sire and that too without delay Whatever relics remain to you of the great nobility guard them with a jealous eye you will never be deficient in courtiers Delay not and send me to the Bastile with my friend for if you did not know how to listen to the Comte de la Fere whose voice is the sweetest and noblest in all the world when honor is the theme if you do not know how to listen to D Artagnan the frankest and honestest voice of sincerity you are a bad king and to morrow will be a poor king And learn from me sire that bad kings are hated by their people and poor kings are driven ignominiously away That is what I had to say to you sire you were wrong to drive me to say it The king threw himself back in his chair cold as death and as livid as a corpse Had a thunderbolt fallen at his feet he could not have been more astonished he seemed as if his respiration had utterly ceased and that he was at the point of death The honest voice of sincerity as D Artagnan had called it had pierced through his heart like a sword blade D Artagnan had said all he had to say Comprehending the king s anger he drew his sword and approaching Louis XIV respectfully he placed it on the table But the king with a furious gesture thrust aside the sword which fell on the ground and rolled to D Artagnan s feet Notwithstanding the perfect mastery which D Artagnan exercised over himself he too in his turn became pale and trembling with indignation said A king may disgrace a soldier he may exile him and may even condemn him to death but were he a hundred times a king he has no right to insult him by casting a dishonor upon his sword Sire a king of France has never repulsed with contempt the sword of a man such as I am Stained with disgrace as this sword now is it has henceforth no other sheath than either your heart or my own I choose my own sire and you have to thank Heaven and my own patience that I do so Then snatching up his sword he cried My blood be upon your head and with a rapid gesture he placed the hilt upon the floor and directed the point of the blade towards his breast The king however with a movement far more rapid than that of D Artagnan threw his right arm around the musketeer s neck and with his left hand seized hold of the blade by the middle and returned it silently to the scabbard D Artagnan upright pale and still trembling let the king do all to the very end Louis overcome and softened by gentler feelings returned to the table took a pen in his hand wrote a few lines signed them and then held it out to D Artagnan What is this paper sire inquired the captain An order for M d Artagnan to set the Comte de la Fere at liberty immediately D Artagnan seized the king s hand and imprinted a kiss upon it he then folded the order placed it in his belt and quitted the room Neither the king nor the captain had uttered a syllable Oh human heart thou guide and director of kings murmured Louis when alone when shall I learn to read in your inmost recesses as in the leaves of a book Oh I am not a bad king nor am I a poor king I am but still a child when all is said and done Chapter LXV Political Rivals D Artagnan had promised M de Baisemeaux to return in time for dessert and he kept his word They had just reached the finer and more delicate class of wines and liqueurs with which the governor s cellar had the reputation of being most admirably stocked when the silver spurs of the captain resounded in the corridor and he himself appeared at the threshold Athos and Aramis had played a close game neither of the two had been able to gain the slightest advantage over the other They had supped talked a good deal about the Bastile of the last journey to Fontainebleau of the intended fete that M Fouquet was about to give at Vaux they had generalized on every possible subject and no one excepting Baisemeaux had in the slightest degree alluded to private matters D Artagnan arrived in the very midst of the conversation still pale and much disturbed by his interview with the king Baisemeaux hastened to give him a chair D Artagnan accepted a glass of wine and set it down empty Athos and Aramis both remarked his emotion as for Baisemeaux he saw nothing more than the captain of the king s musketeers to whom he endeavored to show every possible attention But although Aramis had remarked his emotion he had not been able to guess the cause of it Athos alone believed he had detected it For him D Artagnan s return and particularly the manner in which he usually so impassible seemed overcome signified I have just asked the king something which the king has refused me Thoroughly convinced that his conjecture was correct Athos smiled rose from the table and made a sign to D Artagnan as if to remind him that they had something else to do than to sup together D Artagnan immediately understood him and replied by another sign Aramis and Baisemeaux watched this silent dialogue and looked inquiringly at each other Athos felt that he was called upon to give an explanation of what was passing The truth is my friend said the Comte de la Fere with a smile that you Aramis have been supping with a state criminal and you Monsieur de Baisemeaux with your prisoner Baisemeaux uttered an exclamation of surprise and almost of delight for he was exceedingly proud and vain of his fortress and for his own individual profit the more prisoners he had the happier he was and the higher in rank the prisoners happened to be the prouder he felt Aramis assumed the expression of countenance he thought the position justified and said Well dear Athos forgive me but I almost suspected what has happened Some prank of Raoul and La Valliere I suppose Alas said Baisemeaux And continued Aramis you a high and powerful nobleman as you are forgetful that courtiers now exist you have been to the king I suppose and told him what you thought of his conduct Yes you have guessed right So that said Baisemeaux trembling at having supped so familiarly with a man who had fallen into disgrace with the king so that monsieur le comte So that my dear governor said Athos my friend D Artagnan will communicate to you the contents of the paper which I perceived just peeping out of his belt and which assuredly can be nothing else than the order for my incarceration Baisemeaux held out his hand with his accustomed eagerness D Artagnan drew two papers from his belt and presented one of them to the governor who unfolded it and then read in a low tone of voice looking at Athos over the paper as he did so and pausing from time to time Order to detain in my chateau of the Bastile Monsieur le Comte de la Fere Oh monsieur this is indeed a very melancholy day for me You will have a patient prisoner monsieur said Athos in his calm soft voice A prisoner too who will not remain a month with you my dear governor said Aramis while Baisemeaux still holding the order in his hand transcribed it upon the prison registry Not a day or rather not even a night said D Artagnan displaying the second order of the king for now dear M de Baisemeaux you will have the goodness to transcribe also this order for setting the comte immediately at liberty Ah said Aramis it is a labor that you have deprived me of D Artagnan and he pressed the musketeer s hand in a significant manner at the same moment as that of Athos What said the latter in astonishment the king sets me at liberty Read my dear friend returned D Artagnan Athos took the order and read it It is quite true he said Are you sorry for it asked D Artagnan Oh no on the contrary I wish the king no harm and the greatest evil or misfortune that any one can wish kings is that they should commit an act of injustice But you have had a difficult and painful task I know Tell me have you not D Artagnan I not at all said the musketeer laughing the king does everything I wish him to do Aramis looked fixedly at D Artagnan and saw that he was not speaking the truth But Baisemeaux had eyes for nothing but D Artagnan so great was his admiration for a man who seemed to make the king do all he wished And does the king exile Athos inquired Aramis No not precisely the king did not explain himself upon that subject replied D Artagnan but I think the comte could not well do better unless indeed he wishes particularly to thank the king No indeed replied Athos smiling Well then I think resumed D Artagnan that the comte cannot do better than to retire to his own chateau However my dear Athos you have only to speak to tell me what you want If any particular place of residence is more agreeable to you than another I am influential enough perhaps to obtain it for you No thank you said Athos nothing can be more agreeable to me my dear friend than to return to my solitude beneath my noble trees on the banks of the Loire If Heaven be the overruling physician of the evils of the mind nature is a sovereign remedy And so monsieur continued Athos turning again towards Baisemeaux I am now free I suppose Yes monsieur le comte I think so at least I hope so said the governor turning over and over the two papers in question unless however M d Artagnan has a third order to give me No my dear Baisemeaux no said the musketeer the second is quite enough we will stop there if you please Ah monsieur le comte said Baisemeaux addressing Athos you do not know what you are losing I should have placed you among the thirty franc prisoners like the generals what am I saying I mean among the fifty francs like the princes and you would have supped every evening as you have done to night Allow me monsieur said Athos to prefer my own simpler fare And then turning to D Artagnan he said Let us go my dear friend Shall I have that greatest of all pleasures for me that of having you as my companion To the city gate only replied D Artagnan after which I will tell you what I told the king I am on duty And you my dear Aramis said Athos smiling will you accompany me La Fere is on the road to Vannes Thank you my dear friend said Aramis but I have an appointment in Paris this evening and I cannot leave without very serious interests suffering by my absence In that case said Athos I must say adieu and take my leave of you My dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux I have to thank you exceedingly for your kind and friendly disposition towards me and particularly for the enjoyable specimen you have given me of the ordinary fare of the Bastile And having embraced Aramis and shaken hands with M de Baisemeaux and having received best wishes for a pleasant journey from them both Athos set off with D Artagnan Whilst the denouement of the scene of the Palais Royal was taking place at the Bastile let us relate what was going on at the lodgings of Athos and Bragelonne Grimaud as we have seen had accompanied his master to Paris and as we have said he was present when Athos went out he had observed D Artagnan gnaw the corners of his mustache he had seen his master get into the carriage he had narrowly examined both their countenances and he had known them both for a sufficiently long period to read and understand through the mask of their impassibility that something serious was the matter As soon as Athos had gone he began to reflect he then and then only remembered the strange manner in which Athos had taken leave of him the embarrassment imperceptible as it would have been to any but himself of the master whose ideas were to him so clear and defined and the expression of whose wishes was so precise He knew that Athos had taken nothing with him but the clothes he had on him at the time and yet he seemed to fancy that Athos had not left for an hour merely or even for a day A long absence was signified by the manner in which he pronounced the word Adieu All these circumstances recurred to his mind with feelings of deep affection for Athos with that horror of isolation and solitude which invariably besets the minds of those who love and all these combined rendered poor Grimaud very melancholy and particularly uneasy Without being able to account to himself for what he did since his master s departure he wandered about the room seeking as it were for some traces of him like a faithful dog who is not exactly uneasy about his absent master but at least is restless Only as in addition to the instinct of the animal Grimaud subjoined the reasoning faculties of the man Grimaud therefore felt uneasy and restless too Not having found any indication which could serve as a guide and having neither seen nor discovered anything which could satisfy his doubts Grimaud began to wonder what could possibly have happened Besides imagination is the resource or rather the plague of gentle and affectionate hearts In fact never does a feeling heart represent its absent friend to itself as being happy or cheerful Never does the dove that wings its flight in search of adventures inspire anything but terror at home Grimaud soon passed from uneasiness to terror he carefully went over in his own mind everything that had taken place D Artagnan s letter to Athos the letter which had seemed to distress Athos so much after he had read it then Raoul s visit to Athos which resulted in Athos desiring him Grimaud to get his various orders and his court dress ready to put on then his interview with the king at the end of which Athos had returned home so unusually gloomy then the explanation between the father and the son at the termination of which Athos had embraced Raoul with such sadness of expression while Raoul himself went away equally weary and melancholy and finally D Artagnan s arrival biting as if he were vexed the end of his mustache and leaving again in the carriage accompanied by the Comte de la Fere All this composed a drama in five acts very clearly particularly for so analytical an observer as Grimaud The first step he took was to search in his master s coat for M d Artagnan s letter he found the letter still there and its contents were found to run as follows MY DEAR FRIEND Raoul has been to ask me for some particulars about the conduct of Mademoiselle de la Valliere during our young friend s residence in London I am a poor captain of musketeers and I am sickened to death every day by hearing all the scandal of the barracks and bedside conversations If I had told Raoul all I believe I know the poor fellow would have died of it but I am in the king s service and cannot relate all I hear about the king s affairs If your heart tells you to do it set off at once the matter concerns you more than it does myself and almost as much as Raoul Grimaud tore not a handful but a finger and thumbful of hair out of his head he would have done more if his head of hair had been in a more flourishing condition Yes he said that is the key of the whole enigma The young girl has been playing her pranks what people say about her and the king is true then our young master has been deceived he ought to know it Monsieur le comte has been to see the king and has told him a piece of his mind and then the king sent M d Artagnan to arrange the affair Ah gracious goodness continued Grimaud monsieur le comte I now remember returned without his sword This discovery made the perspiration break out all over poor Grimaud s face He did not waste any more time in useless conjecture but clapped his hat on his head and ran to Raoul s lodgings Raoul after Louise had left him had mastered his grief if not his affection and compelled to look forward on that perilous road over which madness and revulsion were hurrying him he had seen from the very first glance his father exposed to the royal obstinacy since Athos had himself been the first to oppose any resistance to the royal will At this moment from a very natural sequence of feeling the unhappy young man remembered the mysterious signs which Athos had made and the unexpected visit of D Artagnan the result of the conflict between a sovereign and a subject revealed itself to his terrified vision As D Artagnan was on duty that is a fixture at his post without the possibility of leaving it it was certainly not likely that he had come to pay Athos a visit merely for the pleasure of seeing him He must have come to say something to him This something in the midst of such painful conjectures must have been the news of either a misfortune or a danger Raoul trembled at having been so selfish as to have forgotten his father for his affection at having in a word passed his time in idle dreams or in an indulgence of despair at a time when a necessity existed for repelling such an imminent attack on Athos The very idea nearly drove him frantic he buckled on his sword and ran towards his father s lodgings On his way there he encountered Grimaud who having set off from the opposite pole was running with equal eagerness in search of the truth The two men embraced each other most warmly Grimaud exclaimed Raoul is the comte well Have you seen him No where is he I am trying to find out And M d Artagnan Went out with him When Ten minutes after you did In what way did they go out In a carriage Where did they go I have no idea at all Did my father take any money with him No Or his sword No I have an idea Grimaud that M d Artagnan came in order to Arrest monsieur le comte do you not think monsieur Yes Grimaud I could have sworn it What road did they take The way leading towards the quay To the Bastile then Yes yes Quick quick let us run Yes let us not lose a moment But where are we to go said Raoul overwhelmed We will go to M d Artagnan s first we may perhaps learn something there No if they keep me in ignorance at my father s they will do the same everywhere Let us go to Oh good heavens why I must be mad to day Grimaud I have forgotten M du Vallon who is waiting for and expecting me still Where is he then At the Minimes of Vincennes Thank goodness that is on the same side as the Bastile I will run and saddle the horses and we will go at once said Grimaud Do my friend do Chapter LXVI In Which Porthos Is Convinced without Having Understood Anything The good and worthy Porthos faithful to all the laws of ancient chivalry had determined to wait for M de Saint Aignan until sunset and as Saint Aignan did not come as Raoul had forgotten to communicate with his second and as he found that waiting so long was very wearisome Porthos had desired one of the gate keepers to fetch him a few bottles of good wine and a good joint of meat so that at least he might pass away the time by means of a glass or two and a mouthful of something to eat He had just finished when Raoul arrived escorted by Grimaud both of them riding at full speed As soon as Porthos saw the two cavaliers riding at such a pace along the road he did not for a moment doubt but that they were the men he was expecting and he rose from the grass upon which he had been indolently reclining and began to stretch his legs and arms saying See what it is to have good habits The fellow has finished by coming after all If I had gone away he would have found no one here and would have taken advantage of that He then threw himself into a martial attitude and drew himself up to the full height of his gigantic stature But instead of Saint Aignan he only saw Raoul who with the most despairing gestures accosted him by crying out Pray forgive me my dear friend I am most wretched Raoul cried Porthos surprised You have been angry with me said Raoul embracing Porthos I What for For having forgotten you But I assure you my head seems utterly lost If you only knew You have killed him Who Saint Aignan or if that is not the case what is the matter The matter is that Monsieur le Comte de la Fere has by this time been arrested Porthos gave a start that would have thrown down a wall Arrested he cried out by whom By D Artagnan It is impossible said Porthos My dear friend it is perfectly true Porthos turned towards Grimaud as if he needed a second confirmation of the intelligence Grimaud nodded his head And where have they taken him Probably to the Bastile What makes you think that As we came along we questioned some persons who saw the carriage pass and others who saw it enter the Bastile Oh muttered Porthos What do you intend to do inquired Raoul I Nothing only I will not have Athos remain at the Bastile Do you know said Raoul advancing nearer to Porthos that the arrest was made by order of the king Porthos looked at the young man as if to say What does that matter to me This dumb language seemed so eloquent of meaning to Raoul that he did not ask any other question He mounted his horse again and Porthos assisted by Grimaud had already done the same Let us arrange our plan of action said Raoul Yes returned Porthos that is the best thing we can do Raoul sighed deeply and then paused suddenly What is the matter asked Porthos are you faint No only I feel how utterly helpless our position is Can we three pretend to go and take the Bastile Well if D Artagnan were only here replied Porthos I am not so very certain we would fail Raoul could not resist a feeling of admiration at the sight of such perfect confidence heroic in its simplicity These were truly the celebrated men who by three or four attacked armies and assaulted castles Men who had terrified death itself who had survived the wrecks of a tempestuous age and still stood stronger than the most robust of the young Monsieur said he to Porthos you have just given me an idea we absolutely must see M d Artagnan Undoubtedly He ought by this time to have returned home after having taken my father to the Bastile Let us go to his house First inquire at the Bastile said Grimaud who was in the habit of speaking little but that to the purpose Accordingly they hastened towards the fortress when one of those chances which Heaven bestows on men of strong will caused Grimaud suddenly to perceive the carriage which was entering by the great gate of the drawbridge This was the moment that D Artagnan was as we have seen returning from his visit to the king In vain was it that Raoul urged on his horse in order to join the carriage and to see whom it contained The horses had already gained the other side of the great gate which again closed while one of the sentries struck the nose of Raoul s horse with his musket Raoul turned about only too happy to find he had ascertained something respecting the carriage which had contained his father We have him said Grimaud If we wait a little it is certain he will leave don t you think so my friend Unless indeed D Artagnan also be a prisoner replied Porthos in which case everything is lost Raoul returned no answer for any hypothesis was admissible He instructed Grimaud to lead the horses to the little street Jean Beausire so as to give rise to less suspicion and himself with his piercing gaze watched for the exit either of D Artagnan or the carriage Nor had he decided wrongly for twenty minutes had not elapsed before the gate reopened and the carriage reappeared A dazzling of the eyes prevented Raoul from distinguishing what figures occupied the interior Grimaud averred that he had seen two persons and that one of them was his master Porthos kept looking at Raoul and Grimaud by turns in the hope of understanding their idea It is clear said Grimaud that if the comte is in the carriage either he is set at liberty or they are taking him to another prison We shall soon see that by the road he takes answered Porthos If he is set at liberty said Grimaud they will conduct him home True rejoined Porthos The carriage does not take that way cried Raoul and indeed the horses were just disappearing down the Faubourg saint Antoine Let us hasten said Porthos we will attack the carriage on the road and tell Athos to flee Rebellion murmured Raoul Porthos darted a second glance at Raoul quite worthy of the first Raoul replied only by spurring the flanks of his steed In a few moments the three cavaliers had overtaken the carriage and followed it so closely that their horses breath moistened the back of it D Artagnan whose senses were ever on the alert heard the trot of the horses at the moment when Raoul was telling Porthos to pass the chariot so as to see who was the person accompanying Athos Porthos complied but could not see anything for the blinds were lowered Rage and impatience were gaining mastery over Raoul He had just noticed the mystery preserved by Athos s companion and determined on proceeding to extremities On his part D Artagnan had perfectly recognized Porthos and Raoul also from under the blinds and had communicated to the comte the result of his observation They were desirous only of seeing whether Raoul and Porthos would push the affair to the uttermost And this they speedily did for Raoul presenting his pistol threw himself on the leader commanding the coachmen to stop Porthos seized the coachman and dragged him from his seat Grimaud already had hold of the carriage door Raoul threw open his arms exclaiming M le comte M le comte Ah is it you Raoul said Athos intoxicated with joy Not bad indeed added D Artagnan with a burst of laughter and they both embraced the young man and Porthos who had taken possession of them My brave Porthos best of friends cried Athos it is still the same old way with you He is still only twenty said D Artagnan brave Porthos Confound it answered Porthos slightly confused we thought that you were being arrested While rejoined Athos the matter in question was nothing but my taking a drive in M d Artagnan s carriage But we followed you from the Bastile returned Raoul with a tone of suspicion and reproach Where we had been to take supper with our friend M Baisemeaux Do you recollect Baisemeaux Porthos Very well indeed And there we saw Aramis In the Bastile At supper Ah said Porthos again breathing freely He gave us a thousand messages to you And where is M le comte going asked Grimaud already recompensed by a smile from his master We were going home to Blois How can that be At once said Raoul Yes right forward Without any luggage Oh Raoul would have been instructed to forward me mine or to bring it with him on his return if he returns If nothing detains him longer in Paris said D Artagnan with a glance firm and cutting as steel and as painful for it reopened the poor young fellow s wounds he will do well to follow you Athos There is nothing to keep me any longer in Paris said Raoul Then we will go immediately And M d Artagnan Oh as for me I was only accompanying Athos as far as the barrier and I return with Porthos Very good said the latter Come my son added the comte gently passing his arm around Raoul s neck to draw him into the carriage and again embracing him Grimaud continued the comte you will return quietly to Paris with your horse and M du Vallon s for Raoul and I will mount here and give up the carriage to these two gentlemen to return to Paris in and then as soon as you arrive you will take my clothes and letters and forward the whole to me at home But observed Raoul who was anxious to make the comte converse when you return to Paris there will not be a single thing there for you which will be very inconvenient I think it will be a very long time Raoul ere I return to Paris The last sojourn we have made there has not been of a nature to encourage me to repeat it Raoul hung down his head and said not a word more Athos descended from the carriage and mounted the horse which had brought Porthos and which seemed no little pleased at the exchange Then they embraced and clasped each other s hands and interchanged a thousand pledges of eternal friendship Porthos promised to spend a month with Athos at the first opportunity D Artagnan engaged to take advantage of his first leave of absence and then having embraced Raoul for the last time To you my boy said he I will write Coming from D Artagnan who he knew wrote very seldom these words expressed everything Raoul was moved even to tears He tore himself away from the musketeer and departed D Artagnan rejoined Porthos in the carriage Well said he my dear friend what a day we have had Indeed we have answered Porthos You must be quite worn out Not quite however I shall retire early to rest so as to be ready for to morrow And wherefore Why to complete what I have begun You make me shudder my friend you seem to me quite angry What the devil have you begun which is not finished Listen Raoul has not fought but I must fight With whom with the king How exclaimed Porthos astounded with the king Yes I say you great baby with the king I assure you it is with M Saint Aignan Look now this is what I mean you draw your sword against the king in fighting with this gentleman Ah said Porthos staring are you sure of it Indeed I am What in the world are we to do then We must try and make a good supper Porthos The captain of the musketeers keeps a tolerable table There you will see the handsome Saint Aignan and will drink his health I cried Porthos horrified What said D Artagnan you refuse to drink the king s health But body alive I am not talking to you about the king at all I am speaking of M de Saint Aignan But when I repeat that it is the same thing Ah well well said Porthos overcome You understand don t you No answered Porthos but tis all the same Chapter LXVII M de Baisemeaux s Society The reader has not forgotten that on quitting the Bastile D Artagnan and the Comte de la Fere had left Aramis in close confabulation with Baisemeaux When once these two guests had departed Baisemeaux did not in the least perceive that the conversation suffered by their absence He used to think that wine after supper and that of the Bastile in particular was excellent and that it was a stimulation quite sufficient to make any honest man talkative But he little knew his Greatness who was never more impenetrable than at dessert His Greatness however perfectly understood M de Baisemeaux when he reckoned on making the governor discourse by the means which the latter regarded as efficacious The conversation therefore without flagging in appearance flagged in reality for Baisemeaux not only had it nearly all to himself but further kept speaking only of that singular event the incarceration of Athos followed by so prompt an order to set him again at liberty Nor moreover had Baisemeaux failed to observe that the two orders of arrest and of liberation were both in the king s hand But then the king would not take the trouble to write similar orders except under pressing circumstances All this was very interesting and above all very puzzling to Baisemeaux but as on the other hand all this was very clear to Aramis the latter did not attach to the occurrence the same importance as did the worthy governor Besides Aramis rarely put himself out of the way for anything and he had not yet told M de Baisemeaux for what reason he had now done so And so at the very climax of Baisemeaux s dissertation Aramis suddenly interrupted him Tell me my dear Baisemeaux said he have you never had any other diversions at the Bastile than those at which I assisted during the two or three visits I have had the honor to pay you This address was so unexpected that the governor like a vane which suddenly receives an impulsion opposed to that of the wind was quite dumbfounded at it Diversions said he but I take them continually monseigneur Oh to be sure And these diversions Are of every kind Visits no doubt No not visits Visits are not frequent at the Bastile What are visits rare then Very much so Even on the part of your society What do you term my society the prisoners Oh no your prisoners indeed I know well it is you who visit them and not they you By your society I mean my dear Baisemeaux the society of which you are a member Baisemeaux looked fixedly at Aramis and then as if the idea which had flashed across his mind were impossible Oh he said I have very little society at present If I must own it to you dear M d Herblay the fact is to stay at the Bastile appears for the most part distressing and distasteful to persons of the gay world As for the ladies it is never without a certain dread which costs me infinite trouble to allay that they succeed in reaching my quarters And indeed how should they avoid trembling a little poor things when they see those gloomy dungeons and reflect that they are inhabited by prisoners who And in proportion as the eyes of Baisemeaux concentrated their gaze on the face of Aramis the worthy governor s tongue faltered more and more until it ended by stopping altogether No you don t understand me my dear M Baisemeaux you don t understand me I do not at all mean to speak of society in general but of a particular society of the society in a word to which you are affiliated Baisemeaux nearly dropped the glass of muscat which he was in the act of raising to his lips Affiliated cried he affiliated Yes affiliated undoubtedly repeated Aramis with the greatest self possession Are you not a member of a secret society my dear M Baisemeaux Secret Secret or mysterious Oh M d Herblay Consider now don t deny it But believe me I believe what I know I swear to you Listen to me my dear M Baisemeaux I say yes you say no one of us two necessarily says what is true and the other it inevitably follows what is false Well and then Well we shall come to an understanding presently Let us see said Baisemeaux let us see Now drink your glass of muscat dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux said Aramis What the devil you look quite scared No no not the least in the world oh no Drink then Baisemeaux drank but he swallowed the wrong way Well resumed Aramis if I say you are not a member of a secret or mysterious society which you like to call it the epithet is of no consequence if I say you are not a member of a society similar to that I wish to designate well then you will not understand a word of what I am going to say That is all Oh be sure beforehand that I shall not understand anything Well well Try now let us see That is what I am going to do If on the contrary you are one of the members of this society you will immediately answer me yes or no Begin your questions continued Baisemeaux trembling You will agree dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux continued Aramis with the same impassibility that it is evident a man cannot be a member of a society it is evident that he cannot enjoy the advantages it offers to the affiliated without being himself bound to certain little services In short stammered Baisemeaux that would be intelligible if Well resumed Aramis there is in the society of which I speak and of which as it seems you are not a member Allow me said Baisemeaux I should not like to say absolutely There is an engagement entered into by all the governors and captains of fortresses affiliated to the order Baisemeaux grew pale Now the engagement continued Aramis firmly is of this nature Baisemeaux rose manifesting unspeakable emotion Go on dear M d Herblay go on said he Aramis then spoke or rather recited the following paragraph in the same tone as if he had been reading it from a book The aforesaid captain or governor of a fortress shall allow to enter when need shall arise and on demand of the prisoner a confessor affiliated to the order He stopped Baisemeaux was quite distressing to look at being so wretchedly pale and trembling Is not that the text of the agreement quietly asked Aramis Monseigneur began Baisemeaux Ah well you begin to understand I think Monseigneur cried Baisemeaux do not trifle so with my unhappy mind I find myself as nothing in your hands if you have the malignant desire to draw from me the little secrets of my administration Oh by no means pray undeceive yourself dear M Baisemeaux it is not the little secrets of your administration but those of your conscience that I aim at Well then my conscience be it dear M d Herblay But have some consideration for the situation I am in which is no ordinary one It is no ordinary one my dear monsieur continued the inflexible Aramis if you are a member of this society but it is a quite natural one if free from all engagement You are answerable only to the king Well monsieur well I obey only the king and whom else would you have a French nobleman obey Aramis did not yield an inch but with that silvery voice of his continued It is very pleasant said he for a French nobleman for a prelate of France to hear a man of your mark express himself so loyally dear De Baisemeaux and having heard you to believe no more than you do Have you doubted monsieur I oh no And so you doubt no longer I have no longer any doubt that such a man as you monsieur said Aramis gravely does not faithfully serve the masters whom he voluntarily chose for himself Masters cried Baisemeaux Yes masters I said Monsieur d Herblay you are still jesting are you not Oh yes I understand that it is a more difficult position to have several masters than one but the embarrassment is owing to you my dear Baisemeaux and I am not the cause of it Certainly not returned the unfortunate governor more embarrassed than ever but what are you doing You are leaving the table Assuredly Are you going Yes I am going But you are behaving very strangely towards me monseigneur I am behaving strangely how do you make that out Have you sworn then to put me to the torture No I should be sorry to do so Remain then I cannot And why Because I have no longer anything to do here and indeed I have duties to fulfil elsewhere Duties so late as this Yes understand me now my dear De Baisemeaux they told me at the place whence I came The aforesaid governor or captain will allow to enter as need shall arise on the prisoner s demand a confessor affiliated with the order I came you do not know what I mean and so I shall return to tell them that they are mistaken and that they must send me elsewhere What you are cried Baisemeaux looking at Aramis almost in terror The confessor affiliated to the order said Aramis without changing his voice But gentle as the words were they had the same effect on the unhappy governor as a clap of thunder Baisemeaux became livid and it seemed to him as if Aramis s beaming eyes were two forks of flame piercing to the very bottom of his soul The confessor murmured he you monseigneur the confessor of the order Yes I but we have nothing to unravel together seeing that you are not one of the affiliated Monseigneur And I understand that not being so you refuse to comply with its command Monseigneur I beseech you condescend to hear me And wherefore Monseigneur I do not say that I have nothing to do with the society Ah ah I say not that I refuse to obey Nevertheless M de Baisemeaux what has passed wears very much the air of resistance Oh no monseigneur no I only wished to be certain To be certain of what said Aramis in a tone of supreme contempt Of nothing at all monseigneur Baisemeaux lowered his voice and bending before the prelate said I am at all times and in all places at the disposal of my superiors but Very good I like you better thus monsieur said Aramis as he resumed his seat and put out his glass to Baisemeaux whose hand trembled so that he could not fill it You were saying but continued Aramis But replied the unhappy man having received no notice I was very far from expecting it Does not the Gospel say Watch for the moment is known only of God Do not the rules of the order say Watch for that which I will you ought always to will also And what pretext will serve you now that you did not expect the confessor M de Baisemeaux Because monseigneur there is at present in the Bastile no prisoner ill Aramis shrugged his shoulders What do you know about that said he But nevertheless it appears to me M de Baisemeaux said Aramis turning round in his chair here is your servant who wishes to speak with you and at this moment De Baisemeaux s servant appeared at the threshold of the door What is it asked Baisemeaux sharply Monsieur said the man they are bringing you the doctor s return Aramis looked at De Baisemeaux with a calm and confident eye Well said he let the messenger enter The messenger entered saluted and handed in the report Baisemeaux ran his eye over it and raising his head said in surprise No twelve is ill How was it then said Aramis carelessly that you told me everybody was well in your hotel M de Baisemeaux And he emptied his glass without removing his eyes from Baisemeaux The governor then made a sign to the messenger and when he had quitted the room said still trembling I think that there is in the article on the prisoner s demand Yes it is so answered Aramis But see what it is they want with you now And that moment a sergeant put his head in at the door What do you want now cried Baisemeaux Can you not leave me in peace for ten minutes Monsieur said the sergeant the sick man No twelve has commissioned the turnkey to request you to send him a confessor Baisemeaux very nearly sank on the floor but Aramis disdained to reassure him just as he had disdained to terrify him What must I answer inquired Baisemeaux Just what you please replied Aramis compressing his lips that is your business I am not the governor of the Bastile Tell the prisoner cried Baisemeaux quickly tell the prisoner that his request is granted The sergeant left the room Oh monseigneur monseigneur murmured Baisemeaux how could I have suspected how could I have foreseen this Who requested you to suspect and who besought you to foresee contemptuously answered Aramis The order suspects the order knows the order foresees is that not enough What is it you command added Baisemeaux I nothing at all I am nothing but a poor priest a simple confessor Have I your orders to go and see the sufferer Oh monseigneur I do not order I pray you to go Tis well conduct me to him End of Louise de la Valliere The last text in the series is The Man in
