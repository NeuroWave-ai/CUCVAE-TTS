Spinoza Translated from the Latin by R H M Elwes PART I CONCERNING GOD DEFINITIONS I By that which is self caused I mean that of which the essence involves existence or that of which the nature is only conceivable as existent II A thing is called finite after its kind when it can be limited by another thing of the same nature for instance a body is called finite because we always conceive another greater body So also a thought is limited by another thought but a body is not limited by thought nor a thought by body III By substance I mean that which is in itself and is conceived through itself in other words that of which a conception can be formed independently of any other conception IV By attribute I mean that which the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance V By mode I mean the modifications one of substance or that which exists in and is conceived through something other than itself one Affectiones VI By God I mean a being absolutely infinite that is a substance consisting in infinite attributes of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality Explanation I say absolutely infinite not infinite after its kind for of a thing infinite only after its kind infinite attributes may be denied but that which is absolutely infinite contains in its essence whatever expresses reality and involves no negation VII That thing is called free which exists solely by the necessity of its own nature and of which the action is determined by itself alone On the other hand that thing is necessary or rather constrained which is determined by something external to itself to a fixed and definite method of existence or action VIII By eternity I mean existence itself in so far as it is conceived necessarily to follow solely from the definition of that which is eternal Explanation Existence of this kind is conceived as an eternal truth like the essence of a thing and therefore cannot be explained by means of continuance or time though continuance may be conceived without a beginning or end AXIOMS I Everything which exists exists either in itself or in something else II That which cannot be conceived through anything else must be conceived through itself III From a given definite cause an effect necessarily follows and on the other hand if no definite cause be granted it is impossible that an effect can follow IV The knowledge of an effect depends on and involves the knowledge of a cause V Things which have nothing in common cannot be understood the one by means of the other the conception of one does not involve the conception of the other VI A true idea must correspond with its ideate or object VII If a thing can be conceived as non existing its essence does not involve existence PROPOSITIONS PROP I Substance is by nature prior to its modifications Proof This is clear from Deff iii and v PROP II Two substances whose attributes are different have nothing in common Proof Also evident from Def iii For each must exist in itself and be conceived through itself in other words the conception of one does not imply the conception of the other PROP III Things which have nothing in common cannot be one the cause of the other Proof If they have nothing in common it follows that one cannot be apprehended by means of the other Ax v and therefore one cannot be the cause of the other Ax iv Q E D PROP IV Two or more distinct things are distinguished one from the other either by the difference of the attributes of the substances or by the difference of their modifications Proof Everything which exists exists either in itself or in something else Ax i that is by Deff iii and v nothing is granted in addition to the understanding except substance and its modifications Nothing is therefore given besides the understanding by which several things may be distinguished one from the other except the substances or in other words see Ax iv their attributes and modifications Q E D PROP V There cannot exist in the universe two or more substances having the same nature or attribute Proof If several distinct substances be granted they must be distinguished one from the other either by the difference of their attributes or by the difference of their modifications Prop iv If only by the difference of their attributes it will be granted that there cannot be more than one with an identical attribute If by the difference of their modifications as substance is naturally prior to its modifications Prop i it follows that setting the modifications aside and considering substance in itself that is truly Deff iii and vi there cannot be conceived one substance different from another that is by Prop iv there cannot be granted several substances but one substance only Q E D PROP VI One substance cannot be produced by another substance Proof It is impossible that there should be in the universe two substances with an identical attribute i e which have anything common to them both Prop ii and therefore Prop iii one cannot be the cause of the other neither can one be produced by the other Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that a substance cannot be produced by anything external to itself For in the universe nothing is granted save substances and their modifications as appears from Ax i and Deff iii and v Now by the last Prop substance cannot be produced by another substance therefore it cannot be produced by anything external to itself Q E D This is shown still more readily by the absurdity of the contradictory For if substance be produced by an external cause the knowledge of it would depend on the knowledge of its cause Ax iv and by Def iii it would itself not be substance PROP VII Existence belongs to the nature of substances Proof Substance cannot be produced by anything external Corollary Prop vi it must therefore be its own cause that is its essence necessarily involves existence or existence belongs to its nature PROP VIII Every substance is necessarily infinite Proof There can only be one substance with an identical attribute and existence follows from its nature Prop vii its nature therefore involves existence either as finite or infinite It does not exist as finite for by Def ii it would then be limited by something else of the same kind which would also necessarily exist Prop vii and there would be two substances with an identical attribute which is absurd Prop v It therefore exists as infinite Q E D

none	none	I As finite existence involves a partial negation and infinite existence is the absolute affirmation of the given nature it follows solely from Prop vii that every substance is necessarily infinite Note II No doubt it will be difficult for those who think about things loosely and have not been accustomed to know them by their primary causes to comprehend the demonstration of Prop vii for such persons make no distinction between the modifications of substances and the substances themselves and are ignorant of the manner in which things are produced hence they may attribute to substances the beginning which they observe in natural objects Those who are ignorant of true causes make complete confusion think that trees might talk just as well as men that men might be formed from stones as well as from seed and imagine that any form might be changed into any other So also those who confuse the two natures divine and human readily attribute human passions to the deity especially so long as they do not know how passions originate in the mind But if people would consider the nature of substance they would have no doubt about the truth of Prop vii In fact this proposition would be a universal axiom and accounted a truism For by substance would be understood that which is in itself and is conceived through itself that is something of which the conception requires not the conception of anything else whereas modifications exist in something external to themselves and a conception of them is formed by means of a conception of the thing in which they exist Therefore we may have true ideas of non existent modifications for although they may have no actual existence apart from the conceiving intellect yet their essence is so involved in something external to themselves that they may through it be conceived Whereas the only truth substances can have external to the intellect must consist in their existence because they are conceived through themselves Therefore for a person to say that he has a clear and distinct that is a true idea of a substance but that he is not sure whether such substance exists would be the same as if he said that he had a true idea but was not sure whether or no it was false a little consideration will make this plain or if anyone affirmed that substance is created it would be the same as saying that a false idea was true in short the height of absurdity It must then necessarily be admitted that the existence of substance as its essence is an eternal truth And we can hence conclude by another process of reasoning that there is but one such substance I think that this may profitably be done at once and in order to proceed regularly with the demonstration we must premise one The true definition of a thing neither involves nor expresses anything beyond the nature of the thing defined From this it follows that two No definition implies or expresses a certain number of individuals inasmuch as it expresses nothing beyond the nature of the thing defined For instance the definition of a triangle expresses nothing beyond the actual nature of a triangle it does not imply any fixed number of triangles three There is necessarily for each individual existent thing a cause why it should exist four This cause of existence must either be contained in the nature and definition of the thing defined or must be postulated apart from such definition It therefore follows that if a given number of individual things exist in nature there must be some cause for the existence of exactly that number neither more nor less For example if twenty men exist in the universe for simplicity s sake I will suppose them existing simultaneously and to have had no predecessors and we want to account for the existence of these twenty men it will not be enough to show the cause of human existence in general we must also show why there are exactly twenty men neither more nor less for a cause must be assigned for the existence of each individual Now this cause cannot be contained in the actual nature of man for the true definition of man does not involve any consideration of the number twenty Consequently the cause for the existence of these twenty men 
3227-24788-0023	train-other-500	and consequently
none	none	 of each of them must necessarily be sought externally to each individual Hence we may lay down the absolute rule that everything which may consist of several individuals must have an external cause And as it has been shown already that existence appertains to the nature of substance existence must necessarily be included in its definition and from its definition alone existence must be deducible But from its definition as we have shown notes ii iii we cannot infer the existence of several substances therefore it follows that there is only one substance of the same nature Q E D PROP IX The more reality or being a thing has the greater the number of its attributes Def iv PROP X Each particular attribute of the one substance must be conceived through itself Proof An attribute is that which the intellect perceives of substance as constituting its essence Def iv and therefore must be conceived through itself Def iii Q E D Note It is thus evident that though two attributes are in fact conceived as distinct that is one without the help of the other yet we cannot therefore conclude that they constitute two entities or two different substances For it is the nature of substance that each of its attributes is conceived through itself inasmuch as all the attributes it has have always existed simultaneously in it and none could be produced by any other but each expresses the reality or being of substance It is then far from an absurdity to ascribe several attributes to one substance for nothing in nature is more clear than that each and every entity must be conceived under some attribute and that its reality or being is in proportion to the number of its attributes expressing necessity or eternity and infinity Consequently it is abundantly clear that an absolutely infinite being must necessarily be defined as consisting in infinite attributes each of which expresses a certain eternal and infinite essence If anyone now ask by what sign shall he be able to distinguish different substances let him read the following propositions which show that there is but one substance in the universe and that it is absolutely infinite wherefore such a sign would be sought in vain PROP XI God or substance consisting of infinite attributes of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality necessarily exists Proof If this be denied conceive if possible that God does not exist then his essence does not involve existence But this Prop vii is absurd Therefore God necessarily exists Another proof Of everything whatsoever a cause or reason must be assigned either for its existence or for its non existence e g if a triangle exist a reason or cause must be granted for its existence if on the contrary it does not exist a cause must also be granted which prevents it from existing or annuls its existence 
4854_24731_000005_000001	train-clean-360	This reason or cause must either be contained in the nature of the thing in question or be external to it 
4854_24731_000005_000002	train-clean-360	For instance the reason for the non existence of a square circle is indicated in its nature namely because it would involve a contradiction 
4854_24731_000005_000003	train-clean-360	On the other hand the existence of substance follows also solely from its nature inasmuch as its nature involves existence 
none	none	See Prop vii But the reason for the existence of a triangle or a circle does not follow from the nature of those figures but from the order of universal nature in extension 
4854_24731_000006_000001	train-clean-360	From the latter it must follow either that a triangle necessarily exists or that it is impossible that it should exist 
4854_24731_000006_000002	train-clean-360	So much is self evident 
none	none	It follows therefrom that a thing necessarily exists if no cause or reason be granted which prevents its existence 
4854_24731_000007_000000	train-clean-360	If then no cause or reason can be given which prevents the existence of God or which destroys his existence we must certainly conclude that he necessarily does exist 
4854_24731_000007_000001	train-clean-360	If such a reason or cause should be given it must either be drawn from the very nature of God or be external to him that is drawn from another substance of another nature 
4854_24731_000007_000002	train-clean-360	For if it were of the same nature God by that very fact would be admitted to exist 
none	none	But substance of another nature could have nothing in common with God by Prop ii and therefore would be unable either to cause or to destroy his existence As then a reason or cause which would annul the divine existence cannot be drawn from anything external to the divine nature such cause must perforce if God does not exist be drawn from God s own nature which would involve a contradiction 
4854_24731_000008_000001	train-clean-360	To make such an affirmation about a being absolutely infinite and supremely perfect is absurd therefore neither in the nature of God nor externally to his nature can a cause or reason be assigned which would annul his existence 
none	none	Therefore God necessarily exists Q E D 
4854_24731_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Another proof The potentiality of non existence is a negation of power and contrariwise the potentiality of existence is a power as is obvious 
4854_24731_000009_000001	train-clean-360	If then that which necessarily exists is nothing but finite beings such finite beings are more powerful than a being absolutely infinite which is obviously absurd therefore either nothing exists or else a being absolutely infinite necessarily exists also 
none	none	Now we exist either in ourselves or in something else which necessarily exists see Axiom i and Prop vii Therefore a being absolutely infinite in other words God Def vi necessarily exists Q E D 
4854_24731_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Note In this last proof I have purposely shown God s existence a posteriori so that the proof might be more easily followed not because from the same premises God s existence does not follow a priori 
4854_24731_000010_000001	train-clean-360	For as the potentiality of existence is a power it follows that in proportion as reality increases in the nature of a thing so also will it increase its strength for existence 
none	none	Therefore a being absolutely infinite such as God has from himself an absolutely infinite power of existence and hence he does absolutely exist 
4854_24731_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Perhaps there will be many who will be unable to see the force of this proof inasmuch as they are accustomed only to consider those things which flow from external causes 
4854_24731_000010_000004	train-clean-360	Of such things they see that those which quickly come to pass that is quickly come into existence quickly also disappear whereas they regard as more difficult of accomplishment that is not so easily brought into existence those things which they conceive as more complicated 
none	none	However to do away with this misconception I need not here show the measure of truth in the proverb What comes quickly goes quickly nor discuss whether from the point of view of universal nature all things are equally easy or otherwise I need only remark that I am not here speaking of things which come to pass through causes external to themselves but only of substances which by Prop vi cannot be produced by any external cause 
4854_24731_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Things which are produced by external causes whether they consist of many parts or few owe whatsoever perfection or reality they possess solely to the efficacy of their external cause and therefore their existence arises solely from the perfection of their external cause not from their own 
4854_24731_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Contrariwise whatsoever perfection is possessed by substance is due to no external cause wherefore the existence of substance must arise solely from its own nature which is nothing else but its essence 
4854_24731_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Thus the perfection of a thing does not annul its existence but on the contrary asserts it Imperfection on the other hand does annul it therefore we cannot be more certain of the existence of anything than of the existence of a being absolutely infinite or perfect that is of God 
none	none	For inasmuch as his essence excludes all imperfection and involves absolute perfection all cause for doubt concerning his existence is done away and the utmost certainty on the question is given This I think will be evident to every moderately attentive reader PROP XII No attribute of substance can be conceived from which it would follow that substance can be divided Proof The parts into which substance as thus conceived would be divided either will retain the nature of substance or they will not If the former then by Prop viii each part will necessarily be infinite and by Prop vi self caused and by Prop v will perforce consist of a different attribute so that in that case several substances could be formed out of one substance which by Prop vi is absurd Moreover the parts by Prop ii would have nothing in common with their whole and the whole by Def iv and Prop x could both exist and be conceived without its parts which everyone will admit to be absurd If we adopt the second alternative namely that the parts will not retain the nature of substance then if the whole substance were divided into equal parts it would lose the nature of substance and would cease to exist which by Prop vii is absurd PROP XIII 
4854_24731_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Substance absolutely infinite is indivisible 
4854_24731_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Proof If it could be divided the parts into which it was divided would either retain the nature of absolutely infinite substance or they would not 
none	none	If the former we should have several substances of the same nature which by Prop v is absurd If the latter then by Prop vii substance absolutely infinite could cease to exist which by Prop xi is also absurd 
4854_24731_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Corollary It follows that no substance and consequently no extended substance in so far as it is substance is divisible 
none	none	Note The indivisibility of substance may be more easily understood as follows The nature of substance can only be conceived as infinite and by a part of substance nothing else can be understood than finite substance which by Prop viii involves a manifest contradiction PROP XIV Besides God no substance can be granted or conceived Proof As God is a being absolutely infinite of whom no attribute that expresses the essence of substance can be denied by Def vi and he necessarily exists by Prop xi if any substance besides God were granted it would have to be explained by some attribute of God and thus two substances with the same attribute would exist which by Prop v is absurd therefore besides God no substance can be granted or consequently be conceived 
4854_24731_000019_000001	train-clean-360	If it could be conceived it would necessarily have to be conceived as existent but this by the first part of this proof is absurd 
none	none	Therefore besides God no substance can be granted or conceived Q E D Corollary I Clearly therefore one God is one that is by Def vi only one substance can be granted in the universe and that substance is absolutely infinite as we have already indicated in the note to Prop x 
4854_24731_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Corollary II It follows two 
4854_24732_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Corollary II It follows two 
none	none	That extension and thought are either attributes of God or by Ax i accidents affectiones of the attributes of God PROP XV 
4854_24731_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Whatsoever is is in God and without God nothing can be or be conceived 
none	none	Proof Besides God no substance is granted or can be conceived by Prop xiv that is by Def iii nothing which is in itself and is conceived through itself But modes by Def v can neither be nor be conceived without substance wherefore they can only be in the divine nature and can only through it be conceived But substances and modes form the sum total of existence by Ax i therefore without God nothing can be or be conceived Q E D 
4854_24731_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Note Some assert that God like a man consists of body and mind and is susceptible of passions 
none	none	How far such persons have strayed from the truth is sufficiently evident from what has been said 
4854_24731_000024_000002	train-clean-360	But these I pass over 
none	none	For all who have in anywise reflected on the divine nature deny that God has a body 
4854_24731_000024_000004	train-clean-360	Of this they find excellent proof in the fact that we understand by body a definite quantity so long so broad so deep bounded by a certain shape and it is the height of absurdity to predicate such a thing of God a being absolutely infinite 
4854_24731_000024_000005	train-clean-360	But meanwhile by other reasons with which they try to prove their point they show that they think corporeal or extended substance wholly apart from the divine nature and say it was created by God 
none	none	Wherefrom the divine nature can have been created they are wholly ignorant thus they clearly show that they do not know the meaning of their own words I myself have proved sufficiently clearly at any rate in my own judgment Coroll Prop vi and note two Prop viii that no substance can be produced or created by anything other than itself Further I showed in Prop xiv that besides God no substance can be granted or conceived 
4854_24731_000024_000010	train-clean-360	Hence we drew the conclusion that extended substance is one of the infinite attributes of God 
4854_24731_000024_000011	train-clean-360	However in order to explain more fully I will refute the arguments of my adversaries which all start from the following points 
4854_24731_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Extended substance in so far as it is substance consists as they think in parts wherefore they deny that it can be infinite or consequently that it can appertain to God 
none	none	This they illustrate with many examples of which I will take one or two 
4854_24731_000025_000002	train-clean-360	If extended substance they say is infinite let it be conceived to be divided into two parts each part will then be either finite or infinite 
4854_24731_000025_000003	train-clean-360	If the former then infinite substance is composed of two finite parts which is absurd 
4854_24731_000025_000004	train-clean-360	If the latter then one infinite will be twice as large as another infinite which is also absurd 
4854_24731_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Further if an infinite line be measured out in foot lengths it will consist of an infinite number of such parts it would equally consist of an infinite number of parts if each part measured only an inch therefore one infinity would be twelve times as great as the other 
4854_24731_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Lastly if from a single point there be conceived to be drawn two diverging lines which at first are at a definite distance apart but are produced to infinity it is certain that the distance between the two lines will be continually increased until at length it changes from definite to indefinable 
4854_24731_000027_000001	train-clean-360	As these absurdities follow it is said from considering quantity as infinite the conclusion is drawn that extended substance must necessarily be finite and consequently cannot appertain to the nature of God 
none	none	The second argument is also drawn from God s supreme perfection God it is said inasmuch as he is a supremely perfect being cannot be passive but extended substance insofar as it is divisible is passive 
4854_24731_000028_000002	train-clean-360	It follows therefore that extended substance does not appertain to the essence of God 
none	none	Such are the arguments I find on the subject in writers who by them try to prove that extended substance is unworthy of the divine nature and cannot possibly appertain thereto However I think an attentive reader will see that I have already answered their propositions for all their arguments are founded on the hypothesis that extended substance is composed of parts and such a hypothesis I have shown Prop xii and Coroll Prop xiii to be absurd Moreover anyone who reflects will see that all these absurdities if absurdities they be which I am not now discussing from which it is sought to extract the conclusion that extended substance is finite do not at all follow from the notion of an infinite quantity but merely from the notion that an infinite quantity is measurable and composed of finite parts therefore the only fair conclusion to be drawn is that infinite quantity is not measurable and cannot be composed of finite parts This is exactly what we have already proved in Prop xii Wherefore the weapon which they aimed at us has in reality recoiled upon themselves 
4854_24731_000029_000007	train-clean-360	If from this absurdity of theirs they persist in drawing the conclusion that extended substance must be finite they will in good sooth be acting like a man who asserts that circles have the properties of squares and finding himself thereby landed in absurdities proceeds to deny that circles have any center from which all lines drawn to the circumference are equal 
none	none	For taking extended substance which can only be conceived as infinite one and indivisible Props viii v xii they assert in order to prove that it is finite that it is composed of finite parts and that it can be multiplied and divided So also others after asserting that a line is composed of points can produce many arguments to prove that a line cannot be infinitely divided Assuredly it is not less absurd to assert that extended substance is made up of bodies or parts than it would be to assert that a solid is made up of surfaces a surface of lines and a line of points This must be admitted by all who know clear reason to be infallible and most of all by those who deny the possibility of a vacuum 
4854_24731_000030_000003	train-clean-360	For if extended substance could be so divided that its parts were really separate why should not one part admit of being destroyed the others remaining joined together as before 
none	none	And why should all be so fitted into one another as to leave no vacuum 
4854_24731_000030_000005	train-clean-360	Surely in the case of things which are really distinct one from the other one can exist without the other and can remain in its original condition 
4854_24731_000030_000006	train-clean-360	As then there does not exist a vacuum in nature of which anon but all parts are bound to come together to prevent it it follows from this that the parts cannot really be distinguished and that extended substance in so far as it is substance cannot be divided 
4854_24731_000031_000000	train-clean-360	If anyone asks me the further question Why are we naturally so prone to divide quantity 
4854_24731_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I answer that quantity is conceived by us in two ways in the abstract and superficially as we imagine it or as substance as we conceive it solely by the intellect 
none	none	If then we regard quantity as it is represented in our imagination which we often and more easily do we shall find that it is finite divisible and compounded of parts but if we regard it as it is represented in our intellect and conceive it as substance which it is very difficult to do we shall then as I have sufficiently proved find that it is infinite one and indivisible 
4854_24731_000031_000003	train-clean-360	This will be plain enough to all who make a distinction between the intellect and the imagination especially if it be remembered that matter is everywhere the same that its parts are not distinguishable except in so far as we conceive matter as diversely modified whence its parts are distinguished not really but modally 
4854_24731_000031_000004	train-clean-360	For instance water in so far as it is water we conceive to be divided and its parts to be separated one from the other but not in so far as it is extended substance from this point of view it is neither separated nor divisible 
none	none	Further water in so far as it is water is produced and corrupted but in so far as it is substance it is neither produced nor corrupted 
4854_24731_000032_000000	train-clean-360	I think I have now answered the second argument it is in fact founded on the same assumption as the first namely that matter in so far as it is substance is divisible and composed of parts 
none	none	Even if it were so I do not know why it should be considered unworthy of the divine nature inasmuch as besides God by Prop xiv no substance can be granted wherefrom it could receive its modifications 
4854_24731_000032_000002	train-clean-360	All things I repeat are in God and all things which come to pass come to pass solely through the laws of the infinite nature of God and follow as I will shortly show from the necessity of his essence 
4854_24731_000032_000003	train-clean-360	Wherefore it can in nowise be said that God is passive in respect to anything other than himself or that extended substance is unworthy of the Divine nature even if it be supposed divisible so long as it is granted to be infinite and eternal 
none	none	But enough of this for the present PROP XVI From the necessity of the divine nature must follow an infinite number of things in infinite ways that is all things which can fall within the sphere of infinite intellect Proof This proposition will be clear to everyone who remembers that from the given definition of any thing the intellect infers several properties which really necessarily follow therefrom that is from the actual essence of the thing defined and it infers more properties in proportion as the definition of the thing expresses more reality that is in proportion as the essence of the thing defined involves more reality Now as the divine nature has absolutely infinite attributes by Def vi of which each expresses infinite essence after its kind it follows that from the necessity of its nature an infinite number of things that is everything which can fall within the sphere of an infinite intellect must necessarily follow Q E D Corollary I Hence it follows that God is the efficient cause of all that can fall within the sphere of an infinite intellect 
4854_24732_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Corollary II It also follows that God is a cause in himself and not through an accident of his nature 
4854_24732_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Corollary III It follows thirdly that God is the absolutely first cause 
none	none	PROP XVII God acts solely by the laws of his own nature and is not constrained by anyone Proof We have just shown in Prop xvi that solely from the necessity of the divine nature or what is the same thing solely from the laws of his nature an infinite number of things absolutely follow in an infinite number of ways and we proved in Prop xv that without God nothing can be nor be conceived but that all things are in God Wherefore nothing can exist outside himself whereby he can be conditioned or constrained to act Wherefore God acts solely by the laws of his own nature and is not constrained by anyone Q E D Corollary I It follows one That there can be no cause which either extrinsically or intrinsically besides the perfection of his own nature moves God to act Corollary II It follows two 
4854_24732_000008_000001	train-clean-360	That God is the sole free cause 
none	none	For God alone exists by the sole necessity of his nature by Prop xi and Prop xiv Coroll i and acts by the sole necessity of his own nature wherefore God is by Def vii the sole free cause Q E D 
4854_24732_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Note Others think that God is a free cause because he can as they think bring it about that those things which we have said follow from his nature that is which are in his power should not come to pass or should not be produced by him 
4854_24732_000009_000001	train-clean-360	But this is the same as if they said that God could bring it about that it should follow from the nature of a triangle that its three interior angles should not be equal to two right angles or that from a given cause no effect should follow which is absurd 
4854_24732_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Moreover I will show below without the aid of this proposition that neither intellect nor will appertain to God s nature 
4854_24732_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I know that there are many who think that they can show that supreme intellect and free will do appertain to God s nature for they say they know of nothing more perfect which they can attribute to God than that which is the highest perfection in ourselves 
4854_24732_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Further although they conceive God as actually supremely intelligent they yet do not believe that he can bring into existence everything which he actually understands for they think that they would thus destroy God s power 
none	none	If they contend God had created everything which is in his intellect he would not be able to create anything more and this they think would clash with God s omnipotence therefore they prefer to asset that God is indifferent to all things and that he creates nothing except that which he has decided by some absolute exercise of will to create However I think I have shown sufficiently clearly by Prop xvi that from God s supreme power or infinite nature an infinite number of things that is all things have necessarily flowed forth in an infinite number of ways or always flow from the same necessity in the same way as from the nature of a triangle it follows from eternity and for eternity that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles Wherefore the omnipotence of God has been displayed from all eternity and will for all eternity remain in the same state of activity 
4854_24732_000010_000006	train-clean-360	This manner of treating the question attributes to God an omnipotence in my opinion far more perfect 
4854_24732_000010_000007	train-clean-360	For otherwise we are compelled to confess that God understands an infinite number of creatable things which he will never be able to create for if he created all that he understands he would according to this showing exhaust his omnipotence and render himself imperfect 
4854_24732_000010_000008	train-clean-360	Wherefore in order to establish that God is perfect we should be reduced to establishing at the same time that he cannot bring to pass everything over which his power extends this seems to be a hypothesis most absurd and most repugnant to God s omnipotence 
4854_24732_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Further to say a word here concerning the intellect and the will which we attribute to God if intellect and will appertain to the eternal essence of God we must take these words in some significance quite different from those they usually bear 
4854_24732_000011_000001	train-clean-360	For intellect and will which should constitute the essence of God would perforce be as far apart as the poles from the human intellect and will in fact would have nothing in common with them but the name there would be about as much correspondence between the two as there is between the Dog the heavenly constellation and a dog an animal that barks 
4854_24732_000011_000002	train-clean-360	This I will prove as follows 
none	none	If intellect belongs to the divine nature it cannot be in nature as ours is generally thought to be posterior to or simultaneous with the things understood inasmuch as God is prior to all things by reason of his causality Prop xvi Coroll i On the contrary the truth and formal essence of things is as it is because it exists by representation as such in the intellect of God Wherefore the intellect of God in so far as it is conceived to constitute God s essence is in reality the cause of things both of their essence and of their existence 
4854_24732_000011_000006	train-clean-360	This seems to have been recognized by those who have asserted that God s intellect God s will and God s power are one and the same 
4854_24732_000011_000007	train-clean-360	As therefore God s intellect is the sole cause of things namely both of their essence and existence it must necessarily differ from them in respect to its essence and in respect to its existence 
4854_24732_000011_000008	train-clean-360	For a cause differs from a thing it causes precisely in the quality which the latter gains from the former 
none	none	For example a man is the cause of another man s existence but not of his essence for the latter is an eternal truth and therefore the two men may be entirely similar in essence but must be different in existence and hence if the existence of one of them cease the existence of the other will not necessarily cease also but if the essence of one could be destroyed and be made false the essence of the other would be destroyed also 
4854_24732_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Wherefore a thing which is the cause both of the essence and of the existence of a given effect must differ from such effect both in respect to its essence and also in respect to its existence 
none	none	Now the intellect of God is the cause both of the essence and the existence of our intellect therefore the intellect of God in so far as it is conceived to constitute the divine essence differs from our intellect both in respect to essence and in respect to existence nor can it in anywise agree therewith save in name as we said before The reasoning would be identical in the case of the will as anyone can easily see PROP XVIII God is the indwelling and not the transient cause of all things Proof All things which are are in God and must be conceived through God by Prop xv therefore by Prop xvi Coroll i God is the cause of those things which are in him This is our first point Further besides God there can be no substance by Prop xiv that is nothing in itself external to God 
4854_24732_000014_000002	train-clean-360	This is our second point 
4854_24732_000014_000003	train-clean-360	God therefore is the indwelling and not the transient cause of all things 
none	none	Q E D PROP XIX 
4854_24732_000015_000001	train-clean-360	God and all the attributes of God are eternal 
none	none	Proof God by Def vi is substance which by Prop xi necessarily exists that is by Prop vii existence appertains to its nature or what is the same thing follows from its definition therefore God is eternal by Def viii Further by the attributes of God we must understand that which by Def iv expresses the essence of the divine substance in other words that which appertains to substance that I say should be involved in the attributes of substance Now eternity appertains to the nature of substance as I have already shown in Prop vii therefore eternity must appertain to each of the attributes and thus all are eternal Q E D Note This proposition is also evident from the manner in which in Prop xi I demonstrated the existence of God it is evident I repeat from that proof that the existence of God like his essence is an eternal truth Further in Prop xix 
4854_24732_000017_000002	train-clean-360	of my Principles of the Cartesian Philosophy I have proved the eternity of God in another manner which I need not here repeat 
none	none	PROP XX 
4854_24732_000018_000001	train-clean-360	The existence of God and his essence are one and the same 
none	none	Proof God by the last Prop and all his attributes are eternal that is by Def viii each of his attributes expresses existence 
4854_24732_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Therefore the same attributes of God which explain his eternal essence explain at the same time his eternal existence in other words that which constitutes God s essence constitutes at the same time his existence 
none	none	Wherefore God s existence and God s essence are one and the same Q E D Coroll I Hence it follows that God s existence like his essence is an eternal truth Coroll II Secondly it follows that God and all the attributes of God are unchangeable 
4854_24732_000021_000002	train-clean-360	For if they could be changed in respect to existence they must also be able to be changed in respect to essence that is obviously be changed from true to false which is absurd 
none	none	PROP XXI All things which follow from the absolute nature of any attribute of God must always exist and be infinite or in other words are eternal and infinite through the said attribute Proof Conceive if it be possible supposing the proposition to be denied that something in some attribute of God can follow from the absolute nature of the said attribute and that at the same time it is finite and has a conditioned existence or duration for instance the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought Now thought in so far as it is supposed to be an attribute of God is necessarily by Prop xi in its nature infinite But in so far as it possesses the idea of God it is supposed finite It cannot however be conceived as finite unless it be limited by thought by Def ii but it is not limited by thought itself in so far as it has constituted the idea of God for so far it is supposed to be finite therefore it is limited by thought in so far as it has not constituted the idea of God which nevertheless by Prop xi must necessarily exist We have now granted therefore thought not constituting the idea of God and accordingly the idea of God does not naturally follow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought for it is conceived as constituting and also as not constituting the idea of God which is against our hypothesis Wherefore if the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought or indeed anything else in any attribute of God for we may take any example as the proof is of universal application follows from the necessity of the absolute nature of the said attribute the said thing must necessarily be infinite which was our first point Furthermore a thing which thus follows from the necessity of the nature of any attribute cannot have a limited duration For if it can suppose a thing which follows from the necessity of the nature of some attribute to exist in some attribute of God for instance the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought and let it be supposed at some time not to have existed or to be about not to exist Now thought being an attribute of God must necessarily exist unchanged by Prop xi and Prop xx Coroll ii and beyond the limits of the duration of the idea of God supposing the latter at some time not to have existed or not to be going to exist thought would perforce have existed without the idea of God which is contrary to our hypothesis for we supposed that thought being given the idea of God necessarily flowed therefrom Therefore the idea of God expressed in thought or anything which necessarily follows from the absolute nature of some attribute of God cannot have a limited duration but through the said attribute is eternal which is our second point Bear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of anything which in any attribute necessarily follows from God s absolute nature PROP XXII Whatsoever follows from any attribute of God in so far as it is modified by a modification which exists necessarily and as infinite through the said attribute must also exist necessarily and as infinite Proof The proof of this proposition is similar to that of the preceding one PROP XXIII Every mode which exists both necessarily and as infinite must necessarily follow either from the absolute nature of some attribute of God or from an attribute modified by a modification which exists necessarily and as infinite Proof A mode exists in something else through which it must be conceived Def v that is Prop xv it exists solely in God and solely through God can be conceived If therefore a mode is conceived as necessarily existing and infinite it must necessarily be inferred or perceived through some attribute of God in so far as such attribute is conceived as expressing the infinity and necessity of existence in other words Def viii eternity that is in so far as it is considered absolutely A mode therefore which necessarily exists as infinite must follow from the absolute nature of some attribute of God either immediately Prop xxi or through the means of some modification which follows from the absolute nature of the said attribute that is by Prop xxii which exists necessarily and as infinite PROP XXIV The essence of things produced by God does not involve existence Proof This proposition is evident from Def i For that of which the nature considered in itself involves existence is self caused and exists by the sole necessity of its own nature Corollary Hence it follows that God is not only the cause of things coming into existence but also of their continuing in existence that is in scholastic phraseology God is cause of the being of things essendi rerum For whether things exist or do not exist whenever we contemplate their essence we see that it involves neither existence nor duration consequently it cannot be the cause of either the one or the other God must be the sole cause inasmuch as to him alone does existence appertain Prop xiv Coroll i Q E D PROP XXV God is the efficient cause not only of the existence of things but also of their essence Proof If this be denied then God is not the cause of the essence of things and therefore the essence of things can by Ax iv be conceived without God This by Prop xv is absurd Therefore God is the cause of the essence of things Q E D Note This proposition follows more clearly from Prop xvi For it is evident thereby that given the divine nature the essence of things must be inferred from it no less than their existence in a word God must be called the cause of all things in the same sense as he is called the cause of himself This will be made still clearer by the following corollary Corollary Individual things are nothing but modifications of the attributes of God or modes by which the attributes of God are expressed in a fixed and definite manner The proof appears from Prop xv and Def v PROP XXVI 
4863-24734-0000	train-other-500	A thing which is conditioned to act in a particular manner has necessarily been thus conditioned by God and that which has not been conditioned by God cannot condition itself to act Proof
4863-24734-0001	train-other-500	That by which things are said to be conditioned to act in a particular manner is necessarily something positive this is obvious therefore both of its essence and of its existence God by the necessity of his nature is the efficient cause
none	none	 Props xxv and xvi 
4863-24734-0002	train-other-500	this is our first point Our second point is plainly to be inferred therefrom For if a thing which has not been conditioned by God could condition itself the first part of our proof would be false and this as we have shown is absurd
none	none	 PROP XXVII A thing which has been conditioned by God to act in a particular way cannot render itself unconditioned Proof This proposition is evident from the third axiom PROP XXVIII Every individual thing or everything which is finite and has a conditioned existence cannot exist or be conditioned to act unless it be conditioned for existence and action by a cause other than itself which also is finite and has a conditioned existence and likewise this cause cannot in its turn exist or be conditioned to act unless it be conditioned for existence and action by another cause which also is finite and has a conditioned existence and so on to infinity Proof Whatsoever is conditioned to exist and act has been thus conditioned by God by Prop xxvi and Prop xxiv Coroll But that which is finite and has a conditioned existence cannot be produced by the absolute nature of any attribute of God for whatsoever follows from the absolute nature of any attribute of God is infinite and eternal by Prop xxi It must therefore follow from some attribute of God in so far as the said attribute is considered as in some way modified for substance and modes make up the sum total of existence by Ax i and Def iii v while modes are merely modifications of the attributes of God 
4863-24734-0003	train-other-500	But from God or from any of his attributes in so far as the latter is modified
none	none	 by a modification infinite and eternal a conditioned thing cannot follow Wherefore it must follow from or be conditioned for existence and action by God or one of his attributes in so far as the latter are modified by some modification which is finite and has a conditioned existence 
4863-24734-0004	train-other-500	This is our first point Again this cause or this modification for the reason by which we established the first part of this proof must in its turn be conditioned by another cause which also is finite and has a conditioned existence and again
4863-24734-0005	train-other-500	this last by another for the same reason and so on for the same reason to infinity
none	none	 Q E D 
4863-24734-0006	train-other-500	Note As certain things must be produced immediately by God namely those things which necessarily follow from his absolute nature through the means of these primary attributes which nevertheless can neither exist nor be conceived without God it follows
none	none	 one 
4863-24734-0007	train-other-500	That God is absolutely the proximate cause of those things immediately produced by him I say absolutely not after his kind
none	none	 as is usually stated For the effects of God cannot either exist or be conceived without a cause Prop xv and Prop xxiv Coroll two That God cannot properly be styled the remote cause of individual things except for the sake of distinguishing these from what he immediately produces or rather from what follows from his absolute nature For by a remote cause we understand a cause which is in no way conjoined to the effect But all things which are are in God and so depend on God that without him they can neither be nor be conceived PROP XXIX Nothing in the universe is contingent but all things are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular manner by the necessity of the divine nature Proof Whatsoever is is in God Prop xv But God cannot be called a thing contingent For by Prop xi he exists necessarily and not contingently Further the modes of the divine nature follow therefrom necessarily and not contingently Prop xvi and they thus follow whether we consider the divine nature absolutely or whether we consider it as in any way conditioned to act Prop xxvii Further God is not only the cause of these modes in so far as they simply exist by Prop xxiv Coroll but also in so far as they are considered as conditioned for operating in a particular manner Prop xxvi If they be not conditioned by God Prop xxvi it is impossible and not contingent that they should condition themselves contrariwise 
4863-24734-0008	train-other-500	if they be conditioned by God it is impossible and not contingent that they should render themselves unconditioned Wherefore all things are conditioned by the necessity of the divine nature not only to exist
4863-24734-0009	train-other-500	but also to exist and operate in a particular manner and there is nothing that is contingent
none	none	 Q E D 
4863-24734-0010	train-other-500	Note Before going any further I wish here to explain what we should understand by nature viewed as active natura naturans and nature viewed as passive natura naturata I say to explain or rather call attention to it
4863-24734-0011	train-other-500	for I think that from what has been said it is sufficiently clear that by nature viewed as active we should understand that which is in itself and is conceived through itself or those attributes of substance which express eternal and infinite essence
none	none	 in other words Prop xiv Coroll i and Prop xvii Coroll ii God in so far as he is considered as a free cause 
4863-24734-0012	train-other-500	By nature viewed as passive I understand all that which follows from the necessity of the nature of God or of any of the attributes of God that is all the modes of the attributes of God in so far as they are considered as things which are in God
4863-24734-0013	train-other-500	and which without God cannot exist or be conceived
none	none	 PROP XXX Intellect in function 
4863-24734-0014	train-other-500	actu finite or in function infinite must comprehend the attributes of God and the modifications of God and nothing else Proof
none	none	 A true idea must agree with its object Ax vi 
4863-24734-0015	train-other-500	in other words obviously that which is contained in the intellect in representation must necessarily be granted in nature
none	none	 But in nature by Prop xiv Coroll i there is no substance save God nor any modifications save those Prop xv which are in God and cannot without God either be or be conceived Therefore the intellect in function finite or in function infinite must comprehend the attributes of God and the modifications of God and nothing else Q E D PROP XXXI The intellect in function whether finite or infinite as will desire love c should be referred to passive nature and not to active nature Proof By the intellect we do not obviously mean absolute thought but only a certain mode of thinking differing from other modes such as love desire c and therefore Def v requiring to be conceived through absolute thought It must by Prop xv and Def vi through some attribute of God which expresses the eternal and infinite essence of thought be so conceived that without such attribute it could neither be nor be conceived It must therefore be referred to nature passive rather than to nature active as must also the other modes of thinking Q E D Note I do not here by speaking of intellect in function admit that there is such a thing as intellect in potentiality but wishing to avoid all confusion I desire to speak only of what is most clearly perceived by us namely of the very act of understanding than which nothing is more clearly perceived For we cannot perceive anything without adding to our knowledge of the act of understanding PROP XXXII Will cannot be called a free cause but only a necessary cause Proof Will is only a particular mode of thinking like intellect therefore by Prop xxviii no volition can exist nor be conditioned to act unless it be conditioned by some cause other than itself which cause is conditioned by a third cause and so on to infinity But if will be supposed infinite it must also be conditioned to exist and act by God not by virtue of his being substance absolutely infinite but by virtue of his possessing an attribute which expresses the infinite and eternal essence of thought by Prop xxiii Thus however it be conceived whether as finite or infinite it requires a cause by which it should be conditioned to exist and act Thus Def vii it cannot be called a free cause but only a necessary or constrained cause Q E D Coroll I Hence it follows first that God does not act according to freedom of the will Coroll II It follows secondly that will and intellect stand in the same relation to the nature of God as do motion and rest and absolutely all natural phenomena which must be conditioned by God Prop xxix to exist and act in a particular manner For will like the rest stands in need of a cause by which it is conditioned to exist and act in a particular manner And although when will or intellect be granted an infinite number of results may follow yet God cannot on that account be said to act from freedom of the will any more than the infinite number of results from motion and rest would justify us in saying that motion and rest act by free will Wherefore will no more appertains to God than does anything else in nature but stands in the same relation to him as motion rest and the like which we have shown to follow from the necessity of the divine nature and to be conditioned by it to exist and act in a particular manner PROP XXXIII Things could not have been brought into being by God in any manner or in any order different from that which has in fact obtained Proof All things necessarily follow from the nature of God Prop xvi and by the nature of God are conditioned to exist and act in a particular way Prop xxix If things therefore could have been of a different nature or have been conditioned to act in a different way so that the order of nature would have been different God s nature would also have been able to be different from what it now is and therefore by Prop xi that different nature also would have perforce existed and consequently there would have been able to be two or more Gods This by Prop xiv Coroll i is absurd Therefore things could not have been brought into being by God in any other manner c Q E D Note I As I have thus shown more clearly than the sun at noonday that there is nothing to justify us in calling things contingent I wish to explain briefly what meaning we shall attach to the word contingent but I will first explain the words necessary and impossible A thing is called necessary either in respect to its essence or in respect to its cause for the existence of a thing necessarily follows either from its essence and definition or from a given efficient cause For similar reasons a thing is said to be impossible namely inasmuch as its essence or definition involves a contradiction or because no external cause is granted which is conditioned to produce such an effect but a thing can in no respect be called contingent save in relation to the imperfection of our knowledge A thing of which we do not know whether the essence does or does not involve a contradiction or of which knowing that it does not involve a contradiction we are still in doubt concerning the existence because the order of causes escapes us such a thing I say cannot appear to us either necessary or impossible Wherefore we call it contingent or possible Note II It clearly follows from what we have said that things have been brought into being by God in the highest perfection inasmuch as they have necessarily followed from a most perfect nature Nor does this prove any imperfection in God for it has compelled us to affirm his perfection From its contrary proposition we should clearly gather as I have just shown that God is not supremely perfect for if things had been brought into being in any other way we should have to assign to God a nature different from that which we are bound to attribute to him from the consideration of an absolutely perfect being I do not doubt that many will scout this idea as absurd and will refuse to give their minds up to contemplating it simply because they are accustomed to assign to God a freedom very different from that which we Def vii have deduced They assign to him in short absolute free will However I am also convinced that if such persons reflect on the matter and duly weigh in their minds our series of propositions they will reject such freedom as they now attribute to God not only as nugatory but also as a great impediment to organized knowledge There is no need for me to repeat what I have said in the note to Prop xvii But for the sake of my opponents I will show further that although it be granted that will pertains to the essence of God it nevertheless follows from his perfection that things could not have been by him created other than they are or in a different order this is easily proved if we reflect on what our opponents themselves concede namely that it depends solely on the decree and will of God that each thing is what it is If it were otherwise God would not be the cause of all things Further that all the decrees of God have been ratified from all eternity by God himself If it were otherwise God would be convicted of imperfection or change But in eternity there is no such thing as when before or after hence it follows solely from the perfection of God that God never can decree or never could have decreed anything but what is that God did not exist before his decrees and would not exist without them But it is said supposing that God had made a different universe or had ordained other decrees from all eternity concerning nature and her order we could not therefore conclude any imperfection in God But persons who say this must admit that God can change his decrees For if God had ordained any decrees concerning nature and her order different from those which he has ordained in other words if he had willed and conceived something different concerning nature he would perforce have had a different intellect from that which he has and also a different will But if it were allowable to assign to God a different intellect and a different will without any change in his essence or his perfection what would there be to prevent him changing the decrees which he has made concerning created things and nevertheless remaining perfect For his intellect and will concerning things created and their order are the same in respect to his essence and perfection however they be conceived Further all the philosophers whom I have read admit that God s intellect is entirely actual and not at all potential as they also admit that God s intellect and God s will and God s essence are identical it follows that if God had had a different actual intellect and a different will his essence would also have been different and thus as I concluded at first if things had been brought into being by God in a different way from that which has obtained God s intellect and will that is as is admitted his essence would perforce have been different which is absurd As these things could not have been brought into being by God in any but the actual way and order which has obtained and as the truth of this proposition follows from the supreme perfection of God we can have no sound reason for persuading ourselves to believe that God did not wish to create all the things which were in his intellect and to create them in the same perfection as he had understood them But it will be said there is in things no perfection nor imperfection that which is in them and which causes them to be called perfect or imperfect good or bad depends solely on the will of God If God had so willed he might have brought it about that what is now perfection should be extreme imperfection and vice versa What is such an assertion but an open declaration that God who necessarily understands that which he wishes might bring it about by his will that he should understand things differently from the way in which he does understand them This as we have just shown is the height of absurdity Wherefore I may turn the argument against its employers as follows All things depend on the power of God In order that things should be different from what they are God s will would necessarily have to be different But God s will cannot be different as we have just most clearly demonstrated from God s perfection Therefore neither can things be different I confess that the theory which subjects all things to the will of an indifferent deity and asserts that they are all dependent on his fiat is less far from the truth than the theory of those who maintain that God acts in all things with a view of promoting what is good For these latter persons seem to set up something beyond God which does not depend on God but which God in acting looks to as an exemplar or which he aims at as a definite goal This is only another name for subjecting God to the dominion of destiny an utter absurdity in respect to God whom we have shown to be the first and only free cause of the essence of all things and also of their existence I need therefore spend no time in refuting such wild theories PROP XXXIV God s power is identical with his essence Proof From the sole necessity of the essence of God it follows that God is the cause of himself Prop xi and of all things Prop xvi and Coroll Wherefore the power of God by which he and all things are and act is identical with his essence Q E D PROP XXXV Whatsoever we conceive to be in the power of God necessarily exists Proof Whatsoever is in God s power must by the last Prop be comprehended in his essence in such a manner that it necessarily follows therefrom and therefore necessarily exists Q E D PROP XXXVI There is no cause from whose nature some effect does not follow Proof Whatsoever exists expresses God s nature or essence in a given conditioned manner by Prop xxv Coroll that is by Prop xxxiv whatsoever exists expresses in a given conditioned manner God s power which is the cause of all things therefore an effect must by Prop xvi necessarily follow Q E D APPENDIX In the foregoing I have explained the nature and properties of God I have shown that he necessarily exists that he is one that he is and acts solely by the necessity of his own nature that he is the free cause of all things and how he is so that all things are in God and so depend on him that without him they could neither exist nor be conceived lastly that all things are predetermined by God not through his free will or absolute fiat but from the very nature of God or infinite power I have further where occasion afforded taken care to remove the prejudices which might impede the comprehension of my demonstrations Yet there still remain misconceptions not a few which might and may prove very grave hindrances to the understanding of the concatenation of things as I have explained it above I have therefore thought it worth while to bring these misconceptions before the bar of reason All such opinions spring from the notion commonly entertained that all things in nature act as men themselves act namely with an end in view It is accepted as certain that God himself directs all things to a definite goal for it is said that God made all things for man and man that he might worship him I will therefore consider this opinion asking first why it obtains general credence and why all men are naturally so prone to adopt it secondly I will point out its falsity and lastly I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about good and bad right and wrong praise and blame order and confusion beauty and ugliness and the like However this is not the place to deduce these misconceptions from the nature of the human mind it will be sufficient here if I assume as a starting point what ought to be universally admitted namely that all men are born ignorant of the causes of things that all have the desire to seek for what is useful to them and that they are conscious of such desire Herefrom it follows first that men think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their volitions and desires and never even dream in their ignorance of the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire Secondly that men do all things for an end namely for that which is useful to them and which they seek Thus it comes to pass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of events and when these are learned they are content as having no cause for further doubt If they cannot learn such causes from external sources they are compelled to turn to considering themselves and reflecting what end would have induced them personally to bring about the given event and thus they necessarily judge other natures by their own Further as they find in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist them not a little in the search for what is useful for instance eyes for seeing teeth for chewing herbs and animals for yielding food the sun for giving light the sea for breeding fish c they come to look on the whole of nature as a means for obtaining such conveniences Now as they are aware that they found these conveniences and did not make them they think they have cause for believing that some other being has made them for their use As they look upon things as means they cannot believe them to be self created but judging from the means which they are accustomed to prepare for themselves they are bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe endowed with human freedom who have arranged and adapted everything for human use They are bound to estimate the nature of such rulers having no information on the subject in accordance with their own nature and therefore they assert that the gods ordained everything for the use of man in order to bind man to themselves and obtain from him the highest honor Hence also it follows that everyone thought out for himself according to his abilities a different way of worshipping God so that God might love him more than his fellows and direct the whole course of nature for the satisfaction of his blind cupidity and insatiable avarice Thus the prejudice developed into superstition and took deep root in the human mind and for this reason everyone strove most zealously to understand and explain the final causes of things but in their endeavor to show that nature does nothing in vain i e nothing which is useless to man they only seem to have demonstrated that nature the gods and men are all mad together Consider I pray you the result among the many helps of nature they were bound to find some hindrances such as storms earthquakes diseases c so they declared that such things happen because the gods are angry at some wrong done to them by men or at some fault committed in their worship Experience day by day protested and showed by infinite examples that good and evil fortunes fall to the lot of pious and impious alike still they would not abandon their inveterate prejudice for it was more easy for them to class such contradictions among other unknown things of whose use they were ignorant and thus to retain their actual and innate condition of ignorance than to destroy the whole fabric of their reasoning and start afresh They therefore laid down as an axiom that God s judgments far transcend human understanding Such a doctrine might well have sufficed to conceal the truth from the human race for all eternity if mathematics had not furnished another standard of verity in considering solely the essence and properties of figures without regard to their final causes There are other reasons which I need not mention here besides mathematics which might have caused men s minds to be directed to these general prejudices and have led them to the knowledge of the truth I have now sufficiently explained my first point There is no need to show at length that nature has no particular goal in view and that final causes are mere human figments This I think is already evident enough both from the causes and foundations on which I have shown such prejudice to be based and also from Prop xvi and the Corollary of Prop xxxii and in fact all those propositions in which I have shown that everything in nature proceeds from a sort of necessity and with the utmost perfection However I will add a few remarks in order to overthrow this doctrine of a final cause utterly That which is really a cause it considers as an effect and vice versa it makes that which is by nature first to be last and that which is highest and most perfect to be most imperfect Passing over the questions of cause and priority as self evident it is plain from Props xxi xxii xxiii that the effect is most perfect which is produced immediately by God the effect which requires for its production several intermediate causes is in that respect more imperfect But if those things which were made immediately by God were made to enable him to attain his end then the things which come after for the sake of which the first were made are necessarily the most excellent of all Further this doctrine does away with the perfection of God for if God acts for an object he necessarily desires something which he lacks Certainly theologians and metaphysicians draw a distinction between the object of want and the object of assimilation still they confess that God made all things for the sake of himself not for the sake of creation They are unable to point to anything prior to creation except God himself as an object for which God should act and are therefore driven to admit as they clearly must that God lacked those things for whose attainment he created means and further that he desired them We must not omit to notice that the followers of this doctrine anxious to display their talent in assigning final causes have imported a new method of argument in proof of their theory namely a reduction not to the impossible but to ignorance thus showing that they have no other method of exhibiting their doctrine For example if a stone falls from a roof on to someone s head and kills him they will demonstrate by their new method that the stone fell in order to kill the man for if it had not by God s will fallen with that object how could so many circumstances and there are often many concurrent circumstances have all happened together by chance Perhaps you will answer that the event is due to the facts that the wind was blowing and the man was walking that way But why they will insist was the wind blowing and why was the man at that very time walking that way If you again answer that the wind had then sprung up because the sea had begun to be agitated the day before the weather being previously calm and that the man had been invited by a friend they will again insist But why was the sea agitated and why was the man invited at that time So they will pursue their questions from cause to cause till at last you take refuge in the will of God in other words the sanctuary of ignorance So again when they survey the frame of the human body they are amazed and being ignorant of the causes of so great a work of art conclude that it has been fashioned not mechanically but by divine and supernatural skill and has been so put together that one part shall not hurt another Hence anyone who seeks for the true causes of miracles and strives to understand natural phenomena as an intelligent being and not to gaze at them like a fool is set down and denounced as an impious heretic by those whom the masses adore as the interpreters of nature and the gods Such persons know that with the removal of ignorance the wonder which forms their only available means for proving and preserving their authority would vanish also But I now quit this subject and pass on to my third point After men persuaded themselves that everything which is created is created for their sake they were bound to consider as the chief quality in everything that which is most useful to themselves and to account those things the best of all which have the most beneficial effect on mankind Further they were bound to form abstract notions for the explanation of the nature of things such as goodness badness order confusion warmth cold beauty deformity and so on and from the belief that they are free agents arose the further notions of praise and blame sin and merit I will speak of these latter hereafter when I treat of human nature the former I will briefly explain here Everything which conduces to health and the worship of God they have called good everything which hinders these objects they have styled bad and inasmuch as those who do not understand the nature of things do not verify phenomena in any way but merely imagine them after a fashion and mistake their imagination for understanding such persons firmly believe that there is an order in things being really ignorant both of things and their own nature When phenomena are of such a kind that the impression they make on our senses requires little effort of imagination and can consequently be easily remembered we say that they are well ordered if the contrary that they are ill ordered or confused Further as things which are easily imagined are more pleasing to us men prefer order to confusion as though there were any order in nature except in relation to our imagination and say that God has created all things in order thus without knowing it attributing imagination to God unless indeed they would have it that God foresaw human imagination and arranged everything so that it should be most easily imagined If this be their theory they would not perhaps be daunted by the fact that we find an infinite number of phenomena far surpassing our imagination and very many others which confound its weakness But enough has been said on this subject The other abstract notions are nothing but modes of imagining in which the imagination is differently affected though they are considered by the ignorant as the chief attributes of things inasmuch as they believe that everything was created for the sake of themselves and according as they are affected by it style it good or bad healthy or rotten and corrupt For instance if the motion which objects we see communicate to our nerves be conducive to health the objects causing it are styled beautiful if a contrary motion be excited they are styled ugly Things which are perceived through our sense of smell are styled fragrant or fetid if through our taste sweet or bitter full flavored or insipid if through our touch hard or soft rough or smooth c Whatsoever affects our ears is said to give rise to noise sound or harmony In this last case there are men lunatic enough to believe that even God himself takes pleasure in harmony and philosophers are not lacking who have persuaded themselves that the motion of the heavenly bodies gives rise to harmony all of which instances sufficiently show that everyone judges of things according to the state of his brain or rather mistakes for things the forms of his imagination We need no longer wonder that there have arisen all the controversies we have witnessed and finally skepticism for although human bodies in many respects agree yet in very many others they differ so that what seems good to one seems bad to another what seems well ordered to one seems confused to another what is pleasing to one displeases another and so on I need not further enumerate because this is not the place to treat the subject at length and also because the fact is sufficiently well known It is commonly said So many men so many minds everyone is wise in his own way brains differ as completely as palates All of which proverbs show that men judge of things according to their mental disposition and rather imagine than understand for if they understood phenomena they would as mathematicians attest be convinced if not attracted by what I have urged We have now perceived that all the explanations commonly given of nature are mere modes of imagining and do not indicate the true nature of anything but only the constitution of the imagination and although they have names as though they were entities existing externally to the imagination I call them entities imaginary rather than real and therefore all arguments against us drawn from such abstractions are easily rebutted Many argue in this way If all things follow from a necessity of the absolutely perfect nature of God why are there so many imperfections in nature such for instance as things corrupt to the point of putridity loathsome deformity confusion evil sin c But these reasoners are as I have said easily confuted for the perfection of things is to be reckoned only from their own nature and power things are not more or less perfect according as they delight or offend human senses or according as they are serviceable or repugnant to mankind To those who ask why God did not so create all men that they should be governed only by reason I give no answer but this because matter was not lacking to him for the creation of every degree of perfection from highest to lowest or more strictly because the laws of his nature are so vast as to suffice for the production of everything conceivable by an infinite intelligence as I have shown in Prop xvi Such are the misconceptions I have undertaken to note if there are any more of the same sort everyone may easily dissipate them for himself with the aid of a little reflection Part II ON THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND PREFACE I now pass on to explaining the results which must necessarily follow from the essence of God or of the eternal and infinite being not indeed all of them for we proved in Part i Prop xvi that an infinite number must follow in an infinite number of ways but only those which are able to lead us as it were by the hand to the knowledge of the human mind and its highest blessedness DEFINITIONS DEFINITION I By body I mean a mode which expresses in a certain determinate manner the essence of God in so far as he is considered as an extended thing See Pt i Prop xxv Coroll DEFINITION II I consider as belonging to the essence of a thing that which being given the thing is necessarily given also and which being removed the thing is necessarily removed also in other words that without which the thing and which itself without the thing can neither be nor be conceived DEFINITION III By idea I mean the mental conception which is formed by the mind as a thinking thing Explanation I say conception rather than perception because the word perception seems to imply that the mind is passive in respect to the object whereas conception seems to express an activity of the mind DEFINITION IV By an adequate idea I mean an idea which in so far as it is considered in itself without relation to the object has all the properties or intrinsic marks of a true idea Explanation I say intrinsic in order to exclude that mark which is extrinsic namely the agreement between the idea and its object ideatum DEFINITION V Duration is the indefinite continuance of existing Explanation I say indefinite because it cannot be determined through the existence itself of the existing thing or by its efficient cause which necessarily gives the existence of the thing but does not take it away DEFINITION VI Reality and perfection I use as synonymous terms DEFINITION VII By particular things I mean things which are finite and have a conditioned existence but if several individual things concur in one action so as to be all simultaneously the effect of one cause I consider them all so far as one particular thing AXIOMS I The essence of man does not involve necessary existence that is it may in the order of nature come to pass that this or that man does or does not exist II Man thinks III Modes of thinking such as love desire or any other of the passions do not take place unless there be in the same individual an idea of the thing loved desired c But the idea can exist without the presence of any other mode of thinking IV We perceive that a certain body is affected in many ways V We feel and perceive no particular things save bodies and modes of thought N B The Postulates are given after the conclusion of Prop xiii PROPOSITIONS PROP I Thought is an attribute of God or God is a thinking thing Proof Particular thoughts or this and that thought are modes which in a certain conditioned manner express the nature of God Pt i Prop xxv Coroll God therefore possesses the attribute Pt i Def v of which the concept is involved in all particular thoughts which latter are conceived thereby Thought therefore is one of the infinite attributes of God which express God s eternal and infinite essence Pt i Def vi In other words God is a thinking thing Q E D Note This proposition is also evident from the fact that we are able to conceive an infinite thinking being For in proportion as a thinking being is conceived as thinking more thoughts so is it conceived as containing more reality or perfection Therefore a being which can think an infinite number of things in an infinite number of ways is necessarily in respect of thinking infinite As therefore from the consideration of thought alone we conceive an infinite being thought is necessarily Pt i Deff iv and vi one of the infinite attributes of God as we were desirous of showing PROP II Extension is an attribute of God or God is an extended thing Proof The proof of this proposition is similar to that of the last PROP III In God there is necessarily the idea not only of his essence but also of all things which necessarily follow from his essence Proof God by the first Prop of this Part can think an infinite number of things in infinite ways or what is the same thing by Prop xvi Part i can form the idea of his essence and of all things which necessarily follow therefrom Now all that is in the power of God necessarily is Pt i Prop xxxv Therefore such an idea as we are considering necessarily is and in God alone Q E D Part i Prop xv Note The multitude understand by the power of God the free will of God and the right over all things that exist which latter are accordingly generally considered as contingent For it is said that God has the power to destroy all things and to reduce them to nothing Further the power of God is very often likened to the power of kings But this doctrine we have refuted Pt i Prop xxxii Corolls i and ii and we have shown Part i Prop xvi that God acts by the same necessity as that by which he understands himself in other words as it follows from the necessity of the divine nature as all admit that God understands himself so also does it follow by the same necessity that God performs infinite acts in infinite ways We further showed Part i Prop xxxiv that God s power is identical with God s essence in action therefore it is as impossible for us to conceive God as not acting as to conceive him as non existent If we might pursue the subject further I could point out that the power which is commonly attributed to God is not only human as showing that God is conceived by the multitude as a man or in the likeness of a man but involves a negation of power However I am unwilling to go over the same ground so often I would only beg the reader again and again to turn over frequently in his mind what I have said in Part I from Prop xvi to the end No one will be able to follow my meaning unless he is scrupulously careful not to confound the power of God with the human power and right of kings PROP IV The idea of God from which an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways can only be one Proof Infinite intellect comprehends nothing save the attributes of God and his modifications Part i Prop xxx Now God is one Part i Prop xiv Coroll Therefore the idea of God wherefrom an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways can only be one Q E D PROP V The actual being of ideas owns God as its cause only in so far as he is considered as a thinking thing not in so far as he is unfolded in any other attribute that is the ideas both of the attributes of God and of particular things do not own as their efficient cause their objects ideata or the things perceived but God himself in so far as he is a thinking thing Proof This proposition is evident from Prop iii of this Part We there drew the conclusion that God can form the idea of his essence and of all things which follow necessarily therefrom solely because he is a thinking thing and not because he is the object of his own idea Wherefore the actual being of ideas owns for cause God in so far as he is a thinking thing It may be differently proved as follows the actual being of ideas is obviously a mode of thought that is Part i Prop xxv Coroll a mode which expresses in a certain manner the nature of God in so far as he is a thinking thing and therefore Part i Prop x involves the conception of no other attribute of God and consequently by Part i Ax iv is not the effect of any attribute save thought Therefore the actual being of ideas owns God as its cause in so far as he is considered as a thinking thing c Q E D PROP VI The modes of any given attribute are caused by God in so far as he is considered through the attribute of which they are modes and not in so far as he is considered through any other attribute Proof Each attribute is conceived through itself without any other Part i Prop x wherefore the modes of each attribute involve the conception of that attribute but not of any other Thus Part i Ax iv they are caused by God only in so far as he is considered through the attribute whose modes they are and not in so far as he is considered through any other Q E D Corollary Hence the actual being of things which are not modes of thought does not follow from the divine nature because that nature has prior knowledge of the things Things represented in ideas follow and are derived from their particular attribute in the same manner and with the same necessity as ideas follow according to what we have shown from the attribute of thought PROP VII The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things Proof This proposition is evident from Part i Ax iv For the idea of everything that is caused depends on a knowledge of the cause whereof it is an effect Corollary Hence God s power of thinking is equal to his realized power of action that is whatsoever follows from the infinite nature of God in the world of extension formaliter follows without exception in the same order and connection from the idea of God in the world of thought objective Note Before going any further I wish to recall to mind what has been pointed out above namely that whatsoever can be perceived by the infinite intellect as constituting the essence of substance belongs altogether only to one substance consequently substance thinking and substance extended are one and the same substance comprehended now through one attribute now through the other So also a mode of extension and the idea of that mode are one and the same thing though expressed in two ways This truth seems to have been dimly recognized by those Jews who maintained that God God s intellect and the things understood by God are identical For instance a circle existing in nature and the idea of a circle existing which is also in God are one and the same thing displayed through different attributes Thus whether we conceive nature under the attribute of extension or under the attribute of thought or under any other attribute we shall find the same order or one and the same chain of causes that is the same things following in either case I said that God is the cause of an idea for instance of the idea of a circle in so far as he is a thinking thing and of a circle in so far as he is an extended thing simply because the actual being of the idea of a circle can only be perceived as a proximate cause through another mode of thinking and that again through another and so on to infinity so that so long as we consider things as modes of thinking we must explain the order of the whole of nature or the whole chain of causes through the attribute of thought only And in so far as we consider things as modes of extension we must explain the order of the whole of nature through the attributes of extension only and so on in the case of the other attributes Wherefore of things as they are in themselves God is really the cause inasmuch as he consists of infinite attributes I cannot for the present explain my meaning more clearly PROP VIII The ideas of particular things or of modes that do not exist must be comprehended in the infinite idea of God in the same way as the formal essences of particular things or modes are contained in the attributes of God Proof This proposition is evident from the last it is understood more clearly from the preceding note Corollary Hence so long as particular things do not exist except in so far as they are comprehended in the attributes of God their representations in thought or ideas do not exist except in so far as the infinite idea of God exists and when particular things are said to exist not only in so far as they are involved in the attributes of God but also in so far as they are said to continue their ideas will also involve existence through which they are said to continue Note If anyone desires an example to throw more light on this question I shall I fear not be able to give him any which adequately explains the thing of which I here speak inasmuch as it is unique however I will endeavour to illustrate it as far as possible The nature of a circle is such that if any number of straight lines intersect within it the rectangles formed by their segments will be equal to one another thus infinite equal rectangles are contained in a circle Yet none of these rectangles can be said to exist except in so far as the circle exists nor can the idea of any of these rectangles be said to exist except in so far as they are comprehended in the idea of the circle Let us grant that from this infinite number of rectangles two only exist The ideas of these two not only exist in so far as they are contained in the idea of the circle but also as they involve the existence of those rectangles wherefore they are distinguished from the remaining ideas of the remaining rectangles PROP IX The idea of an individual thing actually existing is caused by God not in so far as he is infinite but in so far as he is considered as affected by another idea of a thing actually existing of which he is the cause in so far as he is affected by a third idea and so on to infinity Proof The idea of an individual thing actually existing is an individual mode of thinking and is distinct from other modes by the Corollary and note to Prop viii of this part thus by Prop vi of this part it is caused by God in so far only as he is a thinking thing But not by Prop xxviii of Part i in so far as he is a thing thinking absolutely only in so far as he is considered as affected by another mode of thinking and he is the cause of this latter as being affected by a third and so on to infinity Now the order and connection of ideas is by Prop vii of this book the same as the order and connection of causes Therefore of a given individual idea another individual idea or God in so far as he is considered as modified by that idea is the cause and of this second idea God is the cause in so far as he is affected by another idea and so on to infinity Q E D Corollary Whatsoever takes place in the individual object of any idea the knowledge thereof is in God in so far only as he has the idea of the object Proof Whatsoever takes place in the object of any idea its idea is in God by Prop iii of this part not in so far as he is infinite but in so far as he is considered as affected by another idea of an individual thing by the last Prop but by Prop vii of this part the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things The knowledge therefore of that which takes place in any individual object will be in God in so far only as he has the idea of that object Q E D PROP X The being of substance does not appertain to the essence of man in other words substance does not constitute the actual being two of man two Forma Proof The being of substance involves necessary existence Part i Prop vii If therefore the being of substance appertains to the essence of man substance being granted man would necessarily be granted also II Def ii and consequently man would necessarily exist which is absurd II Ax i Therefore c Q E D Note This proposition may also be proved from I v in which it is shown that there cannot be two substances of the same nature for as there may be many men the being of substance is not that which constitutes the actual being of man Again the proposition is evident from the other properties of substance namely that substance is in its nature infinite immutable indivisible c as anyone may see for himself Corollary Hence it follows that the essence of man is constituted by certain modifications of the attributes of God For by the last Prop the being of substance does not belong to the essence of man That essence therefore by i fifteen is something which is in God and which without God can neither be nor be conceived whether it be a modification i twenty five Coroll or a mode which expresses God s nature in a certain conditioned manner Note Everyone must surely admit that nothing can be or be conceived without God All men agree that God is the one and only cause of all things both of their essence and of their existence that is God is not only the cause of things in respect to their being made secundum fieri but also in respect to their being secundum esse At the same time many assert that that without which a thing cannot be nor be conceived belongs to the essence of that thing wherefore they believe that either the nature of God appertains to the essence of created things or else that created things can be or be conceived without God or else as is more probably the case they hold inconsistent doctrines I think the cause for such confusion is mainly that they do not keep to the proper order of philosophic thinking The nature of God which should be reflected on first inasmuch as it is prior both in the order of knowledge and the order of nature they have taken to be last in the order of knowledge and have put into the first place what they call the objects of sensation hence while they are considering natural phenomena they give no attention at all to the divine nature and when afterwards they apply their mind to the study of the divine nature they are quite unable to bear in mind the first hypotheses with which they have overlaid the knowledge of natural phenomena inasmuch as such hypotheses are no help towards understanding the divine nature So that it is hardly to be wondered at that these persons contradict themselves freely However I pass over this point My intention her was only to give a reason for not saying that that without which a thing cannot be or be conceived belongs to the essence of that thing individual things cannot be or be conceived without God yet God does not appertain to their essence I said that I considered as belonging to the essence of a thing that which being given the thing is necessarily given also and which being removed the thing is necessarily removed also or that without which the thing and which itself without the thing can neither be nor be conceived II Def ii PROP XI The first element which constitutes the actual being of the human mind is the idea of some particular thing actually existing Proof The essence of man by the Coroll of the last Prop is constituted by certain modes of the attributes of God namely by II Ax ii by the modes of thinking of all which by II Ax iii the idea is prior in nature and when the idea is given the other modes namely those of which the idea is prior in nature must be in the same individual by the same Axiom Therefore an idea is the first element constituting the human mind But not the idea of a non existent thing for then II viii Coroll the idea itself cannot be said to exist it must therefore be the idea of something actually existing But not of an infinite thing For an infinite thing I xxi xxii must always necessarily exist this would by II Ax i involve an absurdity Therefore the first element which constitutes the actual being of the human mind is the idea of something actually existing Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that the human mind is part of the infinite intellect of God thus when we say that the human mind perceives this or that we make the assertion that God has this or that idea not in so far as he is infinite but in so far as he is displayed through the nature of the human mind or in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind and when we say that God has this or that idea not only in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind but also in so far as he simultaneously with the human mind has the further idea of another thing we assert that the human mind perceives a thing in part or inadequately Note Here I doubt not readers will come to a stand and will call to mind many things which will cause them to hesitate I therefore beg them to accompany me slowly step by step and not to pronounce on my statements till they have read to the end PROP XII Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of the idea which constitutes the human mind must be perceived by the human mind or there will necessarily be an idea in the human mind of the said occurrence That is if the object of the idea constituting the human mind be a body nothing can take place in that body without being perceived by the mind Proof Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of any idea the knowledge thereof is necessarily in God II ix Coroll in so far as he is considered as affected by the idea of the said object that is II xi in so far as he constitutes the mind of anything Therefore whatsoever takes place in the object constituting the idea of the human mind the knowledge thereof is necessarily in God in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind that is by II xi Coroll the knowledge of the said thing will necessarily be in the mind in other words the mind perceives it Note This proposition is also evident and is more clearly to be understood from II vii which see PROP XIII The object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body in other words a certain mode of extension which actually exists and nothing else Proof If indeed the body were not the object of the human mind the ideas of the modifications of the body would not be in God II ix Coroll in virtue of his constituting our mind but in virtue of his constituting the mind of something else that is II xi Coroll the ideas of the modifications of the body would not be in our mind now by II Ax iv we do possess the idea of the modifications of the body Therefore the object of the idea constituting the human mind is the body and the body as it actually exists II xi Further if there were any other object of the idea constituting the mind besides body then as nothing can exist from which some effect does not follow I xxxvi there would necessarily have to be in our mind an idea which would be the effect of that other object II xi but I Ax v there is no such idea Wherefore the object of our mind is the body as it exists and nothing else Q E D Note We thus comprehend not only that the human mind is united to the body but also the nature of the union between mind and body However no one will be able to grasp this adequately or distinctly unless he first has adequate knowledge of the nature of our body The propositions we have advanced hitherto have been entirely general applying not more to men than to other individual things all of which though in different degrees are animated three For of everything there is necessarily an idea in God of which God is the cause in the same way as there is an idea of the human body thus whatever we have asserted of the idea of the human body must necessarily also be asserted of the idea of everything else Still on the other hand we cannot deny that ideas like objects differ one from the other one being more excellent than another and containing more reality just as the object of one idea is more excellent than the object of another idea and contains more reality three Animata Wherefore in order to determine wherein the human mind differs from other things and wherein it surpasses them it is necessary for us to know the nature of its object that is of the human body What this nature is I am not able here to explain nor is it necessary for the proof of what I advance that I should do so I will only say generally that in proportion as any given body is more fitted than others for doing many actions or receiving many impressions at once so also is the mind of which it is the object more fitted than others for forming many simultaneous perceptions and the more the actions of the body depend on itself alone and the fewer other bodies concur with it in action the more fitted is the mind of which it is the object for distinct comprehension We may thus recognize the superiority of one mind over others and may further see the cause why we have only a very confused knowledge of our body and also many kindred questions which I will in the following propositions deduce from what has been advanced Wherefore I have thought it worth while to explain and prove more strictly my present statements In order to do so I must premise a few propositions concerning the nature of bodies AXIOM I All bodies are either in motion or at rest AXIOM II Every body is moved sometimes more slowly sometimes more quickly LEMMA I Bodies are distinguished from one another in respect of motion and rest quickness and slowness and not in respect of substance Proof The first part of this proposition is I take it self evident That bodies are not distinguished in respect of substance is plain both from I v and I viii It is brought out still more clearly from I xv note LEMMA II All bodies agree in certain respects Proof All bodies agree in the fact that they involve the conception of one and the same attribute II Def i Further in the fact that they may be moved less or more quickly and may be absolutely in motion or at rest LEMMA III A body in motion or at rest must be determined to motion or rest by another body which other body has been determined to motion or rest by a third body and that third again by a fourth and so on to infinity Proof Bodies are individual things II Def i which Lemma I are distinguished one from the other in respect to motion and rest thus I xxviii each must necessarily be determined to motion or rest by another individual thing namely II vi by another body which other body is also Ax i in motion or at rest And this body again can only have been set in motion or caused to rest by being determined by a third body to motion or rest This third body again by a fourth and so on to infinity Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that a body in motion keeps in motion until it is determined to a state of rest by some other body and a body at rest remains so until it is determined to a state of motion by some other body This is indeed self evident For when I suppose for instance that a given body A is at rest and do not take into consideration other bodies in motion I cannot affirm anything concerning the body A except that it is at rest If it afterwards comes to pass that A is in motion this cannot have resulted from its having been at rest for no other consequence could have been involved than its remaining at rest If on the other hand A be given in motion we shall so long as we only consider A be unable to affirm anything concerning it except that it is in motion If A is subsequently found to be at rest this rest cannot be the result of A s previous motion for such motion can only have led to continued motion the state of rest therefore must have resulted from something which was not in A namely from an external cause determining A to a state of rest Axiom I All modes wherein one body is affected by another body follow simultaneously from the nature of the body affected and the body affecting so that one and the same body may be moved in different modes according to the difference in the nature of the bodies moving it on the other hand different bodies may be moved in different modes by one and the same body Axiom II When a body in motion impinges on another body at rest which it is unable to move it recoils in order to continue its motion and the angle made by the line of motion in the recoil and the plane of the body at rest whereon the moving body has impinged will be equal to the angle formed by the line of motion of incidence and the same plane So far we have been speaking only of the most simple bodies which are only distinguished one from the other by motion and rest quickness and slowness We now pass on to compound bodies Definition When any given bodies of the same or different magnitude are compelled by other bodies to remain in contact or if they be moved at the same or different rates of speed so that their mutual movements should preserve among themselves a certain fixed relation we say that such bodies are in union and that together they compose one body or individual which is distinguished from other bodies by the fact of this union Axiom III In proportion as the parts of an individual or a compound body are in contact over a greater or less superficies they will with greater or less difficulty admit of being moved from their position consequently the individual will with greater or less difficulty be brought to assume another form Those bodies whose parts are in contact over large superficies are called hard those whose parts are in contact over small superficies are called soft those whose parts are in motion among one another are called fluid LEMMA IV If from a body or individual compounded of several bodies certain bodies be separated and if at the same time an equal number of other bodies of the same nature take their place the individual will preserve its nature as before without any change in its actuality forma Proof Bodies Lemma i are not distinguished in respect of substance that which constitutes the actuality formam of an individual consists by the last Def in a union of bodies but this union although there is a continual change of bodies will by our hypothesis be maintained the individual therefore will retain its nature as before both in respect of substance and in respect of mode Q E D LEMMA V If the parts composing an individual become greater or less but in such proportion that they all preserve the same mutual relations of motion and rest the individual will still preserve its original nature and its actuality will not be changed Proof The same as for the last Lemma LEMMA VI If certain bodies composing an individual be compelled to change the motion which they have in one direction for motion in another direction but in such a manner that they be able to continue their motions and their mutual communication in the same relations as before the individual will retain its own nature without any change of its actuality Proof This proposition is self evident for the individual is supposed to retain all that which in its definition we spoke of as its actual being LEMMA VII Furthermore the individual thus composed preserves its nature whether it be as a whole in motion or at rest whether it be moved in this or that direction so long as each part retains its motion and preserves its communication with other parts as before Proof This proposition is evident from the definition of an individual prefixed to Lemma iv Note We thus see how a composite individual may be affected in many different ways and preserve its nature notwithstanding Thus far we have conceived an individual as composed of bodies only distinguished one from the other in respect of motion and rest speed and slowness that is of bodies of the most simple character If however we now conceive another individual composed of several individuals of diverse natures we shall find that the number of ways in which it can be affected without losing its nature will be greatly multiplied Each of its parts would consist of several bodies and therefore by Lemma vi each part would admit without change to its nature of quicker or slower motion and would consequently be able to transmit its motions more quickly or more slowly to the remaining parts If we further conceive a third kind of individuals composed of individuals of this second kind we shall find that they may be affected in a still greater number of ways without changing their actuality We may easily proceed thus to infinity and conceive the whole of nature as one individual whose parts that is all bodies vary in infinite ways without any change in the individual as a whole I should feel bound to explain and demonstrate this point at more length if I were writing a special treatise on body But I have already said that such is not my object I have only touched on the question because it enables me to prove easily that which I have in view POSTULATES I The human body is composed of a number of individual parts of diverse nature each one of which is in itself extremely complex II Of the individual parts composing the human body some are fluid some soft some hard III The individual parts composing the human body and consequently the human body itself are affected in a variety of ways by external bodies IV The human body stands in need for its preservation of a number of other bodies by which it is continually so to speak regenerated V When the fluid part of the human body is determined by an external body to impinge often on another soft part it changes the surface of the latter and as it were leaves the impression thereupon of the external body which impels it VI The human body can move external bodies and arrange them in a variety of ways PROP XIV The human mind is capable of perceiving a great number of things and is so in proportion as its body is capable of receiving a great number of impressions Proof The human body by Post iii and vi is affected in very many ways by external bodies and is capable in very many ways of affecting external bodies But II xii the human mind must perceive all that takes place in the human body the human mind is therefore capable of perceiving a great number of things and is so in proportion c Q E D PROP XV The idea which constitutes the actual being of the human mind is not simple but compounded of a great number of ideas Proof The idea constituting the actual being of the human mind is the idea of the body II xiii which Post i is composed of a great number of complex individual parts But there is necessarily in God the idea of each individual part whereof the body is composed II viii Coroll therefore II vii the idea of the human body is composed of these numerous ideas of its component parts Q E D PROP XVI 
5456_24741_000005_000001	train-clean-100	The idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies must involve the nature of the human body and also the nature of the external body 
none	none	Proof All the modes in which any given body is affected follow from the nature of the body affected and also from the nature of the affecting body by Ax i after the Coroll of Lemma iii wherefore their idea also necessarily by I Ax iv involves the nature of both bodies therefore the idea of every mode in which the human body is affected by external bodies involves the nature of the human body and of the external body Q E D Corollary I Hence it follows first that the human mind perceives the nature of a variety of bodies together with the nature of its own 
5456_24741_000008_000000	train-clean-100	Corollary II It follows secondly that the ideas which we have of external bodies indicate rather the constitution of our own body than the nature of external bodies

none	none	PROP XVII 
5456_24741_000009_000001	train-clean-100	If the human body is affected in a manner which involves the nature of any external body the human mind will regard the said external body as actually existing or as present to itself until the human body be affected in such a way as to exclude the existence or the presence of the said external body 
none	none	Proof This proposition is self evident for so long as the human body continues to be thus affected so long will the human mind II xii regard this modification of the body that is by the last Prop it will have the idea of the mode as actually existing and this idea involves the nature of the external body In other words it will have the idea which does not exclude but postulates the existence or presence of the nature of the external body therefore the mind by II xvi Coroll i will regard the external body as actually existing until it is affected c Q E D 
5456_24741_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Corollary The mind is able to regard as present external bodies by which the human body has once been affected even though they be no longer in existence or present 
none	none	Proof When external bodies determine the fluid parts of the human body so that they often impinge on the softer parts they change the surface of the last named Post v hence Ax ii after the Coroll of Lemma iii they are refracted therefrom in a different manner from that which they followed before such change and further when afterwards they impinge on the new surfaces by their own spontaneous movement they will be refracted in the same manner as though they had been impelled towards those surfaces by external bodies consequently they will while they continue to be thus refracted affect the human body in the same manner whereof the mind II xii will again take cognizance that is II xvii the mind will again regard the external body as present and will do so as often as the fluid parts of the human body impinge on the aforesaid surfaces by their own spontaneous motion Wherefore although the external bodies by which the human body has once been affected be no longer in existence the mind will nevertheless regard them as present as often as this action of the body is repeated Q E D 
5456_24741_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Note We thus see how it comes about as is often the case that we regard as present many things which are not 
none	none	It is possible that the same result may be brought about by other causes but I think it suffices for me here to have indicated one possible explanation just as well as if I had pointed out the true cause Indeed I do not think I am very far from the truth for all my assumptions are based on postulates which rest almost without exception on experience that cannot be controverted by those who have shown as we have that the human body as we feel it exists Coroll after II xiii Furthermore II vii Coroll II xvi Coroll ii we clearly understand what is the difference between the idea say of Peter which constitutes the essence of Peter s mind and the idea of the said Peter which is in another man say Paul 
5456_24741_000013_000006	train-clean-100	The former directly answers to the essence of Peter s own body and only implies existence so long as Peter exists the latter indicates rather the disposition of Paul s body than the nature of Peter and therefore while this disposition of Paul s body lasts Paul s mind will regard Peter as present to itself even though he no longer exists 
5456_24741_000013_000007	train-clean-100	Further to retain the usual phraseology the modifications of the human body of which the ideas represent external bodies as present to us we will call the images of things though they do not recall the figure of things 
none	none	When the mind regards bodies in this fashion we say that it imagines 
5456_24741_000013_000009	train-clean-100	I will here draw attention to the fact in order to indicate where error lies that the imaginations of the mind looked at in themselves do not contain error 
5456_24741_000013_000010	train-clean-100	The mind does not err in the mere act of imagining but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea which excludes the existence of such things as it imagines to be present to it 
none	none	If the mind while imagining non existent things as present to it is at the same time conscious that they do not really exist this power of imagination must be set down to the efficacy of its nature and not to a fault especially if this faculty of imagination depend solely on its own nature that is I Def vii if this faculty of imagination be free PROP XVIII If the human body has once been affected by two or more bodies at the same time when the mind afterwards imagines any of them it will straightway remember the others also Proof The mind II xvii Coroll imagines any given body because the human body is affected and disposed by the impressions from an external body in the same manner as it is affected when certain of its parts are acted on by the said external body but by our hypothesis the body was then so disposed that the mind imagined two bodies at once therefore it will also in the second case imagine two bodies at once and the mind when it imagines one will straightway remember the other Q E D 
5456_24741_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Note We now clearly see what Memory is 
none	none	It is simply a certain association of ideas involving the nature of things outside the human body which association arises in the mind according to the order and association of the modifications affectiones of the human body I say first it is an association of those ideas only which involve the nature of things outside the human body not of ideas which answer to the nature of the said things ideas of the modifications of the human body are strictly speaking II xvi those which involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies I say secondly that this association arises according to the order and association of the modifications of the human body in order to distinguish it from that association of ideas which arises from the order of the intellect whereby the mind perceives things through their primary causes and which is in all men the same And hence we can further clearly understand why the mind from the thought of one thing should straightway arrive at the thought of another thing which has no similarity with the first for instance from the thought of the word pomum an apple a Roman would straightway arrive at the thought of the fruit apple which has no similitude with the articulate sound in question nor anything in common with it except that the body of the man has often been affected by these two things that is that the man has often heard the word pomum while he was looking at the fruit similarly every man will go on from one thought to another according as his habit has ordered the images of things in his body For a soldier for instance when he sees the tracks of a horse in sand will at once pass from the thought of a horse to the thought of a horseman and thence to the thought of war c while a countryman will proceed from the thought of a horse to the thought of a plough a field c 
5456_24741_000016_000005	train-clean-100	Thus every man will follow this or that train of thought according as he has been in the habit of conjoining and associating the mental images of things in this or that manner

5456_24741_000017_000001	train-clean-100	The human mind has no knowledge of the body and does not know it to exist save through the ideas of the modifications whereby the body is affected 
none	none	Proof The human mind is the very idea or knowledge of the human body II xiii which II ix is in God in so far as he is regarded as affected by another idea of a particular thing actually existing or inasmuch as Post iv the human body stands in need of very many bodies whereby it is as it were continually regenerated and the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of causes II vii this idea will therefore be in God in so far as he is regarded as affected by the ideas of very many particular things Thus God has the idea of the human body or knows the human body in so far as he is affected by very many other ideas and not in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind that is by II xi Coroll the human mind does not know the human body But the ideas of the modifications of body are in God in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind or the human mind perceives those modifications II xii and consequently II xvi the human body itself and as actually existing therefore the mind perceives thus far only the human body Q E D PROP XX The idea or knowledge of the human mind is also in God following in God in the same manner and being referred to God in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of the human body Proof Thought is an attribute of God II i therefore II iii there must necessarily be in God the idea both of thought itself and of all its modifications consequently also of the human mind II xi Further this idea or knowledge of the mind does not follow from God in so far as he is infinite but in so far as he is affected by another idea of an individual thing II ix But II vii the order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of causes therefore this idea or knowledge of the mind is in God and is referred to God in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of the body Q E D PROP XXI This idea of the mind is united to the mind in the same way as the mind is united to the body Proof That the mind is united to the body we have shown from the fact that the body is the object of the mind II xii and xiii and so for the same reason the idea of the mind must be united with its object that is with the mind in the same manner as the mind is united to the body Q E D Note This proposition is comprehended much more clearly from what we have said in the note to II vii We there showed that the idea of body and body that is mind and body II xiii are one and the same individual conceived now under the attribute of thought now under the attribute of extension wherefore the idea of the mind and the mind itself are one and the same thing which is conceived under one and the same attribute namely thought The idea of the mind I repeat and the mind itself are in God by the same necessity and follow from him from the same power of thinking Strictly speaking the idea of the mind that is the idea of an idea is nothing but the distinctive quality forma of the idea in so far as it is conceived as a mode of thought without reference to the object if a man knows anything he by that very fact knows that he knows it and at the same time knows that he knows that he knows it and so on to infinity But I will treat of this hereafter PROP XXII The human mind perceives not only the modifications of the body but also the ideas of such modifications Proof The ideas of the ideas of modifications follow in God in the same manner and are referred to God in the same manner as the ideas of the said modifications This is proved in the same way as II xx But the ideas of the modifications of the body are in the human mind II xii that is in God in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind therefore the ideas of these ideas will be in God in so far as he has the knowledge or idea of the human mind that is II xxi they will be in the human mind itself which therefore perceives not only the modifications of the body but also the ideas of such modifications Q E D PROP XXIII The mind does not know itself except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of the body Proof The idea or knowledge of the mind II xx follows in God in the same manner and is referred to God in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of the body But since II xix the human mind does not know the human body itself that is II xi Coroll since the knowledge of the human body is not referred to God in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind therefore neither is the knowledge of the mind referred to God in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind therefore by the same Coroll II xi the human mind thus far has no knowledge of itself Further the ideas of the modifications whereby the body is affected involve the nature of the human body itself II xvi that is II xiii they agree with the nature of the mind wherefore the knowledge of these ideas necessarily involves knowledge of the mind but by the last Prop the knowledge of these ideas is in the human mind itself wherefore the human mind thus far only has knowledge of itself Q E D PROP XXIV The human mind does not involve an adequate knowledge of the parts composing the human body Proof The parts composing the human body do not belong to the essence of that body except in so far as they communicate their motions to one another in a certain fixed relation Def after Lemma iii not in so far as they can be regarded as individuals without relation to the human body The parts of the human body are highly complex individuals Post i whose parts Lemma iv can be separated from the human body without in any way destroying the nature and distinctive quality of the latter and they can communicate their motions Ax i after Lemma iii to other bodies in another relation therefore II iii the idea or knowledge of each part will be in God inasmuch II ix as he is regarded as affected by another idea of a particular thing which particular thing is prior in the order of nature to the aforesaid part II vii We may affirm the same thing of each part of each individual composing the human body therefore the knowledge of each part composing the human body is in God in so far as he is affected by very many ideas of things and not in so far as he has the idea of the human body only in other words the idea which constitutes the nature of the human mind II xiii therefore II xi Coroll the human mind does not involve an adequate knowledge of the human body Q E D PROP XXV The idea of each modification of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of the external body Proof We have shown that the idea of a modification of the human body involves the nature of an external body in so far as that external body conditions the human body in a given manner But in so far as the external body is an individual which has no reference to the human body the knowledge or idea thereof is in God II ix in so far as God is regarded as affected by the idea of a further thing which II vii is naturally prior to the said external body Wherefore an adequate knowledge of the external body is not in God in so far as he has the idea of the modification of the human body in other words the idea of the modification of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of the external body Q E D PROP XXVI The human mind does not perceive any external body as actually existing except through the ideas of the modifications of its own body Proof If the human body is in no way affected by a given external body then II vii neither is the idea of the human body in other words the human mind affected in any way by the idea of the existence of the said external body nor does it in any manner perceive its existence But in so far as the human body is affected in any way by a given external body thus far II xvi and Coroll it perceives that external body Q E D Corollary In so far as the human mind imagines an external body it has not an adequate knowledge thereof Proof When the human mind regards external bodies through the ideas of the modifications of its own body we say that it imagines see II xvii note now the mind can only imagine external bodies as actually existing Therefore by II xxv in so far as the mind imagines external bodies it has not an adequate knowledge of them Q E D PROP XXVII The idea of each modification of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of the human body itself Proof Every idea of a modification of the human body involves the nature of the human body in so far as the human body is regarded as affected in a given manner II xvi But inasmuch as the human body is an individual which may be affected in many other ways the idea of the said modification c Q E D PROP XXVIII The ideas of the modifications of the human body in so far as they have reference only to the human mind are not clear and distinct but confused Proof The ideas of the modifications of the human body involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies II xvi they must involve the nature not only of the human body but also of its parts for the modifications are modes Post iii whereby the parts of the human body and consequently the human body as a whole are affected But by II xxiv xxv the adequate knowledge of external bodies as also of the parts composing the human body is not in God in so far as he is regarded as affected by the human mind but in so far as he is regarded as affected by other ideas These ideas of modifications in so far as they are referred to the human mind alone are as consequences without premisses in other words confused ideas Q E D Note The idea which constitutes the nature of the human mind is in the same manner proved not to be when considered in itself alone clear and distinct as also is the case with the idea of the human mind and the ideas of the ideas of the modifications of the human body in so far as they are referred to the mind only as everyone may easily see PROP XXIX The idea of the idea of each modification of the human body does not involve an adequate knowledge of the human mind Proof The idea of a modification of the human body II xxvii does not involve an adequate knowledge of the said body in other words does not adequately express its nature that is II xiii it does not agree with the nature of the mind adequately therefore I Ax vi the idea of this idea does not adequately express the nature of the human mind or does not involve an adequate knowledge thereof Corollary Hence it follows that the human mind when it perceives things after the common order of nature has not an adequate but only a confused and fragmentary knowledge of itself of its own body and of external bodies For the mind does not know itself except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the modifications of body II xxiii It only perceives its own body II xix through the ideas of the modifications and only perceives external bodies through the same means thus in so far as it has such ideas of modification it has not an adequate knowledge of itself II xxix nor of its own body II xxvii nor of external bodies II xxv but only a fragmentary and confused knowledge thereof II xxviii and note Q E D Note I say expressly that the mind has not an adequate but only a confused knowledge of itself its own body and of external bodies whenever it perceives things after the common order of nature that is whenever it is determined from without namely by the fortuitous play of circumstance to regard this or that not at such times as it is determined from within that is by the fact of regarding several things at once to understand their points of agreement difference and contrast Whenever it is determined in anywise from within it regards things clearly and distinctly as I will show below PROP XXX We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body Proof The duration of our body does not depend on its essence II Ax i nor on the absolute nature of God I xxi But I xxviii it is conditioned to exist and operate by causes which in their turn are conditioned to exist and operate in a fixed and definite relation by other causes these last again being conditioned by others and so on to infinity The duration of our body therefore depends on the common order of nature or the constitution of things Now however a thing may be constituted the adequate knowledge of that thing is in God in so far as he has the ideas of all things and not in so far as he has the idea of the human body only II ix Coroll Wherefore the knowledge of the duration of our body is in God very inadequate in so far as he is only regarded as constituting the nature of the human mind that is II xi Coroll this knowledge is very inadequate to our mind Q E D PROP XXXI We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of particular things external to ourselves Proof Every particular thing like the human body must be conditioned by another particular thing to exist and operate in a fixed and definite relation this other particular thing must likewise be conditioned by a third and so on to infinity I xxviii As we have shown in the foregoing proposition from this common property of particular things we have only a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of our body we must draw a similar conclusion with regard to the duration of particular things namely that we can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the duration thereof Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that all particular things are contingent and perishable For we can have no adequate idea of their duration by the last Prop and this is what we must understand by the contingency and perishableness of things I xxxiii Note i For I xxix except in this sense nothing is contingent PROP XXXII All ideas in so far as they are referred to God are true Proof All ideas which are in God agree in every respect with their objects II vii Coroll therefore I Ax vi they are all true Q E D PROP XXXIII There is nothing positive in ideas which causes them to be called false Proof If this be denied conceive if possible a positive mode of thinking which should constitute the distinctive quality of falsehood Such a mode of thinking cannot be in God II xxxii external to God it cannot be or be conceived I xv Therefore there is nothing positive in ideas which causes them to be called false Q E D PROP XXXIV Every idea which in us is absolute or adequate and perfect is true Proof When we say that an idea in us is adequate and perfect we say in other words II xi Coroll that the idea is adequate and perfect in God in so far as he constitutes the essence of our mind consequently II xxxii we say that such an idea is true Q E D PROP XXXV Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge which inadequate fragmentary or confused ideas involve Proof There is nothing positive in ideas which causes them to be called false II xxxiii but falsity cannot consist in simple privation for minds not bodies are said to err and to be mistaken neither can it consist in absolute ignorance for ignorance and error are not identical wherefore it consists in the privation of knowledge which inadequate fragmentary or confused ideas involve Q E D Note In the note to II xvii I explained how error consists in the privation of knowledge but in order to throw more light on the subject I will give an example For instance men are mistaken in thinking themselves free their opinion is made up of consciousness of their own actions and ignorance of the causes by which they are conditioned Their idea of freedom therefore is simply their ignorance of any cause for their actions As for their saying that human actions depend on the will this is a mere phrase without any idea to correspond thereto What the will is and how it moves the body they none of them know those who boast of such knowledge and feign dwellings and habitations for the soul are wont to provoke either laughter or disgust So again when we look at the sun we imagine that it is distant from us about two hundred feet this error does not lie solely in this fancy but in the fact that while we thus imagine we do not know the sun s true distance or the cause of the fancy For although we afterwards learn that the sun is distant from us more than six hundred of the earth s diameters we none the less shall fancy it to be near for we do not imagine the sun as near us because we are ignorant of its true distance but because the modification of our body involves the essence of the sun in so far as our said body is affected thereby PROP XXXVI Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same necessity as adequate or clear and distinct ideas Proof All ideas are in God I xv and in so far as they are referred to God are true II xxxii and II vii Coroll adequate therefore there are no ideas confused or inadequate except in respect to a particular mind cf II xxiv and xxviii therefore all ideas whether adequate or inadequate follow by the same necessity II vi Q E D PROP XXXVII That which is common to all cf Lemma II above and which is equally in a part and in the whole does not constitute the essence of any particular thing Proof If this be denied conceive if possible that it constitutes the essence of some particular thing for instance the essence of B Then II Def ii it cannot without B either exist or be conceived but this is against our hypothesis Therefore it does not appertain to B s essence nor does it constitute the essence of any particular thing Q E D PROP XXXVIII Those things which are common to all and which are equally in a part and in the whole cannot be conceived except adequately Proof Let A be something which is common to all bodies and which is equally present in the part of any given body and in the whole I say A cannot be conceived except adequately For the idea thereof in God will necessarily be adequate II vii Coroll both in so far as God has the idea of the human body and also in so far as he has the idea of the modifications of the human body which II xvi xxv xxvii involve in part the nature of the human body and the nature of external bodies that is II xii xiii the idea in God will necessarily be adequate both in so far as he constitutes the human mind and in so far as he has the ideas which are in the human mind Therefore the mind II xi Coroll necessarily perceives A adequately and has this adequate perception both in so far as it perceives itself and in so far as it perceives its own or any external body nor can A be conceived in any other manner Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that there are certain ideas or notions common to all men for by Lemma ii all bodies agree in certain respects which by the foregoing Prop must be adequately or clearly and distinctly perceived by all PROP XXXIX That which is common to and a property of the human body and such other bodies as are wont to affect the human body and which is present equally in each part of either or in the whole will be represented by an adequate idea in the mind Proof If A be that which is common to and a property of the human body and external bodies and equally present in the human body and in the said external bodies in each part of each external body and in the whole there will be an adequate idea of A in God II vii Coroll both in so far as he has the idea of the human body and in so far as he has the ideas of the given external bodies Let it now be granted that the human body is affected by an external body through that which it has in common therewith namely A the idea of this modification will involve the property A II xvi and therefore II vii Coroll the idea of this modification in so far as it involves the property A will be adequate in God in so far as God is affected by the idea of the human body that is II xiii in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind therefore II xi Coroll this idea is also adequate in the human mind Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that the mind is fitted to perceive adequately more things in proportion as its body has more in common with other bodies PROP XL Whatsoever ideas in the mind follow from ideas which are therein adequate are also themselves adequate Proof This proposition is self evident For when we say that an idea in the human mind follows from ideas which are therein adequate we say in other words II xi Coroll that an idea is in the divine intellect whereof God is the cause not in so far as he is infinite nor in so far as he is affected by the ideas of very many particular things but only in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind Note I I have thus set forth the cause of those notions which are common to all men and which form the basis of our ratiocination But there are other causes of certain axioms or notions which it would be to the purpose to set forth by this method of ours for it would thus appear what notions are more useful than others and what notions have scarcely any use at all Furthermore we should see what notions are common to all men and what notions are only clear and distinct to those who are unshackled by prejudice and we should detect those which are ill founded Again we should discern whence the notions called secondary derived their origin and consequently the axioms on which they are founded and other points of interest connected with these questions But I have decided to pass over the subject here partly because I have set it aside for another treatise partly because I am afraid of wearying the reader by too great prolixity Nevertheless in order not to omit anything necessary to be known I will briefly set down the causes whence are derived the terms styled transcendental such as Being Thing Something These terms arose from the fact that the human body being limited is only capable of distinctly forming a certain number of images what an image is I explained in the II xvii note within itself at the same time if this number be exceeded the images will begin to be confused if this number of images of which the body is capable of forming distinctly within itself be largely exceeded all will become entirely confused one with another This being so it is evident from II Prop xvii Coroll and xviii that the human mind can distinctly imagine as many things simultaneously as its body can form images simultaneously When the images become quite confused in the body the mind also imagines all bodies confusedly without any distinction and will comprehend them as it were under one attribute namely under the attribute of Being Thing c The same conclusion can be drawn from the fact that images are not always equally vivid and from other analogous causes which there is no need to explain here for the purpose which we have in view it is sufficient for us to consider one only All may be reduced to this that these terms represent ideas in the highest degree confused From similar causes arise those notions which we call general such as man horse dog c They arise to wit from the fact that so many images for instance of men are formed simultaneously in the human mind that the powers of imagination break down not indeed utterly but to the extent of the mind losing count of small differences between individuals e g colour size c and their definite number and only distinctly imagining that in which all the individuals in so far as the body is affected by them agree for that is the point in which each of the said individuals chiefly affected the body this the mind expresses by the name man and this it predicates of an infinite number of particular individuals For as we have said it is unable to imagine the definite number of individuals We must however bear in mind that these general notions are not formed by all men in the same way but vary in each individual according as the point varies whereby the body has been most often affected and which the mind most easily imagines or remembers For instance those who have most often regarded with admiration the stature of man will by the name of man understand an animal of erect stature those who have been accustomed to regard some other attribute will form a different general image of man for instance that man is a laughing animal a two footed animal without feathers a rational animal and thus in other cases everyone will form general images of things according to the habit of his body It is thus not to be wondered at that among philosophers who seek to explain things in nature merely by the images formed of them so many controversies should have arisen Note II From all that has been said above it is clear that we in many cases perceive and form our general notions one From particular things represented to our intellect fragmentarily confusedly and without order through our senses II xxix Coroll I have settled to call such perceptions by the name of knowledge from the mere suggestions of experience four four A Baconian phrase Nov Org Aph one hundred Pollock p one hundred twenty six n two From symbols e g from the fact of having read or heard certain words we remember things and form certain ideas concerning them similar to those through which we imagine things II xviii note I shall call both these ways of regarding things knowledge of the first kind opinion or imagination three From the fact that we have notions common to all men and adequate ideas of the properties of things II xxxviii Coroll xxxix and Coroll and xl this I call reason and knowledge of the second kind Besides these two kinds of knowledge there is as I will hereafter show a third kind of knowledge which we will call intuition This kind of knowledge proceeds from an adequate idea of the absolute essence of certain attributes of God to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things I will illustrate all three kinds of knowledge by a single example Three numbers are given for finding a fourth which shall be to the third as the second is to the first Tradesmen without hesitation multiply the second by the third and divide the product by the first either because they have not forgotten the rule which they received from a master without any proof or because they have often made trial of it with simple numbers or by virtue of the proof of the nineteenth proposition of the seventh book of Euclid namely in virtue of the general property of proportionals But with very simple numbers there is no need of this For instance one two three being given everyone can see that the fourth proportional is six and this is much clearer because we infer the fourth number from an intuitive grasping of the ratio which the first bears to the second PROP XLI Knowledge of the first kind is the only source of falsity knowledge of the second and third kinds is necessarily true Proof To knowledge of the first kind we have in the foregoing note assigned all those ideas which are inadequate and confused therefore this kind of knowledge is the only source of falsity II xxxv Furthermore we assigned to the second and third kinds of knowledge those ideas which are adequate therefore these kinds are necessarily true II xxxiv Q E D PROP XLII Knowledge of the second and third kinds not knowledge of the first kind teaches us to distinguish the true from the false Proof This proposition is self evident He who knows how to distinguish between true and false must have an adequate idea of true and false That is II xl note ii he must know the true and the false by the second or third kind of knowledge PROP XLIII He who has a true idea simultaneously knows that he has a true idea and cannot doubt of the truth of the thing perceived Proof A true idea in us is an idea which is adequate in God in so far as he is displayed through the nature of the human mind II xi Coroll Let us suppose that there is in God in so far as he is displayed through the human mind an adequate idea A The idea of this idea must also necessarily be in God and be referred to him in the same way as the idea A by II xx whereof the proof is of universal application But the idea A is supposed to be referred to God in so far as he is displayed through the human mind therefore the idea of the idea A must be referred to God in the same manner that is by II xi Coroll the adequate idea of the idea A will be in the mind which has the adequate idea A therefore he who has an adequate idea or knows a thing truly II xxxiv must at the same time have an adequate idea or true knowledge of his knowledge that is obviously he must be assured Q E D Note I explained in the note to II xxi what is meant by the idea of an idea but we may remark that the foregoing proposition is in itself sufficiently plain No one who has a true idea is ignorant that a true idea involves the highest certainty For to have a true idea is only another expression for knowing a thing perfectly or as well as possible No one indeed can doubt of this unless he thinks that an idea is something lifeless like a picture on a panel and not a mode of thinking namely the very act of understanding And who I ask can know that he understands anything unless he do first understand it In other words who can know that he is sure of a thing unless he be first sure of that thing Further what can there be more clear and more certain than a true idea as a standard of truth Even as light displays both itself and darkness so is truth a standard both of itself and of falsity I think I have thus sufficiently answered these questions namely if a true idea is distinguished from a false idea only in so far as it is said to agree with its object a true idea has no more reality or perfection than a false idea since the two are only distinguished by an extrinsic mark consequently neither will a man who has a true idea have any advantage over him who has only false ideas Further how comes it that men have false ideas Lastly how can anyone be sure that he has ideas which agree with their objects These questions I repeat I have in my opinion sufficiently answered The difference between a true idea and a false idea is plain from what was said in II xxxv the former is related to the latter as being is to not being The causes of falsity I have set forth very clearly in II xix and II xxxv with the note From what is there stated the difference between a man who has true ideas and a man who has only false ideas is made apparent As for the last question as to how a man can be sure that he has ideas that agree with their objects I have just pointed out with abundant clearness that his knowledge arises from the simple fact that he has an idea which corresponds with its object in other words that truth is its own standard We may add that our mind in so far as it perceives things truly is part of the infinite intellect of God II xi Coroll therefore the clear and distinct ideas of the mind are as necessarily true as the ideas of God PROP XLIV It is not in the nature of reason to regard things as contingent but as necessary Proof It is in the nature of reason to perceive things truly II xli namely I Ax vi as they are in themselves that is I xxix not as contingent but as necessary Q E D Corollary I Hence it follows that it is only through our imagination that we consider things whether in respect to the future or the past as contingent Note How this way of looking at things arises I will briefly explain We have shown above II xvii and Coroll that the mind always regards things as present to itself even though they be not in existence until some causes arise which exclude their existence and presence Further II xviii we showed that if the human body has once been affected by two external bodies simultaneously the mind when it afterwards imagines one of the said external bodies will straightway remember the other that is it will regard both as present to itself unless there arise causes which exclude their existence and presence Further no one doubts that we imagine time from the fact that we imagine bodies to be moved some more slowly than others some more quickly some at equal speed Thus let us suppose that a child yesterday saw Peter for the first time in the morning Paul at noon and Simon in the evening then that today he again sees Peter in the morning It is evident from II Prop xviii that as soon as he sees the morning light he will imagine that the sun will traverse the same parts of the sky as it did when he saw it on the preceding day in other words he will imagine a complete day and together with his imagination of the morning he will imagine Peter with noon he will imagine Paul and with evening he will imagine Simon that is he will imagine the existence of Paul and Simon in relation to a future time on the other hand if he sees Simon in the evening he will refer Peter and Paul to a past time by imagining them simultaneously with the imagination of a past time If it should at any time happen that on some other evening the child should see James instead of Simon he will on the following morning associate with his imagination of evening sometimes Simon sometimes James not both together for the child is supposed to have seen at evening one or other of them not both together His imagination will therefore waver and with the imagination of future evenings he will associate first one then the other that is he will imagine them in the future neither of them as certain but both as contingent This wavering of the imagination will be the same if the imagination be concerned with things which we thus contemplate standing in relation to time past or time present consequently we may imagine things as contingent whether they be referred to time present past or future Corollary II It is in the nature of reason to perceive things under a certain form of eternity sub quadam aeternitatis specie Proof It is in the nature of reason to regard things not as contingent but as necessary II xliv Reason perceives this necessity of things II xli truly that is I Ax vi as it is in itself But I xvi this necessity of things is the very necessity of the eternal nature of God therefore it is in the nature of reason to regard things under this form of eternity We may add that the bases of reason are the notions II xxxviii which answer to things common to all and which II xxxvii do not answer to the essence of any particular thing which must therefore be conceived without any relation to time under a certain form of eternity PROP XLV Every idea of every body or of every particular thing actually existing necessarily involves the eternal and infinite essence of God Proof The idea of a particular thing actually existing necessarily involves both the existence and the essence of the said thing II viii Now particular things cannot be conceived without God I xv but inasmuch as II vi they have God for their cause in so far as he is regarded under the attribute of which the things in question are modes their ideas must necessarily involve I Ax iv the conception of the attributes of those ideas that is I vi the eternal and infinite essence of God Q E D Note By existence I do not here mean duration that is existence in so far as it is conceived abstractedly and as a certain form of quantity I am speaking of the very nature of existence which is assigned to particular things because they follow in infinite numbers and in infinite ways from the eternal necessity of God s nature I xvi I am speaking I repeat of the very existence of particular things in so far as they are in God For although each particular thing be conditioned by another particular thing to exist in a given way yet the force whereby each particular thing perseveres in existing follows from the eternal necessity of God s nature cf I xxiv Coroll PROP XLVI 
3227-24747-0000	train-other-500	The knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God which every idea involves is adequate and perfect
none	none	 Proof 
3227-24747-0001	train-other-500	The proof of the last proposition is universal and whether a thing be considered as a part or a whole the idea thereof whether of the whole or of a part
none	none	 by the last Prop 
3227-24747-0002	train-other-500	will involve God s eternal and infinite essence Wherefore that which gives knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God is common to all
none	none	 and is equally in the part and in the whole therefore II xxxviii this knowledge will be adequate Q E D PROP XLVII The human mind has an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God Proof The human mind has ideas II xxii from which II xxiii it perceives itself and its own body II xix and external bodies II xvi Coroll i and II xvii as actually existing therefore II xlv and xlvi it has an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God Q E D 
3227-24747-0003	train-other-500	Note Hence we see that the infinite essence and the eternity of God are known to all Now as all things are in God and are conceived through God
3227-24747-0004	train-other-500	we can from this knowledge infer many things which we may adequately know and we may form that third kind of knowledge of which we spoke
none	none	 in the note to II xl and of the excellence and use of which we shall have occasion to speak in Part V 
3227-24747-0005	train-other-500	Men have not so clear a knowledge of God as they have of general notions because they are unable to imagine God as they do bodies and also because they have associated the name God
3227-24747-0006	train-other-500	with images of things that they are in the habit of seeing
none	none	 as indeed they can hardly avoid doing being as they are men 
3227-24747-0007	train-other-500	and continually affected by external bodies Many errors in truth can be traced to this head
none	none	 namely that we do not apply names to things rightly For instance when a man says that the lines drawn from the centre of a circle to its circumference are not equal 
3227-24747-0008	train-other-500	he then at all events assuredly attaches a meaning to the word circle
none	none	 different from that assigned by mathematicians So again when men make mistakes in calculation they have one set of figures in their mind and another on the paper If we could see into their minds they do not make a mistake they seem to do so because we think that they have the same numbers in their mind as they have on the paper If this were not so we should not believe them to be in error any more than I thought that a man was in error whom I lately heard exclaiming that his entrance hall had flown into a neighbour s hen for his meaning seemed to me sufficiently clear Very many controversies have arisen from the fact that men do not rightly explain their meaning or do not rightly interpret the meaning of others For as a matter of fact as they flatly contradict themselves they assume now one side now another of the argument so as to oppose the opinions which they consider mistaken and absurd in their opponents PROP XLVIII In the mind there is no absolute or free will but the mind is determined to wish this or that by a cause which has also been determined by another cause and this last by another cause and so on to infinity Proof The mind is a fixed and definite mode of thought II xi therefore it cannot be the free cause of its actions I xvii Coroll ii in other words it cannot have an absolute faculty of positive or negative volition but by I xxviii it must be determined by a cause which has also been determined by another cause and this last by another c Q E D Note In the same way it is proved that there is in the mind no absolute faculty of understanding desiring loving c Whence it follows that these and similar faculties are either entirely fictitious or are merely abstract and general terms such as we are accustomed to put together from particular things Thus the intellect and the will stand in the same relation to this or that idea or this or that volition as lapidity to this or that stone or as man to Peter and Paul The cause which leads men to consider themselves free has been set forth in the Appendix to Part I But before I proceed further I would here remark that by the will to affirm and decide I mean the faculty not the desire I mean I repeat the faculty whereby the mind affirms or denies what is true or false not the desire wherewith the mind wishes for or turns away from any given thing 
3227-24747-0009	train-other-500	After we have proved that these faculties of ours are general notions which cannot be distinguished from the particular instances on which they are based
3227-24747-0010	train-other-500	we must inquire whether volitions themselves are anything besides the ideas of things We must inquire I say whether there is in the mind any affirmation or negation beyond that
3227-24747-0011	train-other-500	which the idea in so far as it is an idea involves
none	none	 On which subject see the following proposition and II Def iii 
3227-24747-0012	train-other-500	lest the idea of pictures should suggest itself
none	none	 For by ideas I do not mean images such as are formed at the back of the eye 
3227-24747-0013	train-other-500	or in the midst of the brain but the conceptions of thought
none	none	 PROP XLIX There is in the mind no volition or affirmation and negation 
3227-24747-0014	train-other-500	save that which an idea inasmuch as it is an idea involves
none	none	 Proof 
3227-24747-0015	train-other-500	There is in the mind no absolute faculty of positive or negative volition but only particular volitions namely this or that affirmation
none	none	 and this or that negation 
3227-24747-0016	train-other-500	Now let us conceive a particular volition
none	none	 namely the mode of thinking whereby the mind affirms that the three interior angles of a triangle 
3227-24747-0017	train-other-500	are equal to two right angles This affirmation involves the conception or idea of a triangle that is without the idea of a triangle it cannot be conceived
3227-24747-0018	train-other-500	It is the same thing to say that the concept A must involve the concept B as it is to say that A cannot be conceived without B
none	none	 Further this affirmation cannot be made II Ax iii 
3227-24747-0019	train-other-500	without the idea of a triangle Therefore
none	none	 this affirmation can neither be nor be conceived without the idea of a triangle 
3227-24747-0020	train-other-500	Again this idea of a triangle must involve this same affirmation namely that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles Wherefore and vice versa
3227-24747-0021	train-other-500	this idea of a triangle can neither be nor be conceived without this affirmation therefore this affirmation belongs to the essence of the idea of a triangle and is nothing besides
none	none	 What we have said of this volition 
3227-24747-0022	train-other-500	inasmuch as we have selected it at random may be said of any other volition
none	none	 namely that it is nothing but an idea Q E D Corollary Will and understanding are one and the same Proof Will and understanding are nothing beyond the individual volitions and ideas II xlviii and note But a particular volition and a particular idea are one and the same by the foregoing Prop therefore will and understanding are one and the same Q E D Note We have thus removed the cause which is commonly assigned for error For we have shown above that falsity consists solely in the privation of knowledge involved in ideas which are fragmentary and confused Wherefore a false idea inasmuch as it is false does not involve certainty When we say then that a man acquiesces in what is false and that he has no doubts on the subject we do not say that he is certain but only that he does not doubt or that he acquiesces in what is false inasmuch as there are no reasons which should cause his imagination to waver see II xliv note Thus although the man be assumed to acquiesce in what is false we shall never say that he is certain For by certainty we mean something positive II xliii and note not merely the absence of doubt However 
3227-24747-0023	train-other-500	in order that the foregoing proposition may be fully explained I will draw attention to a few additional points and I will furthermore answer the objections which may be advanced against our doctrine Lastly
3227-24747-0024	train-other-500	in order to remove every scruple I have thought it worth while to point out some of the advantages which follow therefrom
none	none	 I say some for they will be better appreciated from what we shall set forth in the fifth part I begin then with the first point and warn my readers to make an accurate distinction between an idea or conception of the mind and the images of things which we imagine It is further necessary that they should distinguish between idea and words whereby we signify things These three namely images words and ideas are by many persons either entirely confused together or not distinguished with sufficient accuracy or care and hence people are generally in ignorance how absolutely necessary is a knowledge of this doctrine of the will both for philosophic purposes and for the wise ordering of life 
3227-24747-0025	train-other-500	Those who think that ideas consist in images which are formed in us by contact with external bodies persuade themselves that the ideas of those things whereof we can form no mental picture
none	none	 are not ideas but only figments which we invent by the free decree of our will 
3227-24747-0026	train-other-500	they thus regard ideas as though they were inanimate pictures on a panel and filled with this misconception do not see that an idea inasmuch as it is an idea
3227-24747-0027	train-other-500	involves an affirmation or negation Again those who confuse words with ideas or with the affirmation which an idea involves think that they can wish something contrary to what they feel affirm or deny
3227-24747-0028	train-other-500	This misconception will easily be laid aside by one who reflects on the nature of knowledge and seeing that it in no wise involves the conception of extension will therefore clearly understand
none	none	 that an idea being a mode of thinking 
3227-24747-0029	train-other-500	does not consist in the image of anything nor in words The essence of words and images is put together by bodily motions which in no wise involve the conception of thought These few words on this subject will suffice
3227-24747-0030	train-other-500	I will therefore pass on to consider the objections which may be raised against our doctrine Of these the first is advanced by those who think that the will has a wider scope than the understanding
none	none	 and that therefore it is different therefrom The reason for their holding the belief that the will has wider scope 
3227-24747-0031	train-other-500	than the understanding is that they assert that
none	none	 they have no need of an increase in their faculty of assent 
3227-24747-0032	train-other-500	that is of affirmation or negation in order to assent to an infinity of things which we do not perceive but that they have need of an increase in their faculty of understanding
3227-24747-0033	train-other-500	The will is thus distinguished from the intellect
none	none	 the latter being finite and the former infinite Secondly it may be objected that experience seems to teach us especially clearly 
3227-24747-0034	train-other-500	that we are able to suspend our judgment before assenting to things which we perceive this is confirmed by the fact
3227-24747-0035	train-other-500	that no one is said to be deceived in so far as he perceives anything but only in so far as he assents or dissents For instance he who feigns a winged horse
3227-24747-0036	train-other-500	does not therefore admit that a winged horse exists that is he is not deceived unless he admits in addition that a winged horse does exist Nothing therefore seems to be taught more clearly by experience
3227-24747-0037	train-other-500	than that the will or faculty of assent is free and different from the faculty of understanding Thirdly
none	none	 it may be objected that one affirmation does not apparently contain more reality than another in other words that we do not seem to need for affirming that what is true is true any greater power than for affirming that what is false is true We have however seen that one idea has more reality or perfection than another 
3227-24747-0038	train-other-500	for as objects are some more excellent than others so also are the ideas of them some more excellent than others this also seems to point to a difference between the understanding and the will
3227-24747-0039	train-other-500	Fourthly it may be objected if man does not act from free will what will happen if the incentives to action are equally balanced
3227-24747-0040	train-other-500	as in the case of Buridan s ass Will he perish of hunger and thirst If I say that he would I shall seem to have in my thoughts an ass or the statue of a man
3227-24747-0041	train-other-500	rather than an actual man If I say that he would not he would then determine his own action and would consequently possess the faculty of going and doing whatever he liked Other objections might also be raised
none	none	 but as I am not bound to put in evidence everything that anyone may dream 
3227-24747-0042	train-other-500	I will only set myself to the task of refuting those I have mentioned
none	none	 and that as briefly as possible To the first objection I answer 
3227-24747-0043	train-other-500	that I admit that the will has a wider scope than the understanding
none	none	 if by the understanding be meant only clear and distinct ideas but I deny that the will has a wider scope than the perceptions 
3227-24747-0044	train-other-500	and the faculty of forming conceptions nor do I see why the faculty of volition should be called infinite any more than the faculty of feeling for as we are able by the same faculty of volition to affirm an infinite number of things
none	none	 one after the other for we cannot affirm an infinite number simultaneously 
3227-24747-0045	train-other-500	so also can we by the same faculty of feeling feel or perceive in succession an infinite number of bodies If it be said that there is an infinite number of things which we cannot perceive
3227-24747-0046	train-other-500	I answer that we cannot attain to such things by any thinking nor consequently by any faculty of volition But it may still be urged
3227-24747-0047	train-other-500	if God wished to bring it about that we should perceive them he would be obliged to endow us with a greater faculty of perception but not a greater faculty of volition than we have already
3227-24747-0048	train-other-500	This is the same as to say that if God wished to bring it about that we should understand an infinite number of other entities it would be necessary for him to give us a greater understanding
3227-24747-0049	train-other-500	but not a more universal idea of entity than that which we have already in order to grasp such infinite entities We have shown that will is a universal entity or idea
3227-24747-0050	train-other-500	whereby we explain all particular volitions
none	none	 in other words that which is common to all such volitions As then our opponents maintain that this idea 
3227-24747-0051	train-other-500	common or universal to all volitions is a faculty it is little to be wondered at that they assert that such a faculty extends itself into the infinite beyond the limits of the understanding
3227-24747-0052	train-other-500	for what is universal is predicated alike of one of many and of an infinite number of individuals To the second objection
3227-24747-0053	train-other-500	I reply by denying that we have a free power of suspending our judgment for when we say that anyone suspends his judgment we merely mean that he sees that he does not perceive the matter in question adequately
none	none	 Suspension of judgment is therefore 
3227-24747-0054	train-other-500	strictly speaking a perception and not free will In order to illustrate the point
none	none	 let us suppose a boy imagining a horse and perceive nothing else Inasmuch as this imagination involves the existence of the horse II xvii Coroll and the boy does not perceive anything which would exclude the existence of the horse 
3227-24747-0055	train-other-500	he will necessarily regard the horse as present he will not be able to doubt of its existence although he be not certain thereof We have daily experience of such a state of things in dreams
none	none	 and I do not suppose that there is anyone who would maintain 
3227-24747-0056	train-other-500	that while he is dreaming he has the free power of suspending his judgment concerning the things in his dream and bringing it about that he should not dream those things which he dreams that he sees
3227-24747-0057	train-other-500	yet it happens notwithstanding
none	none	 that even in dreams we suspend our judgment 
3227-24747-0058	train-other-500	namely when we dream that we are dreaming Further I grant that no one can be deceived so far as actual perception extends that is I grant that the mind s imaginations regarded in themselves do not involve error
none	none	 II xvii note but I deny that a man does not in the act of perception 
3227-24747-0059	train-other-500	make any affirmation For what is the perception of a winged horse save affirming that a horse has wings If the mind could perceive nothing else but the winged horse it would regard the same as present to itself
3227-24747-0060	train-other-500	it would have no reasons for doubting its existence nor any faculty of dissent unless the imagination of a winged horse be joined to an idea which precludes the existence of the said horse
3227-24747-0061	train-other-500	or unless the mind perceives that the idea which it possess of a winged horse is inadequate in which case it will either necessarily deny the existence of such a horse
3227-24747-0062	train-other-500	or will necessarily be in doubt on the subject I think that I have anticipated my answer to the third objection namely that the will is something universal which is predicated of all ideas
3227-24747-0063	train-other-500	and that it only signifies that which is common to all ideas namely an affirmation whose adequate essence must therefore in so far as it is thus conceived in the abstract
3227-24747-0064	train-other-500	be in every idea and be in this respect alone the same in all not in so far as it is considered as constituting the idea s essence for in this respect particular
none	none	 affirmations differ one from the other as much as do ideas For instance the affirmation which involves the idea of a circle differs from that which involves the idea of a triangle as much as the idea of a circle differs from the idea of a triangle Further I absolutely deny that we are in need of an equal power of thinking to affirm that that which is true is true and to affirm that that which is false is true These two affirmations if we regard the mind are in the same relation to one another as being and not being for there is nothing positive in ideas which constitutes the actual reality of falsehood II xxxv note and xlvii note We must therefore conclude that we are easily deceived when we confuse universals with singulars and the entities of reason and abstractions with realities As for the fourth objection I am quite ready to admit that a man placed in the equilibrium described namely as perceiving nothing but hunger and thirst a certain food and a certain drink each equally distant from him would die of hunger and thirst If I am asked whether such an one should not rather be considered an ass than a man I answer that I do not know neither do I know how a man should be considered who hangs himself or how we should consider children fools madmen c It remains to point out the advantages of a knowledge of this doctrine as bearing on conduct and this may be easily gathered from what has been said The doctrine is good one Inasmuch as it teaches us to act solely according to the decree of God and to be partakers in the Divine nature and so much the more as we perform more perfect actions and more and more understand God Such a doctrine not only completely tranquilizes our spirit but also shows us where our highest happiness or blessedness is namely solely in the knowledge of God whereby we are led to act only as love and piety shall bid us We may thus clearly understand how far astray from a true estimate of virtue are those who expect to be decorated by God with high rewards for their virtue and their best actions as for having endured the direst slavery as if virtue and the service of God were not in itself happiness and perfect freedom two Inasmuch as it teaches us how we ought to conduct ourselves with respect to the gifts of fortune or matters which are not in our power and do not follow from our nature For it shows us that we should await and endure fortune s smiles or frowns with an equal mind seeing that all things follow from the eternal decree of God by the same necessity as it follows from the essence of a triangle that the three angles are equal to two right angles three This doctrine raises social life inasmuch as it teaches us to hate no man neither to despise to deride to envy or to be angry with any Further as it tells us that each should be content with his own and helpful to his neighbour not from any womanish pity favour or superstition but solely by the guidance of reason according as the time and occasion demand as I will show in Part III four Lastly this doctrine confers no small advantage on the commonwealth for it teaches how citizens should be governed and led not so as to become slaves but so that they may freely do whatsoever things are best I have thus fulfilled the promise made at the beginning of this note and I thus bring the second part of my treatise to a close I think I have therein explained the nature and properties of the human mind at sufficient length and considering the difficulty of the subject with sufficient clearness I have laid a foundation whereon may be raised many excellent conclusions of the highest utility and most necessary to be known as will in what follows be partly made plain PART III ON THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS Most writers on the emotions and on human conduct seem to be treating rather of matters outside nature than of natural phenomena following nature s general laws They appear to conceive man to be situated in nature as a kingdom within a kingdom for they believe that he disturbs rather than follows nature s order that he has absolute control over his actions and that he is determined solely by himself They attribute human infirmities and fickleness not to the power of nature in general but to some mysterious flaw in the nature of man which accordingly they bemoan deride despise or as usually happens abuse he who succeeds in hitting off the weakness of the human mind more eloquently or more acutely than his fellows is looked upon as a seer Still there has been no lack of very excellent men to whose toil and industry I confess myself much indebted who have written many noteworthy things concerning the right way of life and have given much sage advice to mankind But no one so far as I know has defined the nature and strength of the emotions and the power of the mind against them for their restraint I do not forget that the illustrious Descartes though he believed that the mind has absolute power over its actions strove to explain human emotions by their primary causes and at the same time to point out a way by which the mind might attain to absolute dominion over them However in my opinion he accomplishes nothing beyond a display of the acuteness of his own great intellect as I will show in the proper place For the present I wish to revert to those who would rather abuse or deride human emotions than understand them Such persons will doubtless think it strange that I should attempt to treat of human vice and folly geometrically and should wish to set forth with rigid reasoning those matters which they cry out against as repugnant to reason frivolous absurd and dreadful However such is my plan Nothing comes to pass in nature which can be set down to a flaw therein for nature is always the same and everywhere one and the same in her efficacy and power of action that is nature s laws and ordinances whereby all things come to pass and change from one form to another are everywhere and always the same so that there should be one and the same method of understanding the nature of all things whatsoever namely through nature s universal laws and rules Thus the passions of hatred anger envy and so on considered in themselves follow from this same necessity and efficacy of nature they answer to certain definite causes through which they are understood and possess certain properties as worthy of being known as the properties of anything else whereof the contemplation in itself affords us delight I shall therefore treat of the nature and strength of the emotions according to the same method as I employed heretofore in my investigations concerning God and the mind I shall consider human actions and desires in exactly the same manner as though I were concerned with lines planes and solids DEFINITIONS I By an adequate cause I mean a cause through which its effect can be clearly and distinctly perceived By an inadequate or partial cause I mean a cause through which by itself its effect cannot be understood II I say that we act when anything takes place either within us or externally to us whereof we are the adequate cause that is by the foregoing definition when through our nature something takes place within us or externally to us which can through our nature alone be clearly and distinctly understood On the other hand I say that we are passive as regards something when that something takes place within us or follows from our nature externally we being only the partial cause III By emotion I mean the modifications of the body whereby the active power of the said body is increased or diminished aided or constrained and also the ideas of such modifications N B If we can be the adequate cause of any of these modifications I then call the emotion an activity otherwise I call it a passion or state wherein the mind is passive POSTULATES I The human body can be affected in many ways whereby its power of activity is increased or diminished and also in other ways which do not render its power of activity either greater or less N B This postulate or axiom rests on Postulate i and Lemmas v and vii which see after II xiii II The human body can undergo many changes and nevertheless retain the impressions or traces of objects cf II Post v and consequently the same images of things see note II xvii PROP I Our mind is in certain cases active and in certain cases passive In so far as it has adequate ideas it is necessarily active and in so far as it has inadequate ideas it is necessarily passive Proof In every human mind there are some adequate ideas and some ideas that are fragmentary and confused II xl note Those ideas which are adequate in the mind are adequate also in God inasmuch as he constitutes the essence of the mind II xl Coroll and those which are inadequate in the mind are likewise by the same Coroll adequate in God not inasmuch as he contains in himself the essence of the given mind alone but as he at the same time contains the minds of other things Again from any given idea some effect must necessarily follow I thirty six of this effect God is the adequate cause III Def i not inasmuch as he is infinite but inasmuch as he is conceived as affected by the given idea II ix But of that effect whereof God is the cause inasmuch as he is affected by an idea which is adequate in a given mind of that effect I repeat the mind in question is the adequate cause II xi Coroll Therefore our mind in so far as it has adequate ideas III Def ii is in certain cases necessarily active this was our first point Again whatsoever necessarily follows from the idea which is adequate in God not by virtue of his possessing in himself the mind of one man only but by virtue of his containing together with the mind of that one man the minds of other things also of such an effect II xi Coroll the mind of the given man is not an adequate but only a partial cause thus III Def ii the mind inasmuch as it has inadequate ideas is in certain cases necessarily passive this was our second point Therefore our mind c Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that the mind is more or less liable to be acted upon in proportion as it possesses inadequate ideas and contrariwise is more or less active in proportion as it possesses adequate ideas PROP II Body cannot determine mind to think neither can mind determine body to motion or rest or any state different from these if such there be Proof All modes of thinking have for their cause God by virtue of his being a thinking thing and not by virtue of his being displayed under any other attribute II vi That therefore which determines the mind to thought is a mode of thought and not a mode of extension that is II Def i it is not body This was our first point Again the motion and rest of a body must arise from another body which has also been determined to a state of motion or rest by a third body and absolutely everything which takes place in a body must spring from God in so far as he is regarded as affected by some mode of extension and not by some mode of thought II vi that is it cannot spring from the mind which is a mode of thought This was our second point Therefore body cannot determine mind c Q E D Note This is made more clear by what was said in the note to II vii namely that mind and body are one and the same thing conceived first under the attribute of thought secondly under the attribute of extension Thus it follows that the order or concatenation of things is identical whether nature be conceived under the one attribute or the other consequently the order of states of activity and passivity in our body is simultaneous in nature with the order of states of activity and passivity in the mind The same conclusion is evident from the manner in which we proved II xii Nevertheless though such is the case and though there be no further room for doubt I can scarcely believe until the fact is proved by experience that men can be induced to consider the question calmly and fairly so firmly are they convinced that it is merely at the bidding of the mind that the body is set in motion or at rest or performs a variety of actions depending solely on the mind s will or the exercise of thought However no one has hitherto laid down the limits to the powers of the body that is no one has as yet been taught by experience what the body can accomplish solely by the laws of nature in so far as she is regarded as extension No one hitherto has gained such an accurate knowledge of the bodily mechanism that he can explain all its functions nor need I call attention to the fact that many actions are observed in the lower animals which far transcend human sagacity and that somnambulists do many things in their sleep which they would not venture to do when awake these instances are enough to show that the body can by the sole laws of its nature do many things which the mind wonders at Again no one knows how or by what means the mind moves the body nor how many various degrees of motion it can impart to the body nor how quickly it can move it Thus when men say that this or that physical action has its origin in the mind which latter has dominion over the body they are using words without meaning or are confessing in specious phraseology that they are ignorant of the cause of the said action and do not wonder at it But they will say whether we know or do not know the means whereby the mind acts on the body we have at any rate experience of the fact that unless the human mind is in a fit state to think the body remains inert Moreover we have experience that the mind alone can determine whether we speak or are silent and a variety of similar states which accordingly we say depend on the mind s decree But as to the first point I ask such objectors whether experience does not also teach that if the body be inactive the mind is simultaneously unfitted for thinking For when the body is at rest in sleep the mind simultaneously is in a state of torpor also and has no power of thinking such as it possesses when the body is awake Again I think everyone s experience will confirm the statement that the mind is not at all times equally fit for thinking on a given subject but according as the body is more or less fitted for being stimulated by the image of this or that object so also is the mind more or less fitted for contemplating the said object But it will be urged it is impossible that solely from the laws of nature considered as extended substance we should be able to deduce the causes of buildings pictures and things of that kind which are produced only by human art nor would the human body unless it were determined and led by the mind be capable of building a single temple However I have just pointed out that the objectors cannot fix the limits of the body s power or say what can be concluded from a consideration of its sole nature whereas they have experience of many things being accomplished solely by the laws of nature which they would never have believed possible except under the direction of mind such are the actions performed by somnambulists while asleep and wondered at by their performers when awake I would further call attention to the mechanism of the human body which far surpasses in complexity all that has been put together by human art not to repeat what I have already shown namely that from nature under whatever attribute she be considered infinite results follow As for the second objection I submit that the world would be much happier if men were as fully able to keep silence as they are to speak Experience abundantly shows that men can govern anything more easily than their tongues and restrain anything more easily than their appetites when it comes about that many believe that we are only free in respect to objects which we moderately desire because our desire for such can easily be controlled by the thought of something else frequently remembered but that we are by no means free in respect to what we seek with violent emotion for our desire cannot then be allayed with the remembrance of anything else However unless such persons had proved by experience that we do many things which we afterwards repent of and again that we often when assailed by contrary emotions see the better and follow the worse there would be nothing to prevent their believing that we are free in all things Thus an infant believes that of its own free will it desires milk an angry child believes that it freely desires vengeance a timid child believes that it freely desires to run away further a drunken man believes that he utters from the free decision of his mind words which when he is sober he would willingly have withheld thus too a delirious man a garrulous woman a child and others of like complexion believe that they speak from the free decision of their mind when they are in reality unable to restrain their impulse to talk Experience teaches us no less clearly than reason that men believe themselves to be free simply because they are conscious of their actions and unconscious of the causes whereby those actions are determined and further it is plain that the dictates of the mind are but another name for the appetites and therefore vary according to the varying state of the body Everyone shapes his actions according to his emotion those who are assailed by conflicting emotions know not what they wish those who are not attacked by any emotion are readily swayed this way or that All these considerations clearly show that a mental decision and a bodily appetite or determined state are simultaneous or rather are one and the same thing which we call decision when it is regarded under and explained through the attribute of thought and a conditioned state when it is regarded under the attribute of extension and deduced from the laws of motion and rest This will appear yet more plainly in the sequel For the present I wish to call attention to another point namely that we cannot act by the decision of the mind unless we have a remembrance of having done so For instance we cannot say a word without remembering that we have done so Again it is not within the free power of the mind to remember or forget a thing at will Therefore the freedom of the mind must in any case be limited to the power of uttering or not uttering something which it remembers But when we dream that we speak we believe that we speak from a free decision of the mind yet we do not speak or if we do it is by a spontaneous motion of the body Again we dream that we are concealing something and we seem to act from the same decision of the mind as that whereby we keep silence when awake concerning something we know Lastly we dream that from the free decision of our mind we do something which we should not dare to do when awake Now I should like to know whether there be in the mind two sorts of decisions one sort illusive and the other sort free If our folly does not carry us so far as this we must necessarily admit that the decision of the mind which is believed to be free is not distinguishable from the imagination or memory and is nothing more than the affirmation which an idea by virtue of being an idea necessarily involves II xlix Wherefore these decisions of the mind arise in the mind by the same necessity as the ideas of things actually existing Therefore those who believe that they speak or keep silence or act in any way from the free decision of their mind do but dream with their eyes open PROP III The activities of the mind arise solely from adequate ideas the passive states of the mind depend solely on inadequate ideas Proof The first element which constitutes the essence of the mind is nothing else but the idea of the actually existent body II xi and xiii which II xv is compounded of many other ideas whereof some are adequate and some inadequate II xxix Coroll II xxxviii Coroll Whatsoever therefore follows from the nature of mind and has mind for its proximate cause through which it must be understood must necessarily follow either from an adequate or from an inadequate idea But in so far as the mind III i has inadequate ideas it is necessarily passive wherefore the activities of the mind follow solely from adequate ideas and accordingly the mind is only passive in so far as it has inadequate ideas Q E D Note Thus we see that passive states are not attributed to the mind except in so far as it contains something involving negation or in so far as it is regarded as a part of nature which cannot be clearly and distinctly perceived through itself without other parts I could thus show that passive states are attributed to individual things in the same way that they are attributed to the mind and that they cannot otherwise be perceived but my purpose is solely to treat of the human mind PROP IV Nothing can be destroyed except by a cause external to itself Proof This proposition is self evident for the definition of anything affirms the essence of that thing but does not negative it in other words it postulates the essence of the thing but does not take it away So long therefore as we regard only the thing itself without taking into account external causes we shall not be able to find in it anything which could destroy it Q E D PROP V Things are naturally contrary that is cannot exist in the same object in so far as one is capable of destroying the other Proof If they could agree together or company exist in the same object there would then be in the said object something which could destroy it but this by the foregoing proposition is absurd therefore things c Q E D PROP VI Everything in so far as it is in itself endeavours to persist in its own being Proof Individual things are modes whereby the attributes of God are expressed in a given determinate manner I xxv Coroll that is I xxxiv they are things which express in a given determinate manner the power of God whereby God is and acts now no thing contains in itself anything whereby it can be destroyed or which can take away its existence III iv but contrariwise it is opposed to all that could take away its existence III v Therefore in so far as it can and in so far as it is in itself it endeavours to persist in its own being Q E D PROP VII The endeavour wherewith everything endeavours to persist in its own being is nothing else but the actual essence of the thing in question Proof From the given essence of any thing certain consequences necessarily follow I xxxvi nor have things any power save such as necessarily follows from their nature as determined I xxix wherefore the power of any given thing or the endeavour whereby either alone or with other things it acts or endeavours to act that is III vi the power or endeavour wherewith it endeavours to persist in its own being is nothing else but the given or actual essence of the thing in question Q E D PROP VIII The endeavour whereby a thing endeavours to persist in its own being involves no finite time but an indefinite time Proof If it involved a limited time which should determine the duration of the thing it would then follow solely from that power whereby the thing exists that the thing could not exist beyond the limits of that time but that it must be destroyed but this III iv is absurd Wherefore the endeavour wherewith a thing exists involves no definite time but contrariwise since III iv it will by the same power whereby it already exists always continue to exist unless it be destroyed by some external cause this endeavour involves an indefinite time PROP IX The mind both in so far as it has clear and distinct ideas and also in so far as it has confused ideas endeavours to persist in its being for an indefinite period and of this endeavour it is conscious Proof The essence of the mind is constituted by adequate and inadequate ideas III iii therefore III vii both in so far as it possesses the former and in so far as it possesses the latter it endeavours to persist in its own being and that for an indefinite time III viii Now as the mind II xxiii is necessarily conscious of itself through the ideas of the modifications of the body the mind is therefore III vii conscious of its own endeavour Note This endeavour when referred solely to the mind is called will when referred to the mind and body in conjunction it is called appetite it is in fact nothing else but man s essence from the nature of which necessarily follow all those results which tend to its preservation and which man has thus been determined to perform Further between appetite and desire there is no difference except that the term desire is generally applied to men in so far as they are conscious of their appetite and may accordingly be thus defined Desire is appetite with consciousness thereof It is thus plain from what has been said that in no case do we strive for wish for long for or desire anything because we deem it to be good but on the other hand we deem a thing to be good because we strive for it wish for it long for it or desire it PROP X An idea which excludes the existence of our body cannot be postulated in our mind but is contrary thereto Proof Whatsoever can destroy our body cannot be postulated therein III v Therefore neither can the idea of such a thing occur in God in so far as he has the idea of our body II ix Coroll that is II xi xiii the idea of that thing cannot be postulated as in our mind but contrariwise since II xi xiii the first element that constitutes the essence of the mind is the idea of the human body as actually existing it follows that the first and chief endeavour of our mind is the endeavour to affirm the existence of our body thus an idea which negatives the existence of our body is contrary to our mind c Q E D PROP XI Whatsoever increases or diminishes helps or hinders the power of activity in our body the idea thereof increases or diminishes helps or hinders the power of thought in our mind Proof This proposition is evident from II vii or from II xiv Note Thus we see that the mind can undergo many changes and can pass sometimes to a state of greater perfection sometimes to a state of lesser perfection These passive states of transition explain to us the emotions of pleasure and pain By pleasure therefore in the following propositions I shall signify a passive state wherein the mind passes to a greater perfection By pain I shall signify a passive state wherein the mind passes to a lesser perfection Further the emotion of pleasure in reference to the body and mind together I shall call stimulation titillatio or merriment hilaritas the emotion of pain in the same relation I shall call suffering or melancholy But we must bear in mind that stimulation and suffering are attributed to man when one part of his nature is more affected than the rest merriment and melancholy when all parts are alike affected What I mean by desire I have explained in the note to Prop ix of this part beyond these three I recognize no other primary emotion I will show as I proceed that all other emotions arise from these three But before I go further I should like here to explain at greater length Prop x of this part in order that we may clearly understand how one idea is contrary to another In the note to II xvii we showed that the idea which constitutes the essence of mind involves the existence of body so long as the body itself exists Again it follows from what we pointed out in the Corollary to II viii that the present existence of our mind depends solely on the fact that the mind involves the actual existence of the body Lastly we showed II xvii xviii and note that the power of the mind whereby it imagines and remembers things also depends on the fact that it involves the actual existence of the body Whence it follows that the present existence of the mind and its power of imagining are removed as soon as the mind ceases to affirm the present existence of the body Now the cause why the mind ceases to affirm this existence of the body cannot be the mind itself III iv nor again the fact that the body ceases to exist For by II vi the cause why the mind affirms the existence of the body is not that the body began to exist therefore for the same reason it does not cease to affirm the existence of the body because the body ceases to exist but II xvii this result follows from another idea which excludes the present existence of our body and consequently of our mind and which is therefore contrary to the idea constituting the essence of our mind PROP XII The mind as far as it can endeavours to conceive those things which increase or help the power of activity in the body Proof So long as the human body is affected in a mode which involves the nature of any external body the human mind will regard that external body as present II xvii and consequently II vii so long as the human mind regards an external body as present that is II xvii note conceives it the human body is affected in a mode which involves the nature of the said external body thus so long as the mind conceives things which increase or help the power of activity in our body the body is affected in modes which increase or help its power of activity III Post i consequently III xi the mind s power of thinking is for that period increased or helped Thus III vi ix the mind as far as it can endeavours to imagine such things Q E D PROP XIII When the mind conceives things which diminish or hinder the body s power of activity it endeavours as far as possible to remember things which exclude the existence of the first named things Proof So long as the mind conceives anything of the kind alluded to the power of the mind and body is diminished or constrained cf III xii Proof nevertheless it will continue to conceive it until the mind conceives something else which excludes the present existence thereof II xvii that is as I have just shown the power of the mind and of the body is diminished or constrained until the mind conceives something else which excludes the existence of the former thing conceived therefore the mind III ix as far as it can will endeavour to conceive or remember the latter Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that the mind shrinks from conceiving those things which diminish or constrain the power of itself and of the body Note From what has been said we may clearly understand the nature of Love and Hate Love is nothing else but pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause Hate is nothing else but pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause We further see that he who loves necessarily endeavours to have and to keep present to him the object of his love while he who hates endeavours to remove and destroy the object of his hatred But I will treat of these matters at more length hereafter PROP XIV If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at the same time it will whenever it is afterwards affected by one of these two be also affected by the other Proof If the human body has once been affected by two bodies at once whenever afterwards the mind conceives one of them it will straightway remember the other also II xviii But the mind s conceptions indicate rather the emotions of our body than the nature of external bodies II xvi Coroll ii therefore if the body and consequently the mind III Def iii has been once affected by two emotions at the same time it will whenever it is afterwards affected by one of the two be also affected by the other PROP XV Anything can accidentally be the cause of pleasure pain or desire Proof Let it be granted that the mind is simultaneously affected by two emotions of which one neither increases nor diminishes its power of activity and the other does either increase or diminish the said power III Post i From the foregoing proposition it is evident that whenever the mind is afterwards affected by the former through its true cause which by hypothesis neither increases nor diminishes its power of action it will be at the same time affected by the latter which does increase or diminish its power of activity that is III xi note it will be affected with pleasure or pain Thus the former of the two emotions will not through itself but accidentally be the cause of pleasure or pain In the same way also it can be easily shown that a thing may be accidentally the cause of desire Q E D Corollary Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing with the emotion of pleasure or pain though that thing be not the efficient cause of the emotion we can either love or hate it Proof For from this fact alone it arises III xiv that the mind afterwards conceiving the said thing is affected with the emotion of pleasure or pain that is III xi note according as the power of the mind and body may be increased or diminished c and consequently III xii according as the mind may desire or shrink from the conception of it III xiii Coroll in other words III xiii note according as it may love or hate the same Q E D Note Hence we understand how it may happen that we love or hate a thing without any cause for our emotion being known to us merely as a phrase is from sympathy or antipathy We should refer to the same category those objects which affect us pleasurably or painfully simply because they resemble other objects which affect us in the same way This I will show in the next Prop I am aware that certain authors who were the first to introduce these terms sympathy and antipathy wished to signify thereby some occult qualities in things nevertheless I think we may be permitted to use the same terms to indicate known or manifest qualities PROP XVI Simply from the fact that we conceive that a given object has some point of resemblance with another object which is wont to affect the mind pleasurably or painfully although the point of resemblance be not the efficient cause of the said emotions we shall still regard the first named object with love or hate Proof The point of resemblance was in the object by hypothesis when we regarded it with pleasure or pain thus III xiv when the mind is affected by the image thereof it will straightway be affected by one or the other emotion and consequently the thing which we perceive to have the same point of resemblance will be accidentally III xv a cause of pleasure or pain Thus by the foregoing Corollary although the point in which the two objects resemble one another be not the efficient cause of the emotion we shall still regard the first named object with love or hate Q E D PROP XVII If we conceive that a thing which is wont to affect us painfully has any point of resemblance with another thing which is wont to affect us with an equally strong emotion of pleasure we shall hate the first named thing and at the same time we shall love it Proof The given thing is by hypothesis in itself a cause of pain and III xiii note in so far as we imagine it with this emotion we shall hate it further inasmuch as we conceive that it has some point of resemblance to something else which is wont to affect us with an equally strong emotion of pleasure we shall with an equally strong impulse of pleasure love it III xvi thus we shall both hate and love the same thing Q E D Note This disposition of the mind which arises from two contrary emotions is called vacillation it stands to the emotions in the same relation as doubt does to the imagination II xliv note vacillation and doubt do not differ one from the other except as greater differs from less But we must bear in mind that I have deduced this vacillation from causes which give rise through themselves to one of the emotions and to the other accidentally I have done this in order that they might be more easily deduced from what went before but I do not deny that vacillation of the disposition generally arises from an object which is the efficient cause of both emotions The human body is composed II Post i of a variety of individual parts of different nature and may therefore Ax i after Lemma iii after II xiii be affected in a variety of different ways by one and the same body and contrariwise as one and the same thing can be affected in many ways it can also in many different ways affect one and the same part of the body Hence we can easily conceive that one and the same object may be the cause of many and conflicting emotions PROP XVIII A man is as much affected pleasurably or painfully by the image of a thing past or future as by the image of a thing present Proof So long as a man is affected by the image of anything he will regard that thing as present even though it be non existent II xvii and Coroll he will not conceive it as past or future except in so far as its image is joined to the image of time past or future II xliv note Wherefore the image of a thing regarded in itself alone is identical whether it be referred to time past time future or time present that is II xvi Coroll the disposition or emotion of the body is identical whether the image be of a thing past future or present Thus the emotion of pleasure or pain is the same whether the image be of a thing past or future Q E D Note I I call a thing past or future according as we either have been or shall be affected thereby For instance according as we have seen it or are about to see it according as it has recreated us or will recreate us according as it has harmed us or will harm us For as we thus conceive it we affirm its existence that is the body is affected by no emotion which excludes the existence of the thing and therefore II xvii the body is affected by the image of the thing in the same way as if the thing were actually present However as it generally happens that those who have had many experiences vacillate so long as they regard a thing as future or past and are usually in doubt about its issue II xliv note it follows that the emotions which arise from similar images of things are not so constant but are generally disturbed by the images of other things until men become assured of the issue Note II From what has just been said we understand what is meant by the terms Hope Fear Confidence Despair Joy and Disappointment five Hope is nothing else but an inconstant pleasure arising from the image of something future or past whereof we do not yet know the issue Fear on the other hand is an inconstant pain also arising from the image of something concerning which we are in doubt If the element of doubt be removed from these emotions hope becomes Confidence and fear becomes Despair In other words Pleasure or Pain arising from the image of something concerning which we have hoped or feared Again Joy is Pleasure arising from the image of something past whereof we have doubted the issue Disappointment is the Pain opposed to Joy five Conscientiae morsus thus rendered by mister Pollock PROP XIX He who conceives that the object of his love is destroyed will feel pain if he conceives that it is preserved he will feel pleasure Proof The mind as far as possible endeavours to conceive those things which increase or help the body s power of activity III xii in other words III xii note those things which it loves But conception is helped by those things which postulate the existence of a thing and contrariwise is hindered by those which exclude the existence of a thing II xvii therefore the images of things which postulate the existence of an object of love help the mind s endeavour to conceive the object of love in other words III xi note affect the mind pleasurably contrariwise those things which exclude the existence of an object of love hinder the aforesaid mental endeavour in other words affect the mind painfully He therefore who conceives that the object of his love is destroyed will feel pain c Q E D PROP XX He who conceives that the object of his hate is destroyed will also feel pleasure Proof The mind III xiii endeavours to conceive those things which exclude the existence of things whereby the body s power of activity is diminished or constrained that is III xiii note it endeavours to conceive such things as exclude the existence of what it hates therefore the image of a thing which excludes the existence of what the mind hates helps the aforesaid mental effort in other words III xi note affects the mind pleasurably Thus he who conceives that the object of his hate is destroyed will feel pleasure Q E D PROP XXI He who conceives that the object of his love is affected pleasurably or painfully will himself be affected pleasurably or painfully and the one or the other emotion will be greater or less in the lover according as it is greater or less in the thing loved Proof The images of things as we showed in III xix which postulate the existence of the object of love help the mind s endeavour to conceive the said object But pleasure postulates the existence of something feeling pleasure so much the more in proportion as the emotion of pleasure is greater for it is III xi note a transition to a greater perfection therefore the image of pleasure in the object of love helps the mental endeavour of the lover that is it affects the lover pleasurably and so much the more in proportion as this emotion may have been greater in the object of love This was our first point Further in so far as a thing is affected with pain it is to that extent destroyed the extent being in proportion to the amount of pain III xi note therefore III xix he who conceives that the object of his love is affected painfully will himself be affected painfully in proportion as the said emotion is greater or less in the object of love Q E D PROP XXII If we conceive that anything pleasurably affects some object of our love we shall be affected with love towards that thing Contrariwise if we conceive that it affects an object of our love painfully we shall be affected with hatred towards it Proof He who affects pleasurably or painfully the object of our love affects us also pleasurably or painfully that is if we conceive the loved object as affected with the said pleasure or pain III xxi But this pleasure or pain is postulated to come to us accompanied by the idea of an external cause therefore III xiii note if we conceive that anyone affects an object of our love pleasurably or painfully we shall be affected with love or hatred towards him Q E D Note Prop xxi explains to us the nature of Pity which we may define as pain arising from another s hurt What term we can use for pleasure arising from another s gain I know not We will call the love towards him who confers a benefit on another Approval and the hatred towards him who injures another we will call Indignation We must further remark that we not only feel pity for a thing which we have loved as shown in III xxi but also for a thing which we have hitherto regarded without emotion provided that we deem that it resembles ourselves as I will show presently Thus we bestow approval on one who has benefited anything resembling ourselves and contrariwise are indignant with him who has done it an injury PROP XXIII He who conceives that an object of his hatred is painfully affected will feel pleasure Contrariwise if he thinks that the said object is pleasurably affected he will feel pain Each of these emotions will be greater or less according as its contrary is greater or less in the object of hatred Proof In so far as an object of hatred is painfully affected it is destroyed to an extent proportioned to the strength of the pain III xi note Therefore he III xx who conceives that some object of his hatred is painfully affected will feel pleasure to an extent proportioned to the amount of pain he conceives in the object of his hatred This was our first point Again pleasure postulates the existence of the pleasurably affected thing III xi note in proportion as the pleasure is greater or less If anyone imagines that an object of his hatred is pleasurably affected this conception III xiii will hinder his own endeavour to persist in other words III xi note he who hates will be painfully affected Q E D Note This pleasure can scarcely be felt unalloyed and without any mental conflict For as I am about to show in Prop xxvii in so far as a man conceives that something similar to himself is affected by pain he will himself be affected in like manner and he will have the contrary emotion in contrary circumstances But here we are regarding hatred only PROP XXIV If we conceive that anyone pleasurably affects an object of our hate we shall feel hatred towards him also If we conceive that he painfully affects that said object we shall feel love towards him Proof This proposition is proved in the same way as III xxii which see Note These and similar emotions of hatred are attributable to envy which accordingly is nothing else but hatred in so far as it is regarded as disposing a man to rejoice in another s hurt and to grieve at another s advantage PROP XXV We endeavour to affirm concerning ourselves and concerning what we love everything that we can conceive to affect pleasurably ourselves or the loved object Contrariwise we endeavour to negative everything which we conceive to affect painfully ourselves or the loved object Proof That which we conceive to affect an object of our love pleasurably or painfully affects us also pleasurably or painfully III xxi But the mind III xii endeavours as far as possible to conceive those things which affect us pleasurably in other words II xvii and Coroll it endeavours to regard them as present And contrariwise III xiii it endeavours to exclude the existence of such things as affect us painfully therefore we endeavour to affirm concerning ourselves and concerning the loved object whatever we conceive to affect ourselves or the love object pleasurably Q E D PROP XXVI We endeavour to affirm concerning that which we hate everything which we conceive to affect it painfully and contrariwise we endeavour to deny concerning it everything which we conceive to affect it pleasurably Proof This proposition follows from III xxiii as the foregoing proposition followed from III xxi Note Thus we see that it may readily happen that a man may easily think too highly of himself or a loved object and contrariwise too meanly of a hated object This feeling is called pride in reference to the man who thinks too highly of himself and is a species of madness wherein a man dreams with his eyes open thinking that he can accomplish all things that fall within the scope of his conception and thereupon accounting them real and exulting in them so long as he is unable to conceive anything which excludes their existence and determines his own power of action Pride therefore is pleasure springing from a man thinking too highly of himself Again the pleasure which arises from a man thinking too highly of another is called over esteem Whereas the pleasure which arises from thinking too little of a man is called disdain PROP XXVII By the very fact that we conceive a thing which is like ourselves and which we have not regarded with any emotion to be affected with any emotion we are ourselves affected with a like emotion affectus Proof The images of things are modifications of the human body whereof the ideas represent external bodies as present to us II xvii in other words II x whereof the ideas involve the nature of our body and at the same time the nature of the external bodies as present If therefore the nature of the external body be similar to the nature of our body then the idea which we form of the external body will involve a modification of our own body similar to the modification of the external body Consequently if we conceive anyone similar to ourselves as affected by any emotion this conception will express a modification of our body similar to that emotion Thus from the fact of conceiving a thing like ourselves to be affected with any emotion we are ourselves affected with a like emotion If however we hate the said thing like ourselves we shall to that extent be affected by a contrary and not similar emotion Q E D Note I This imitation of emotions when it is referred to pain is called compassion cf III xxii note when it is referred to desire it is called emulation which is nothing else but the desire of anything engendered in us by the fact that we conceive that others have the like desire Corollary I If we conceive that anyone whom we have hitherto regarded with no emotion pleasurably affects something similar to ourselves we shall be affected with love towards him If on the other hand we conceive that he painfully affects the same we shall be affected with hatred towards him Proof This is proved from the last proposition in the same manner as III xxii is proved from III xxi Corollary II We cannot hate a thing which we pity because its misery affects us painfully Proof If we could hate it for this reason we should rejoice in its pain which is contrary to the hypothesis Corollary III We seek to free from misery as far as we can a thing which we pity Proof That which painfully affects the object of our pity affects us also with similar pain by the foregoing proposition therefore we shall endeavour to recall everything which removes its existence or which destroys it cf III xiii in other words III ix note we shall desire to destroy it or we shall be determined for its destruction thus we shall endeavour to free from misery a thing which we pity Q E D Note II This will or appetite for doing good which arises from pity of the thing whereon we would confer a benefit is called benevolence and is nothing else but desire arising from compassion Concerning love or hate towards him who has done good or harm to something which we conceive to be like ourselves see III xxii note PROP XXVIII We endeavour to bring about whatsoever we conceive to conduce to pleasure but we endeavour to remove or destroy whatsoever we conceive to be truly repugnant thereto or to conduce to pain Proof We endeavour as far as possible to conceive that which we imagine to conduce to pleasure III xii in other words II xvii we shall endeavour to conceive it as far as possible as present or actually existing But the endeavour of the mind or the mind s power of thought is equal to and simultaneous with the endeavour of the body or the body s power of action This is clear from II vii Coroll and II xi Coroll Therefore we make an absolute endeavour for its existence in other words which by III ix note come to the same thing we desire and strive for it this was our first point Again if we conceive that something which we believed to be the cause of pain that is III xiii note which we hate is destroyed we shall rejoice III xx We shall therefore by the first part of this proof endeavour to destroy the same or III xiii to remove it from us so that we may not regard it as present this was our second point Wherefore whatsoever conduces to pleasure c Q E D PROP XXIX We shall also endeavour to do whatsoever we conceive men six to regard with pleasure and contrariwise we shall shrink from doing that which we conceive men to shrink from six By men in this and the following propositions I mean men whom we regard without any particular emotion Proof From the fact of imagining that men love or hate anything we shall love or hate the same thing III xxvii That is III xiii note from this mere fact we shall feel pleasure or pain at the thing s presence And so we shall endeavour to do whatsoever we conceive men to love or regard with pleasure et cetera Q E D Note This endeavour to do a thing or leave it undone solely in order to please men we call ambition especially when we so eagerly endeavour to please the vulgar that we do or omit certain things to our own or another s hurt in other cases it is generally called kindliness Furthermore I give the name of praise to the pleasure with which we conceive the action of another whereby he has endeavoured to please us but of blame to the pain wherewith we feel aversion to his action PROP XXX If anyone has done something which he conceives as affecting other men pleasurably he will be affected by pleasure accompanied by the idea of himself as cause in other words he will regard himself with pleasure On the other hand if he has done anything which he conceives as affecting others painfully he will regard himself with pain Proof He who conceives that he affects others with pleasure or pain will by that very fact himself be affected with pleasure or pain III xxvii but as a man II xix and xxiii is conscious of himself through the modifications whereby he is determined to action it follows that he who conceives that he affects others pleasurably will be affected with pleasure accompanied by the idea of himself as cause in other words he will regard himself with pleasure And so mutatis mutandis in the case of pain Q E D Note As love III xiii is pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause and hatred is pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause the pleasure and pain in question will be a species of love and hatred But as the terms love and hatred are used in reference to external objects we will employ other names for the emotions now under discussion pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause seven we will style Honour and the emotion contrary thereto we will style Shame I mean in such cases as where pleasure or pain arises from a man s belief that he is being praised or blamed otherwise pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause eight is called self complacency and its contrary pain is called repentance Again as it may happen II xvii Coroll that the pleasure wherewith a man conceives that he affects others may exist solely in his own imagination and as III xxv everyone endeavours to conceive concerning himself that which he conceives will affect him with pleasure it may easily come to pass that a vain man may be proud and may imagine that he is pleasing to all when in reality he may be an annoyance to all seven So Van Vloten and Bruder The Dutch version and Camerer read an internal cause Honor Gloria eight See previous endnote PROP XXXI If we conceive that anyone loves desires or hates anything which we ourselves love desire or hate we shall thereupon regard the thing in question with more steadfast love c On the contrary if we think that anyone shrinks from something that we love we shall undergo vacillations of soul Proof From the mere fact of conceiving that anyone loves anything we shall ourselves love that thing III xxvii but we are assumed to love it already there is therefore a new cause of love whereby our former emotion is fostered hence we shall thereupon love it more steadfastly Again from the mere fact of conceiving that anyone shrinks from anything we shall ourselves shrink from that thing III xxvii If we assume that we at the same time love it we shall then simultaneously love it and shrink from it in other words we shall be subject to vacillation III xvii note Q E D Corollary From the foregoing and also from III xxviii it follows that everyone endeavours as far as possible to cause others to love what he himself loves and to hate what he himself hates as the poet says As lovers let us share every hope and every fear ironhearted were he who should love what the other leaves nine nine Ovid Amores II xix forty five Spinoza transposes the verses Speremus pariter pariter metuamus amantes Ferreus est si quis quod sinit alter amat Note This endeavour to bring it about that our own likes and dislikes should meet with universal approval is really ambition see III xxix note wherefore we see that everyone by nature desires appetere that the rest of mankind should live according to his own individual disposition when such a desire is equally present in all everyone stands in everyone else s way and in wishing to be loved or praised by all all become mutually hateful PROP XXXII If we conceive that anyone takes delight in something which only one person can possess we shall endeavour to bring it about that the man in question shall not gain possession thereof Proof From the mere fact of our conceiving that another person takes delight in a thing III xxvii and Coroll we shall ourselves love that thing and desire to take delight therein But we assumed that the pleasure in question would be prevented by another s delight in its object we shall therefore endeavour to prevent his possession thereof III xxviii Q E D Note We thus see that man s nature is generally so constituted that he takes pity on those who fare ill and envies those who fare well with an amount of hatred proportioned to his own love for the goods in their possession Further we see that from the same property of human nature whence it follows that men are merciful it follows also that they are envious and ambitious Lastly if we make appeal to Experience we shall find that she entirely confirms what we have said more especially if we turn our attention to the first years of our life We find that children whose body is continually as it were in equilibrium laugh or cry simply because they see others laughing or crying moreover they desire forthwith to imitate whatever they see others doing and to possess themselves of whatever they conceive as delighting others inasmuch as the images of things are as we have said modifications of the human body or modes wherein the human body is affected and disposed by external causes to act in this or that manner PROP XXXIII When we love a thing similar to ourselves we endeavour as far as we can to bring about that it should love us in return Proof That which we love we endeavour as far as we can to conceive in preference to anything else III xii If the thing be similar to ourselves we shall endeavour to affect it pleasurably in preference to anything else III xxix In other words we shall endeavour as far as we can to bring it about that the thing should be affected with pleasure accompanied by the idea of ourselves that is III xiii note that it should love us in return Q E D PROP XXXIV The greater the emotion with which we conceive a loved object to be affected towards us the greater will be our complacency Proof We endeavour III xxxiii as far as we can to bring about that what we love should love us in return in other words that what we love should be affected with pleasure accompanied by the idea of ourself as cause Therefore in proportion as the loved object is more pleasurably affected because of us our endeavour will be assisted that is III xi and note the greater will be our pleasure But when we take pleasure in the fact that we pleasurably affect something similar to ourselves we regard ourselves with pleasure III thirty therefore the greater the emotion with which we conceive a loved object to be affected c Q E D PROP XXXV If anyone conceives that an object of his love joins itself to another with closer bonds of friendship than he himself has attained to he will be affected with hatred towards the loved object and with envy towards his rival Proof In proportion as a man thinks that a loved object is well affected towards him will be the strength of his self approval by the last Prop that is III xxx note of his pleasure he will therefore III xxviii endeavour as far as he can to imagine the loved object as most closely bound to him this endeavour or desire will be increased if he thinks that someone else has a similar desire III xxxi But this endeavour or desire is assumed to be checked by the image of the loved object in conjunction with the image of him whom the loved object has joined to itself therefore III xi note he will for that reason be affected with pain accompanied by the idea of the loved object as a cause in conjunction with the image of his rival that is he will be III xiii affected with hatred towards the loved object and also towards his rival III xv Coroll which latter he will envy as enjoying the beloved object Q E D Note This hatred towards an object of love joined with envy is called Jealousy which accordingly is nothing else but a wavering of the disposition arising from combined love and hatred accompanied by the idea of some rival who is envied Further this hatred towards the object of love will be greater in proportion to the pleasure which the jealous man had been wont to derive from the reciprocated love of the said object and also in proportion to the feelings he had previously entertained towards his rival If he had hated him he will forthwith hate the object of his love because he conceives it is pleasurably affected by one whom he himself hates and also because he is compelled to associate the image of his loved one with the image of him whom he hates This condition generally comes into play in the case of love for a woman for he who thinks that a woman whom he loves prostitutes herself to another will feel pain not only because his own desire is restrained but also because being compelled to associate the image of her he loves with the parts of shame and the excreta of another he therefore shrinks from her We must add that a jealous man is not greeted by his beloved with the same joyful countenance as before and this also gives him pain as a lover as I will now show PROP XXXVI He who remembers a thing in which he has once taken delight desires to possess it under the same circumstances as when he first took delight therein Proof Everything which a man has seen in conjunction with the object of his love will be to him accidentally a cause of pleasure III xv he will therefore desire to possess it in conjunction with that wherein he has taken delight in other words he will desire to possess the object of his love under the same circumstances as when he first took delight therein Q E D Corollary A lover will therefore feel pain if one of the aforesaid attendant circumstances be missing Proof For in so far as he finds some circumstance to be missing he conceives something which excludes its existence As he is assumed to be desirous for love s sake of that thing or circumstance by the last Prop he will in so far as he conceives it to be missing feel pain III xix Q E D Note This pain in so far as it has reference to the absence of the object of love is called Regret PROP XXXVII Desire arising through pain or pleasure hatred or love is greater in proportion as the emotion is greater Proof Pain diminishes or constrains a man s power of activity III xi note in other words III vii diminishes or constrains the effort wherewith he endeavours to persist in his own being therefore III v it is contrary to the said endeavour thus all the endeavours of a man affected by pain are directed to removing that pain But by the definition of pain in proportion as the pain is greater so also is it necessarily opposed to a greater part of man s power of activity therefore the greater the pain the greater the power of activity employed to remove it that is the greater will be the desire or appetite in endeavouring to remove it Again since pleasure III xi note increases or aids a man s power of activity it may easily be shown in like manner that a man affected by pleasure has no desire further than to preserve it and his desire will be in proportion to the magnitude of the pleasure Lastly since hatred and love are themselves emotions of pain and pleasure it follows in like manner that the endeavour appetite or desire which arises through hatred or love will be greater in proportion to the hatred or love Q E D PROP XXXVIII If a man has begun to hate an object of his love so that love is thoroughly destroyed he will causes being equal regard it with more hatred than if he had never loved it and his hatred will be in proportion to the strength of his former love Proof If a man begins to hate that which he had loved more of his appetites are put under restraint than if he had never loved it For love is a pleasure III xiii note which a man endeavours as far as he can to render permanent III xxviii he does so by regarding the object of his love as present and by affecting it as far as he can pleasurably this endeavour is greater in proportion as the love is greater and so also is the endeavour to bring about that the beloved should return his affection III xxxiii Now these endeavours are constrained by hatred towards the object of love III xiii Coroll and III xxiii wherefore the lover III xi note will for this cause also be affected with pain the more so in proportion as his love has been greater that is in addition to the pain caused by hatred there is a pain caused by the fact that he has loved the object wherefore the lover will regard the beloved with greater pain or in other words will hate it more than if he had never loved it and with the more intensity in proportion as his former love was greater Q E D PROP XXXIX He who hates anyone will endeavour to do him an injury unless he fears that a greater injury will thereby accrue to himself on the other hand he who loves anyone will by the same law seek to benefit him Proof To hate a man is III xiii note to conceive him as a cause of pain therefore he who hates a man will endeavour to remove or destroy him But if anything more painful or in other words a greater evil should accrue to the hater thereby and if the hater thinks he can avoid such evil by not carrying out the injury which he planned against the object of his hate he will desire to abstain from inflicting that injury III xxviii and the strength of his endeavour III xxxvii will be greater than his former endeavour to do injury and will therefore prevail over it as we asserted The second part of this proof proceeds in the same manner Wherefore he who hates another et cetera Q E D Note By good I here mean every kind of pleasure and all that conduces thereto especially that which satisfies our longings whatsoever they may be By evil I mean every kind of pain especially that which frustrates our longings For I have shown III ix note that we in no case desire a thing because we deem it good but contrariwise we deem a thing good because we desire it consequently we deem evil that which we shrink from everyone therefore according to his particular emotions judges or estimates what is good what is bad what is better what is worse lastly what is best and what is worst Thus a miser thinks that abundance of money is the best and want of money the worst an ambitious man desires nothing so much as glory and fears nothing so much as shame To an envious man nothing is more delightful than another s misfortune and nothing more painful than another s success So every man according to his emotions judges a thing to be good or bad useful or useless The emotion which induces a man to turn from that which he wishes or to wish for that which he turns from is called timidity which may accordingly be defined as the fear whereby a man is induced to avoid an evil which he regards as future by encountering a lesser evil III xxviii But if the evil which he fears be shame timidity becomes bashfulness Lastly if the desire to avoid a future evil be checked by the fear of another evil so that the man knows not which to choose fear becomes consternation especially if both the evils feared be very great PROP XL He who conceives himself to be hated by another and believes that he has given him no cause for hatred will hate that other in return Proof He who conceives another as affected with hatred will thereupon be affected himself with hatred III xxvii that is with pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause But by the hypothesis he conceives no cause for this pain except him who is his enemy therefore from conceiving that he is hated by some one he will be affected with pain accompanied by the idea of his enemy in other words he will hate his enemy in return Q E D Note He who thinks that he has given just cause for hatred will III xxx and note be affected with shame but this case III xxv rarely happens This reciprocation of hatred may also arise from the hatred which follows an endeavour to injure the object of our hate III xxxix He therefore who conceives that he is hated by another will conceive his enemy as the cause of some evil or pain thus he will be affected with pain or fear accompanied by the idea of his enemy as cause in other words he will be affected with hatred towards his enemy as I said above Corollary I He who conceives that one whom he loves hates him will be a prey to conflicting hatred and love For in so far as he conceives that he is an object of hatred he is determined to hate his enemy in return But by the hypothesis he nevertheless loves him wherefore he will be a prey to conflicting hatred and love Corollary II If a man conceives that one whom he has hitherto regarded without emotion has done him any injury from motives of hatred he will forthwith seek to repay the injury in kind Proof He who conceives that another hates him will by the last proposition hate his enemy in return and III xxvi will endeavour to recall everything which can affect him painfully he will moreover endeavour to do him an injury III xxxix Now the first thing of this sort which he conceives is the injury done to himself he will therefore forthwith endeavour to repay it in kind Q E D Note The endeavour to injure one whom we hate is called Anger the endeavour to repay in kind injury done to ourselves is called Revenge PROP XLI If anyone conceives that he is loved by another and believes that he has given no cause for such love he will love that other in return Cf III xv Coroll and III xvi Proof This proposition is proved in the same way as the preceding one See also the note appended thereto Note If he believes that he has given just cause for the love he will take pride therein III xxx and note this is what most often happens III xxv and we said that its contrary took place whenever a man conceives himself to be hated by another See note to preceding proposition This reciprocal love and consequently the desire of benefiting him who loves us III xxxix and who endeavours to benefit us is called gratitude or thankfulness It thus appears that men are much more prone to take vengeance than to return benefits Corollary He who imagines that he is loved by one whom he hates will be a prey to conflicting hatred and love This is proved in the same way as the first corollary of the preceding proposition Note If hatred be the prevailing emotion he will endeavour to injure him who loves him this emotion is called cruelty especially if the victim be believed to have given no ordinary cause for hatred PROP XLII He who has conferred a benefit on anyone from motives of love or honour will feel pain if he sees that the benefit is received without gratitude Proof When a man loves something similar to himself he endeavours as far as he can to bring it about that he should be loved thereby in return III xxxiii Therefore he who has conferred a benefit confers it in obedience to the desire which he feels of being loved in return that is III xxxiv from the hope of honour or III xxx note pleasure hence he will endeavour as far as he can to conceive this cause of honour or to regard it as actually existing But by the hypothesis he conceives something else which excludes the existence of the said cause of honour wherefore he will thereat feel pain III xix Q E D PROP XLIII Hatred is increased by being reciprocated and can on the other hand be destroyed by love Proof He who conceives that an object of his hatred hates him in return will thereupon feel a new hatred while the former hatred by hypothesis still remains III xl But if on the other hand he conceives that the object of hate loves him he will to this extent III xxxviii regard himself with pleasure and III xxix will endeavour to please the cause of his emotion In other words he will endeavour not to hate him III xli and not to affect him painfully this endeavour III xxxvii will be greater or less in proportion to the emotion from which it arises Therefore if it be greater than that which arises from hatred and through which the man endeavours to affect painfully the thing which he hates it will get the better of it and banish the hatred from his mind Q E D PROP XLIV Hatred which is completely vanquished by love passes into love and love is thereupon greater than if hatred had not preceded it Proof The proof proceeds in the same way as Prop xxxviii of this Part for he who begins to love a thing which he was wont to hate or regard with pain from the very fact of loving feels pleasure To this pleasure involved in love is added the pleasure arising from aid given to the endeavour to remove the pain involved in hatred III xxxvii accompanied by the idea of the former object of hatred as cause Note Though this be so no one will endeavour to hate anything or to be affected with pain for the sake of enjoying this greater pleasure that is no one will desire that he should be injured in the hope of recovering from the injury nor long to be ill for the sake of getting well For everyone will always endeavour to persist in his being and to ward off pain as far as he can If the contrary is conceivable namely that a man should desire to hate someone in order that he might love him the more thereafter he will always desire to hate him For the strength of love is in proportion to the strength of the hatred wherefore the man would desire that the hatred be continually increased more and more and for a similar reason he would desire to become more and more ill in order that he might take a greater pleasure in being restored to health in such a case he would always endeavour to be ill which III vi is absurd PROP XLV If a man conceives that anyone similar to himself hates anything also similar to himself which he loves he will hate that person Proof The beloved object feels reciprocal hatred towards him who hates it III xl therefore the lover in conceiving that anyone hates the beloved object conceives the beloved thing as affected by hatred in other words III xiii by pain consequently he is himself affected by pain accompanied by the idea of the hater of the beloved thing as cause that is he will hate him who hates anything which he himself loves III xiii note Q E D PROP XLVI 
3630_24758_000002_000001	train-clean-360	If a man has been affected pleasurably or painfully by anyone of a class or nation different from his own and if the pleasure or pain has been accompanied by the idea of the said stranger as cause under the general category of the class or nation the man will feel love or hatred not only to the individual stranger but also to the whole class or nation whereto he belongs 
none	none	Proof This is evident from III xvi PROP XLVII 
3630_24758_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Joy arising from the fact that anything we hate is destroyed or suffers other injury is never unaccompanied by a certain pain in us 
none	none	Proof This is evident from III xxvii 
3630_24758_000005_000001	train-clean-360	For in so far as we conceive a thing similar to ourselves to be affected with pain we ourselves feel pain 
none	none	Note This proposition can also be proved from the Corollary to II xvii Whenever we remember anything even if it does not actually exist we regard it only as present and the body is affected in the same manner wherefore in so far as the remembrance of the thing is strong a man is determined to regard it with pain this determination while the image of the thing in question lasts is indeed checked by the remembrance of other things excluding the existence of the aforesaid thing but is not destroyed hence a man only feels pleasure in so far as the said determination is checked for this reason the joy arising from the injury done to what we hate is repeated every time we remember that object of hatred 
3630_24758_000006_000002	train-clean-360	For as we have said when the image of the thing in question is aroused inasmuch as it involves the thing s existence it determines the man to regard the thing with the same pain as he was wont to do when it actually did exist 
3630_24758_000006_000003	train-clean-360	However since he has joined to the image of the thing other images which exclude its existence this determination to pain is forthwith checked and the man rejoices afresh as often as the repetition takes place 
3630_24758_000006_000004	train-clean-360	This is the cause of men s pleasure in recalling past evils and delight in narrating dangers from which they have escaped 
3630_24758_000006_000005	train-clean-360	For when men conceive a danger they conceive it as still future and are determined to fear it this determination is checked afresh by the idea of freedom which became associated with the idea of the danger when they escaped therefrom this renders them secure afresh therefore they rejoice afresh 
none	none	PROP XLVIII 
3630_24758_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Love or hatred towards for instance Peter is destroyed if the pleasure involved in the former or the pain involved in the latter emotion be associated with the idea of another cause and will be diminished in proportion as we conceive Peter not to have been the sole cause of either emotion 
none	none	Proof This Prop is evident from the mere definition of love and hatred III xiii note 
3630_24758_000008_000002	train-clean-360	For pleasure is called love towards Peter and pain is called hatred towards Peter simply in so far as Peter is regarded as the cause of one emotion or the other 
3630_24758_000008_000003	train-clean-360	When this condition of causality is either wholly or partly removed the emotion towards Peter also wholly or in part vanishes

3630_24758_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Love or hatred towards a thing which we conceive to be free must other conditions being similar be greater than if it were felt towards a thing acting by necessity 
none	none	Proof A thing which we conceive as free must I Def vii be perceived through itself without anything else If therefore we conceive it as the cause of pleasure or pain we shall therefore III xiii 
3630_24758_000010_000003	train-clean-360	note love it or hate it and shall do so with the utmost love or hatred that can arise from the given emotion 
none	none	But if the thing which causes the emotion be conceived as acting by necessity we shall then by the same Def vii 
3630_24758_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Part I conceive it not as the sole cause but as one of the causes of the emotion and therefore our love or hatred towards it will be less 
none	none	Q E D Note Hence it follows that men thinking themselves to be free feel more love or hatred towards one another than towards anything else to this consideration we must add the imitation of emotions treated of in III xxvii xxxiv xl and xliii PROP L Anything whatever can be accidentally a cause of hope or fear Proof This proposition is proved in the same way as III xv which see together with the note to III xviii 
3630_24758_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Note Things which are accidentally the causes of hope or fear are called good or evil omens 
none	none	Now in so far as such omens are the cause of hope or fear they are by the definitions of hope and fear given in III xviii note the causes also of pleasure and pain consequently we to this extent regard them with love or hatred and endeavour either to invoke them as means towards that which we hope for or to remove them as obstacles or causes of that which we fear It follows further from III xxv that we are naturally so constituted as to believe readily in that which we hope for and with difficulty in that which we fear moreover we are apt to estimate such objects above or below their true value Hence there have arisen superstitions whereby men are everywhere assailed 
3630_24758_000014_000005	train-clean-360	However I do not think it worth while to point out here the vacillations springing from hope and fear it follows from the definition of these emotions that there can be no hope without fear and no fear without hope as I will duly explain in the proper place 
none	none	Further in so far as we hope for or fear anything we regard it with love or hatred thus everyone can apply by himself to hope and fear what we have said concerning love and hatred PROP LI Different men may be differently affected by the same object and the same man may be differently affected at different times by the same object Proof The human body is affected by external bodies in a variety of ways II Post iii Two men may therefore be differently affected at the same time and therefore by Ax i after Lemma iii after II xiii may be differently affected by one and the same object Further by the same Post the human body can be affected sometimes in one way sometimes in another consequently by the same Axiom it may be differently affected at different times by one and the same object Q E D Note We thus see that it is possible that what one man loves another may hate and that what one man fears another may not fear or again that one and the same man may love what he once hated or may be bold where he once was timid and so on Again as everyone judges according to his emotions what is good what bad what better and what worse III xxxix note it follows that men s judgments may vary no less than their emotions ten hence when we compare some with others we distinguish them solely by the diversity of their emotions and style some intrepid others timid others by some other epithet For instance I shall call a man intrepid if he despises an evil which I am accustomed to fear if I further take into consideration that in his desire to injure his enemies and to benefit those whom he loves he is not restrained by the fear of an evil which is sufficient to restrain me I shall call him daring Again a man will appear timid to me if he fears an evil which I am accustomed to despise and if I further take into consideration that his desire is restrained by the fear of an evil which is not sufficient to restrain me I shall say that he is cowardly and in like manner will everyone pass judgment ten This is possible though the human mind is part of the divine intellect as I have shown in II xiii note Lastly from this inconstancy in the nature of human judgment inasmuch as a man often judges things solely by his emotions and inasmuch as the things which he believes cause pleasure or pain and therefore endeavours to promote or prevent are often purely imaginary not to speak of the uncertainty of things alluded to in III xxviii we may readily conceive that a man may be at one time affected with pleasure and at another with pain accompanied by the idea of himself as cause Thus we can easily understand what are Repentance and Self complacency Repentance is pain accompanied by the idea of one s self as cause Self complacency is pleasure accompanied by the idea of one s self as cause and these emotions are most intense because men believe themselves to be free III xlix PROP LII An object which we have formerly seen in conjunction with others and which we do not conceive to have any property that is not common to many will not be regarded by us for so long as an object which we conceive to have some property peculiar to itself Proof As soon as we conceive an object which we have seen in conjunction with others we at once remember those others II xviii and note and thus we pass forthwith from the contemplation of one object to the contemplation of another object And this is the case with the object which we conceive to have no property that is not common to many For we thereupon assume that we are regarding therein nothing which we have not before seen in conjunction with other objects But when we suppose that we conceive an object something special which we have never seen before we must needs say that the mind while regarding that object has in itself nothing which it can fall to regarding instead thereof therefore it is determined to the contemplation of that object only Therefore an object c Q E D Note This mental modification or imagination of a particular thing in so far as it is alone in the mind is called Wonder but if it be excited by an object of fear it is called Consternation because wonder at an evil keeps a man so engrossed in the simple contemplation thereof that he has no power to think of anything else whereby he might avoid the evil If however the object of wonder be a man s prudence industry or anything of that sort inasmuch as the said man is thereby regarded as far surpassing ourselves wonder is called Veneration otherwise if a man s anger envy c be what we wonder at the emotion is called Horror Again if it be the prudence industry or what not of a man we love that we wonder at our love will on this account be the greater III xii and when joined to wonder or veneration is called Devotion We may in like manner conceive hatred hope confidence and the other emotions as associated with wonder and we should thus be able to deduce more emotions than those which have obtained names in ordinary speech Whence it is evident that the names of the emotions have been applied in accordance rather with their ordinary manifestations than with an accurate knowledge of their nature To wonder is opposed Contempt which generally arises from the fact that because we see someone wondering at loving or fearing something or because something at first sight appears to be like things which we ourselves wonder at love fear c we are in consequence III xv Coroll and III xxvii determined to wonder at love or fear that thing But if from the presence or more accurate contemplation of the said thing we are compelled to deny concerning it all that can be the cause of wonder love fear c the mind then by the presence of the thing remains determined to think rather of those qualities which are not in it than of those which are in it whereas on the other hand the presence of the object would cause it more particularly to regard that which is therein As devotion springs from wonder at a thing which we love so does Derision spring from contempt of a thing which we hate or fear and Scorn from contempt of folly as veneration from wonder at prudence Lastly we can conceive the emotions of love hope honour c in association with contempt and can thence deduce other emotions which are not distinguished one from another by any recognized name PROP LIII When the mind regards itself and its own power of activity it feels pleasure and that pleasure is greater in proportion to the distinctness wherewith it conceives itself and its own power of activity Proof A man does not know himself except through the modifications of his body and the ideas thereof II xix and xxiii When therefore the mind is able to contemplate itself it is thereby assumed to pass to a greater perfection or III xi note to feel pleasure and the pleasure will be greater in proportion to the distinctness wherewith it is able to conceive itself and its own power of activity Q E D Corollary This pleasure is fostered more and more in proportion as a man conceives himself to be praised by others For the more he conceives himself as praised by others the more he will imagine them to be affected with pleasure accompanied by the idea of himself III xxix note thus he is III xxvii himself affected with greater pleasure accompanied by the idea of himself Q E D PROP LIV The mind endeavours to conceive only such things as assert its power of activity Proof The endeavour or power of the mind is the actual essence thereof III vii but the essence of the mind obviously only affirms that which the mind is and can do not that which it neither is nor can do therefore the mind endeavours to conceive only such things as assert or affirm its power of activity Q E D PROP LV When the mind contemplates its own weakness it feels pain thereat Proof The essence of the mind only affirms that which the mind is or can do in other words it is the mind s nature to conceive only such things as assert its power of activity last Prop Thus when we say that the mind contemplates its own weakness we are merely saying that while the mind is attempting to conceive something which asserts its power of activity it is checked in its endeavour in other words III xi note it feels pain Q E D Corollary This pain is more and more fostered if a man conceives that he is blamed by others this may be proved in the same way as the corollary to III liii Note This pain accompanied by the idea of our own weakness is called humility the pleasure which springs from the contemplation of ourselves is called self love or self complacency And inasmuch as this feeling is renewed as often as a man contemplates his own virtues or his own power of activity it follows that everyone is fond of narrating his own exploits and displaying the force both of his body and mind and also that for this reason men are troublesome to one another Again it follows that men are naturally envious III xxiv note and III xxxii note rejoicing in the shortcomings of their equals and feeling pain at their virtues For whenever a man conceives his own actions he is affected with pleasure III liii in proportion as his actions display more perfection and he conceives them more distinctly that is II xl note in proportion as he can distinguish them from others and regard them as something special Therefore a man will take most pleasure in contemplating himself when he contemplates some quality which he denies to others But if that which he affirms of himself be attributable to the idea of man or animals in general he will not be so greatly pleased he will on the contrary feel pain if he conceives that his own actions fall short when compared with those of others This pain III xxviii he will endeavour to remove by putting a wrong construction on the actions of his equals or by as far as he can embellishing his own It is thus apparent that men are naturally prone to hatred and envy which latter is fostered by their education For parents are accustomed to incite their children to virtue solely by the spur of honour and envy But perhaps some will scruple to assent to what I have said because we not seldom admire men s virtues and venerate their possessors In order to remove such doubts I append the following corollary Corollary No one envies the virtue of anyone who is not his equal Proof Envy is a species of hatred III xxiv note or III xiii note pain that is III xi note a modification whereby a man s power of activity or endeavour towards activity is checked But a man does not endeavour or desire to do anything which cannot follow from his nature as it is given therefore a man will not desire any power of activity or virtue which is the same thing to be attributed to him that is appropriate to another s nature and foreign to his own hence his desire cannot be checked nor he himself pained by the contemplation of virtue in some one unlike himself consequently he cannot envy such an one But he can envy his equal who is assumed to have the same nature as himself Q E D Note When therefore as we said in the note to III lii we venerate a man through wonder at his prudence fortitude c we do so because we conceive those qualities to be peculiar to him and not as common to our nature we therefore no more envy their possessor than we envy trees for being tall or lions for being courageous PROP LVI There are as many kinds of pleasure of pain of desire and of every emotion compounded of these such as vacillations of spirit or derived from these such as love hatred hope fear c as there are kinds of objects whereby we are affected Proof Pleasure and pain and consequently the emotions compounded thereof or derived therefrom are passions or passive states III xi note 
5248-24760-0000	train-other-500	now we are necessarily passive
none	none	 III i 
5248-24760-0001	train-other-500	in so far as we have inadequate ideas and only in so far as we have such ideas are we passive
none	none	 III iii that is we are only necessarily passive II xl note in so far as we conceive or II xvii and note in so far as we are affected by an emotion which involves the nature of our own body and the nature of an external body Wherefore the nature of every passive state must necessarily be so explained that the nature of the object whereby we are affected be expressed 
5248-24760-0002	train-other-500	Namely the pleasure which arises from say the object A involves the nature of that object A and the pleasure which arises from the object B involves the nature of the object B
5248-24760-0003	train-other-500	wherefore these two pleasurable emotions are by nature different
none	none	 inasmuch as the causes whence they arise are by nature different 
5248-24760-0004	train-other-500	So again the emotion of pain which arises from one object is by nature different from the pain arising from another object and similarly in the case of love hatred hope fear vacillation
none	none	 c Thus there are necessarily as many kinds of pleasure pain love hatred c as there are kinds of objects whereby we are affected 
5248-24760-0005	train-other-500	Now desire is each man s essence or nature in so far as it is conceived as determined to a particular action by any given modification of itself
none	none	 III ix note therefore according as a man is affected through external causes by this or that kind of pleasure pain love hatred c in other words 
5248-24760-0006	train-other-500	according as his nature is disposed in this or that manner so will his desire be of one kind or another
none	none	 and the nature of one desire must necessarily differ 
5248-24760-0007	train-other-500	from the nature of another desire as widely as the emotions differ wherefrom each desire arose Thus there are as many kinds of desire as there are kinds of pleasure pain
none	none	 love c consequently by what has been shown there are as many kinds of desire as there are kinds of objects whereby we are affected Q E D Note Among the kinds of emotions which by the last proposition must be very numerous the chief are luxury drunkenness lust avarice and ambition being merely species of love or desire 
5248-24760-0008	train-other-500	displaying the nature of those emotions in a manner varying according to the object with which they are concerned
none	none	 For by luxury drunkenness lust avarice ambition c we simply mean the immoderate love of feasting drinking venery riches and fame Furthermore these emotions in so far as we distinguish them from others merely by the objects wherewith they are concerned have no contraries For temperance sobriety and chastity 
5248-24760-0009	train-other-500	which we are wont to oppose to luxury drunkenness and lust are not emotions or passive states
none	none	 but indicate a power of the mind which moderates the last named emotions However I cannot here explain the remaining kinds of emotions seeing that they are as numerous as the kinds of objects nor if I could would it be necessary It is sufficient for our purpose namely to determine the strength of the emotions and the mind s power over them to have a general definition of each emotion It is sufficient I repeat to understand the general properties of the emotions and the mind to enable us to determine the quality and extent of the mind s power in moderating and checking the emotions Thus though there is a great difference between various emotions of love hatred or desire for instance between love felt towards children and love felt towards a wife there is no need for us to take cognizance of such differences or to track out further the nature and origin of the emotions PROP LVII Any emotion of a given individual differs from the emotion of another individual only in so far as the essence of the one individual differs from the essence of the other Proof This proposition is evident from Ax i which see after Lemma iii Prop xiii Part II Nevertheless 
5248-24760-0010	train-other-500	we will prove it from the nature of the three primary emotions All emotions are attributable to desire pleasure or pain as their definitions above given show But desire is each man s nature or essence
none	none	 III ix note therefore desire in one individual differs from desire in another individual only in so far as the nature or essence of the one differs from the nature or essence of the other Again pleasure and pain are passive states or passions whereby every man s power or endeavour to persist in his being 
5248-24760-0011	train-other-500	is increased or diminished helped or hindered
none	none	 III xi and note But by the endeavour to persist in its being in so far as it is attributable to mind and body in conjunction we mean appetite and desire III ix note therefore 
5248-24760-0012	train-other-500	pleasure and pain are identical with desire or appetite in so far as by external causes they are increased or diminished helped or hindered in other words they are every man s nature
none	none	 wherefore the pleasure and pain felt by one man 
5248-24760-0013	train-other-500	differ from the pleasure and pain felt by another man only in so far as the nature or essence of the one man differs from the essence of the other consequently any emotion of one individual only differs
none	none	 c Q E D Note Hence it follows that the emotions of the animals which are called irrational for after learning the origin of mind we cannot doubt that brutes feel only differ from man s emotions to the extent that brute nature differs from human nature Horse and man are alike carried away by the desire of procreation but the desire of the former is equine the desire of the latter is human So also the lusts and appetites of insects fishes and birds must needs vary according to the several natures Thus although each individual lives content and rejoices in that nature belonging to him wherein he has his being yet the life wherein each is content and rejoices is nothing else but the idea or soul 
5248-24760-0014	train-other-500	of the said individual and hence the joy of one only differs in nature from the joy of another
none	none	 to the extent that the essence of one differs from the essence of another Lastly it follows from the foregoing proposition that there is no small difference between the joy which actuates say a drunkard and the joy possessed by a philosopher as I just mention here by the way 
5248-24760-0015	train-other-500	Thus far I have treated of the emotions attributable to man in so far as he is passive It remains to add a few words on those attributable to him in so far as he is active
none	none	 PROP LVIII 
5248-24760-0016	train-other-500	Besides pleasure and desire which are passivities or passions there are other emotions derived from pleasure and desire which are attributable to us in so far as we are active Proof
5248-24760-0017	train-other-500	When the mind conceives itself and its power of activity it feels pleasure
none	none	 III liii now 
5248-24760-0018	train-other-500	the mind necessarily contemplates itself
none	none	 when it conceives a true or adequate idea II xliii 
5248-24760-0019	train-other-500	But the mind does conceive certain adequate ideas
none	none	 II xl note two 
5248-24760-0020	train-other-500	Therefore it feels pleasure in so far as it conceives adequate ideas that is
none	none	 in so far as it is active III i Again the mind both in so far as it has clear and distinct ideas and in so far as it 
5248-24760-0021	train-other-500	has confused ideas endeavours to persist in its own being
none	none	 III ix but by such an endeavour we mean desire by the note to the same Prop 
5248-24760-0022	train-other-500	therefore desire is also attributable to us
none	none	 in so far as we understand or III i in so far as we are active Q E D PROP LIX Among all the emotions attributable to the mind as active there are none which cannot be referred to pleasure or desire Proof All emotions can be referred to desire pleasure or pain 
5248-24760-0023	train-other-500	as their definitions already given show Now by pain we mean that the mind s power of thinking is diminished or checked
none	none	 III xi and note therefore in so far as the mind feels pain its power of understanding that is of activity is diminished or checked III i 
5248-24760-0024	train-other-500	therefore no painful emotions can be attributed to the mind in virtue of its being active but only emotions of pleasure and desire which
none	none	 by the last Prop 
5248-24760-0025	train-other-500	are attributable to the mind in that condition
none	none	 Q E D Note All actions following from emotion 
5248-24760-0026	train-other-500	which are attributable to the mind in virtue of its understanding I set down to strength of character fortitudo which I divide into courage animositas and highmindedness generositas
5248-24760-0027	train-other-500	By courage I mean the desire whereby every man strives to preserve his own being in accordance solely with the dictates of reason By highmindedness I mean the desire whereby every man endeavours
5248-24760-0028	train-other-500	solely under the dictates of reason to aid other men and to unite them to himself in friendship Those actions therefore which have regard solely to the good of the agent I set down to courage those which aim at the good of others
5248-24760-0029	train-other-500	I set down to highmindedness Thus temperance sobriety and presence of mind in danger
none	none	 c are varieties of courage courtesy mercy c are varieties of highmindedness I think I have thus explained and displayed through their primary causes the principal emotions and vacillations of spirit which arise from the combination of the three primary emotions to wit desire pleasure and pain 
5248-24760-0030	train-other-500	It is evident from what I have said that we are in many ways driven about by external causes and that like waves of the sea driven by contrary winds we toss to and fro unwitting of the issue and of our fate But I have said
5248-24760-0031	train-other-500	that I have only set forth the chief conflicting emotions not all that might be given For by proceeding in the same way as above we can easily show that love is united to repentance scorn
none	none	 shame c I think everyone will agree from what has been said that the emotions may be compounded one with another in so many ways and so many variations may arise therefrom as to exceed all possibility of computation However for my purpose 
5248-24760-0032	train-other-500	it is enough to have enumerated the most important to reckon up the rest which I have omitted would be more curious than profitable It remains to remark
5248-24760-0033	train-other-500	concerning love that it very often happens that while we are enjoying a thing which we longed for the body from the act of enjoyment acquires a new disposition whereby it is determined in another way other images
none	none	 of things are aroused in it and the mind begins to conceive and desire something fresh For example when we conceive something which generally delights us with its flavour we desire to enjoy that is to eat it But whilst we are thus enjoying it the stomach is filled and the body is otherwise disposed 
5248-24760-0034	train-other-500	If therefore when the body is thus otherwise disposed the image of the food which is present be stimulated and consequently the endeavour or desire to eat it be stimulated also the new disposition of the body
none	none	 will feel repugnance to the desire or attempt and consequently the presence of the food which we formerly longed for will become odious This revulsion of feeling is called satiety or weariness For the rest I have neglected the outward modifications of the body observable in emotions such for instance as trembling pallor sobbing laughter c for these are attributable to the body only without any reference to the mind Lastly the definitions of the emotions require to be supplemented in a few points I will therefore repeat them interpolating such observations as I think should here and there be added DEFINITIONS OF THE EMOTIONS I Desire is the actual essence of man in so far as it is conceived as determined to a particular activity by some given modification of itself Explanation We have said above in the note to Prop ix of this part that desire is appetite with consciousness thereof further that appetite is the essence of man in so far as it is determined to act in a way tending to promote its own persistence But in the same note I also remarked that strictly speaking I recognize no distinction between appetite and desire For whether a man be conscious of his appetite or not it remains one and the same appetite Thus in order to avoid the appearance of tautology I have refrained from explaining desire by appetite but I have take care to define it in such a manner as to comprehend under one head all those endeavours of human nature which we distinguish by the terms appetite will desire or impulse I might indeed have said that desire is the essence of man in so far as it is conceived as determined to a particular activity but from such a definition cf II xxiii it would not follow that the mind can be conscious of its desire or appetite Therefore in order to imply the cause of such consciousness it was necessary to add in so far as it is determined by some given modification c For by a modification of man s essence we understand every disposition of the said essence whether such disposition be innate or whether it be conceived solely under the attribute of thought or solely under the attribute of extension or whether lastly it be referred simultaneously to both these attributes By the term desire then I here mean all man s endeavours impulses appetites and volitions which vary according to each man s disposition and are therefore not seldom opposed one to another according as a man is drawn in different directions and knows not where to turn II Pleasure is the transition of a man from a less to a greater perfection III Pain is the transition of a man from a greater to a less perfection Explanation I say transition for pleasure is not perfection itself For if man were born with the perfection to which he passes he would possess the same without the emotion of pleasure This appears more clearly from the consideration of the contrary emotion pain No one can deny that pain consists in the transition to a less perfection and not in the less perfection itself for a man cannot be pained in so far as he partakes of perfection of any degree Neither can we say that pain consists in the absence of a greater perfection For absence is nothing whereas the emotion of pain is an activity wherefore this activity can only be the activity of transition from a greater to a less perfection in other words it is an activity whereby a man s power of action is lessened or constrained cf III xi note I pass over the definitions of merriment stimulation melancholy and grief because these terms are generally used in reference to the body and are merely kinds of pleasure or pain IV Wonder is the conception imaginatio of anything wherein the mind comes to a stand because the particular concept in question has no connection with other concepts cf III lii and note Explanation In the note to II xviii we showed the reason why the mind from the contemplation of one thing straightway falls to the contemplation of another thing namely because the images of the two things are so associated and arranged that one follows the other This state of association is impossible if the image of the thing be new the mind will then be at a stand in the contemplation thereof until it is determined by other causes to think of something else Thus the conception of a new object considered in itself is of the same nature as other conceptions hence I do not include wonder among the emotions nor do I see why I should so include it inasmuch as this distraction of the mind arises from no positive cause drawing away the mind from other objects but merely from the absence of a cause which should determine the mind to pass from the contemplation of one object to the contemplation of another I therefore recognize only three primitive or primary emotions as I said in the note to III xi namely pleasure pain and desire I have spoken of wonder simply because it is customary to speak of certain emotions springing from the three primitive ones by different names when they are referred to the objects of our wonder I am led by the same motive to add a definition of contempt V Contempt is the conception of anything which touches the mind so little that its presence leads the mind to imagine those qualities which are not in it rather than such as are in it cf III lii note The definitions of veneration and scorn I here pass over for I am not aware that any emotions are named after them VI Love is pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause Explanation This definition explains sufficiently clearly the essence of love the definition given by those authors who say that love is the lover s wish to unite himself to the loved object expresses a property but not the essence of love and as such authors have not sufficiently discerned love s essence they have been unable to acquire a true conception of its properties accordingly their definition is on all hands admitted to be very obscure It must however be noted that when I say that it is a property of love that the lover should wish to unite himself to the beloved object I do not here mean by wish consent or conclusion or a free decision of the mind for I have shown such in II xlviii to be fictitious neither do I mean a desire of being united to the loved object when it is absent or of continuing in its presence when it is at hand for love can be conceived without either of these desires but by wish I mean the contentment which is in the lover on account of the presence of the beloved object whereby the pleasure of the lover is strengthened or at least maintained VII Hatred is pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause Explanation These observations are easily grasped after what has been said in the explanation of the preceding definition cf also III xiii note VIII Inclination is pleasure accompanied by the idea of something which is accidentally a cause of pleasure IX Aversion is pain accompanied by the idea of something which is accidentally the cause of pain cf III xv note X Devotion is love towards one whom we admire Explanation Wonder admiratio arises as we have shown III lii from the novelty of a thing If therefore it happens that the object of our wonder is often conceived by us we shall cease to wonder at it thus we see that the emotion of devotion readily degenerates into simple love XI Derision is pleasure arising from our conceiving the presence of a quality which we despise in an object which we hate Explanation In so far as we despise a thing which we hate we deny existence thereof III lii note and to that extent rejoice III xx But since we assume that man hates that which he derides it follows that the pleasure in question is not without alloy cf III xlvii note XII Hope is an inconstant pleasure arising from the idea of something past or future whereof we to a certain extent doubt the issue XIII Fear is an inconstant pain arising from the idea of something past or future whereof we to a certain extent doubt the issue cf III xviii note Explanation From these definitions it follows that there is no hope unmingled with fear and no fear unmingled with hope For he who depends on hope and doubts concerning the issue of anything is assumed to conceive something which excludes the existence of the said thing in the future therefore he to this extent feels pain cf III xix consequently while dependent on hope he fears for the issue Contrariwise he who fears in other words doubts concerning the issue of something which he hates also conceives something which excludes the existence of the thing in question to this extent he feels pleasure and consequently to this extent he hopes that it will turn out as he desires III xx XIV Confidence is pleasure arising from the idea of something past or future wherefrom all cause of doubt has been removed XV Despair is pain arising from the idea of something past or future wherefrom all cause of doubt has been removed Explanation Thus confidence springs from hope and despair from fear when all cause for doubt as to the issue of an event has been removed this comes to pass because man conceives something past or future as present and regards it as such or else because he conceives other things which exclude the existence of the causes of his doubt For although we can never be absolutely certain of the issue of any particular event II xxxi Coroll it may nevertheless happen that we feel no doubt concerning it For we have shown that to feel no doubt concerning a thing is not the same as to be quite certain of it II xlix note Thus it may happen that we are affected by the same emotion of pleasure or pain concerning a thing past or future as concerning the conception of a thing present this I have already shown in III xviii to which with its note I refer the reader XVI Joy is pleasure accompanied by the idea of something past which has had an issue beyond our hope XVII Disappointment is pain accompanied by the idea of something past which has had an issue contrary to our hope XVIII Pity is pain accompanied by the idea of evil which has befallen someone else whom we conceive to be like ourselves cf III xxii note and III xxvii note Explanation Between pity and sympathy misericordia there seems to be no difference unless perhaps that the former term is used in reference to a particular action and the latter in reference to a disposition XIX Approval is love towards one who has done good to another XX Indignation is hatred towards one who has done evil to another Explanation I am aware that these terms are employed in senses somewhat different from those usually assigned But my purpose is to explain not the meaning of words but the nature of things I therefore make use of such terms as may convey my meaning without any violent departure from their ordinary signification One statement of my method will suffice As for the cause of the above named emotions see III xxvii Coroll i and III xxii note XXI Partiality is thinking too highly of anyone because of the love we bear him XXII Disparagement is thinking too meanly of anyone because we hate him Explanation Thus partiality is an effect of love and disparagement an effect of hatred so that partiality may also be defined as love in so far as it induces a man to think too highly of a beloved object Contrariwise disparagement may be defined as hatred in so far as it induces a man to think too meanly of a hated object Cf III xxvi note XXIII Envy is hatred in so far as it induces a man to be pained by another s good fortune and to rejoice in another s evil fortune Explanation Envy is generally opposed to sympathy which by doing some violence to the meaning of the word may therefore be thus defined XXIV Sympathy misericordia is love in so far as it induces a man to feel pleasure at another s good fortune and pain at another s evil fortune Explanation Concerning envy see the notes to III xxiv and xxxii These emotions also arise from pleasure or pain accompanied by the idea of something external as cause either in itself or accidentally I now pass on to other emotions which are accompanied by the idea of something within as a cause XXV Self approval is pleasure arising from a man s contemplation of himself and his own power of action XXVI Humility is pain arising from a man s contemplation of his own weakness of body or mind Explanation Self complacency is opposed to humility in so far as we thereby mean pleasure arising from a contemplation of our own power of action but in so far as we mean thereby pleasure accompanied by the idea of any action which we believe we have performed by the free decision of our mind it is opposed to repentance which we may thus define XXVII Repentance is pain accompanied by the idea of some action which we believe we have performed by the free decision of our mind Explanation The causes of these emotions we have set forth in III li note and in III liii liv lv and note Concerning the free decision of the mind see II xxxv note This is perhaps the place to call attention to the fact that it is nothing wonderful that all those actions which are commonly called wrong are followed by pain and all those which are called right are followed by pleasure We can easily gather from what has been said that this depends in great measure on education Parents by reprobating the former class of actions and by frequently chiding their children because of them and also by persuading to and praising the latter class have brought it about that the former should be associated with pain and the latter with pleasure This is confirmed by experience For custom and religion are not the same among all men but that which some consider sacred others consider profane and what some consider honourable others consider disgraceful According as each man has been educated he feels repentance for a given action or glories therein XXVIII Pride is thinking too highly of one s self from self love Explanation Thus pride is different from partiality for the latter term is used in reference to an external object but pride is used of a man thinking too highly of himself However as partiality is the effect of love so is pride the effect or property of self love which may therefore be thus defined love of self or self approval in so far as it leads a man to think too highly of himself To this emotion there is no contrary For no one thinks too meanly of himself because of self hatred I say that no one thinks too meanly of himself in so far as he conceives that he is incapable of doing this or that For whatsoever a man imagines that he is incapable of doing he imagines this of necessity and by that notion he is so disposed that he really cannot do that which he conceives that he cannot do For so long as he conceives that he cannot do it so long is he not determined to do it and consequently so long is it impossible for him to do it However if we consider such matters as only depend on opinion we shall find it conceivable that a man may think too meanly of himself for it may happen that a man sorrowfully regarding his own weakness should imagine that he is despised by all men while the rest of the world are thinking of nothing less than of despising him Again a man may think too meanly of himself if he deny of himself in the present something in relation to a future time of which he is uncertain As for instance if he should say that he is unable to form any clear conceptions or that he can desire and do nothing but what is wicked and base c We may also say that a man thinks too meanly of himself when we see him from excessive fear of shame refusing to do things which others his equals venture We can therefore set down as a contrary to pride an emotion which I will call self abasement for as from self complacency springs pride so from humility springs self abasement which I will accordingly thus define XXIX Self abasement is thinking too meanly of one s self by reason of pain Explanation We are nevertheless generally accustomed to oppose pride to humility but in that case we pay more attention to the effect of either emotion than to its nature We are wont to call proud the man who boasts too much III xxx note who talks of nothing but his own virtues and other people s faults who wishes to be first and lastly who goes through life with a style and pomp suitable to those far above him in station On the other hand we call humble the man who too often blushes who confesses his faults who sets forth other men s virtues and who lastly walks with bent head and is negligent of his attire However these emotions humility and self abasement are extremely rare For human nature considered in itself strives against them as much as it can see III xiii liv hence those who are believed to be most self abased and humble are generally in reality the most ambitious and envious XXX Honour eleven is pleasure accompanied by the idea of some action of our own which we believe to be praised by others eleven Gloria XXXI Shame is pain accompanied by the idea of some action of our own which we believe to be blamed by others Explanation On this subject see the note to III xxx But we should here remark the difference which exists between shame and modesty Shame is the pain following the deed whereof we are ashamed Modesty is the fear or dread of shame which restrains a man from committing a base action Modesty is usually opposed to shamelessness but the latter is not an emotion as I will duly show however the names of the emotions as I have remarked already have regard rather to their exercise than to their nature I have now fulfilled the task of explaining the emotions arising from pleasure and pain I therefore proceed to treat of those which I refer to desire XXXII Regret is the desire or appetite to possess something kept alive by the remembrance of the said thing and at the same time constrained by the remembrance of other things which exclude the existence of it Explanation When we remember a thing we are by that very fact as I have already said more than once disposed to contemplate it with the same emotion as if it were something present but this disposition or endeavour while we are awake is generally checked by the images of things which exclude the existence of that which we remember Thus when we remember something which affected us with a certain pleasure we by that very fact endeavour to regard it with the same emotion of pleasure as though it were present but this endeavour is at once checked by the remembrance of things which exclude the existence of the thing in question Wherefore regret is strictly speaking a pain opposed to that of pleasure which arises from the absence of something we hate cf III xlvii note But as the name regret seems to refer to desire I set this emotion down among the emotions springing from desire XXXIII Emulation is the desire of something engendered in us by our conception that others have the same desire Explanation He who runs away because he sees others running away or he who fears because he sees others in fear or again he who on seeing that another man has burnt his hand draws towards him his own hand and moves his body as though his own were burnt such an one can be said to imitate another s emotion but not to emulate him not because the causes of emulation and imitation are different but because it has become customary to speak of emulation only in him who imitates that which we deem to be honourable useful or pleasant As to the cause of emulation cf III xxvii and note The reason why this emotion is generally coupled with envy may be seen from III xxxii and note XXXIV Thankfulness or Gratitude is the desire or zeal springing from love whereby we endeavour to benefit him who with similar feelings of love has conferred a benefit on us Cf III xxxix note and xl XXXV Benevolence is the desire of benefiting one whom we pity Cf III xxvii note XXXVI Anger is the desire whereby through hatred we are induced to injure one whom we hate III xxxix XXXVII Revenge is the desire whereby we are induced through mutual hatred to injure one who with similar feelings has injured us See III xl Coroll ii and note XXXVIII Cruelty or savageness is the desire whereby a man is impelled to injure one whom we love or pity Explanation To cruelty is opposed clemency which is not a passive state of the mind but a power whereby man restrains his anger and revenge XXXIX Timidity is the desire to avoid a greater evil which we dread by undergoing a lesser evil Cf III xxxix note XL Daring is the desire whereby a man is set on to do something dangerous which his equals fear to attempt XLI Cowardice is attributed to one whose desire is checked by the fear of some danger which his equals dare to encounter Explanation Cowardice is therefore nothing else but the fear of some evil which most men are wont not to fear hence I do not reckon it among the emotions springing from desire Nevertheless I have chosen to explain it here because in so far as we look to the desire it is truly opposed to the emotion of daring XLII Consternation is attributed to one whose desire of avoiding evil is checked by amazement at the evil which he fears Explanation Consternation is therefore a species of cowardice But inasmuch as consternation arises from a double fear it may be more conveniently defined as a fear which keeps a man so bewildered and wavering that he is not able to remove the evil I say bewildered in so far as we understand his desire of removing the evil to be constrained by his amazement I say wavering in so far as we understand the said desire to be constrained by the fear of another evil which equally torments him whence it comes to pass that he knows not which he may avert of the two On this subject see III xxxix note and III lii note Concerning cowardice and daring see III li note XLIII Courtesy or deference Humanitas seu modestia is the desire of acting in a way that should please men and refraining from that which should displease them XLIV Ambition is the immoderate desire of power Explanation Ambition is the desire whereby all the emotions cf III xxvii and xxxi are fostered and strengthened therefore this emotion can with difficulty be overcome For so long as a man is bound by any desire he is at the same time necessarily bound by this The best men says Cicero are especially led by honour Even philosophers when they write a book contemning honour sign their names thereto and so on XLV Luxury is excessive desire or even love of living sumptuously XLVI Intemperance is the excessive desire and love of drinking XLVII Avarice is the excessive desire and love of riches XLVIII Lust is desire and love in the matter of sexual intercourse Explanation Whether this desire be excessive or not it is still called lust These last five emotions as I have shown in III lvi have on contraries For deference is a species of ambition Cf III xxix note Again I have already pointed out that temperance sobriety and chastity indicate rather a power than a passivity of the mind It may nevertheless happen that an avaricious an ambitious or a timid man may abstain from excess in eating drinking or sexual indulgence yet avarice ambition and fear are not contraries to luxury drunkenness and debauchery For an avaricious man often is glad to gorge himself with food and drink at another man s expense An ambitious man will restrain himself in nothing so long as he thinks his indulgences are secret and if he lives among drunkards and debauchees he will from the mere fact of being ambitious be more prone to those vices Lastly a timid man does that which he would not For though an avaricious man should for the sake of avoiding death cast his riches into the sea he will none the less remain avaricious so also if a lustful man is downcast because he cannot follow his bent he does not on the ground of abstention cease to be lustful In fact these emotions are not so much concerned with the actual feasting drinking c as with the appetite and love of such Nothing therefore can be opposed to these emotions but high mindedness and valour whereof I will speak presently The definitions of jealousy and other waverings of the mind I pass over in silence first because they arise from the compounding of the emotions already described secondly because many of them have no distinctive names which shows that it is sufficient for practical purposes to have merely a general knowledge of them However it is established from the definitions of the emotions which we have set forth that they all spring from desire pleasure or pain or rather that there is nothing besides these three wherefore each is wont to be called by a variety of names in accordance with its various relations and extrinsic tokens If we now direct our attention to these primitive emotions and to what has been said concerning the nature of the mind we shall be able thus to define the emotions in so far as they are referred to the mind only GENERAL DEFINITION OF THE EMOTIONS Emotion which is called a passivity of the soul is a confused idea whereby the mind affirms concerning its body or any part thereof a force for existence existendi vis greater or less than before and by the presence of which the mind is determined to think of one thing rather than another Explanation I say first that emotion or passion of the soul is a confused idea For we have shown that the mind is only passive in so far as it has inadequate or confused ideas III iii I say further whereby the mind affirms concerning its body or any part thereof a force for existence greater than before For all the ideas of bodies which we possess denote rather the actual disposition of our own body II xvi Coroll ii than the nature of an external body But the idea which constitutes the reality of an emotion must denote or express the disposition of the body or of some part thereof because its power of action or force for existence is increased or diminished helped or hindered But it must be noted that when I say a greater or less force for existence than before I do not mean that the mind compares the present with the past disposition of the body but that the idea which constitutes the reality of an emotion affirms something of the body which in fact involves more or less of reality than before And inasmuch as the essence of mind consists in the fact II xi xiii that it affirms the actual existence of its own body and inasmuch as we understand by perfection the very essence of a thing it follows that the mind passes to greater or less perfection when it happens to affirm concerning its own body or any part thereof something involving more or less reality than before When therefore I said above that the power of the mind is increased or diminished I merely meant that the mind had formed of its own body or of some part thereof an idea involving more or less of reality than it had already affirmed concerning its own body For the excellence of ideas and the actual power of thinking are measured by the excellence of the object Lastly I have added by the presence of which the mind is determined to think of one thing rather than another so that besides the nature of pleasure and pain which the first part of the definition explains I might also express the nature of desire PART IV Of Human Bondage or the Strength of the Emotions 
5185-24763-0000	train-other-500	PREFACE Human infirmity in moderating and checking the emotions I name bondage for when a man is a prey to his emotions he is not his own master but lies at the mercy of fortune
5185-24763-0001	train-other-500	so much so that he is often compelled while seeing that which is better for him to follow that which is worse Why this is so and what is good or evil in the emotions I propose to show in this part of my treatise
5185-24763-0002	train-other-500	But before I begin it would be well to make a few prefatory observations on perfection and imperfection good and evil When a man has purposed to make a given thing and has brought it to perfection
5185-24763-0003	train-other-500	his work will be pronounced perfect not only by himself but by everyone who rightly knows or thinks that he knows the intention and aim of its author For instance suppose anyone sees a work which I assume to be not yet completed
none	none	 and knows that the aim of the author of that work is to build a house he will call the work imperfect 
5185-24763-0004	train-other-500	he will on the other hand call it perfect as soon as he sees that it is carried through to the end which its author had purposed for it But if a man sees a work the like whereof he has never seen before and if he knows not the intention of the artificer
5185-24763-0005	train-other-500	he plainly cannot know whether that work be perfect or imperfect Such seems to be the primary meaning of these terms But after men began to form general ideas
none	none	 to think out types of houses buildings towers c and to prefer certain types to others 
5185-24763-0006	train-other-500	it came about that each man called perfect that which he saw agree with the general idea he had formed of the thing in question and called imperfect that which he saw agree less with his own preconceived type
5185-24763-0007	train-other-500	even though it had evidently been completed in accordance with the idea of its artificer This seems to be the only reason for calling natural phenomena which indeed are not made with human hands perfect or imperfect
5185-24763-0008	train-other-500	for men are wont to form general ideas of things natural no less than of things artificial and such ideas they hold as types believing that Nature who they think does nothing without an object has them in view and has set them
5185-24763-0009	train-other-500	as types before herself Therefore when they behold something in Nature which does not wholly conform to the preconceived type which they have formed of the thing in question they say that Nature has fallen short or has blundered and has left her work incomplete
5185-24763-0010	train-other-500	Thus we see that men are wont to style natural phenomena perfect or imperfect rather from their own prejudices than from true knowledge of what they pronounce upon Now
none	none	 we showed in the Appendix to Part I 
5185-24763-0011	train-other-500	that Nature does not work with an end in view For the eternal and infinite Being which we call God or Nature
none	none	 acts by the same necessity as that whereby it exists For we have shown 
5185-24763-0012	train-other-500	that by the same necessity of its nature whereby it exists it likewise works
none	none	 I xvi 
5185-24763-0013	train-other-500	The reason or cause why God or Nature exists and the reason why he acts are one and the same Therefore as he does not exist for the sake of an end so neither does he act for the sake of an end
5185-24763-0014	train-other-500	of his existence and of his action there is neither origin nor end Wherefore a cause which is called final is nothing else but human desire in so far as it is considered as the origin or cause of anything
5185-24763-0015	train-other-500	For example when we say that to be inhabited is the final cause of this or that house we mean nothing more than that a man conceiving the conveniences of household life had a desire to build a house Wherefore
none	none	 the being inhabited in so far as it is regarded as a final cause 
5185-24763-0016	train-other-500	is nothing else but this particular desire which is really the efficient cause it is regarded as the primary cause because men are generally ignorant of the causes of their desires They are as I have often said already conscious of their own actions and appetites
5185-24763-0017	train-other-500	but ignorant of the causes whereby they are determined to any particular desire Therefore the common saying that Nature sometimes falls short or blunders
none	none	 and produces things which are imperfect I set down among the glosses treated of in the Appendix to Part I 
5185-24763-0018	train-other-500	Perfection and imperfection then are in reality merely modes of thinking or notions which we form from a comparison among one another of individuals of the same species
none	none	 hence I said above II Def vi 
5185-24763-0019	train-other-500	that by reality and perfection I mean the same thing For we are wont to refer all the individual things in nature to one genus which is called the highest genus namely to the category of Being
none	none	 whereto absolutely all individuals in nature belong 
5185-24763-0020	train-other-500	Thus in so far as we refer the individuals in nature to this category and comparing them one with another find that some possess more of being or reality than others we to this extent
5185-24763-0021	train-other-500	say that some are more perfect than others Again in so far as we attribute to them anything implying negation as term end infirmity et cetera we to this extent call them imperfect
none	none	 because they do not affect our mind so much as the things which we call perfect 
5185-24763-0022	train-other-500	not because they have any intrinsic deficiency or because Nature has blundered For nothing lies within the scope of a thing s nature save that which follows from the necessity of the nature of its efficient cause
5185-24763-0023	train-other-500	and whatsoever follows from the necessity of the nature of its efficient cause necessarily comes to pass As for the terms good and bad they indicate no positive quality in things
5185-24763-0024	train-other-500	regarded in themselves but are merely modes of thinking or notions which we form from the comparison of things one with another Thus one and the same thing can be at the same time good bad and indifferent For instance
5185-24763-0025	train-other-500	music is good for him that is melancholy bad for him that mourns for him that is deaf it is neither good nor bad Nevertheless though this be so the terms should still be retained
5185-24763-0026	train-other-500	For inasmuch as we desire to form an idea of man as a type of human nature which we may hold in view it will be useful for us to retain the terms in question in the sense I have indicated In what follows then
5185-24763-0027	train-other-500	I shall mean by good that which we certainly know to be a means of approaching more nearly to the type of human nature which we have set before ourselves by bad that which we certainly know to be a hindrance to us in approaching the said type
none	none	 Again we shall that men 
5185-24763-0028	train-other-500	are more perfect or more imperfect in proportion as they approach more or less nearly to the said type For it must be specially remarked that when I say that a man passes from a lesser to a greater perfection or vice versa
5185-24763-0029	train-other-500	I do not mean that he is changed from one essence or reality to another for instance a horse would be as completely destroyed by being changed into a man as by being changed into an insect What I mean is that we conceive the thing s power of action
5185-24763-0030	train-other-500	in so far as this is understood by its nature to be increased or diminished Lastly by perfection in general I shall as I have said mean reality in other words
none	none	 each thing s essence in so far as it exists and operates in a particular manner and without paying any regard to its duration 
5185-24763-0031	train-other-500	For no given thing can be said to be more perfect because it has passed a longer time in existence The duration of things cannot be determined by their essence for the essence of things involves no fixed and definite period of existence but everything
5185-24763-0032	train-other-500	whether it be more perfect or less perfect will always be able to persist in existence with the same force wherewith it began to exist wherefore in this respect all things are equal DEFINITIONS
none	none	 I By good I mean that which we certainly know to be useful to us II By evil I mean that which we certainly know to be a hindrance to us in the attainment of any good Concerning these terms see the foregoing preface towards the end III Particular things I call contingent in so far as while regarding their essence only we find nothing therein which necessarily asserts their existence or excludes it IV Particular things I call possible in so far as while regarding the causes whereby they must be produced we know not whether such causes be determined for producing them In I xxxiii note i I drew no distinction between possible and contingent because there was in that place no need to distinguish them accurately V 
5185-24763-0036	train-other-500	By conflicting emotions I mean those which draw a man in different directions though they are of the same kind such as luxury and avarice which are both species of love and are contraries not by nature
none	none	 but by accident VI What I mean by emotion felt towards a thing future present and past I explained in III xviii notes i and ii which see 
5185-24763-0038	train-other-500	But I should here also remark that we can only distinctly conceive distance of space or time up to a certain definite limit that is
5185-24763-0039	train-other-500	all objects distant from us more than two hundred feet or whose distance from the place where we are exceeds that which we can distinctly conceive seem to be an equal distance from us and all in the same plane
5185-24763-0040	train-other-500	so also objects whose time of existing is conceived as removed from the present by a longer interval than we can distinctly conceive seem to be all equally distant from the present and are set down as it were to the same moment of time
none	none	 VII By an end for the sake of which we do something I mean a desire VIII By virtue virtus and power I mean the same thing that is III vii virtue in so far 
5185-24763-0042	train-other-500	as it is referred to man is a man s nature or essence in so far as it has the power of effecting what can only be understood by the laws of that nature AXIOM
5185-24763-0043	train-other-500	There is no individual thing in nature than which there is not another more powerful and strong Whatsoever thing be given
none	none	 there is something stronger whereby it can be destroyed PROPOSITIONS PROP I No positive quality possessed by a false idea is removed by the presence of what is true in virtue of its being true Proof Falsity consists solely in the privation of knowledge which inadequate ideas involve II xxxv nor have they any positive quality on account of which they are called false II xxxiii contrariwise in so far as they are referred to God they are true II xxxii Wherefore if the positive quality possessed by a false idea were removed by the presence of what is true in virtue of its being true a true idea would then be removed by itself which IV iii is absurd Therefore no positive quality possessed by a false idea c Q E D Note This proposition is more clearly understood from II xvi Coroll ii For imagination is an idea which indicates rather the present disposition of the human body than the nature of the external body not indeed distinctly but confusedly whence it comes to pass that the mind is said to err For instance when we look at the sun we conceive that it is distant from us about two hundred feet in this judgment we err so long as we are in ignorance of its true distance when its true distance is known the error is removed but not the imagination or in other words the idea of the sun which only explains tho nature of that luminary in so far as the body is affected thereby wherefore though we know the real distance we shall still nevertheless imagine the sun to be near us For as we said in II xxxv note we do not imagine the sun to be so near us because we are ignorant of its true distance but because the mind conceives the magnitude of the sun to the extent that the body is affected thereby Thus when the rays of the sun falling on the surface of water are reflected into our eyes we imagine the sun as if it were in the water though we are aware of its real position and similarly other imaginations wherein the mind is deceived whether they indicate the natural disposition of the body or that its power of activity is increased or diminished are not contrary to the truth and do not vanish at its presence It happens indeed that when we mistakenly fear an evil the fear vanishes when we hear the true tidings but the contrary also happens namely that we fear an evil which will certainly come and our fear vanishes when we hear false tidings thus imaginations do not vanish at the presence of the truth in virtue of its being true but because other imaginations stronger than the first supervene and exclude the present existence of that which we imagined as I have shown in II xvii PROP II We are only passive in so far as we are apart of Nature which cannot be conceived by itself without other parts Proof We are said to be passive when something arises in us whereof we are only a partial cause III Def ii that is III Def i something which cannot be deduced solely from the laws of our nature We are passive therefore in so far as we are a part of Nature which cannot be conceived by itself without other parts Q E D PROP III The force whereby a man persists in existing is limited and is infinitely surpassed by the power of external causes Proof This is evident from the axiom of this part For when man is given there is something else say A more powerful when A is given there is something else say B more powerful than A and so on to infinity thus the power of man is limited by the power of some other thing and is infinitely surpassed by the power of external causes Q E D PROP IV It is impossible that man should not be a part of Nature or that he should be capable of undergoing no changes save such as can be understood through his nature only as their adequate cause Proof The power whereby each particular thing and consequently man preserves his being is the power of God or of Nature I xxiv Coroll not in so far as it is infinite but in so far as it can be explained by the actual human essence III vii Thus the power of man in so far as it is explained through his own actual essence is a part of the infinite power of God or Nature in other words of the essence thereof I xxxiv This was our first point Again if it were possible that man should undergo no changes save such as can be understood solely through the nature of man it would follow that he would not be able to die but would always necessarily exist this would be the necessary consequence of a cause whose power was either finite or infinite namely either of man s power only inasmuch as he would be capable of removing from himself all changes which could spring from external causes or of the infinite power of Nature whereby all individual things would be so ordered that man should be incapable of undergoing any changes save such as tended towards his own preservation But the first alternative is absurd by the last Prop the proof of which is universal and can be applied to all individual things Therefore if it be possible that man should not be capable of undergoing any changes save such as can be explained solely through his own nature and consequently that he must always as we have shown necessarily exist such a result must follow from the infinite power of God and consequently I xvi from the necessity of the divine nature in so far as it is regarded as affected by the idea of any given man the whole order of nature as conceived under the attributes of extension and thought must be deducible It would therefore follow I xxi that man is infinite which by the first part of this proof is absurd It is therefore impossible that man should not undergo any changes save those whereof he is the adequate cause Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that man is necessarily always a prey to his passions that he follows and obeys the general order of nature and that he accommodates himself thereto as much as the nature of things demands PROP V The power and increase of every passion and its persistence in existing are not defined by the power whereby we ourselves endeavour to persist in existing but by the power of an external cause compared with our own Proof The essence of a passion cannot be explained through our essence alone III Deff i and ii that is III vii the power of a passion cannot be defined by the power whereby we ourselves endeavour to persist in existing but as is shown in II xvi must necessarily be defined by the power of an external cause compared with our own Q E D PROP VI The force of any passion or emotion can overcome the rest of a man s activities or power so that the emotion becomes obstinately fixed to him Proof The force and increase of any passion and its persistence in existing are defined by the power of an external cause compared with our own by the foregoing Prop therefore IV iii it can overcome a man s power e Q E D PROP VII An emotion can only be controlled or destroyed by another emotion contrary thereto and with more power for controlling emotion Proof Emotion in so far as it is referred to the mind is an idea whereby the mind affirms of its body a greater or less force of existence than before cf the general Definition of the Emotions at the end of Part III When therefore the mind is assailed by any emotion the body is at the same time affected with a modification whereby its power of activity is increased or diminished Now this modification of the body IV v receives from its cause the force for persistence in its being which force can only be checked or destroyed by a bodily cause II vi in virtue of the body being affected with a modification contrary to III v and stronger than itself IV Ax wherefore II xii the mind is affected by the idea of a modification contrary to and stronger than the former modification in other words by the general definition of the emotions the mind will be affected by an emotion contrary to and stronger than the former emotion which will exclude or destroy the existence of the former emotion thus an emotion cannot be destroyed nor controlled except by a contrary and stronger emotion Q E D Corollary An emotion in so far as it is referred to the mind can only be controlled or destroyed through an idea of a modification of the body contrary to and stronger than that which we are undergoing For the emotion which we undergo can only be checked or destroyed by an emotion contrary to and stronger than itself in other words by the general Definition of the Emotions only by an idea of a modification of the body contrary to and stronger than the modification which we undergo PROP VIII The knowledge of good and evil is nothing else but the emotions of pleasure or pain in so far as we are conscious thereof Proof We call a thing good or evil when it is of service or the reverse in preserving our being IV Deff i and ii that is III vii when it increases or diminishes helps or hinders our power of activity Thus in so far as we perceive that a thing affects us with pleasure or pain we call it good or evil wherefore the knowledge of good and evil is nothing else but the idea of the pleasure or pain which necessarily follows from that pleasurable or painful emotion II xxii But this idea is united to the emotion in the same way as mind is united to body II xxi that is there is no real distinction between this idea and the emotion or idea of the modification of the body save in conception only Therefore the knowledge of good and evil is nothing else but the emotion in so far as we are conscious thereof Q E D PROP IX An emotion whereof we conceive the cause to be with us at the present time is stronger than if we did not conceive the cause to be with us Proof Imagination or conception is the idea by which the mind regards a thing as present II xvii note but which indicates the disposition of the mind rather than the nature of the external thing II xvi Coroll ii An emotion is therefore a conception in so far as it indicates the disposition of the body But a conception by II xvii is stronger so long as we conceive nothing which excludes the present existence of the external object wherefore an emotion is also stronger or more intense when we conceive the cause to be with us at the present time than when we do not conceive the cause to be with us Q E D Note When I said above in III xviii that we are affected by the image of what is past or future with the same emotion as if the thing conceived were present I expressly stated that this is only true in so far as we look solely to the image of the thing in question itself for the thing s nature is unchanged whether we have conceived it or not I did not deny that the image becomes weaker when we regard as present to us other things which exclude the present existence of the future object I did not expressly call attention to the fact because I purposed to treat of the strength of the emotions in this part of my work Corollary The image of something past or future that is of a thing which we regard as in relation to time past or time future to the exclusion of time present is when other conditions are equal weaker than the image of something present consequently an emotion felt towards what is past or future is less intense other conditions being equal than an emotion felt towards something present PROP X Towards something future which we conceive as close at hand we are affected more intensely than if we conceive that its time for existence is separated from the present by a longer interval so too by the remembrance of what we conceive to have not long passed away we are affected more intensely than if we conceive that it has long passed away Proof In so far as we conceive a thing as close at hand or not long passed away we conceive that which excludes the presence of the object less than if its period of future existence were more distant from the present or if it had long passed away this is obvious therefore by the foregoing Prop we are so far more intensely affected towards it Q E D Corollary From the remarks made in Def vi of this part it follows that if objects are separated from the present by a longer period than we can define in conception though their dates of occurrence be widely separated one from the other they all affect us equally faintly PROP XI An emotion towards that which we conceive as necessary is when other conditions are equal more intense than an emotion towards that which possible or contingent or non necessary Proof In so far as we conceive a thing to be necessary we to that extent affirm its existence on the other hand we deny a thing s existence in so far as we conceive it not to be necessary I xxxiii note i wherefore IV ix an emotion towards that which is necessary is other conditions being equal more intense than an emotion that which is non necessary Q E D PROP XII An emotion towards a thing which we know not to exist at the present time and which we conceive as possible is more intense other conditions being equal than an emotion towards a thing contingent Proof In so far as we conceive a thing as contingent we are affected by the conception of some further thing which would assert the existence of the former IV Def iii but on the other hand we by hypothesis conceive certain things which exclude its present existence But in so far as we conceive a thing to be possible in the future we there by conceive things which assert its existence IV iv that is III xviii things which promote hope or fear wherefore an emotion towards something possible is more vehement Q E D Corollary An emotion towards a thing which we know not to exist in the present and which we conceive as contingent is far fainter than if we conceive the thing to be present with us Proof Emotion towards a thing which we conceive to exist is more intense than it would be if we conceived the thing as future IV ix Coroll and is much more vehement than if the future time be conceived as far distant from the present IV x Therefore an emotion towards a thing whose period of existence we conceive to be far distant from the present is far fainter than if we conceive the thing as present it is nevertheless more intense than if we conceived the thing as contingent wherefore an emotion towards a thing which we regard as contingent will be far fainter than if we conceived the thing to be present with us Q E D PROP XIII Emotion towards a thing contingent which we know not to exist in the present is other conditions being equal fainter than an emotion towards a thing past Proof In so far as we conceive a thing as contingent we are not affected by the image of any other thing which asserts the existence of the said thing IV Def iii but on the other hand by hypothesis we conceive certain things excluding its present existence But in so far as we conceive it in relation to time past we are assumed to conceive something which recalls the thing to memory or excites the image thereof II xviii and note which is so far the same as regarding it as present II xvii Coroll Therefore IV ix an emotion towards a thing contingent which we know does not exist in the present is fainter other conditions being equal than an emotion towards a thing past Q E D PROP XIV A true knowledge of good and evil cannot check any emotion by virtue of being true but only in so far as it is considered as an emotion Proof An emotion is an idea whereby the mind affirms of its body a greater or less force of existing than before by the general Definition of the Emotions therefore it has no positive quality which can be destroyed by the presence of what is true consequently the knowledge of good and evil cannot by virtue of being true restrain any emotion But in so far as such knowledge is an emotion IV viii if it have more strength for restraining emotion it will to that extent be able to restrain the given emotion Q E D PROP XV Desire arising from the knowledge of good and bad can be quenched or checked by many of the other desires arising from the emotions whereby we are assailed Proof From the true knowledge of good and evil in so far as it is an emotion necessarily arises desire Def of the Emotions i the strength of which is proportioned to the strength of the emotion wherefrom it arises III xxxvii But inasmuch as this desire arises by hypothesis from the fact of our truly understanding anything it follows that it is also present with us in so far as we are active III i and must therefore be understood through our essence only III Def ii consequently III vii its force and increase can be defined solely by human power Again the desires arising from the emotions whereby we are assailed are stronger in proportion as the said emotions are more vehement wherefore their force and increase must be defined solely by the power of external causes which when compared with our own power indefinitely surpass it IV iii hence the desires arising from like emotions may be more vehement than the desire which arises from a true knowledge of good and evil and may consequently control or quench it Q E D PROP XVI 
5185-24767-0000	train-other-500	Desire arising from the knowledge of good and evil in so far as such knowledge regards what is future may be more easily controlled or quenched than the desire for what is agreeable at the present moment Proof
5185-24767-0001	train-other-500	Emotion towards a thing which we conceive as future is fainter than emotion towards a thing that is present
none	none	 IV ix Coroll 
5185-24767-0002	train-other-500	But desire which arises from the true knowledge of good and evil though it be concerned with things which are good at the moment can be quenched or controlled by any headstrong desire
none	none	 by the last Prop the proof whereof 
5185-24767-0003	train-other-500	is of universal application Wherefore desire arising from such knowledge when concerned with the future can be more easily controlled or quenched
none	none	 c Q E D PROP XVII Desire arising from the true knowledge of good and evil in so far as such knowledge is concerned with what is contingent can be controlled far more easily still than desire for things that are present Proof This Prop is proved in the same way as the last Prop from IV xii Coroll Note I think I have now shown the reason why men are moved by opinion more readily than by true reason 
5185-24767-0004	train-other-500	why it is that the true knowledge of good and evil stirs up conflicts in the soul and often yields to every kind of passion
none	none	 This state of things gave rise to the exclamation of the poet twelve The better path I gaze at and approve The worse I follow twelve Ov Met vii twenty Video meliora proboque Deteriora sequor Ecclesiastes seems to have had the same thought in his mind when he says He who increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow 
5185-24767-0005	train-other-500	I have not written the above with the object of drawing the conclusion that ignorance is more excellent than knowledge or that a wise man is on a par with a fool in controlling his emotions but because it is necessary to know the power and the infirmity of our nature
5185-24767-0006	train-other-500	before we can determine what reason can do in restraining the emotions and what is beyond her power I have said that in the present part I shall merely treat of human infirmity
none	none	 The power of reason over the emotions I have settled to treat separately PROP XVIII Desire arising from pleasure 
5185-24767-0007	train-other-500	is other conditions being equal stronger than desire arising from pain Proof Desire is the essence of a man
none	none	 Def of the Emotions i 
5185-24767-0008	train-other-500	that is the endeavour whereby a man endeavours to persist in his own being Wherefore desire arising from pleasure is by the fact of pleasure being felt increased or helped on the contrary desire arising from pain
5185-24767-0009	train-other-500	is by the fact of pain being felt diminished or hindered hence the force of desire arising from pleasure must be defined
none	none	 by human power 
5185-24767-0010	train-other-500	together with the power of an external cause whereas desire arising from pain
none	none	 must be defined by human power only Thus the former is the stronger of the two Q E D 
5185-24767-0011	train-other-500	Note In these few remarks I have explained the causes of human infirmity and inconstancy and shown why men do not abide by the precepts of reason It now remains for me to show what course is marked out for us by reason
5185-24767-0012	train-other-500	which of the emotions are in harmony with the rules of human reason
none	none	 and which of them are contrary thereto 
5185-24767-0013	train-other-500	But before I begin to prove my Propositions in detailed geometrical fashion it is advisable to sketch them briefly in advance so that everyone may more readily grasp my meaning As reason makes no demands contrary to nature
5185-24767-0014	train-other-500	it demands that every man should love himself should seek that which is useful to him I mean that which is really useful to him should desire everything which really brings man to greater perfection and should each for himself
5185-24767-0015	train-other-500	endeavour as far as he can to preserve his own being This is as necessarily true as that a whole is greater than its part
none	none	 Cf III iv 
5185-24767-0016	train-other-500	Again as virtue is nothing else but action in accordance with the laws of one s own nature
none	none	 IV Def viii 
5185-24767-0017	train-other-500	and as no one endeavours to preserve his own being except in accordance with the laws of his own nature it follows first that the foundation of virtue is the endeavour to preserve one s own being and that happiness consists
5185-24767-0018	train-other-500	in man s power of preserving his own being secondly that virtue is to be desired for its own sake
none	none	 and that there is nothing more excellent or more useful to us for the sake of which we should desire it thirdly and lastly 
5185-24767-0019	train-other-500	that suicides are weak minded and are overcome by external causes repugnant to their nature
none	none	 Further it follows from Postulate iv Part II 
5185-24767-0020	train-other-500	that we can never arrive at doing without all external things for the preservation of our being or living so as to have no relations with things which are outside ourselves Again if we consider our mind
5185-24767-0021	train-other-500	we see that our intellect would be more imperfect if mind were alone and could understand nothing besides itself There are then many things outside ourselves which are useful to us and are therefore to be desired
5185-24767-0022	train-other-500	Of such none can be discerned more excellent than those which are in entire agreement with our nature For if for example two individuals of entirely the same nature are united they form a combination twice as powerful
5185-24767-0023	train-other-500	as either of them singly Therefore to man there is nothing more useful than man nothing I repeat more excellent for preserving their being can be wished for by men than that all should so in all points agree
none	none	 that the minds and bodies 
5185-24767-0024	train-other-500	of all should form as it were one single mind and one single body and that all should with one consent as far as they are able endeavour to preserve their being and all with one consent seek what is useful to them all Hence
5185-24767-0025	train-other-500	men who are governed by reason that is who seek what is useful to them in accordance with reason desire for themselves nothing which they do not also desire for the rest of mankind and consequently are just faithful and honourable in their conduct
5185-24767-0026	train-other-500	Such are the dictates of reason which I purposed thus briefly to indicate before beginning to prove them in greater detail I have taken this course in order if possible to gain the attention of those who believe that the principle that every man
5185-24767-0027	train-other-500	is bound to seek what is useful for himself is the foundation of impiety rather than of piety and virtue Therefore after briefly showing that the contrary is the case I go on to prove it by the same method
5185-24767-0028	train-other-500	as that whereby I have hitherto proceeded
none	none	 PROP XIX 
5185-24767-0029	train-other-500	Every man by the laws of his nature necessarily desires or shrinks from that which he deems to be good or bad Proof The knowledge of good and evil is
none	none	 IV viii the emotion of pleasure 
5185-24767-0030	train-other-500	or pain in so far as we are conscious thereof therefore every man necessarily desires what he thinks good and shrinks from what he thinks bad Now this appetite is nothing else but man s nature or essence
none	none	 Cf the Definition of Appetite III ix note and Def of the Emotions i 
5185-24767-0031	train-other-500	Therefore every man solely by the laws of his nature desires the one
none	none	 and shrinks from the other c Q E D PROP XX The more every man endeavours and is able to seek what is useful to him 
5185-24767-0032	train-other-500	in other words to preserve his own being the more is he endowed with virtue on the contrary in proportion as a man neglects to seek what is useful to him that is to preserve his own being he is wanting in power Proof
5185-24767-0033	train-other-500	Virtue is human power which is defined solely by man s essence
none	none	 IV Def viii 
5185-24767-0034	train-other-500	that is which is defined solely by the endeavour made by man to persist in his own being Wherefore the more a man endeavours and is able to preserve his own being the more is he endowed with virtue
none	none	 and consequently III iv and vi in so far as a man 
5185-24767-0035	train-other-500	neglects to preserve his own being he is wanting in power
none	none	 Q E D 
5185-24767-0036	train-other-500	Note No one therefore neglects seeking his own good or preserving his own being unless he be overcome by causes external and foreign to his nature No one I say from the necessity of his own nature or otherwise
5185-24767-0037	train-other-500	than under compulsion from external causes shrinks from food or kills himself which latter may be done in a variety of ways A man for instance kills himself under the compulsion of another man who twists round his right hand
none	none	 wherewith he happened to have taken up a sword 
5185-24767-0038	train-other-500	and forces him to turn the blade against his own heart or again he may be compelled like Seneca by a tyrant s command to open his own veins that is to escape a greater evil by incurring a lesser or lastly latent external causes
5185-24767-0039	train-other-500	may so disorder his imagination and so affect his body that it may assume a nature contrary to its former one and whereof the idea cannot exist in the mind
none	none	 III x 
5185-24767-0040	train-other-500	But that a man from the necessity of his own nature should endeavour to become non existent is as impossible as that something should be made out of nothing
none	none	 as everyone will see for himself after a little reflection PROP XXI No one can desire to be blessed to act rightly and to live rightly without at the same time wishing to be act and to live in other words to actually exist Proof The proof of this proposition or rather the proposition itself is self evident and is also plain from the definition of desire For the desire of living acting c blessedly or rightly is Def of the Emotions i the essence of man that is III vii the endeavour made by everyone to preserve his own being Therefore no one can desire c Q E D PROP XXII No virtue can be conceived as prior to this endeavour to preserve one s own being Proof The effort for self preservation is the essence of a thing III vii therefore if any virtue could be conceived as prior thereto the essence of a thing would have to be conceived as prior to itself which is obviously absurd Therefore no virtue c Q E D Corollary The effort for self preservation is the first and only foundation of virtue For prior to this principle nothing can be conceived and without it no virtue can be conceived PROP XXIII Man in so far as he is determined to a particular action because he has inadequate ideas cannot be absolutely said to act in obedience to virtue he can only be so described in so far as he is determined for the action because he understands Proof In so far as a man is determined to an action through having inadequate ideas he is passive III i that is III Deff i and iii he does something which cannot be perceived solely through his essence that is by IV Def viii which does not follow from his virtue But in so far as he is determined for an action because he understands he is active that is he does something which is perceived through his essence alone or which adequately follows from his virtue Q E D PROP XXIV To act absolutely in obedience to virtue is in us the same thing as to act to live or to preserve one s being these three terms are identical in meaning in accordance with the dictates of reason on the basis of seeking what is useful to one s self Proof To act absolutely in obedience to virtue is nothing else but to act according to the laws of one s own nature But we only act in so far as we understand III iii therefore to act in obedience to virtue is in us nothing else but to act to live or to preserve one s being in obedience to reason and that on the basis of seeking what is useful for us IV xxii Coroll Q E D PROP XXV No one wishes to preserve his being for the sake of anything else Proof The endeavour wherewith everything endeavours to persist in its being is defined solely by the essence of the thing itself III vii from this alone and not from the essence of anything else it necessarily follows III vi that everyone endeavours to preserve his being Moreover this proposition is plain from IV xxii Coroll for if a man should endeavour to preserve his being for the sake of anything else the last named thing would obviously be the basis of virtue which by the foregoing corollary is absurd Therefore no one c Q E D PROP XXVI Whatsoever we endeavour in obedience to reason is nothing further than to understand neither does the mind in so far as it makes use of reason judge anything to be useful to it save such things as are conducive to understanding Proof The effort for self preservation is nothing else but the essence of the thing in question III vii which in so far as it exists such as it is is conceived to have force for continuing in existence III vi and doing such things as necessarily follow from its given nature see the Def of Appetite III ix note But the essence of reason is nought else but our mind in so far as it clearly and distinctly understands see the definition in II xl note ii therefore II xl whatsoever we endeavour in obedience to reason is nothing else but to understand Again since this effort of the mind wherewith the mind endeavours in so far as it reasons to preserve its own being is nothing else but understanding this effort at understanding is IV xxii Coroll the first and single basis of virtue nor shall we endeavour to understand things for the sake of any ulterior object IV xxv on the other hand the mind in so far as it reasons will not be able to conceive any good for itself save such things as are conducive to understanding PROP XXVII We know nothing to be certainly good or evil save such things as really conduce to understanding or such as are able to hinder us from understanding Proof The mind in so far as it reasons desires nothing beyond understanding and judges nothing to be useful to itself save such things as conduce to understanding by the foregoing Prop But the mind II xli xliii and note cannot possess certainty concerning anything except in so far as it has adequate ideas or what by II xl note is the same thing in so far as it reasons Therefore we know nothing to be good or evil save such things as really conduce c Q E D PROP XXVIII The mind s highest good is the knowledge of God and the mind s highest virtue is to know God Proof The mind is not capable of understanding anything higher than God that is I Def vi than a Being absolutely infinite and without which I xv nothing can either be or be conceived therefore IV xxvi and xxvii the mind s highest utility or IV Def i good is the knowledge of God Again the mind is active only in so far as it understands and only to the same extent can it be said absolutely to act virtuously The mind s absolute virtue is therefore to understand Now as we have already shown the highest that the mind can understand is God therefore the highest virtue of the mind is to understand or to know God Q E D PROP XXIX No individual thing which is entirely different from our own nature can help or check our power of activity and absolutely nothing can do us good or harm unless it has something in common with our nature Proof The power of every individual thing and consequently the power of man whereby he exists and operates can only be determined by an individual thing I xxviii whose nature II vi must be understood through the same nature as that through which human nature is conceived Therefore our power of activity however it be conceived can be determined and consequently helped or hindered by the power of any other individual thing which has something in common with us but not by the power of anything of which the nature is entirely different from our own and since we call good or evil that which is the cause of pleasure or pain IV viii that is III xi note which increases or diminishes helps or hinders our power of activity therefore that which is entirely different from our nature can neither be to us good nor bad Q E D PROP XXX A thing cannot be bad for us through the quality which it has in common with our nature but it is bad for us in so far as it is contrary to our nature Proof We call a thing bad when it is the cause of pain IV viii that is by the Def which see in III xi note when it diminishes or checks our power of action Therefore if anything were bad for us through that quality which it has in common with our nature it would be able itself to diminish or check that which it has in common with our nature which III iv is absurd Wherefore nothing can be bad for us through that quality which it has in common with us but on the other hand in so far as it is bad for us that is as we have just shown in so far as it can diminish or check our power of action it is contrary to our nature Q E D PROP XXXI In so far as a thing is in harmony with our nature 
5185-24770-0000	train-other-500	it is necessarily good Proof In so far as a thing is in harmony with our nature it cannot be bad for it It will therefore necessarily be either good or indifferent
5185-24770-0001	train-other-500	If it be assumed that it be neither good nor bad nothing will follow from its nature
none	none	 IV Def i which tends to the preservation of our nature 
5185-24770-0002	train-other-500	that is by the hypothesis which tends to the preservation of the thing itself but this
none	none	 III vi is absurd 
5185-24770-0003	train-other-500	therefore in so far as a thing is in harmony with our nature it is necessarily good
none	none	 Q E D 
5185-24770-0004	train-other-500	Corollary Hence it follows that in proportion as a thing is in harmony with our nature so is it more useful or better for us and vice versa in proportion as a thing is more useful for us
5185-24770-0005	train-other-500	so is it more in harmony with our nature For in so far as it is not in harmony with our nature it will necessarily be different therefrom
none	none	 or contrary thereto If different it can neither be good nor bad IV xxix if contrary it will be contrary to that which is in harmony with our nature that is contrary to what is good in short bad Nothing therefore can be good except in so far as it is in harmony with our nature and hence a thing is useful in proportion as it is in harmony with our nature and vice versa Q E D PROP XXXII In so far as men are a prey to passion they cannot in that respect 
5185-24770-0006	train-other-500	be said to be naturally in harmony Proof Things which are said to be in harmony naturally are understood to agree in power
none	none	 III vii not in want of power 
5185-24770-0007	train-other-500	or negation and consequently not in passion
none	none	 III iii note 
5185-24770-0008	train-other-500	wherefore men in so far as they are a prey to their passions cannot be said to be naturally in harmony
none	none	 Q E D 
5185-24770-0009	train-other-500	Note This is also self evident for if we say that white and black only agree in the fact that neither is red we absolutely affirm that the do not agree in any respect
5185-24770-0010	train-other-500	So if we say that a man and a stone only agree in the fact that both are finite wanting in power not existing by the necessity of their own nature or lastly indefinitely surpassed by the power of external causes
none	none	 we should certainly affirm that a man and a stone are in no respect alike therefore things which agree only in negation or in qualities which neither possess really agree in no respect PROP XXXIII Men can differ in nature in so far as they are assailed by those emotions which are passions or passive states and to this extent one and the same man is variable and inconstant Proof The nature or essence of the emotions 
5185-24770-0011	train-other-500	cannot be explained solely through our essence or nature
none	none	 III Deff i ii but it must be defined by the power that is III vii 
5185-24770-0012	train-other-500	by the nature of external causes in comparison with our own hence it follows that there are as many kinds of each emotion as there are external objects whereby we are affected
none	none	 III lvi 
5185-24770-0013	train-other-500	and that men may be differently affected by one and the same object
none	none	 III li and to this extent differ in nature lastly that one and the same man may be differently affected towards the same object and may therefore be variable and inconstant Q E D PROP XXXIV In so far as men are assailed by emotions which are passions they can be contrary one to another 
5185-24770-0014	train-other-500	Proof A man for instance Peter can be the cause of Paul s feeling pain because he Peter possesses something similar to that which Paul hates
none	none	 III xvi 
5185-24770-0015	train-other-500	or because Peter has sole possession of a thing which Paul also loves
none	none	 III xxxii and note or for other causes of which the chief are enumerated in III lv note it may therefore happen that Paul should hate Peter Def of Emotions vii consequently it may easily happen also that Peter should hate Paul in return and that each should endeavour to do the other an injury III xxxix that is IV xxx that they should be contrary one to another But the emotion of pain is always a passion or passive state III lix hence men in so far as they are assailed by emotions which are passions can be contrary one to another Q E D 
5185-24770-0016	train-other-500	Note I said that Paul may hate Peter because he conceives that Peter possesses something which he Paul
none	none	 also loves from this it seems at first sight to follow that these two men through both loving the same thing and consequently through agreement of their respective natures stand in one another s way if this were so Props xxx and xxxi of this part would be untrue But if we give the matter our unbiased attention 
5185-24770-0017	train-other-500	we shall see that the discrepancy vanishes For the two men are not in one another s way in virtue of the agreement of their natures that is through both loving the same thing but in virtue of one differing from the other
5185-24770-0018	train-other-500	For in so far as each loves the same thing the love of each is fostered thereby
none	none	 III xxxi that is Def of the Emotions vi 
5185-24770-0019	train-other-500	the pleasure of each is fostered thereby Wherefore it is far from being the case that they are at variance through both loving the same thing and through the agreement in their natures
5185-24770-0020	train-other-500	The cause for their opposition lies as I have said solely in the fact that they are assumed to differ For we assume that Peter has the idea of the loved object as already in his possession
5185-24770-0021	train-other-500	while Paul has the idea of the loved object as lost Hence the one man will be affected with pleasure the other will be affected with pain
none	none	 and thus they will be at variance one with another We can easily show in like manner that all other causes of hatred depend solely on differences and not on the agreement between men s natures PROP XXXV In so far only as men live in obedience to reason do they always necessarily agree in nature Proof In so far as men are assailed by emotions that are passions they can be different in nature IV xxxiii and at variance one with another But men are only said to be active 
5185-24770-0022	train-other-500	in so far as they act in obedience to reason
none	none	 III iii 
5185-24770-0023	train-other-500	therefore what so ever follows from human nature in so far as it is defined by reason must
none	none	 III Def ii 
5185-24770-0024	train-other-500	be understood solely through human nature as its proximate cause But since every man by the laws of his nature desires that which he deems good and endeavours to remove that which he deems bad
none	none	 IV xix 
5185-24770-0025	train-other-500	and further since that which we in accordance with reason deem good or bad necessarily is good or bad
none	none	 II xli it follows that men in so far as they live in obedience to reason 
5185-24770-0026	train-other-500	necessarily do only such things
none	none	 as are necessarily good for human nature and consequently for each individual man IV xxxi Coroll in other words such things as are in harmony with each man s nature Therefore men in so far as they live in obedience to reason necessarily live always in harmony one with another Q E D Corollary I There is no individual thing in nature which is more useful to man than a man who lives in obedience to reason For that thing is to man most useful which is most in harmony with his nature IV xxxi Coroll that is obviously man But man acts absolutely according to the laws of his nature when he lives in obedience to reason III Def ii and to this extent only is always necessarily in harmony with the nature of another man by the last Prop wherefore among individual things nothing is more useful to man than a man who lives in obedience to reason Q E D Corollary II As every man seeks most that which is useful to him so are men most useful one to another For the more a man seeks what is useful to him and endeavours to preserve himself the more is he endowed with virtue IV xx or what is the same thing IV Def viii the more is he endowed with power to act according to the laws of his own nature that is to live in obedience to reason But men are most in natural harmony when they live in obedience to reason by the last Prop therefore by the foregoing Coroll 
5185-24770-0027	train-other-500	men will be most useful one to another when each seeks most that which is useful to him
none	none	 Q E D 
5185-24770-0028	train-other-500	Note What we have just shown is attested by experience so conspicuously that it is in the mouth of nearly everyone Man is to man a God
none	none	 Yet it rarely happens that men live in obedience to reason for things are so ordered among them 
5185-24770-0029	train-other-500	that they are generally envious and troublesome one to another Nevertheless they are scarcely able to lead a solitary life
none	none	 so that the definition of man as a social animal 
5185-24770-0030	train-other-500	has met with general assent in fact men do derive from social life much more convenience than injury
none	none	 Let satirists then laugh their fill at human affairs 
5185-24770-0031	train-other-500	let theologians rail and let misanthropes praise to their utmost the life of untutored rusticity let them heap contempt on men and praises on beasts when all is said they will find that men can provide for their wants
5185-24770-0032	train-other-500	much more easily by mutual help and that only by uniting their forces can they escape from the dangers that on every side beset them
none	none	 not to say how much more excellent and worthy of our knowledge it is to study the actions of men than the actions of beasts But I will treat of this more at length elsewhere PROP XXXVI The highest good of those who follow virtue is common to all and therefore all can equally rejoice therein Proof To act virtuously is to act in obedience with reason IV xxiv and whatsoever we endeavour to do in obedience to reason is to understand IV xxvi therefore IV xxviii the highest good for those who follow after virtue is to know God that is II xlvii and note a good which is common to all and can be possessed by all men equally in so far as they are of the same nature Q E D Note Someone may ask how it would be if the highest good of those who follow after virtue were not common to all Would it not then follow as above IV xxxiv that men living in obedience to reason that is IV xxxv men in so far as they agree in nature would be at variance one with another To such an inquiry I make answer that it follows not accidentally but from the very nature of reason that main s highest good is common to all inasmuch as it is deduced from the very essence of man in so far as defined by reason and that a man could neither be nor be conceived without the power of taking pleasure in this highest good For it belongs to the essence of the human mind II xlvii to have an adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God PROP XXXVII The good which every man who follows after virtue desires for himself he will also desire for other men and so much the more in proportion as he has a greater knowledge of God Proof Men in so far as they live in obedience to reason are most useful to their fellow men IV xxxv Coroll i therefore IV xix we shall in obedience to reason necessarily endeavour to bring about that men should live in obedience to reason But the good which every man in so far as he is guided by reason or in other words follows after virtue desires for himself is to understand IV xxvi wherefore the good which each follower of virtue seeks for himself he will desire also for others Again desire in so far as it is referred to the mind is the very essence of the mind Def of the Emotions i now the essence of the mind consists in knowledge II xi which involves the knowledge of God II xlvii and without it I xv can neither be nor be conceived therefore in proportion as the mind s essence involves a greater knowledge of God so also will be greater the desire of the follower of virtue that other men should possess that which he seeks as good for himself Q E D Another Proof The good which a man desires for himself and loves he will love more constantly if he sees that others love it also III xxxi he will therefore endeavour that others should love it also and as the good in question is common to all and therefore all can rejoice therein he will endeavour for the same reason to bring about that all should rejoice therein and this he will do the more III xxxvii in proportion as his own enjoyment of the good is greater Note I He who guided by emotion only endeavours to cause others to love what he loves himself and to make the rest of the world live according to his own fancy acts solely by impulse and is therefore hateful especially to those who take delight in something different and accordingly study and by similar impulse endeavour to make men live in accordance with what pleases themselves Again as the highest good sought by men under the guidance of emotion is often such that it can only be possessed by a single individual it follows that those who love it are not consistent in their intentions but while they delight to sing its praises fear to be believed But he who endeavours to lead men by reason does not act by impulse but courteously and kindly and his intention is always consistent Again whatsoever we desire and do whereof we are the cause in so far as we possess the idea of God or know God I set down to Religion The desire of well doing which is engendered by a life according to reason I call piety Further the desire whereby a man living according to reason is bound to associate others with himself in friendship I call honour thirteen by honourable I mean that which is praised by men living according to reason and by base I mean that which is repugnant to the gaining of friendship I have also shown in addition what are the foundations of a state and the difference between true virtue and infirmity may be readily gathered from what I have said namely that true virtue is nothing else but living in accordance with reason while infirmity is nothing else but man s allowing himself to be led by things which are external to himself and to be by them determined to act in a manner demanded by the general disposition of things rather than by his own nature considered solely in itself thirteen Honestas Such are the matters which I engaged to prove in Prop xviii of this Part whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow men but not with beasts or things whose nature is different from our own we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us Nay as everyone s right is defined by his virtue or power men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men Still I do not deny that beasts feel what I deny is that we may not consult our own advantage and use them as we please treating them in the way which best suits us for their nature is not like ours and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions III lvii note It remains for me to explain what I mean by just and unjust sin and merit On these points see the following note Note II In the Appendix to Part I I undertook to explain praise and blame merit and sin justice and injustice Concerning praise and blame I have spoken in III xxix note the time has now come to treat of the remaining terms But I must first say a few words concerning man in the state of nature and in society Every man exists by sovereign natural right and consequently by sovereign natural right performs those actions which follow from the necessity of his own nature therefore by sovereign natural right every man judges what is good and what is bad takes care of his own advantage according to his own disposition IV xix and IV xx avenges the wrongs done to him III xl Coroll ii and endeavours to preserve that which he loves and to destroy that which he hates III xxviii Now if men lived under the guidance of reason everyone would remain in possession of this his right without any injury being done to his neighbour IV xxxv Coroll i But seeing that they are a prey to their emotions which far surpass human power or virtue IV vi they are often drawn in different directions and being at variance one with another IV xxxiii xxxiv stand in need of mutual help IV xxxv note Wherefore in order that men may live together in harmony and may aid one another it is necessary that they should forego their natural right and for the sake of security refrain from all actions which can injure their fellow men The way in which this end can be obtained so that men who are necessarily a prey to their emotions IV iv Coroll inconstant and diverse should be able to render each other mutually secure and feel mutual trust is evident from IV vii and III xxxix It is there shown that an emotion can only be restrained by an emotion stronger than and contrary to itself and that men avoid inflicting injury through fear of incurring a greater injury themselves On this law society can be established so long as it keeps in its own hand the right possessed by everyone of avenging injury and pronouncing on good and evil and provided it also possesses the power to lay down a general rule of conduct and to pass laws sanctioned not by reason which is powerless in restraining emotion but by threats IV xvii note Such a society established with laws and the power of preserving itself is called a State while those who live under its protection are called citizens We may readily understand that there is in the state of nature nothing which by universal consent is pronounced good or bad for in the state of nature everyone thinks solely of his own advantage and according to his disposition with reference only to his individual advantage decides what is good or bad being bound by no law to anyone besides himself In the state of nature therefore sin is inconceivable it can only exist in a state where good and evil are pronounced on by common consent and where everyone is bound to obey the State authority Sin then is nothing else but disobedience which is therefore punished by the right of the State only Obedience on the other hand is set down as merit inasmuch as a man is thought worthy of merit if he takes delight in the advantages which a State provides Again in the state of nature no one is by common consent master of anything nor is there anything in nature which can be said to belong to one man rather than another all things are common to all Hence in the state of nature we can conceive no wish to render to every man his own or to deprive a man of that which belongs to him in other words there is nothing in the state of nature answering to justice and injustice Such ideas are only possible in a social state when it is decreed by common consent what belongs to one man and what to another From all these considerations it is evident that justice and injustice sin and merit are extrinsic ideas and not attributes which display the nature of the mind But I have said enough PROP XXXVIII Whatsoever disposes the human body so as to render it capable of being affected in an increased number of ways or of affecting external bodies in an increased number of ways is useful to man and is so in proportion as the body is thereby rendered more capable of being affected or affecting other bodies in an increased number of ways contrariwise whatsoever renders the body less capable in this respect is hurtful to man Proof Whatsoever thus increases the capabilities of the body increases also the mind s capability of perception II xiv therefore whatsoever thus disposes the body and thus renders it capable is necessarily good or useful IV xxvi xxvii and is so in proportion to the extent to which it can render the body capable contrariwise II xiv IV xxvi xxvii it is hurtful if it renders the body in this respect less capable Q E D PROP XXXIX Whatsoever brings about the preservation of the proportion of motion and rest which the parts of the human body mutually possess is good contrariwise whatsoever causes a change in such proportion is bad Proof The human body needs many other bodies for its preservation II Post iv But that which constitutes the specific reality forma of a human body is that its parts communicate their several motions one to another in a certain fixed proportion Def before Lemma iv after II xiii Therefore whatsoever brings about the preservation of the proportion between motion and rest which the parts of the human body mutually possess preserves the specific reality of the human body and consequently renders the human body capable of being affected in many ways and of affecting external bodies in many ways consequently it is good by the last Prop Again whatsoever brings about a change in the aforesaid proportion causes the human body to assume another specific character in other words see Preface to this Part towards the end though the point is indeed self evident to be destroyed and consequently totally incapable of being affected in an increased numbers of ways therefore it is bad Q E D Note The extent to which such causes can injure or be of service to the mind will be explained in the Fifth Part But I would here remark that I consider that a body undergoes death when the proportion of motion and rest which obtained mutually among its several parts is changed For I do not venture to deny that a human body while keeping the circulation of the blood and other properties wherein the life of a body is thought to consist may none the less be changed into another nature totally different from its own There is no reason which compels me to maintain that a body does not die unless it becomes a corpse nay experience would seem to point to the opposite conclusion It sometimes happens that a man undergoes such changes that I should hardly call him the same As I have heard tell of a certain Spanish poet who had been seized with sickness and though he recovered therefrom yet remained so oblivious of his past life that he would not believe the plays and tragedies he had written to be his own indeed he might have been taken for a grown up child if he had also forgotten his native tongue If this instance seems incredible what shall we say of infants A man of ripe age deems their nature so unlike his own that he can only be persuaded that he too has been an infant by the analogy of other men However I prefer to leave such questions undiscussed lest I should give ground to the superstitious for raising new issues PROP XL Whatsoever conduces to man s social life or causes men to live together in harmony is useful whereas whatsoever brings discord into a State is bad Proof For whatsoever causes men to live together in harmony also causes them to live according to reason IV xxxv and is therefore IV xxvi xxvii good and for the same reason whatsoever brings about discord is bad Q E D PROP XLI

5185-24772-0012	train-other-500	Note Mirth which I have stated to be good can be conceived more easily than it can be observed For the emotions whereby we are daily assailed are generally referred to some part of the body
5185-24772-0013	train-other-500	which is affected more than the rest hence the emotions are generally excessive and so fix the mind in the contemplation of one object that it is unable to think of others and although men as a rule
5185-24772-0014	train-other-500	are a prey to many emotions and very few are found who are always assailed by one and the same yet there are cases where one and the same emotion remains obstinately fixed We sometimes see men so absorbed in one object
5185-24772-0015	train-other-500	that although it be not present they think they have it before them when this is the case with a man who is not asleep we say he is delirious or mad nor are those persons who are inflamed with love and who dream all night and all day about nothing but their mistress or some woman

5185-24772-0021	train-other-500	and have convinced myself as follows No deity nor anyone else save the envious takes pleasure in my infirmity and discomfort nor sets down to my virtue the tears sobs fear and the like
5185-24772-0022	train-other-500	which axe signs of infirmity of spirit on the contrary the greater the pleasure wherewith we are affected the greater the perfection
none	none	 whereto we pass 
5185-24772-0023	train-other-500	in other words the more must we necessarily partake of the divine nature Therefore to make use of what comes in our way and to enjoy it as much as possible not to the point of satiety for that would not be enjoyment
5185-24772-0024	train-other-500	is the part of a wise man I say it is the part of a wise man to refresh and recreate himself with moderate and pleasant food and drink and also with perfumes with the soft beauty of growing plants
5185-24772-0025	train-other-500	with dress with music with many sports with theatres and the like such as every man may make use of without injury to his neighbour For the human body is composed of very numerous parts of diverse nature

none	none	 which follow from the necessity of its own nature 
5185-24772-0027	train-other-500	and consequently so that the mind may also be equally capable of understanding many things simultaneously This way of life then agrees best with our principles and also with general practice
5185-24772-0028	train-other-500	therefore if there be any question of another plan the plan we have mentioned is the best and in every way to be commended
none	none	 There is no need for me to set forth the matter more clearly or in more detail PROP XLVI He who lives under the guidance of reason endeavours as far as possible to render back love or kindness for other men s hatred anger contempt c towards him Proof All emotions of hatred are bad IV xlv Coroll i therefore he who lives under the guidance of reason will endeavour as far as possible to avoid being assailed by such emotions IV xix consequently he will also endeavour to prevent others being so assailed IV xxxvii But hatred is increased by being reciprocated and can be quenched by love III xliii so that hatred may pass into love III xliv therefore he who lives under the guidance of reason will endeavour to repay hatred with love that is with kindness Q E D Note He who chooses to avenge wrongs with hatred is assuredly wretched But he who strives to conquer hatred with love fights his battle in joy and confidence he withstands many as easily as one and has very little need of fortune s aid Those whom he vanquishes yield joyfully not through failure but through increase in their powers all these consequences follow so plainly from the mere definitions of love and understanding that I have no need to prove them in detail PROP XLVII Emotions of hope and fear cannot be in themselves good Proof Emotions of hope and fear cannot exist without pain For fear is pain Def of the Emotions xiii and hope Def of the Emotions Explanation xii and xiii cannot exist without fear therefore IV xli these emotions cannot be good in themselves but only in so far as they can restrain excessive pleasure IV xliii Q E D Note We may add that these emotions show defective knowledge and an absence of power in the mind for the same reason confidence despair joy and disappointment are signs of a want of mental power For although confidence and joy are pleasurable emotions they nevertheless imply a preceding pain namely hope and fear Wherefore the more we endeavour to be guided by reason the less do we depend on hope we endeavour to free ourselves from fear and as far as we can to dominate fortune directing our actions by the sure counsels of wisdom PROP XLVIII The emotions of over esteem and disparagement are always bad Proof These emotions see Def of the Emotions xxi xxii are repugnant to reason and are therefore IV xxvi xxvii bad Q E D PROP XLIX Over esteem is apt to render its object proud Proof If we see that any one rates us too highly for love s sake we are apt to become elated III xli or to be pleasurably affected Def of the Emotions xxx the good which we hear of ourselves we readily believe III xxv and therefore for love s sake rate ourselves too highly in other words we are apt to become proud Q E D PROP L Pity in a man who lives under the guidance of reason is in itself bad and useless Proof Pity Def of the Emotions xviii is a pain and therefore IV xli is in itself bad The good effect which follows namely our endeavour to free the object of our pity from misery is an action which we desire to do solely at the dictation of reason IV xxxvii only at the dictation of reason are we able to perform any action which we know for certain to be good IV xxvii thus in a man who lives under the guidance of reason pity in itself is useless and bad Q E D Note He who rightly realizes that all things follow from the necessity of the divine nature and come to pass in accordance with the eternal laws and rules of nature will not find anything worthy of hatred derision or contempt nor will he bestow pity on anything but to the utmost extent of human virtue he will endeavour to do well as the saying is and to rejoice We may add that he who is easily touched with compassion and is moved by another s sorrow or tears often does something which he afterwards regrets partly because we can never be sure that an action caused by emotion is good partly because we are easily deceived by false tears I am in this place expressly speaking of a man living under the guidance of reason He who is moved to help others neither by reason nor by compassion is rightly styled inhuman for III xxvii he seems unlike a man PROP LI Approval is not repugnant to reason but can agree therewith and arise therefrom Proof Approval is love towards one who has done good to another Def of the Emotions xix therefore it may be referred to the mind in so far as the latter is active III lix that is III iii in so far as it understands therefore it is in agreement with reason c Q E D Another Proof He who lives under the guidance of reason desires for others the good which he seeks for himself IV xxxvii wherefore from seeing someone doing good to his fellow his own endeavour to do good is aided in other words he will feel pleasure III xi note accompanied by the idea of the benefactor Therefore he approves of him Q E D Note Indignation as we defined it Def of the Emotions xx is necessarily evil IV xlv we may however remark that when the sovereign power for the sake of preserving peace punishes a citizen who has injured another it should not be said to be indignant with the criminal for it is not incited by hatred to ruin him it is led by a sense of duty to punish him PROP LII Self approval may arise from reason and that which arises from reason is the highest possible Proof Self approval is pleasure arising from a man s contemplation of himself and his own power of action Def of the Emotions xxv But a man s true power of action or virtue is reason herself III iii as the said man clearly and distinctly contemplates her II xl xliii therefore self approval arises from reason Again when a man is contemplating himself he only perceived clearly and distinctly or adequately such things as follow from his power of action III Def ii that is III iii from his power of understanding therefore in such contemplation alone does the highest possible self approval arise Q E D Note Self approval is in reality the highest object for which we can hope For as we showed in IV xxv no one endeavours to preserve his being for the sake of any ulterior object and as this approval is more and more fostered and strengthened by praise III liii Coroll and on the contrary III lv Coroll is more and more disturbed by blame fame becomes the most powerful of incitements to action and life under disgrace is almost unendurable PROP LIII Humility is not a virtue or does not arise from reason Proof Humility is pain arising from a man s contemplation of his own infirmities Def of the Emotions xxvi But in so far as a man knows himself by true reason he is assumed to understand his essence that is his power III vii Wherefore if a man in self contemplation perceives any infirmity in himself it is not by virtue of his understanding himself but III lv by virtue of his power of activity being checked But if we assume that a man perceives his own infirmity by virtue of understanding something stronger than himself by the knowledge of which he determines his own power of activity this is the same as saying that we conceive that a man understands himself distinctly IV xxvi because fourteen his power of activity is aided Wherefore humility or the pain which arises from a man s contemplation of his own infirmity does not arise from the contemplation or reason and is not a virtue but a passion Q E D fourteen Land reads Quod ipsius agendi potentia juvatur which I have translated above He suggests as alternative readings to quod quo whereby and quodque and that PROP LIV Repentance is not a virtue or does not arise from reason but he who repents of an action is doubly wretched or infirm Proof The first part of this proposition is proved like the foregoing one The second part is proved from the mere definition of the emotion in question Def of the Emotions xxvii For the man allows himself to be overcome first by evil desires secondly by pain Note As men seldom live under the guidance of reason these two emotions namely Humility and Repentance as also Hope and Fear bring more good than harm hence as we must sin we had better sin in that direction For if all men who are a prey to emotion were all equally proud they would shrink from nothing and would fear nothing how then could they be joined and linked together in bonds of union The crowd plays the tyrant when it is not in fear hence we need not wonder that the prophets who consulted the good not of a few but of all so strenuously commended Humility Repentance and Reverence Indeed those who are a prey to these emotions may be led much more easily than others to live under the guidance of reason that is to become free and to enjoy the life of the blessed PROP LV Extreme pride or dejection indicates extreme ignorance of self Proof This is evident from Def of the Emotions xxviii and xxix PROP LVI Extreme pride or dejection indicates extreme infirmity of spirit Proof The first foundation of virtue is self preservation IV xxii Coroll under the guidance of reason IV xxiv He therefore who is ignorant of himself is ignorant of the foundation of all virtues and consequently of all virtues Again to act virtuously is merely to act under the guidance of reason IV xxiv now he that acts under the guidance of reason must necessarily know that he so acts II xliii Therefore he who is in extreme ignorance of himself and consequently of all virtues acts least in obedience to virtue in other words IV Def viii is most infirm of spirit Thus extreme pride or dejection indicates extreme infirmity of spirit Q E D Corollary Hence it most clearly follows that the proud and the dejected specially fall a prey to the emotions Note Yet dejection can be more easily corrected than pride for the latter being a pleasurable emotion and the former a painful emotion the pleasurable is stronger than the painful IV xviii PROP LVII The proud man delights in the company of flatterers and parasites but hates the company of the high minded Proof Pride is pleasure arising from a man s over estimation of himself Def of the Emotions xxviii and vi this estimation the proud man will endeavour to foster by all the means in his power III xiii note he will therefore delight in the company of flatterers and parasites whose character is too well known to need definition here and will avoid the company of high minded men who value him according to his deserts Q E D Note It would be too long a task to enumerate here all the evil results of pride inasmuch as the proud are a prey to all the emotions though to none of them less than to love and pity I cannot however pass over in silence the fact that a man may be called proud from his underestimation of other people and therefore pride in this sense may be defined as pleasure arising from the false opinion whereby a man may consider himself superior to his fellows The dejection which is the opposite quality to this sort of pride may be defined as pain arising from the false opinion whereby a man may think himself inferior to his fellows Such being the ease we can easily see that a proud man is necessarily envious III xli note and only takes pleasure in the company who fool his weak mind to the top of his bent and make him insane instead of merely foolish Though dejection is the emotion contrary to pride yet is the dejected man very near akin to the proud man For inasmuch as his pain arises from a comparison between his own infirmity and other men s power or virtue it will be removed or in other words he will feel pleasure if his imagination be occupied in contemplating other men s faults whence arises the proverb The unhappy are comforted by finding fellow sufferers Contrariwise he will be the more pained in proportion as he thinks himself inferior to others hence none are so prone to envy as the dejected they are specially keen in observing men s actions with a view to fault finding rather than correction in order to reserve their praises for dejection and to glory therein though all the time with a dejected air These effects follow as necessarily from the said emotion as it follows from the nature of a triangle that the three angles are equal to two right angles I have already said that I call these and similar emotions bad solely in respect to what is useful to man The laws of nature have regard to nature s general order whereof man is but a part I mention this in passing lest any should think that I have wished to set forth the faults and irrational deeds of men rather than the nature and properties of things For as I said in the preface to the third Part I regard human emotions and their properties as on the same footing with other natural phenomena Assuredly human emotions indicate the power and ingenuity of nature if not of human nature quite as fully as other things which we admire and which we delight to contemplate But I pass on to note those qualities in the emotions which bring advantage to man or inflict injury upon him PROP LVIII Honour gloria is not repugnant to reason but may arise therefrom Proof This is evident from Def of the Emotions xxx and also from the definition of an honourable man IV xxxvii note i Note Empty honour as it is styled is self approval fostered only by the good opinion of the populace when this good opinion ceases there ceases also the self approval in other words the highest object of each man s love IV lii note consequently he whose honour is rooted in popular approval must day by day anxiously strive act and scheme in order to retain his reputation For the populace is variable and inconstant so that if a reputation be not kept up it quickly withers away Everyone wishes to catch popular applause for himself and readily represses the fame of others The object of the strife being estimated as the greatest of all goods each combatant is seized with a fierce desire to put down his rivals in every possible way till he who at last comes out victorious is more proud of having done harm to others than of having done good to himself This sort of honour then is really empty being nothing The points to note concerning shame may easily be inferred from what was said on the subject of mercy and repentance I will only add that shame like compassion though not a virtue is yet good in so far as it shows that the feeler of shame is really imbued with the desire to live honourably in the same way as suffering is good as showing that the injured part is not mortified Therefore though a man who feels shame is sorrowful he is yet more perfect than he who is shameless and has no desire to live honourably Such are the points which I undertook to remark upon concerning the emotions of pleasure and pain as for the desires they are good or bad according as they spring from good or evil emotions But all in so far as they are engendered in us by emotions wherein the mind is passive are blind as is evident from what was said in IV xliv note and would be useless if men could easily be induced to live by the guidance of reason only as I will now briefly show PROP LIX To all the actions whereto we are determined by emotion wherein the mind is passive we can be determined without emotion by reason Proof To act rationally is nothing else III iii and Def ii but to perform those actions which follow from the necessity of our nature considered in itself alone But pain is bad in so far as it diminishes or checks the power of action IV xli wherefore we cannot by pain be determined to any action which we should be unable to perform under the guidance of reason Again pleasure is bad only in so far as it hinders a man s capability for action IV xli xliii therefore to this extent we could not be determined by it to any action which we could not perform under the guidance of reason Lastly pleasure in so far as it is good is in harmony with reason for it consists in the fact that a man s capability for action is increased or aided nor is the mind passive therein except in so far as a man s power of action is not increased to the extent of affording him an adequate conception of himself and his actions III iii and note Wherefore if a man who is pleasurably affected be brought to such a state of perfection that he gains an adequate conception of himself and his own actions he will be equally nay more capable of those actions to which he is determined by emotion wherein the mind is passive But all emotions are attributable to pleasure to pain or to desire Def of the Emotions iv explanation and desire Def of the Emotions i is nothing else but the attempt to act therefore to all actions c Q E D Another Proof A given action is called bad in so far as it arises from one being affected by hatred or any evil emotion But no action considered in itself alone is either good or bad as we pointed out in the preface to Pt IV one and the same action being sometimes good sometimes bad wherefore to the action which is sometimes bad or arises from some evil emotion we may be led by reason IV xix Q E D Note An example will put this point in a clearer light The action of striking in so far as it is considered physically and in so far as we merely look to the fact that a man raises his arm clenches his fist and moves his whole arm violently downwards is a virtue or excellence which is conceived as proper to the structure of the human body If then a man moved by anger or hatred is led to clench his fist or to move his arm this result takes place as we showed in Pt II because one and the same action can be associated with various mental images of things therefore we may be determined to the performance of one and the same action by confused ideas or by clear and distinct ideas Hence it is evident that every desire which springs from emotion wherein the mind is passive would become useless if men could be guided by reason Let us now see why desire which arises from emotion wherein the mind is passive is called by us blind PROP LX Desire arising from a pleasure or pain that is not attributable to the whole body but only to one or certain parts thereof is without utility in respect to a man as a whole Proof Let it be assumed for instance that A a part of a body is so strengthened by some external cause that it prevails over the remaining parts IV vi This part will not endeavour to do away with its own powers in order that the other parts of the body may perform its office for this it would be necessary for it to have a force or power of doing away with its own powers which III vi is absurd The said part and consequently the mind also will endeavour to preserve its condition Wherefore desire arising from a pleasure of the kind aforesaid has no utility in reference to a man as a whole If it be assumed on the other hand that the part A be checked so that the remaining parts prevail it may be proved in the same manner that desire arising from pain has no utility in respect to a man as a whole Q E D Note As pleasure is generally IV xliv note attributed to one part of the body we generally desire to preserve our being with out taking into consideration our health as a whole to which it may be added that the desires which have most hold over us IV ix take account of the present and not of the future PROP LXI Desire which springs from reason cannot be excessive Proof Desire Def of the Emotions i considered absolutely is the actual essence of man in so far as it is conceived as in any way determined to a particular activity by some given modification of itself Hence desire which arises from reason that is III iii which is engendered in us in so far as we act is the actual essence or nature of man in so far as it is conceived as determined to such activities as are adequately conceived through man s essence only III Def ii Now if such desire could be excessive human nature considered in itself alone would be able to exceed itself or would be able to do more than it can a manifest contradiction Therefore such desire cannot be excessive Q E D PROP LXII In so far as the mind conceives a thing under the dictates of reason it is affected equally whether the idea be of a thing future past or present Proof Whatsoever the mind conceives under the guidance of reason it conceives under the form of eternity or necessity II xliv Coroll ii and is therefore affected with the same certitude II xliii and note Wherefore whether the thing be present past or future the mind conceives it under the same necessity and is affected with the same certitude and whether the idea be of something present past or future it will in all cases be equally true II xli that is it will always possess the same properties of an adequate idea II Def iv therefore in so far as the mind conceives things under the dictates of reason it is affected in the same manner whether the idea be of a thing future past or present Q E D Note If we could possess an adequate knowledge of the duration of things and could determine by reason their periods of existence we should contemplate things future with the same emotion as things present and the mind would desire as though it were present the good which it conceived as future consequently it would necessarily neglect a lesser good in the present for the sake of a greater good in the future and would in no wise desire that which is good in the present but a source of evil in the future as we shall presently show However we can have but a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of things II xxxi and the periods of their existence II xliv note we can only determine by imagination which is not so powerfully affected by the future as by the present Hence such true knowledge of good and evil as we possess is merely abstract or general and the judgment which we pass on the order of things and the connection of causes with a view to determining what is good or bad for us in the present is rather imaginary than real Therefore it is nothing wonderful if the desire arising from such knowledge of good and evil in so far as it looks on into the future be more readily checked than the desire of things which are agreeable at the present time Cf IV xvi PROP LXIII He who is led by fear and does good in order to escape evil is not led by reason Proof All the emotions which are attributable to the mind as active or in other words to reason are emotions of pleasure and desire III lix therefore he who is led by fear and does good in order to escape evil is not led by reason Note Superstitions persons who know better how to rail at vice than how to teach virtue and who strive not to guide men by reason but so to restrain them that they would rather escape evil than love virtue have no other aim but to make others as wretched as themselves wherefore it is nothing wonderful if they be generally troublesome and odious to their fellow men Corollary Under desire which springs from reason we seek good directly and shun evil indirectly Proof Desire which springs from reason can only spring from a pleasurable emotion wherein the mind is not passive III lix in other words from a pleasure which cannot be excessive IV lxi and not from pain wherefore this desire springs from the knowledge of good not of evil IV viii hence under the guidance of reason we seek good directly and only by implication shun evil Q E D Note This Corollary may be illustrated by the example of a sick and a healthy man The sick man through fear of death eats what he naturally shrinks from but the healthy man takes pleasure in his food and thus gets a better enjoyment out of life than if he were in fear of death and desired directly to avoid it So a judge who condemns a criminal to death not from hatred or anger but from love of the public well being is guided solely by reason PROP LXIV The knowledge of evil is an inadequate knowledge Proof The knowledge of evil IV viii is pain in so far as we are conscious thereof Now pain is the transition to a lesser perfection Def of the Emotions iii and therefore cannot be understood through man s nature III vi and vii therefore it is a passive state III Def ii which III iii depends on inadequate ideas consequently the knowledge thereof II xxix namely the knowledge of evil is inadequate Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that if the human mind possessed only adequate ideas it would form no conception of evil PROP LXV Under the guidance of reason we should pursue the greater of two goods and the lesser of two evils Proof A good which prevents our enjoyment of a greater good is in reality an evil for we apply the terms good and bad to things in so far as we compare them one with another see preface to this Part therefore evil is in reality a lesser good hence under the guidance of reason we seek or pursue only the greater good and the lesser evil Q E D Corollary We may under the guidance of reason pursue the lesser evil as though it were the greater good and we may shun the lesser good which would be the cause of the greater evil For the evil which is here called the lesser is really good and the lesser good is really evil wherefore we may seek the former and shun the latter Q E D PROP LXVI We may under the guidance of reason seek a greater good in the future in preference to a lesser good in the present and we may seek a lesser evil in the present in preference to a greater evil in the future fifteen fifteen Maltim praesens minus prae majori futuro Van Vloten Bruder reads Malum praesens minus quod causa est faturi alicujus mali The last word of the latter is an obvious misprint and is corrected by the Dutch translator into majoris boni Pollock p two hundred sixty eight note Proof If the mind could have an adequate knowledge of things future it would be affected towards what is future in the same way as towards what is present IV lxii wherefore looking merely to reason as in this proposition we are assumed to do there is no difference whether the greater good or evil be assumed as present or assumed as future hence IV lxv we may seek a greater good in the future in preference to a lesser good in the present c Q E D Corollary We may under the guidance of reason seek a lesser evil in the present because it is the cause of a greater good in the future and we may shun a lesser good in the present because it is the cause of a greater evil in the future This Corollary is related to the foregoing Proposition as the Corollary to IV lxv is related to the said IV lxv Note If these statements be compared with what we have pointed out concerning the strength of the emotions in this Part up to Prop xviii we shall readily see the difference between a man who is led solely by emotion or opinion and a man who is led by reason The former whether will or no performs actions whereof he is utterly ignorant the latter is his own master and only performs such actions as he knows are of primary importance in life and therefore chiefly desires wherefore I call the former a slave and the latter a free man concerning whose disposition and manner of life it will be well to make a few observations PROP LXVII A free man thinks of death least of all things and his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life Proof A free man is one who lives under the guidance of reason who is not led by fear IV lxiii but who directly desires that which is good IV lxiii Coroll in other words IV xxiv who strives to act to live and to preserve his being on the basis of seeking his own true advantage wherefore such an one thinks of nothing less than of death but his wisdom is a meditation of life Q E D PROP LXVIII If men were born free they would so long as they remained free form no conception of good and evil Proof I call free him who is led solely by reason he therefore who is born free and who remains free has only adequate ideas therefore IV lxiv Coroll he has no conception of evil or consequently good and evil being correlative of good Q E D Note It is evident from IV iv that the hypothesis of this Proposition is false and inconceivable except in so far as we look solely to the nature of man or rather to God not in so far as the latter is infinite but only in so far as he is the cause of man s existence This and other matters which we have already proved seem to have been signifieded by Moses in the history of the first man For in that narrative no other power of God is conceived save that whereby he created man that is the power wherewith he provided solely for man s advantage it is stated that God forbade man being free to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and that as soon as man should have eaten of it he would straightway fear death rather than desire to live Further it is written that when man had found a wife who was in entire harmony with his nature he knew that there could be nothing in nature which could be more useful to him but that after he believed the beasts to be like himself he straightway began to imitate their emotions III xxvii and to lose his freedom this freedom was afterwards recovered by the patriarchs led by the spirit of Christ that is by the idea of God whereon alone it depends that man may be free and desire for others the good which he desires for himself as we have shown above IV xxxvii PROP LXIX The virtue of a free man is seen to be as great when it declines dangers as when it overcomes them Proof Emotion can only be checked or removed by an emotion contrary to itself and possessing more power in restraining emotion IV vii But blind daring and fear are emotions which can be conceived as equally great IV v and iii hence no less virtue or firmness is required in checking daring than in checking fear III lix note in other words Def of the Emotions xl and xli the free man shows as much virtue when he declines dangers as when he strives to overcome them Q E D Corollary The free man is as courageous in timely retreat as in combat or a free man shows equal courage or presence of mind whether he elect to give battle or to retreat Note What courage animositas is and what I mean thereby I explained in III lix note By danger I mean everything which can give rise to any evil such as pain hatred discord c PROP LXX The free man who lives among the ignorant strives as far as he can to avoid receiving favours from them Proof Everyone judges what is good according to his disposition III xxxix note wherefore an ignorant man who has conferred a benefit on another puts his own estimate upon it and if it appears to be estimated less highly by the receiver will feel pain III xlii But the free man only desires to join other men to him in friendship IV xxxvii not repaying their benefits with others reckoned as of like value but guiding himself and others by the free decision of reason and doing only such things as he knows to be of primary importance Therefore the free man lest he should become hateful to the ignorant or follow their desires rather than reason will endeavour as far as he can to avoid receiving their favours Note I say as far as he can For though men be ignorant yet are they men and in cases of necessity could afford us human aid the most excellent of all things therefore it is often necessary to accept favours from them and consequently to repay such favours in kind we must therefore exercise caution in declining favours lest we should have the appearance of despising those who bestow them or of being from avaricious motives unwilling to requite them and so give ground for offence by the very fact of striving to avoid it Thus in declining favours we must look to the requirements of utility and courtesy PROP LXXI Only free men are thoroughly grateful one to another Proof Only free men are thoroughly useful one to another and associated among themselves by the closest necessity of friendship IV xxxv and Coroll i only such men endeavour with mutual zeal of love to confer benefits on each other IV xxxvii and therefore only they are thoroughly grateful one to another Q E D Note The goodwill which men who are led by blind desire have for one another is generally a bargaining or enticement rather than pure goodwill Moreover ingratitude is not an emotion Yet it is base inasmuch as it generally shows that a man is affected by excessive hatred anger pride avarice c He who by reason of his folly knows not how to return benefits is not ungrateful much less he who is not gained over by the gifts of a courtesan to serve her lust or by a thief to conceal his thefts or by any similar persons Contrariwise such an one shows a constant mind inasmuch as he cannot by any gifts be corrupted to his own or the general hurt PROP LXXII The free man never acts fraudulently but always in good faith Proof If it be asked What should a man s conduct be in a case where he could by breaking faith free himself from the danger of present death Would not his plan of self preservation completely persuade him to deceive This may be answered by pointing out that if reason persuaded him to act thus it would persuade all men to act in a similar manner in which case reason would persuade men not to agree in good faith to unite their forces or to have laws in common that is not to have any general laws which is absurd PROP LXXIII The man who is guided by reason is more free in a State where he lives under a general system of law than in solitude where he is independent Proof The man who is guided by reason does not obey through fear IV lxiii but in so far as he endeavours to preserve his being according to the dictates of reason that is IV lxvi note in so far as he endeavours to live in freedom he desires to order his life according to the general good IV xxxvii and consequently as we showed in IV xxxvii note ii to live according to the laws of his country Therefore the free man in order to enjoy greater freedom desires to possess the general rights of citizenship Q E D Note These and similar observations which we have made on man s true freedom may be referred to strength that is to courage and nobility of character III lix note I do not think it worth while to prove separately all the properties of strength much less need I show that he that is strong hates no man is angry with no man envies no man is indignant with no man despises no man and least of all things is proud These propositions and all that relate to the true way of life and religion are easily proved from IV xxxvii and IV xlvi namely that hatred should be overcome with love and that every man should desire for others the good which he seeks for himself We may also repeat what we drew attention to in the note to IV l and in other places namely that the strong man has ever first in his thoughts that all things follow from the necessity of the divine nature so that whatsoever he deems to be hurtful and evil and whatsoever accordingly seems to him impious horrible unjust and base assumes that appearance owing to his own disordered fragmentary and confused view of the universe Wherefore he strives before all things to conceive things as they really are and to remove the hindrances to true knowledge such as are hatred anger envy derision pride and similar emotions which I have mentioned above Thus he endeavours as we said before as far as in him lies to do good and to go on his way rejoicing How far human virtue is capable of attaining to such a condition and what its powers may be I will prove in the following Part APPENDIX What have said in this Part concerning the right way of life has not been arranged so as to admit of being seen at one view but has been set forth piece meal according as I thought each Proposition could most readily be deduced from what preceded it I propose therefore to rearrange my remarks and to bring them under leading heads I All our endeavours or desires so follow from the necessity of our nature that they can be understood either through it alone as their proximate cause or by virtue of our being a part of nature which cannot be adequately conceived through itself without other individuals II Desires which follow from our nature in such a manner that they can be understood through it alone are those which are referred to the mind in so far as the latter is conceived to consist of adequate ideas the remaining desires are only referred to the mind in so far as it conceives things inadequately and their force and increase are generally defined not by the power of man but by the power of things external to us wherefore the former are rightly called actions the latter passions for the former always indicate our power the latter on the other hand show our infirmity and fragmentary knowledge III Our actions that is those desires which are defined by man s power or reason are always good The rest may be either good or bad IV Thus in life it is before all things useful to perfect the understanding or reason as far as we can and in this alone man s highest happiness or blessedness consists indeed blessedness is nothing else but the contentment of spirit which arises from the intuitive knowledge of God now to perfect the understanding is nothing else but to understand God God s attributes and the actions which follow from the necessity of his nature Wherefore of a man who is led by reason the ultimate aim or highest desire whereby he seeks to govern all his fellows is that whereby he is brought to the adequate conception of himself and of all things within the scope of his intelligence V Therefore without intelligence there is not rational life and things are only good in so far as they aid man in his enjoyment of the intellectual life which is defined by intelligence Contrariwise whatsoever things hinder man s perfecting of his reason and capability to enjoy the rational life are alone called evil VI As all things whereof man is the efficient cause are necessarily good no evil can befall man except through external causes namely by virtue of man being a part of universal nature whose laws human nature is compelled to obey and to conform to in almost infinite ways VII It is impossible that man should not be a part of nature or that he should not follow her general order but if he be thrown among individuals whose nature is in harmony with his own his power of action will thereby be aided and fostered whereas if he be thrown among such as are but very little in harmony with his nature he will hardly be able to accommodate himself to them without undergoing a great change himself VIII Whatsoever in nature we deem to be evil or to be capable of injuring our faculty for existing and enjoying the rational life we may endeavour to remove in whatever way seems safest to us on the other hand whatsoever we deem to be good or useful for preserving our being and enabling us to enjoy the rational life we may appropriate to our use and employ as we think best Everyone without exception may by sovereign right of nature do whatsoever he thinks will advance his own interest IX Nothing can be in more harmony with the nature of any given thing than other individuals of the same species therefore cf vii for man in the preservation of his being and the enjoyment of the rational life there is nothing more useful than his fellow man who is led by reason Further as we know not anything among individual things which is more excellent than a man led by reason no man can better display the power of his skill and disposition than in so training men that they come at last to live under the dominion of their own reason X In so far as men are influenced by envy or any kind of hatred one towards another they are at variance and are therefore to be feared in proportion as they are more powerful than their fellows XI Yet minds are not conquered by force but by love and high mindedness XII It is before all things useful to men to associate their ways of life to bind themselves together with such bonds as they think most fitted to gather them all into unity and generally to do whatsoever serves to strengthen friendship XIII But for this there is need of skill and watchfulness For men are diverse seeing that those who live under the guidance of reason are few yet are they generally envious and more prone to revenge than to sympathy No small force of character is therefore required to take everyone as he is and to restrain one s self from imitating the emotions of others But those who carp at mankind and are more skilled in railing at vice than in instilling virtue and who break rather than strengthen men s dispositions are hurtful both to themselves and others Thus many from too great impatience of spirit or from misguided religious zeal have preferred to live among brutes rather than among men as boys or youths who cannot peaceably endure the chidings of their parents will enlist as soldiers and choose the hardships of war and the despotic discipline in preference to the comforts of home and the admonitions of their father suffering any burden to be put upon them so long as they may spite their parents XIV Therefore although men are generally governed in everything by their own lusts yet their association in common brings many more advantages than drawbacks Wherefore it is better to bear patiently the wrongs they may do us and to strive to promote whatsoever serves to bring about harmony and friendship XV Those things which beget harmony are such as are attributable to justice equity and honourable living For men brook ill not only what is unjust or iniquitous but also what is reckoned disgraceful or that a man should slight the received customs of their society For winning love those qualities are especially necessary which have regard to religion and piety cf IV xxxvii notes i ii xlvi note and lxxiii note XVI Further harmony is often the result of fear but such harmony is insecure Further fear arises from infirmity of spirit and moreover belongs not to the exercise of reason the same is true of compassion though this latter seems to bear a certain resemblance to piety XVII Men are also gained over by liberality especially such as have not the means to buy what is necessary to sustain life However to give aid to every poor man is far beyond the power and the advantage of any private person For the riches of any private person are wholly inadequate to meet such a call Again an individual man s resources of character are too limited for him to be able to make all men his friends Hence providing for the poor is a duty which falls on the State as a whole and has regard only to the general advantage XVIII In accepting favours and in returning gratitude our duty must be wholly different cf IV lxx note lxxi note XIX Again meretricious love that is the lust of generation arising from bodily beauty and generally every sort of love which owns anything save freedom of soul as its cause readily passes into hate unless indeed what is worse it is a species of madness and then it promotes discord rather than harmony cf III xxxi Coroll XX As concerning marriage it is certain that this is in harmony with reason if the desire for physical union be not engendered solely by bodily beauty but also by the desire to beget children and to train them up wisely and moreover if the love of both to wit of the man and of the woman is not caused by bodily beauty only but also by freedom of soul XXI Furthermore flattery begets harmony but only by means of the vile offence of slavishness or treachery None are more readily taken with flattery than the proud who wish to be first but are not XXII There is in abasement a spurious appearance of piety and religion Although abasement is the opposite to pride yet is he that abases himself most akin to the proud IV lvii note XXIII Shame also brings about harmony but only in such matters as cannot be hid Further as shame is a species of pain it does not concern the exercise of reason XXIV The remaining emotions of pain towards men are directly opposed to justice equity honour piety and religion and although indignation seems to bear a certain resemblance to equity yet is life but lawless where every man may pass judgment on another s deeds and vindicate his own or other men s rights XXV Correctness of conduct modestia that is the desire of pleasing men which is determined by reason is attributable to piety as we said in IV xxxvii note i But if it spring from emotion it is ambition or the desire whereby men under the false cloak of piety generally stir up discords and seditions For he who desires to aid his fellows either in word or in deed so that they may together enjoy the highest good he I say will before all things strive to win them over with love not to draw them into admiration so that a system may be called after his name nor to give any cause for envy Further in his conversation he will shrink from talking of men s faults and will be careful to speak but sparingly of human infirmity but he will dwell at length on human virtue or power and the way whereby it may be perfected Thus will men be stirred not by fear nor by aversion but only by the emotion of joy to endeavour so far as in them lies to live in obedience to reason XXVI Besides men we know of no particular thing in nature in whose mind we may rejoice and whom we can associate with ourselves in friendship or any sort of fellowship therefore whatsoever there be in nature besides man a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve but to preserve or destroy according to its various capabilities and to adapt to our use as best we may XXVII The advantage which we derive from things external to us besides the experience and knowledge which we acquire from observing them and from recombining their elements in different forms is principally the preservation of the body from this point of view those things are most useful which can so feed and nourish the body that all its parts may rightly fulfil their functions For in proportion as the body is capable of being affected in a greater variety of ways and of affecting external bodies in a great number of ways so much the more is the mind capable of thinking IV xxxviii xxxix But there seem to be very few things of this kind in nature wherefore for the due nourishment of the body we must use many foods of diverse nature For the human body is composed of very many parts of different nature which stand in continual need of varied nourishment so that the whole body may be equally capable of doing everything that can follow from its own nature and consequently that the mind also may be equally capable of forming many perceptions XXVIII Now for providing these nourishments the strength of each individual would hardly suffice if men did not lend one another mutual aid But money has furnished us with a token for everything hence it is with the notion of money that the mind of the multitude is chiefly engrossed nay it can hardly conceive any kind of pleasure which is not accompanied with the idea of money as cause XXIX This result is the fault only of those who seek money not from poverty or to supply their necessary wants but because they have learned the arts of gain wherewith they bring themselves to great splendour Certainly they nourish their bodies according to custom but scantily believing that they lose as much of their wealth as they spend on the preservation of their body But they who know the true use of money and who fix the measure of wealth solely with regard to their actual needs live content with little XXX As therefore those things are good which assist the various parts of the body and enable them to perform their functions and as pleasure consists in an increase of or aid to man s power in so far as he is composed of mind and body it follows that all those things which bring pleasure are good But seeing that things do not work with the object of giving us pleasure and that their power of action is not tempered to suit our advantage and lastly that pleasure is generally referred to one part of the body more than to the other parts therefore most emotions of pleasure unless reason and watchfulness be at hand and consequently the desires arising therefrom may become excessive Moreover we may add that emotion leads us to pay most regard to what is agreeable in the present nor can we estimate what is future with emotions equally vivid IV xliv note and lx note XXXI Superstition on the other hand seems to account as good all that brings pain and as bad all that brings pleasure However as we said above IV xlv note none but the envious take delight in my infirmity and trouble For the greater the pleasure whereby we are affected the greater is the perfection whereto we pass and consequently the more do we partake of the divine nature no pleasure can ever be evil which is regulated by a true regard for our advantage But contrariwise he who is led by fear and does good only to avoid evil is not guided by reason XXXII But human power is extremely limited and is infinitely surpassed by the power of external causes we have not therefore an absolute power of shaping to our use those things which are without us Nevertheless we shall bear with an equal mind all that happens to us in contravention to the claims of our own advantage so long as we are conscious that we have done our duty and that the power which we possess is not sufficient to enable us to protect ourselves completely remembering that we are a part of universal nature and that we follow her order If we have a clear and distinct understanding of this that part of our nature which is defined by intelligence in other words the better part of ourselves will assuredly acquiesce in what befalls us and in such acquiescence will endeavour to persist For in so far as we are intelligent beings we cannot desire anything save that which is necessary nor yield absolute acquiescence to anything save to that which is true wherefore in so far as we have a right understanding of these things the endeavour of the better part of ourselves is in harmony with the order of nature as a whole PART V Of the Power of the Understanding or of Human Freedom PREFACE At length I pass to the remaining portion of my Ethics which is concerned with the way leading to freedom I shall therefore treat therein of the power of the reason showing how far the reason can control the emotions and what is the nature of Mental Freedom or Blessedness we shall then be able to see how much more powerful the wise man is than the ignorant It is no part of my design to point out the method and means whereby the understanding may be perfected nor to show the skill whereby the body may be so tended as to be capable of the due performance of its functions The latter question lies in the province of Medicine the former in the province of Logic Here therefore I repeat I shall treat only of the power of the mind or of reason and I shall mainly show the extent and nature of its dominion over the emotions for their control and moderation That we do not possess absolute dominion over them I have already shown Yet the Stoics have thought that the emotions depended absolutely on our will and that we could absolutely govern them But these philosophers were compelled by the protest of experience not from their own principles to confess that no slight practice and zeal is needed to control and moderate them and this someone endeavoured to illustrate by the example if I remember rightly of two dogs the one a house dog and the other a hunting dog For by long training it could be brought about that the house dog should become accustomed to hunt and the hunting dog to cease from running after hares To this opinion Descartes not a little inclines For he maintained that the soul or mind is specially united to a particular part of the brain namely to that part called the pineal gland by the aid of which the mind is enabled to feel all the movements which are set going in the body and also external objects and which the mind by a simple act of volition can put in motion in various ways He asserted that this gland is so suspended in the midst of the brain that it could be moved by the slightest motion of the animal spirits further that this gland is suspended in the midst of the brain in as many different manners as the animal spirits can impinge thereon and again that as many different marks are impressed on the said gland as there are different external objects which impel the animal spirits towards it whence it follows that if the will of the soul suspends the gland in a position wherein it has already been suspended once before by the animal spirits driven in one way or another the gland in its turn reacts on the said spirits driving and determining them to the condition wherein they were when repulsed before by a similar position of the gland He further asserted that every act of mental volition is united in nature to a certain given motion of the gland For instance whenever anyone desires to look at a remote object the act of volition causes the pupil of the eye to dilate whereas if the person in question had only thought of the dilatation of the pupil the mere wish to dilate it would not have brought about the result inasmuch as the motion of the gland which serves to impel the animal spirits towards the optic nerve in a way which would dilate or contract the pupil is not associated in nature with the wish to dilate or contract the pupil but with the wish to look at remote or very near objects Lastly he maintained that although every motion of the aforesaid gland seems to have been united by nature to one particular thought out of the whole number of our thoughts from the very beginning of our life yet it can nevertheless become through habituation associated with other thoughts this he endeavours to prove in the Passions de l ame I fifty He thence concludes that there is no soul so weak that it cannot under proper direction acquire absolute power over its passions For passions as defined by him are perceptions or feelings or disturbances of the soul which are referred to the soul as species and which mark the expression are produced preserved and strengthened through some movement of the spirits Passions de l ame I twenty seven But seeing that we can join any motion of the gland or consequently of the spirits to any volition the determination of the will depends entirely on our own powers if therefore we determine our will with sure and firm decisions in the direction to which we wish our actions to tend and associate the motions of the passions which we wish to acquire with the said decisions we shall acquire an absolute dominion over our passions Such is the doctrine of this illustrious philosopher in so far as I gather it from his own words it is one which had it been less ingenious I could hardly believe to have proceeded from so great a man Indeed I am lost in wonder that a philosopher who had stoutly asserted that he would draw no conclusions which do not follow from self evident premisses and would affirm nothing which he did not clearly and distinctly perceive and who had so often taken to task the scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities through occult qualities could maintain a hypothesis beside which occult qualities are commonplace What does he understand I ask by the union of the mind and the body What clear and distinct conception has he got of thought in most intimate union with a certain particle of extended matter Truly I should like him to explain this union through its proximate cause But he had so distinct a conception of mind being distinct from body that he could not assign any particular cause of the union between the two or of the mind itself but was obliged to have recourse to the cause of the whole universe that is to God Further I should much like to know what degree of motion the mind can impart to this pineal gland and with what force can it hold it suspended For I am in ignorance whether this gland can be agitated more slowly or more quickly by the mind than by the animal spirits and whether the motions of the passions which we have closely united with firm decisions cannot be again disjoined therefrom by physical causes in which case it would follow that although the mind firmly intended to face a given danger and had united to this decision the motions of boldness yet at the sight of the danger the gland might become suspended in a way which would preclude the mind thinking of anything except running away In truth as there is no common standard of volition and motion so is there no comparison possible between the powers of the mind and the power or strength of the body consequently the strength of one cannot in any wise be determined by the strength of the other We may also add that there is no gland discoverable in the midst of the brain so placed that it can thus easily be set in motion in so many ways and also that all the nerves are not prolonged so far as the cavities of the brain Lastly I omit all the assertions which he makes concerning the will and its freedom inasmuch as I have abundantly proved that his premisses are false Therefore since the power of the mind as I have shown above is defined by the understanding only we shall determine solely by the knowledge of the mind the remedies against the emotions which I believe all have had experience of but do not accurately observe or distinctly see and from the same basis we shall deduce all those conclusions which have regard to the mind s blessedness AXIOMS I If two contrary actions be started in the same subject a change must necessarily take place either in both or in one of the two and continue until they cease to be contrary II The power of an effect is defined by the power of its cause in so far as its essence is explained or defined by the essence of its cause This axiom is evident from III vii PROPOSITIONS PROP I Even as thoughts and the ideas of things are arranged and associated in the mind so are the modifications of body or the images of things precisely in the same way arranged and associated in the body Proof The order and connection of ideas is the same II vii as the order and connection of things and vice versa the order and connection of things is the same II vi Coroll and vii as the order and connection of ideas Wherefore even as the order and connection of ideas in the mind takes place according to the order and association of modifications of the body II xviii so vice versa III ii the order and connection of modifications of the body takes place in accordance with the manner in which thoughts and the ideas of things are arranged and associated in the mind Q E D PROP II If we remove a disturbance of the spirit or emotion from the thought of an external cause and unite it to other thoughts then will the love or hatred towards that external cause and also the vacillations of spirit which arise from these emotions be destroyed Proof That which constitutes the reality of love or hatred is pleasure or pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause Def of the Emotions vi vii wherefore when this cause is removed the reality of love or hatred is removed with it therefore these emotions and those which arise therefrom are destroyed Q E D PROP III An emotion which is a passion ceases to be a passion as soon as we form a clear and distinct idea thereof Proof An emotion which is a passion is a confused idea by the general Def of the Emotions If therefore we form a clear and distinct idea of a given emotion that idea will only be distinguished from the emotion in so far as it is referred to the mind only by reason II xxi and note therefore III iii the emotion will cease to be a passion Q E D Corollary An emotion therefore becomes more under our control and the mind is less passive in respect to it in proportion as it is more known to us PROP IV There is no modification of the body whereof we cannot form some clear and distinct conception Proof Properties which are common to all things can only be conceived adequately II xxxviii therefore II xii and Lemma ii after II xiii there is no modification of the body whereof we cannot form some clear and distinct conception Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that there is no emotion whereof we cannot form some clear and distinct conception For an emotion is the idea of a modification of the body by the general Def of the Emotions and must therefore by the preceding Prop involve some clear and distinct conception Note Seeing that there is nothing which is not followed by an effect I xxxvi and that we clearly and distinctly understand whatever follows from an idea which in us is adequate II xl it follows that everyone has the power of clearly and distinctly understanding himself and his emotions if not absolutely at any rate in part and consequently of bringing it about that he should become less subject to them To attain this result therefore we must chiefly direct our efforts to acquiring as far as possible a clear and distinct knowledge of every emotion in order that the mind may thus through emotion be determined to think of those things which it clearly and distinctly perceives and wherein it fully acquiesces and thus that the emotion itself may be separated from the thought of an external cause and may be associated with true thoughts whence it will come to pass not only that love hatred c will be destroyed V ii but also that the appetites or desires which are wont to arise from such emotion will become incapable of being excessive IV lxi For it must be especially remarked that the appetite through which a man is said to be active and that through which he is said to be passive is one and the same For instance we have shown that human nature is so constituted that everyone desires his fellow men to live after his own fashion III xxxi note in a man who is not guided by reason this appetite is a passion which is called ambition and does not greatly differ from pride whereas in a man who lives by the dictates of reason it is an activity or virtue which is called piety IV xxxvii note i and second proof In like manner all appetites or desires are only passions in so far as they spring from inadequate ideas the same results are accredited to virtue when they are aroused or generated by adequate ideas For all desires whereby we are determined to any given action may arise as much from adequate as from inadequate ideas IV lix Than this remedy for the emotions to return to the point from which I started which consists in a true knowledge thereof nothing more excellent being within our power can be devised For the mind has no other power save that of thinking and of forming adequate ideas as we have shown above III iii PROP V An emotion towards a thing which we conceive simply and not as necessary or as contingent or as possible is other conditions being equal greater than any other emotion Proof An emotion towards a thing which we conceive to be free is greater than one towards what we conceive to be necessary III xlix and consequently still greater than one towards what we conceive as possible or contingent IV xi But to conceive a thing as free can be nothing else than to conceive it simply while we are in ignorance of the causes whereby it has been determined to action II xxxv note therefore an emotion towards a thing which we conceive simply is other conditions being equal greater than one which we feel towards what is necessary possible or contingent and consequently it is the greatest of all Q E D PROP VI The mind has greater power over the emotions and is less subject thereto in so far as it understands all things as necessary Proof The mind understands all things to be necessary I xxix and to be determined to existence and operation by an infinite chain of causes therefore by the foregoing Proposition it thus far brings it about that it is less subject to the emotions arising therefrom and III xlviii feels less emotion towards the things themselves Q E D Note The more this knowledge that things are necessary is applied to particular things which we conceive more distinctly and vividly the greater is the power of the mind over the emotions as experience also testifies For we see that the pain arising from the loss of any good is mitigated as soon as the man who has lost it perceives that it could not by any means have been preserved So also we see that no one pities an infant because it cannot speak walk or reason or lastly because it passes so many years as it were in unconsciousness Whereas if most people were born full grown and only one here and there as an infant everyone would pity the infants because infancy would not then be looked on as a state natural and necessary but as a fault or delinquency in Nature and we may note several other instances of the same sort PROP VII Emotions which are aroused or spring from reason if we take account of time are stronger than those which are attributable to particular objects that we regard as absent Proof We do not regard a thing as absent by reason of the emotion wherewith we conceive it but by reason of the body being affected by another emotion excluding the existence of the said thing II xvii Wherefore the emotion which is referred to the thing which we regard as absent is not of a nature to overcome the rest of a man s activities and power IV vi but is on the contrary of a nature to be in some sort controlled by the emotions which exclude the existence of its external cause IV ix But an emotion which springs from reason is necessarily referred to the common properties of things see the def of reason in II xl note ii which we always regard as present for there can be nothing to exclude their present existence and which we always conceive in the same manner II xxxviii Wherefore an emotion of this kind always remains the same and consequently V Ax i emotions which are contrary thereto and are not kept going by their external causes will be obliged to adapt themselves to it more and more until they are no longer contrary to it to this extent the emotion which springs from reason is more powerful Q E D PROP VIII An emotion is stronger in proportion to the number of simultaneous concurrent causes whereby it is aroused Proof Many simultaneous causes are more powerful than a few III vii therefore IV v in proportion to the increased number of simultaneous causes whereby it is aroused an emotion becomes stronger Q E D Note This proposition is also evident from V Ax ii PROP IX An emotion which is attributable to many and diverse causes which the mind regards as simultaneous with the emotion itself is less hurtful and we are less subject thereto and less affected towards each of its causes than if it were a different and equally powerful emotion attributable to fewer causes or to a single cause Proof An emotion is only bad or hurtful in so far as it hinders the mind from being able to think IV xxvi xxvii therefore an emotion whereby the mind is determined to the contemplation of several things at once is less hurtful than another equally powerful emotion which so engrosses the mind in the single contemplation of a few objects or of one that it is unable to think of anything else this was our first point Again as the mind s essence in other words its power III vii consists solely in thought II xi the mind is less passive in respect to an emotion which causes it to think of several things at once than in regard to an equally strong emotion which keeps it engrossed in the contemplation of a few or of a single object this was our second point Lastly this emotion III xlviii in so far as it is attributable to several causes is less powerful in regard to each of them Q E D PROP X So long as we are not assailed by emotions contrary to our nature we have the power of arranging and associating the modifications of our body according to the intellectual order Proof The emotions which are contrary to our nature that is IV xxx which are bad are bad in so far as they impede the mind from understanding IV xxvii So long therefore as we are not assailed by emotions contrary to our nature the mind s power whereby it endeavours to understand things IV xxvi is not impeded and therefore it is able to form clear and distinct ideas and to deduce them one from another II xl note ii and II xlvii note consequently we have in such cases the power of arranging and associating the modifications of the body according to the intellectual order Q E D Note By this power of rightly arranging and associating the bodily modifications we can guard ourselves from being easily affected by evil emotions For V vii a greater force is needed for controlling the emotions when they are arranged and associated according to the intellectual order than when they are uncertain and unsettled The best we can do therefore so long as we do not possess a perfect knowledge of our emotions is to frame a system of right conduct or fixed practical precepts to commit it to memory and to apply it forthwith sixteen to the particular circumstances which now and again meet us in life so that our imagination may become fully imbued therewith and that it may be always ready to our hand For instance we have laid down among the rules of life IV xlvi and note that hatred should be overcome with love or high mindedness and not required with hatred in return Now that this precept of reason may be always ready to our hand in time of need we should often think over and reflect upon the wrongs generally committed by men and in what manner and way they may be best warded off by high mindedness we shall thus associate the idea of wrong with the idea of this precept which accordingly will always be ready for use when a wrong is done to us II xviii If we keep also in readiness the notion of our true advantage and of the good which follows from mutual friendships and common fellowships further if we remember that complete acquiescence is the result of the right way of life IV lii and that men no less than everything else act by the necessity of their nature in such case I say the wrong or the hatred which commonly arises therefrom will engross a very small part of our imagination and will be easily overcome or if the anger which springs from a grievous wrong be not overcome easily it will nevertheless be overcome though not without a spiritual conflict far sooner than if we had not thus reflected on the subject beforehand As is indeed evident from V vi vii viii We should in the same way reflect on courage as a means of overcoming fear the ordinary dangers of life should frequently be brought to mind and imagined together with the means whereby through readiness of resource and strength of mind we can avoid and overcome them But we must note that in arranging our thoughts and conceptions we should always bear in mind that which is good in every individual thing IV lxiii Coroll and III lix in order that we may always be determined to action by an emotion of pleasure For instance if a man sees that he is too keen in the pursuit of honour let him think over its right use the end for which it should be pursued and the means whereby he may attain it Let him not think of its misuse and its emptiness and the fickleness of mankind and the like whereof no man thinks except through a morbidness of disposition with thoughts like these do the most ambitious most torment themselves when they despair of gaining the distinctions they hanker after and in thus giving vent to their anger would fain appear wise Wherefore it is certain that those who cry out the loudest against the misuse of honour and the vanity of the world are those who most greedily covet it This is not peculiar to the ambitious but is common to all who are ill used by fortune and who are infirm in spirit For a poor man also who is miserly will talk incessantly of the misuse of wealth and of the vices of the rich whereby he merely torments himself and shows the world that he is intolerant not only of his own poverty but also of other people s riches So again those who have been ill received by a woman they love think of nothing but the inconstancy treachery and other stock faults of the fair sex all of which they consign to oblivion directly they are again taken into favour by their sweetheart Thus he who would govern his emotions and appetite solely by the love of freedom strives as far as he can to gain a knowledge of the virtues and their causes and to fill his spirit with the joy which arises from the true knowledge of them he will in no wise desire to dwell on men s faults or to carp at his fellows or to revel in a false show of freedom Whosoever will diligently observe and practise these precepts which indeed are not difficult will verily in a short space of time be able for the most part to direct his actions according to the commandments of reason sixteen Continuo Rendered constantly by mister Pollock on the ground that the classical meaning of the word does not suit the context PROP XI In proportion as a mental image is referred to more objects so is it more frequent or more often vivid and occupies the mind more Proof In proportion as a mental image or an emotion is referred to more objects so are there more causes whereby it can be aroused and fostered all of which by hypothesis the mind contemplates simultaneously in association with the given emotion therefore the emotion is more frequent or is more often in full vigour and V viii occupies the mind more Q E D PROP XII The mental images of things are more easily associated with the images referred to things which we clearly and distinctly understand than with others Proof Things which we clearly and distinctly understand are either the common properties of things or deductions therefrom see definition of Reason II xl note ii and are consequently by the last Prop more often aroused in us Wherefore it may more readily happen that we should contemplate other things in conjunction with these than in conjunction with something else and consequently II xviii that the images of the said things should be more often associated with the images of these than with the images of something else Q E D PROP XIII A mental image is more often vivid in proportion as it is associated with a greater number of other images Proof In proportion as an image is associated with a greater number of other images so II xviii are there more causes whereby it can be aroused Q E D PROP XIV The mind can bring it about that all bodily modifications or images of things may be referred to the idea of God Proof There is no modification of the body whereof the mind may not form some clear and distinct conception V iv wherefore it can bring it about that they should all be referred to the idea of God I xv Q E D PROP XV He who clearly and distinctly understands himself and his emotions loves God and so much the more in proportion as he more understands himself and his emotions Proof He who clearly and distinctly understands himself and his emotions feels pleasure III liii and this pleasure is by the last Prop accompanied by the idea of God therefore Def of the Emotions vi such an one loves God and for the same reason so much the more in proportion as he more understands himself and his emotions Q E D PROP XVI This love towards God must hold the chief place in the mind Proof For this love is associated with all the modifications of the body V xiv and is fostered by them all V xv therefore V xi it must hold the chief place in the mind Q E D PROP XVII God is without passions neither is he affected by any emotion of pleasure or pain Proof All ideas in so far as they are referred to God are true II xxxii that is II Def iv adequate and therefore by the general Def of the Emotions God is without passions Again God cannot pass either to a greater or to a lesser perfection I xx Coroll ii therefore by Def of the Emotions ii iii he is not affected by any emotion of pleasure or pain Corollary Strictly speaking God does not love or hate anyone For God by the foregoing Prop is not affected by any emotion of pleasure or pain consequently Def of the Emotions vi vii he does not love or hate anyone PROP XVIII No one can hate God Proof The idea of God which is in us is adequate and perfect II xlvi xlvii wherefore in so far as we contemplate God we are active III iii consequently III lix there can be no pain accompanied by the idea of God in other words Def of the Emotions vii no one can hate God Q E D Corollary Love towards God cannot be turned into hate Note It may be objected that as we understand God as the cause of all things we by that very fact regard God as the cause of pain But I make answer that in so far as we understand the causes of pain it to that extent V iii ceases to be a passion that is it ceases to be pain III lix therefore in so far as we understand God to be the cause of pain we to that extent feel pleasure PROP XIX He who loves God cannot endeavour that God should love him in return Proof For if a man should so endeavour he would desire V xvii Coroll that God whom he loves should not be God and consequently he would desire to feel pain III xix which is absurd III xxviii Therefore he who loves God c Q E D PROP XX This love towards God cannot be stained by the emotion of envy or jealousy contrariwise it is the more fostered in proportion as we conceive a greater number of men to be joined to God by the same bond of love Proof This love towards God is the highest good which we can seek for under the guidance of reason IV xxviii it is common to all men IV xxxvi and we desire that all should rejoice therein IV xxxvii therefore Def of the Emotions xxiii it cannot be stained by the emotion envy nor by the emotion of jealousy V xviii see definition of Jealousy III xxxv note but contrariwise it must needs be the more fostered in proportion as we conceive a greater number of men to rejoice therein Q E D Note We can in the same way show 
3227-24784-0000	train-other-500	that there is no emotion directly contrary to this love whereby this love can be destroyed therefore we may conclude that this love towards God is the most constant of all the emotions
3227-24784-0001	train-other-500	and that in so far as it is referred to the body it cannot be destroyed unless the body be destroyed also As to its nature in so far as it is referred to the mind only
none	none	 we shall presently inquire I have now gone through all the remedies against the emotions or all that the mind considered in itself alone can do against them Whence it appears that the mind s power over the emotions consists I In the actual knowledge of the emotions V iv note II In the fact that it separates the emotions from the thought of an external cause which we conceive confusedly V ii and V iv note III In the fact that in respect to time the emotions referred to things which we distinctly understand surpass those referred to what we conceive in a confused and fragmentary manner V vii IV In the number of causes whereby those modifications seventeen are fostered which have regard to the common properties of things or to God V ix xi seventeen Affectiones Camerer reads affectus emotions V Lastly in the order wherein the mind can arrange and associate one with another its own emotions V x note and xii xiii xiv But in order that this power of the mind over the emotions may be better understood it should be specially observed that the emotions are called by us strong when we compare the emotion of one man 
3227-24784-0002	train-other-500	with the emotion of another and see that one man is more troubled than another by the same emotion or when we are comparing the various emotions of the same man one with another
none	none	 and find that he is more affected or stirred by one emotion than by another For the strength of every emotion is defined by a comparison of our own power with the power of an external cause Now the power of the mind is defined by knowledge only and its infirmity or passion is defined by the privation of knowledge only it therefore follows that that mind is most passive whose greatest part is made up of inadequate ideas so that it may be characterized more readily by its passive states than by its activities on the other hand that mind is most active whose greatest part is made up of adequate ideas so that although it may contain as many inadequate ideas as the former mind it may yet be more easily characterized by ideas attributable to human virtue than by ideas which tell of human infirmity Again it must be observed that spiritual unhealthiness and misfortunes can generally be traced to excessive love for something which is subject to many variations and which we can never become masters of For no one is solicitous or anxious about anything unless he loves it neither do wrongs suspicions enmities c arise except in regard to things whereof no one can be really master We may thus readily conceive the power which clear and distinct knowledge and especially that third kind of knowledge II xlvii note founded on the actual knowledge of God 
3227-24784-0003	train-other-500	possesses over the emotions if it does not absolutely destroy them
none	none	 in so far as they are passions V iii and iv note 
3227-24784-0004	train-other-500	at any rate it causes them to occupy a very small part of the mind
none	none	 V xiv 
3227-24784-0005	train-other-500	Further it begets a love towards a thing immutable and eternal
none	none	 V xv whereof we may really enter into possession II xlv 
3227-24784-0006	train-other-500	neither can it be defiled with those faults which are inherent in ordinary love but it may grow from strength to strength and may engross the greater part of the mind and deeply penetrate it
3227-24784-0007	train-other-500	And now I have finished with all that concerns this present life
none	none	 for as I said in the beginning of this note I have briefly described all the remedies against the emotions And this everyone may readily have seen for himself if he has attended to what is advanced in the present note and also to the definitions of the mind and its emotions and lastly to Propositions i and iii of Part III It is now therefore time to pass on to those matters which appertain to the duration of the mind without relation to the body PROP XXI The mind can only imagine anything or remember what is past while the body endures Proof The mind does not express the actual existence of its body nor does it imagine the modifications of the body as actual except while the body endures II viii Coroll and consequently II xxvi it does not imagine any body as actually existing except while its own body endures Thus it cannot imagine anything for definition of Imagination see II xvii note or remember things past except while the body endures see definition of Memory II xviii note Q E D PROP XXII Nevertheless in God there is necessarily an idea which expresses the essence of this or that human body under the form of eternity Proof God is the cause not only of the existence of this or that human body but also of its essence I xxv This essence therefore must necessarily be conceived through the very essence of God I Ax iv and be thus conceived by a certain eternal necessity I xvi and this conception must necessarily exist in God II iii Q E D PROP XXIII The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the body but there remains of it something which is eternal Proof There is necessarily in God a concept or idea which expresses the essence of the human body last Prop which therefore is necessarily something appertaining to the essence of the human mind II xiii But we have not assigned to the human mind any duration definable by time except in so far as it expresses the actual existence of the body which is explained through duration and may be defined by time that is II viii Coroll we do not assign to it duration except while the body endures Yet as there is something notwithstanding which is conceived by a certain eternal necessity through the very essence of God last Prop this something which appertains to the essence of the mind will necessarily be eternal Q E D Note This idea which expresses the essence of the body under the form of eternity is as we have said a certain mode of thinking which belongs to the essence of the mind and is necessarily eternal Yet it is not possible that we should remember that we existed before our body for our body can bear no trace of such existence neither can eternity be defined in terms of time or have any relation to time But notwithstanding we feel and know that we are eternal For the mind feels those things that it conceives by understanding no less than those things that it remembers For the eyes of the mind whereby it sees and observes things are none other than proofs Thus although we do not remember that we existed before the body yet we feel that our mind in so far as it involves the essence of the body under the form of eternity is eternal and that thus its existence cannot be defined in terms of time or explained through duration Thus our mind can only be said to endure and its existence can only be defined by a fixed time in so far as it involves the actual existence of the body Thus far only has it the power of determining the existence of things by time and conceiving them under the category of duration PROP XXIV The more we understand particular things the more do we understand God Proof This is evident from I xxv Coroll PROP XXV The highest endeavour of the mind and the highest virtue is to understand things by the third kind of knowledge Proof The third kind of knowledge proceeds from an adequate idea of certain attributes of God to an adequate knowledge of the essence of things see its definition II xl note ii and in proportion as we understand things more in this way we better understand God by the last Prop therefore IV xxviii the highest virtue of the mind that is IV Def viii the power or nature or III vii highest endeavour of the mind is to understand things by the third kind of knowledge Q E D PROP XXVI In proportion as the mind is more capable of understanding things by the third kind of knowledge it desires more to understand things by that kind Proof This is evident For in so far as we conceive the mind to be capable of conceiving things by this kind of knowledge we to that extent conceive it as determined thus to conceive things and consequently Def of the Emotions i the mind desires so to do in proportion as it is more capable thereof Q E D PROP XXVII From this third kind of knowledge arises the highest possible mental acquiescence Proof The highest virtue of the mind is to know God IV xxviii or to understand things by the third kind of knowledge V xxv and this virtue is greater in proportion as the mind knows things more by the said kind of knowledge V xxiv consequently he who knows things by this kind of knowledge passes to the summit of human perfection and is therefore Def of the Emotions ii affected by the highest pleasure such pleasure being accompanied by the idea of himself and his own virtue thus Def of the Emotions xxv from this kind of knowledge arises the highest possible acquiescence Q E D PROP XXVIII The endeavour or desire to know things by the third kind of knowledge cannot arise from the first but from the second kind of knowledge Proof This proposition is self evident For whatsoever we understand clearly and distinctly we understand either through itself or through that which is conceived through itself that is ideas which are clear and distinct in us or which are referred to the third kind of knowledge II xl note ii cannot follow from ideas that are fragmentary and confused and are referred to knowledge of the first kind but must follow from adequate ideas or ideas of the second and third kind of knowledge therefore Def of the Emotions i the desire of knowing things by the third kind of knowledge cannot arise from the first but from the second kind Q E D PROP XXIX Whatsoever the mind understands under the form of eternity it does not understand by virtue of conceiving the present actual existence of the body but by virtue of conceiving the essence of the body under the form of eternity Proof In so far as the mind conceives the present existence of its body it to that extent conceives duration which can be determined by time and to that extent only has it the power of conceiving things in relation to time V xxi II xxvi But eternity cannot be explained in terms of duration I Def viii and explanation Therefore to this extent the mind has not the power of conceiving things under the form of eternity but it possesses such power because it is of the nature of reason to conceive things under the form of eternity II xliv Coroll ii and also because it is of the nature of the mind to conceive the essence of the body under the form of eternity V xxiii for besides these two there is nothing which belongs to the essence of mind II xiii Therefore this power of conceiving things under the form of eternity only belongs to the mind in virtue of the mind s conceiving the essence of the body under the form of eternity Q E D Note Things are conceived by us as actual in two ways either as existing in relation to a given time and place or as contained in God and following from the necessity of the divine nature Whatsoever we conceive in this second way as true or real we conceive under the form of eternity and their ideas involve the eternal and infinite essence of God as we showed in II xlv and note which see PROP XXX Our mind in so far as it knows itself and the body under the form of eternity has to that extent necessarily a knowledge of God and knows that it is in God and is conceived through God Proof Eternity is the very essence of God in so far as this involves necessary existence I Def viii Therefore to conceive things under the form of eternity is to conceive things in so far as they are conceived through the essence of God as real entities or in so far as they involve existence through the essence of God wherefore our mind in so far as it conceives itself and the body under the form of eternity has to that extent necessarily a knowledge of God and knows c Q E D PROP XXXI The third kind of knowledge depends on the mind as its formal cause in so far as the mind itself is eternal Proof The mind does not conceive anything under the form of eternity except in so far as it conceives its own body under the form of eternity V xxix that is except in so far as it is eternal V xxi xxiii therefore by the last Prop in so far as it is eternal it possesses the knowledge of God which knowledge is necessarily adequate II xlvi hence the mind in so far as it is eternal is capable of knowing everything which can follow from this given knowledge of God II xl in other words of knowing things by the third kind of knowledge see Def in II xl note ii whereof accordingly the mind III Def i in so far as it is eternal is the adequate or formal cause of such knowledge Q E D Note In proportion therefore as a man is more potent in this kind of knowledge he will be more completely conscious of himself and of God in other words he will be more perfect and blessed as will appear more clearly in the sequel But we must here observe that although we are already certain that the mind is eternal in so far as it conceives things under the form of eternity yet in order that what we wish to show may be more readily explained and better understood we will consider the mind itself as though it had just begun to exist and to understand things under the form of eternity as indeed we have done hitherto this we may do without any danger of error so long as we are careful not to draw any conclusion unless our premisses are plain PROP XXXII Whatsoever we understand by the third kind of knowledge we take delight in and our delight is accompanied by the idea of God as cause Proof From this kind of knowledge arises the highest possible mental acquiescence that is Def of the Emotions xxv pleasure and this acquiescence is accompanied by the idea of the mind itself V xxvii and consequently V xxx the idea also of God as cause Q E D Corollary From the third kind of knowledge necessarily arises the intellectual love of God From this kind of knowledge arises pleasure accompanied by the idea of God as cause that is Def of the Emotions vi the love of God not in so far as we imagine him as present V xxix but in so far as we understand him to be eternal this is what I call the intellectual love of God PROP XXXIII The intellectual love of God which arises from the third kind of knowledge is eternal Proof The third kind of knowledge is eternal V xxxi I Ax iii therefore by the same Axiom the love which arises therefrom is also necessarily eternal Q E D Note Although this love towards God has by the foregoing Prop no beginning it yet possesses all the perfections of love just as though it had arisen as we feigned in the Coroll of the last Prop Nor is there here any difference except that the mind possesses as eternal those same perfections which we feigned to accrue to it and they are accompanied by the idea of God as eternal cause If pleasure consists in the transition to a greater perfection assuredly blessedness must consist in the mind being endowed with perfection itself PROP XXXIV The mind is only while the body endures subject to those emotions which are attributable to passions Proof Imagination is the idea wherewith the mind contemplates a thing as present II xvii note yet this idea indicates rather the present disposition of the human body than the nature of the external thing II xvi Coroll ii Therefore emotion see general Def of Emotions is imagination in so far as it indicates the present disposition of the body therefore V xxi the mind is only while the body endures subject to emotions which are attributable to passions Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that no love save intellectual love is eternal Note If we look to men s general opinion we shall see that they are indeed conscious of the eternity of their mind but that they confuse eternity with duration and ascribe it to the imagination or the memory which they believe to remain after death PROP XXXV God loves himself with an infinite intellectual love Proof God is absolutely infinite I Def vi that is II Def vi the nature of God rejoices in infinite perfection and such rejoicing is II iii accompanied by the idea of himself that is I xi and Def i the idea of his own cause now this is what we have in V xxxii Coroll described as intellectual love PROP XXXVI The intellectual love of the mind towards God 
3227-24788-0000	train-other-500	is that very love of God whereby God loves himself not in so far as he is infinite but in so far as he can be explained through the essence of the human mind
none	none	 regarded under the form of eternity in other words the intellectual love of the mind towards God is part of the infinite love wherewith God loves himself Proof This love of the mind must be referred to the activities of the mind V xxxii Coroll and III iii it is itself indeed an activity whereby the mind regards itself accompanied by the idea of God as cause V xxxii and Coroll that is I xxv Coroll and II xi Coroll an activity whereby God in so far as he can be explained through the human mind regards himself accompanied by the idea of himself therefore by the last Prop 
3227-24788-0001	train-other-500	this love of the mind is part of the infinite love wherewith God loves himself
none	none	 Q E D 
3227-24788-0002	train-other-500	Corollary Hence it follows that God in so far as he loves himself loves man and consequently
3227-24788-0003	train-other-500	that the love of God towards men and the intellectual love of the mind towards God are identical Note From what has been said we clearly understand
none	none	 wherein our salvation or blessedness or freedom consists namely in the constant and eternal love towards God or in God s love towards men This love or blessedness is in the Bible called Glory and not undeservedly For whether this love be referred to God or to the mind it may rightly be called acquiescence of spirit which Def of the Emotions xxv xxx is not really distinguished from glory In so far as it is referred to God it is V xxxv pleasure if we may still use that term accompanied by the idea of itself and in so far as it is referred to the mind it is the same V xxvii Again since the essence of our mind consists solely in knowledge whereof the beginning and the foundation is God I xv and II xlvii note it becomes clear to us in what manner and way our mind 
3227-24788-0004	train-other-500	as to its essence and existence follows from the divine nature and constantly depends on God
none	none	 I have thought it worth while here to call attention to this 
3227-24788-0005	train-other-500	in order to show by this example how the knowledge of particular things which I have called intuitive or of the third kind
none	none	 II xl note ii is potent and more powerful than the universal knowledge 
3227-24788-0006	train-other-500	which I have styled knowledge of the second kind
none	none	 For although in Part I I showed in general terms that all things 
3227-24788-0007	train-other-500	and consequently also the human mind
none	none	 depend as to their essence and existence on God yet that demonstration though legitimate and placed beyond the chances of doubt 
3227-24788-0008	train-other-500	does not affect our mind so much as when the same conclusion is derived from the actual essence of some particular thing which we say depends on God
none	none	 PROP XXXVI
3227-24788-0009	train-other-500	I There is nothing in nature which is contrary to this intellectual love
none	none	 or which can take it away Proof This intellectual love follows necessarily from the nature of the mind in so far as the latter is regarded through the nature of God as an eternal truth V xxxiii and xxix If therefore there should be anything which would be contrary to this love that thing would be contrary to that which is true consequently that which should be able to take away this love would cause that which is true to be false an obvious absurdity Therefore there is nothing in nature which c Q E D Note The Axiom of Part IV has reference to particular things in so far as they are regarded in relation to a given time and place of this I think no one can doubt PROP XXXVIII In proportion as the mind understands more things by the second and third kind of knowledge it is less subject to those emotions which are evil and stands in less fear of death Proof The mind s essence consists in knowledge II xi therefore in proportion as the mind understands more things by the second and third kinds of knowledge the greater will be the part of it that endures V xxix and xxiii and consequently by the last Prop the greater will be the part that is not touched by the emotions which are contrary to our nature or in other words evil IV xxx Thus in proportion as the mind understands more things by the second and third kinds of knowledge the greater will be the part of it that remains unimpaired and consequently less subject to emotions c Q E D Note Hence we understand that point which I touched on in IV xxxix note and which I promised to explain in this Part namely that death becomes less hurtful in proportion as the mind s clear and distinct knowledge is greater 
3227-24788-0010	train-other-500	and consequently in proportion as the mind loves God more
none	none	 Again since from the third kind of knowledge arises the highest possible acquiescence V xxvii it follows that the human mind can attain to being of such a nature that the part thereof which we have shown to perish with the body V xxi should be of little importance when compared with the part which endures But I will soon treat of the subject at greater length PROP XXXIX He who possesses a body capable of the greatest number of activities possesses a mind whereof the greatest part is eternal Proof He who possesses a body capable of the greatest number of activities is least agitated by those emotions which are evil IV xxxviii that is IV xxx by those emotions which are contrary to our nature therefore V x he possesses the power of arranging and associating the modifications of the body 
3227-24788-0011	train-other-500	according to the intellectual order and consequently of bringing it about that all the modifications of the body should be referred to the idea of God
none	none	 whence it will come to pass that V xv he will be affected with love towards God which V xvi 
3227-24788-0012	train-other-500	must occupy or constitute
none	none	 the chief part of the mind therefore V xxxiii such a man will possess a mind whereof the chief part is eternal Q E D Note Since human bodies are capable of the greatest number of activities there is no doubt but that they may be of such a nature that they may be referred to minds possessing a great knowledge of themselves and of God and whereof the greatest or chief part is eternal 
3227-24788-0013	train-other-500	and therefore that they should scarcely fear death But in order that this may be understood more clearly we must here call to mind that we live in a state of perpetual variation
none	none	 and according as we are changed for the better or the worse 
3227-24788-0014	train-other-500	we are called happy or unhappy For he who from being an infant or a child becomes a corpse is called unhappy whereas it is set down to happiness if we have been able to live through the whole period of life
3227-24788-0015	train-other-500	with a sound mind in a sound body And in reality he who as in the case of an infant or a child has a body capable of very few activities
none	none	 and depending for the most part on external causes 
3227-24788-0017	train-other-500	has a mind which considered in itself alone
3227-24788-0016	train-other-500	is scarcely conscious of itself or of God or of things
none	none	 whereas he who has a body capable of very many activities has a mind which considered in itself alone is highly conscious of itself of God and of things 
3227-24788-0018	train-other-500	In this life therefore we primarily endeavour to bring it about
none	none	 that the body of a child in so far as its nature allows and conduces thereto 
3227-24788-0019	train-other-500	may be changed into something else capable of very many activities and referable to a mind which is highly conscious of itself of God and of things
3227-24788-0020	train-other-500	and we desire so to change it that what is referred to its imagination and memory may become insignificant in comparison with its intellect as I have already said in the note to the last Proposition
none	none	 PROP XL In proportion as each thing possesses more of perfection 
3227-24788-0021	train-other-500	so is it more active and less passive and vice versa in proportion as it is more active so is it more perfect
none	none	 Proof 
3227-24788-0022	train-other-500	In proportion as each thing is more perfect
none	none	 it possesses more of reality II Def vi and consequently III iii and note it is to that extent more active and less passive This demonstration may be reversed and thus prove that in proportion as a thing is more active so is it more perfect Q E D Corollary Hence it follows that the part of the mind which endures be it great or small is more perfect than the rest For the eternal part of the mind V xxiii xxix is the understanding through which alone we are said to act III iii the part which we have shown to perish is the imagination V xxi through which only we are said to be passive III iii and general Def of the Emotions therefore the former 
3227-24788-0024	train-other-500	be it great or small is more perfect than the latter
none	none	 Q E D 
3227-24788-0025	train-other-500	Note Such are the doctrines which I had purposed to set forth concerning the mind in so far as it is regarded without relation to the body
none	none	 whence as also from I xxi and other places 
3227-24788-0026	train-other-500	it is plain that our mind in so far as it understands is an eternal mode of thinking which is determined by another eternal mode of thinking and this other by a third and so on to infinity
none	none	 so that all taken together at once constitute the eternal and infinite intellect of God PROP XLI Even if we did not know that our mind is eternal we should still consider as of primary importance piety and religion and generally all things which in Part IV we showed to be attributable to courage and high mindedness Proof The first and only foundation of virtue or the rule of right living is IV xxii Coroll and xxiv seeking one s own true interest Now while we determined what reason prescribes as useful we took no account of the mind s eternity which has only become known to us in this Fifth Part Although we were ignorant at that time that the mind is eternal we nevertheless stated that the qualities attributable to courage and high mindedness are of primary importance Therefore even if we were still ignorant of this doctrine we should yet put the aforesaid precepts of reason in the first place Q E D Note The general belief of the multitude seems to be different Most people seem to believe that they are free in so far as they may obey their lusts and that they cede their rights in so far as they are bound to live according to the commandments of the divine law They therefore believe that piety religion and generally all things attributable to firmness of mind are burdens which after death they hope to lay aside and to receive the reward for their bondage that is for their piety and religion it is not only by this hope but also and chiefly by the fear of being horribly punished after death that they are induced to live according to the divine commandments so far as their feeble and infirm spirit will carry them If men had not this hope and this fear but believed that the mind perishes with the body and that no hope of prolonged life remains for the wretches who are broken down with the burden of piety they would return to their own inclinations controlling everything in accordance with their lusts and desiring to obey fortune rather than themselves Such a course appears to me not less absurd than if a man because he does not believe that he can by wholesome food sustain his body for ever should wish to cram himself with poisons and deadly fare or if because he sees that the mind is not eternal or immortal he should prefer to be out of his mind altogether and to live without the use of reason these ideas are so absurd as to be scarcely worth refuting PROP XLII Blessedness is not the reward of virtue but virtue itself neither do we rejoice therein because we control our lusts but contrariwise because we rejoice therein we are able to control our lusts Proof Blessedness consists in love towards God V xxxvi and note which love springs from the third kind of knowledge V xxxii Coroll therefore this love III iii lix must be referred to the mind in so far as the latter is active therefore IV Def viii it is virtue itself This was our first point Again in proportion as the mind rejoices more in this divine love or blessedness so does it the more understand V xxxii that is V iii Coroll so much the more power has it over the emotions and V xxxviii so much the less is it subject to those emotions which are evil therefore in proportion as the mind rejoices in this divine love or blessedness so has it the power of controlling lusts And since human power in controlling the emotions consists solely in the understanding it follows that no one rejoices in blessedness because he has controlled his lusts but contrariwise his power of controlling his lusts arises from this blessedness itself Q E D Note I have thus completed all I wished to set forth touching the mind s power over the emotions and the mind s freedom Whence it appears how potent is the wise man and how much he surpasses the ignorant man who is driven only by his lusts For the ignorant man is not only distracted in various ways by external causes without ever gaining the true acquiescence of his spirit but moreover lives as it were unwitting of himself and of God and of things and as soon as he ceases to suffer ceases also to be Whereas the wise man in so far as he is regarded as such is scarcely at all disturbed in spirit but being conscious of himself and of God and of things by a certain eternal necessity never ceases to be but always possesses true acquiescence of his spirit If the way which I have pointed out as leading to this result seems exceedingly hard it may nevertheless be discovered Needs must it be hard since it is so seldom found How would it be possible if salvation were ready to our hand and could without great labour be found that it should be by almost all men neglected But all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare End of the Ethics by Benedict de Spinoza one Affectiones two
