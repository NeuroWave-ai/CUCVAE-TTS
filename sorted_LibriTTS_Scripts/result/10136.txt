can be found In Woman than to study household good MILTON Published Originally By S O Beeton in twenty four Monthly Parts eighteen fifty nine eighteen sixty one First Published in a Bound Edition eighteen sixty one PREFACE I must frankly own that if I had known beforehand that this book would have cost me the labour which it has I should never have been courageous enough to commence it What moved me in the first instance to attempt a work like this was the discomfort and suffering which I had seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement I have always thought that there is no more fruitful source of family discontent than a housewife s badly cooked dinners and untidy ways Men are now so well served out of doors at their clubs well ordered taverns and dining houses that in order to compete with the attractions of these places a mistress must be thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice of cookery as well as be perfectly conversant with all the other arts of making and keeping a comfortable home In this book I have attempted to give under the chapters devoted to cookery an intelligible arrangement to every recipe a list of the ingredients a plain statement of the mode of preparing each dish and a careful estimate of its cost the number of people for whom it is sufficient and the time when it is seasonable For the matter of the recipes I am indebted in some measure to many correspondents of the Englishwoman s Domestic Magazine who have obligingly placed at my disposal their formulas for many original preparations A large private circle has also rendered me considerable service A diligent study of the works of the best modern writers on cookery was also necessary to the faithful fulfilment of my task Friends in England Scotland Ireland France and Germany have also very materially aided me I have paid great attention to those recipes which come under the head of COLD MEAT COOKERY But in the department belonging to the Cook I have striven too to make my work something more than a Cookery Book and have therefore on the best authority that I could obtain given an account of the natural history of the animals and vegetables which we use as food I have followed the animal from his birth to his appearance on the table have described the manner of feeding him and of slaying him the position of his various joints and after giving the recipes have described the modes of carving Meat Poultry and Game Skilful artists have designed the numerous drawings which appear in this work and which illustrate better than any description many important and interesting items The coloured plates are a novelty not without value Besides the great portion of the book which has especial reference to the cook s department there are chapters devoted to those of the other servants of the household who have all I trust their duties clearly assigned to them Towards the end of the work will be found valuable chapters on the Management of Children The Doctor the latter principally referring to accidents and emergencies some of which are certain to occur in the experience of every one of us and the last chapter contains Legal Memoranda which will be serviceable in cases of doubt as to the proper course to be adopted in the relations between Landlord and Tenant Tax gatherer and Tax payer and Tradesman and Customer These chapters have been contributed by gentlemen fully entitled to confidence those on medical subjects by an experienced surgeon and the legal matter by a solicitor I wish here to acknowledge the kind letters and congratulations I have received during the progress of this work and have only further to add that I trust the result of the four years incessant labour which I have expended will not be altogether unacceptable to some of my countrymen and countrywomen ISABELLA BEETON GENERAL CONTENTS CHAP I THE MISTRESS two THE HOUSEKEEPER three ARRANGEMENT AND ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN four

her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness She looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness Her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her Proverbs xxxi twenty five twenty eight I AS WITH THE COMMANDER OF AN ARMY or the leader of any enterprise so is it with the mistress of a house Her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment and just in proportion as she performs her duties intelligently and thoroughly so will her domestics follow in her path Of all those acquirements which more particularly belong to the feminine character there are none which take a higher rank in our estimation than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness comfort and well being of a family In this opinion we are borne out by the author of The Vicar of Wakefield who says The modest virgin the prudent wife and the careful matron are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers blustering heroines or virago queens She who makes her husband and her children happy who reclaims the one from vice and trains up the other to virtue is a much greater character than ladies described in romances whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver or their eyes two PURSUING THIS PICTURE we may add that to be a good housewife does not necessarily imply an abandonment of proper pleasures or amusing recreation and we think it the more necessary to express this as the performance of the duties of a mistress may to some minds perhaps seem to be incompatible with the enjoyment of life Let us however now proceed to describe some of those home qualities and virtues which are necessary to the proper management of a Household and then point out the plan which may be the most profitably pursued for the daily regulation of its affairs three EARLY RISING IS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL QUALITIES which enter into good Household Management as it is not only the parent of health but of innumerable other advantages Indeed when a mistress is an early riser it is almost certain that her house will be orderly and well managed On the contrary if she remain in bed till a late hour then the domestics who as we have before observed invariably partake somewhat of their mistress s character will surely become sluggards To self indulgence all are more or less disposed and it is not to be expected that servants are freer from this fault than the heads of houses The great Lord Chatham thus gave his advice in reference to this subject I would have inscribed on the curtains of your bed and the walls of your chamber If you do not rise early you can make progress in nothing four CLEANLINESS IS ALSO INDISPENSABLE TO HEALTH and must be studied both in regard to the person and the house and all that it contains Cold or tepid baths should be employed every morning unless on account of illness or other circumstances they should be deemed objectionable The bathing of children will be treated of under the head of MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN five FRUGALITY AND ECONOMY ARE HOME VIRTUES without which no household can prosper doctor Johnson says Frugality may be termed the daughter of Prudence the sister of Temperance and the parent of Liberty He that is extravagant will quickly become poor and poverty will enforce dependence and invite corruption The necessity of practising economy should be evident to every one whether in the possession of an income no more than sufficient for a family s requirements or of a large fortune which puts financial adversity out of the question We must always remember that it is a great merit in housekeeping to manage a little well He is a good waggoner says Bishop Hall that can turn in a little room To live well in abundance is the praise of the estate not of the person I will study more how to give a good account of my little than how to make it more In this there is true wisdom and it may be added that those who can manage a little well are most likely to succeed in their management of larger matters Economy and frugality must never however be allowed to degenerate into parsimony and meanness six THE CHOICE OF ACQUAINTANCES is very important to the happiness of a mistress and her family A gossiping acquaintance who indulges in the scandal and ridicule of her neighbours should be avoided as a pestilence It is likewise all necessary to beware as Thomson sings The whisper d tale That like the fabling Nile no fountain knows Fair laced Deceit whose wily conscious aye Ne er looks direct the tongue that licks the dust But when it safely dares as prompt to sting If the duties of a family do not sufficiently occupy the time of a mistress society should be formed of such a kind as will tend to the mutual interchange of general and interesting information seven FRIENDSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE HASTILY FORMED nor the heart given at once to every new comer There are ladies who uniformly smile at and approve everything and everybody and who possess neither the courage to reprehend vice nor the generous warmth to defend virtue The friendship of such persons is without attachment and their love without affection or even preference They imagine that every one who has any penetration is ill natured and look coldly on a discriminating judgment It should be remembered however that this discernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper but that those who possess a long experience and thorough knowledge of the world scrutinize the conduct and dispositions of people before they trust themselves to the first fair appearances Addison who was not deficient in a knowledge of mankind observes that a friendship which makes the least noise is very often the most useful for which reason I should prefer a prudent friend to a zealous one And Joanna Baillie tells us that Friendship is no plant of hasty growth Though planted in esteem s deep fixed soil The gradual culture of kind intercourse Must bring it to perfection eight HOSPITALITY IS A MOST EXCELLENT VIRTUE but care must be taken that the love of company for its own sake does not become a prevailing passion for then the habit is no longer hospitality but dissipation Reality and truthfulness in this as in all other duties of life are the points to be studied for as Washington Irving well says There is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality which cannot be described but is immediately felt and puts the stranger at once at his ease With respect to the continuance of friendships however it may be found necessary in some cases for a mistress to relinquish on assuming the responsibility of a household many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life This will be the more requisite if the number still retained be quite equal to her means and opportunities nine IN CONVERSATION TRIFLING OCCURRENCES such as small disappointments petty annoyances and other every day incidents should never be mentioned to your friends The extreme injudiciousness of repeating these will be at once apparent when we reflect on the unsatisfactory discussions which they too frequently occasion and on the load of advice which they are the cause of being tendered and which is too often of a kind neither to be useful nor agreeable Greater events whether of joy or sorrow should be communicated to friends and on such occasions their sympathy gratifies and comforts If the mistress be a wife never let an account of her husband s failings pass her lips and in cultivating the power of conversation she should keep the versified advice of Cowper continually in her memory that it Should flow like water after summer showers Not as if raised by mere mechanic powers In reference to its style doctor Johnson who was himself greatly distinguished for his colloquial abilities says that no style is more extensively acceptable than the narrative because this does not carry an air of superiority over the rest of the company and therefore is most likely to please them For this purpose we should store our memory with short anecdotes and entertaining pieces of history Almost every one listens with eagerness to extemporary history Vanity often company operates with curiosity for he that is a hearer in one place wishes to qualify himself to be a principal speaker in some inferior company and therefore more attention is given to narrations than anything else in conversation It is true indeed that sallies of wit and quick replies are very pleasing in conversation but they frequently tend to raise envy in some of the company but the narrative way neither raises this nor any other evil passion but keeps all the company nearly upon an equality and if judiciously managed will at once entertain and improve them all ten GOOD TEMPER SHOULD BE CULTIVATED by every mistress as upon it the welfare of the household may be said to turn indeed its influence can hardly be over estimated as it has the effect of moulding the characters of those around her and of acting most beneficially on the happiness of the domestic circle Every head of a household should strive to be cheerful and should never fail to show a deep interest in all that appertains to the well being of those who claim the protection of her roof Gentleness not partial and temporary but universal and regular should pervade her conduct for where such a spirit is habitually manifested it not only delights her children but makes her domestics attentive and respectful her visitors are also pleased by it and their happiness is increased eleven ON THE IMPORTANT SUBJECT OF DRESS AND FASHION we cannot do better than quote an opinion from the eighth volume of the Englishwoman s Domestic Magazine The writer there says Let people write talk lecture satirize as they may it cannot be denied that whatever is the prevailing mode in attire let it intrinsically be ever so absurd it will never look as ridiculous as another or as any other which however convenient comfortable or even becoming is totally opposite in style to that generally worn twelve IN PURCHASING ARTICLES OF WEARING APPAREL whether it be a silk dress a bonnet shawl or riband it is well for the buyer to consider three things I That it be not too expensive for her purse II That its colour harmonize with her complexion and its size and pattern with her figure III That its tint allow of its being worn with the other garments she possesses The quaint Fuller observes that the good wife is none of our dainty dames who love to appear in a variety of suits every day new as if a gown like a stratagem in war were to be used but once But our good wife sets up a sail according to the keel of her husband s estate and if of high parentage she doth not so remember what she was by birth that she forgets what she is by match To Brunettes or those ladies having dark complexions silks of a grave hue are adapted For Blondes or those having fair complexions lighter colours are preferable as the richer deeper hues are too overpowering for the latter The colours which go best together are green with violet gold colour with dark crimson or lilac pale blue with scarlet pink with black or white and gray with scarlet or pink A cold colour generally requires a warm tint to give life to it Gray and pale blue for instance do not combine well both being cold colours thirteen THE DRESS OF THE MISTRESS should always be adapted to her circumstances and be varied with different occasions Thus at breakfast she should be attired in a very neat and simple manner wearing no ornaments If this dress should decidedly pertain only to the breakfast hour and be specially suited for such domestic occupations as usually follow that meal then it would be well to exchange it before the time for receiving visitors if the mistress be in the habit of doing so It is still to be remembered however that in changing the dress jewellery and ornaments are not to be worn until the full dress for dinner is assumed Further information and hints on the subject of the toilet will appear under the department of the LADY S MAID The advice of Polonius to his son Laertes in Shakspeare s tragedy of Hamlet is most excellent and although given to one of the male sex will equally apply to a fayre ladye Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy But not express d in fancy rich not gaudy For the apparel oft proclaims the man fourteen CHARITY AND BENEVOLENCE ARE DUTIES which a mistress owes to herself as well as to her fellow creatures and there is scarcely any income so small but something may be spared from it even if it be but the widow s mite It is to be always remembered however that it is the spirit of charity which imparts to the gift a value far beyond its actual amount and is by far its better part True Charity a plant divinely nursed Fed by the love from which it rose at first Thrives against hope and in the rudest scene Storms but enliven its unfading green Exub rant is the shadow it supplies Its fruit on earth its growth above the skies Visiting the houses of the poor is the only practical way really to understand the actual state of each family and although there may be difficulties in following out this plan in the metropolis and other large cities yet in country towns and rural districts these objections do not obtain Great advantages may result from visits paid to the poor for there being unfortunately much ignorance generally amongst them with respect to all household knowledge there will be opportunities for advising and instructing them in a pleasant and unobtrusive manner in cleanliness industry cookery and good management fifteen IN MARKETING THAT THE BEST ARTICLES ARE THE CHEAPEST may be laid down as a rule and it is desirable unless an experienced and confidential housekeeper be kept that the mistress should herself purchase all provisions and stores needed for the house If the mistress be a young wife and not accustomed to order things for the house a little practice and experience will soon teach her who are the best tradespeople to deal with and what are the best provisions to buy Under each particular head of FISH MEAT POULTRY GAME c will be described the proper means of ascertaining the quality of these comestibles sixteen A HOUSEKEEPING ACCOUNT BOOK should invariably be kept and kept punctually and precisely The plan for keeping household accounts which we should recommend would be to make an entry that is write down into a daily diary every amount paid on that particular day be it ever so small then at the end of the month let these various payments be ranged under their specific heads of Butcher Baker c and thus will be seen the proportions paid to each tradesman and any one month s expenses may be contrasted with another The housekeeping accounts should be balanced not less than once a month so that you may see that the money you have in hand tallies with your account of it in your diary Judge Haliburton never wrote truer words than when he said No man is rich whose expenditure exceeds his means and no one is poor whose incomings exceed his outgoings When in a large establishment a housekeeper is kept it will be advisable for the mistress to examine her accounts regularly Then any increase of expenditure which may be apparent can easily be explained and the housekeeper will have the satisfaction of knowing whether her efforts to manage her department well and economically have been successful seventeen ENGAGING DOMESTICS is one of those duties in which the judgment of the mistress must be keenly exercised There are some respectable registry offices where good servants may sometimes be hired but the plan rather to be recommended is for the mistress to make inquiry amongst her circle of friends and acquaintances and her tradespeople The latter generally know those in their neighbourhood who are wanting situations and will communicate with them when a personal interview with some of them will enable the mistress to form some idea of the characters of the applicants and to suit herself accordingly We would here point out an error and a grave one it is into which some mistresses fall They do not when engaging a servant expressly tell her all the duties which she will be expected to perform This is an act of omission severely to be reprehended Every portion of work which the maid will have to do should be plainly stated by the mistress and understood by the servant If this plan is not carefully adhered to domestic contention is almost certain to ensue and this may not be easily settled so that a change of servants which is so much to be deprecated is continually occurring eighteen IN OBTAINING A SERVANT S CHARACTER it is not well to be guided by a written one from some unknown quarter but it is better to have an interview if at all possible with the former mistress By this means you will be assisted in your decision of the suitableness of the servant for your place from the appearance of the lady and the state of her house Negligence and want of cleanliness in her and her household generally will naturally lead you to the conclusion that her servant has suffered from the influence of the bad example The proper course to pursue in order to obtain a personal interview with the lady is this The servant in search of the situation must be desired to see her former mistress and ask her to be kind enough to appoint a time convenient to herself when you may call on her this proper observance of courtesy being necessary to prevent any unseasonable intrusion on the part of a stranger Your first questions should be relative to the honesty and general morality of her former servant and if no objection is stated in that respect her other qualifications are then to be ascertained Inquiries should be very minute so that you may avoid disappointment and trouble by knowing the weak points of your domestic nineteen THE TREATMENT OF SERVANTS is of the highest possible moment as well to the mistress as to the domestics themselves On the head of the house the latter will naturally fix their attention and if they perceive that the mistress s conduct is regulated by high and correct principles they will not fail to respect her If also a benevolent desire is shown to promote their comfort at the same time that a steady performance of their duty is exacted then their respect will not be unmingled with affection and they will be still more solicitous to continue to deserve her favour twenty IN GIVING A CHARACTER it is scarcely necessary to say that the mistress should be guided by a sense of strict justice It is not fair for one lady to recommend to another a servant she would not keep herself The benefit too to the servant herself is of small advantage for the failings which she possesses will increase if suffered to be indulged with impunity It is hardly necessary to remark on the other hand that no angry feelings on the part of a mistress towards her late servant should ever be allowed in the slightest degree to influence her so far as to induce her to disparage her maid s character twenty one THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF THE AVERAGE YEARLY WAGES paid to domestics with the various members of the household placed in the order in which they are usually ranked will serve as a guide to regulate the expenditure of an establishment When not found in When found in Livery Livery The House Steward From Lten to Leighty The Valet twenty five to fifty From Ltwenty to Lthirty The Butler twenty five to fifty The Cook twenty to forty The Gardener twenty to forty The Footman twenty to forty fifteen to twenty five The Under Butler fifteen to thirty fifteen to twenty five The Coachman twenty to thirty five The Groom fifteen to thirty twelve to twenty The Under Footman twelve to twenty The Page or Footboy eight to

six one two to ten The Still room Maid nine to fourteen eight to thirteen The Nursemaid eight to twelve five to ten The Under Laundry maid nine to eleven eight to twelve The Kitchen maid nine to fourteen eight to twelve The Scullery maid five to nine four to eight These quotations of wages are those usually given in or near the metropolis but of course there are many circumstances connected with locality and also having reference to the long service on the one hand or the inexperience on the other of domestics which may render the wages still higher or lower than those named above All the domestics mentioned in the above table would enter into the establishment of a wealthy nobleman The number of servants of course would become smaller in proportion to the lesser size of the establishment and we may here enumerate a scale of servants suited to various incomes commencing with About Lone thousand a year A cook upper housemaid nursemaid under housemaid and a man servant About Lseven hundred fifty a year A cook housemaid nursemaid and footboy About Lfive hundred a year A cook housemaid and nursemaid About Lthree hundred a year A maid of all work and nursemaid About Ltwo hundred or Lone hundred fifty a year A maid of all work and girl occasionally twenty two HAVING THUS INDICATED some of the more general duties of the mistress relative to the moral government of her household we will now give a few specific instructions on matters having a more practical relation to the position which she is supposed to occupy in the eye of the world To do this the more clearly we will begin with her earliest duties and take her completely through the occupations of a day twenty three HAVING RISEN EARLY as we have already advised see three and having given due attention to the bath and made a careful toilet it will be well at once to see that the children have received their proper ablutions and are in every way clean and comfortable The first meal of the day breakfast will then be served at which all the family should be punctually present unless illness or other circumstances prevent twenty four AFTER BREAKFAST IS OVER it will be well for the mistress to make a round of the kitchen and other offices to see that all are in order and that the morning s work has been properly performed by the various domestics The orders for the day should then be given and any questions which the domestics desire to ask respecting their several departments should be answered and any special articles they may require handed to them from the store closet In those establishments where there is a housekeeper it will not be so necessary for the mistress personally to perform the above named duties twenty five AFTER THIS GENERAL SUPERINTENDENCE of her servants the mistress if a mother of a young family may devote herself to the instruction of some of its younger members or to the examination of the state of their wardrobe leaving the later portion of the morning for reading or for some amusing recreation Recreation says Bishop Hall is intended to the mind as whetting is to the scythe to sharpen the edge of it which would otherwise grow dull and blunt He therefore that spends his whole time in recreation is ever whetting never mowing his grass may grow and his steed starve as contrarily he that always toils and never recreates is ever mowing never whetting labouring much to little purpose As good no scythe as no edge Then only doth the work go forward when the scythe is so seasonably and moderately whetted that it may cut and so cut that it may have the help of sharpening Unless the means of the mistress be very circumscribed and she be obliged to devote a great deal of her time to the making of her children s clothes and other economical pursuits it is right that she should give some time to the pleasures of literature the innocent delights of the garden and to the improvement of any special abilities for music painting and other elegant arts which she may happily possess twenty six THESE DUTIES AND PLEASURES BEING PERFORMED AND ENJOYED the hour of luncheon will have arrived This is a very necessary meal between an early breakfast and a late dinner as a healthy person with good exercise should have a fresh supply of food once in four hours It should be a light meal but its solidity must of course be in some degree proportionate to the time it is intended to enable you to wait for your dinner and the amount of exercise you take in the mean time At this time also the servants dinner will be served In those establishments where an early dinner is served that will of course take the place of the luncheon In many houses where a nursery dinner is provided for the children and about one o clock the mistress and the elder portion of the family make their luncheon at the same time from the same joint or whatever may be provided A mistress will arrange according to circumstances the serving of the meal but the more usual plan is for the lady of the house to have the joint brought to her table and afterwards carried to the nursery twenty seven AFTER LUNCHEON MORNING CALLS AND VISITS may be made and received These may be divided under three heads those of ceremony friendship and congratulation or condolence Visits of ceremony or courtesy which occasionally merge into those of friendship are to be paid under various circumstances Thus they are uniformly required after dining at a friend s house or after a ball picnic or any other party These visits should be short a stay of from fifteen to twenty minutes being quite sufficient A lady paying a visit may remove her boa or neckerchief but neither her shawl nor bonnet When other visitors are announced it is well to retire as soon as possible taking care to let it appear that their arrival is not the cause When they are quietly seated and the bustle of their entrance is over rise from your chair taking a kind leave of the hostess and bowing politely to the guests Should you call at an inconvenient time not having ascertained the luncheon hour or from any other inadvertence retire as soon as possible without however showing that you feel yourself an intruder It is not difficult for any well bred or even good tempered person to know what to say on such an occasion and on politely withdrawing a promise can be made to call again if the lady you have called on appear really disappointed twenty eight IN PAYING VISITS OF FRIENDSHIP it will not be so necessary to be guided by etiquette as in paying visits of ceremony and if a lady be pressed by her friend to remove her shawl and bonnet it can be done if it will not interfere with her subsequent arrangements It is however requisite to call at suitable times and to avoid staying too long if your friend is engaged The courtesies of society should ever be maintained even in the domestic circle and amongst the nearest friends During these visits the manners should be easy and cheerful and the subjects of conversation such as may be readily terminated Serious discussions or arguments are to be altogether avoided and there is much danger and impropriety in expressing opinions of those persons and characters with whom perhaps there is but a slight acquaintance See six seven and nine It is not advisable at any time to take favourite dogs into another lady s drawing room for many persons have an absolute dislike to such animals and besides this there is always a chance of a breakage of some article occurring through their leaping and bounding here and there sometimes very much to the fear and annoyance of the hostess Her children also unless they are particularly well trained and orderly and she is on exceedingly friendly terms with the hostess should not accompany a lady in making morning calls Where a lady however pays her visits in a carriage the children can be taken in the vehicle and remain in it until the visit is over twenty nine FOR MORNING CALLS it is well to be neatly attired for a costume very different to that you generally wear or anything approaching an evening dress will be very much out of place As a general rule it may be said both in reference to this and all other occasions it is better to be under dressed than over dressed A strict account should be kept of ceremonial visits and notice how soon your visits have been returned An opinion may thus be formed as to whether your frequent visits are or are not desirable There are naturally instances when the circumstances of old age or ill health will preclude any return of a call but when this is the case it must not interrupt the discharge of the duty thirty IN PAYING VISITS OF CONDOLENCE it is to be remembered that they should be paid within a week after the event which occasions them If the acquaintance however is but slight then immediately after the family has appeared at public worship A lady should send in her card and if her friends be able to receive her the visitor s manner and conversation should be subdued and in harmony with the character of her visit Courtesy would dictate that a mourning card should be used and that visitors in paying condoling visits should be dressed in black either silk or plain coloured apparel Sympathy with the affliction of the family is thus expressed and these attentions are in such cases pleasing and soothing In all these visits if your acquaintance or friend be not at home a card should be left If in a carriage the servant will answer your inquiry and receive your card if paying your visits on foot give your card to the servant in the hall but leave to go in and rest should on no account be asked The form of words Not at home may be understood in different senses but the only courteous way is to receive them as being perfectly true You may imagine that the lady of the house is really at home and that she would make an exception in your favour or you may think that your acquaintance is not desired but in either case not the slightest word is to escape you which would suggest on your part such an impression thirty one IN RECEIVING MORNING CALLS the foregoing description of the etiquette to be observed in paying them will be of considerable service It is to be added however that the occupations of drawing music or reading should be suspended on the entrance of morning visitors If a lady however be engaged with light needlework and none other is appropriate in the drawing room it may not be under some circumstances inconsistent with good breeding to quietly continue it during conversation particularly if the visit be protracted or the visitors be gentlemen Formerly the custom was to accompany all visitors quitting the house to the door and there take leave of them but modern society which has thrown off a great deal of this kind of ceremony now merely requires that the lady of the house should rise from her seat shake hands or courtesy in accordance with the intimacy she has with her guests and ring the bell to summon the servant to attend them and open the door In making a first call either upon a newly married couple or persons newly arrived in the neighbourhood a lady should leave her husband s card together with her own at the same time stating that the profession or business in which he is engaged has prevented him from having the pleasure of paying the visit with her It is a custom with many ladies when on the eve of an absence from their neighbourhood to leave or send their own and husband s cards with the letters P P C in the right hand corner These letters are the initials of the French words Pour prendre conge meaning To take leave thirty two THE MORNING CALLS BEING PAID OR RECEIVED and their etiquette properly attended to the next great event of the day in most establishments is The Dinner and we only propose here to make a few general remarks on this important topic as in future pages the whole Art of Dining will be thoroughly considered with reference to its economy comfort and enjoyment thirty three IN GIVING OR ACCEPTING AN INVITATION FOR DINNER the following is the form of words generally made use of They however can be varied in proportion to the intimacy or position of the hosts and guests mister and missus A present their compliments to mister and missus B and request the honour or hope to have the pleasure of their company to dinner on Wednesday the sixth of December next A STREET November thirteenth eighteen fifty nine R S V P The letters in the corner imply Repondez s il vous plait meaning an answer will oblige The reply accepting the invitation is couched in the following terms mister and missus B present their compliments to mister and missus A and will do themselves the honour of or will have much pleasure in accepting their kind invitation to dinner on the sixth of December next B SQUARE November eighteenth eighteen fifty nine Cards or invitations for a dinner party should be issued a fortnight or three weeks sometimes even a month beforehand and care should be taken by the hostess in the selection of the invited guests that they should be suited to each other Much also of the pleasure of a dinner party will depend on the arrangement of the guests at table so as to form a due admixture of talkers and listeners the grave and the gay If an invitation to dinner is accepted the guests should be punctual and the mistress ready in her drawing room to receive them At some periods it has been considered fashionable to come late to dinner but lately nous avons change tout cela thirty four THE HALF HOUR BEFORE DINNER has always been considered as the great ordeal through which the mistress in giving a dinner party will either pass with flying colours or lose many of her laurels The anxiety to receive her guests her hope that all will be present in due time her trust in the skill of her cook and the attention of the other domestics all tend to make these few minutes a trying time The mistress however must display no kind of agitation but show her tact in suggesting light and cheerful subjects of conversation which will be much aided by the introduction of any particular new book curiosity of art or article of vertu which may pleasantly engage the attention of the company Waiting for Dinner however is a trying time and there are few who have not felt How sad it is to sit and pine The long half hour before we dine Upon our watches oft to look Then wonder at the clock and cook And strive to laugh in spite of Fate But laughter forced soon quits the room And leaves it in its former gloom But lo the dinner now appears The object of our hopes and fears The end of all our pain In giving an entertainment of this kind the mistress should remember that it is her duty to make her guests feel happy comfortable and quite at their ease and the guests should also consider that they have come to the house of their hostess to be happy Thus an opportunity is given to all for innocent enjoyment and intellectual improvement when also acquaintances may be formed that may prove invaluable through life and information gained that will enlarge the mind Many celebrated men and women have been great talkers and amongst others the genial Sir Walter Scott who spoke freely to every one and a favourite remark of whom it was that he never did so without learning something he didn t know before thirty five DINNER BEING ANNOUNCED the host offers his arm to and places on his right hand at the dinner table the lady to whom he desires to pay most respect either on account of her age position or from her being the greatest stranger in the party If this lady be married and her husband present the latter takes the hostess to her place at table and seats himself at her right hand The rest of the company follow in couples as specified by the master and mistress of the house arranging the party according to their rank and other circumstances which may be known to the host and hostess It will be found of great assistance to the placing of a party at the dinner table to have the names of the guests neatly and correctly written on small cards and placed at that part of the table where it is desired they should sit With respect to the number of guests it has often been said that a private dinner party should consist of not less than the number of the Graces or more than that of the Muses A party of ten or twelve is perhaps in a general way sufficient to enjoy themselves and be enjoyed White kid gloves are worn by ladies at dinner parties but should be taken off before the business of dining commences thirty six THE GUESTS BEING SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE the lady begins to help the soup which is handed round commencing with the gentleman on her right and on her left and continuing in the same order till all are served It is generally established as a rule not to ask for soup or fish twice as in so doing part of the company may be kept waiting too long for the second course when perhaps a little revenge is taken by looking at the awkward consumer of a second portion This rule however may under various circumstances not be considered as binding It is not usual where taking wine is en regle for a gentleman to ask a lady to take wine until the fish or soup is finished and then the gentleman honoured by sitting on the right of the hostess may politely inquire if she will do him the honour of taking wine with him This will act as a signal to the rest of the company the gentleman of the house most probably requesting the same pleasure of the ladies at his right and left At many tables however the custom or fashion of drinking wine in this manner is abolished and the servant fills the glasses of the guests with the various wines suited to the course which is in progress thirty seven WHEN DINNER IS FINISHED THE DESSERT is placed on the table accompanied with finger glasses It is the custom of some gentlemen to wet a corner of the napkin but the hostess whose behaviour will set the tone to all the ladies present will merely wet the tips of her fingers which will serve all the purposes required The French and other continentals have a habit of gargling the mouth but it is a custom which no English gentlewoman should in the slightest degree imitate thirty eight WHEN FRUIT HAS BEEN TAKEN and a glass or two of wine passed round the time will have arrived when the hostess will rise and thus give the signal for the ladies to leave the gentlemen and retire to the drawing room The gentlemen of the party will rise at the same time and he who is nearest the door will open it for the ladies all remaining courteously standing until the last lady has withdrawn doctor Johnson has a curious paragraph on the effects of a dinner on men Before dinner he says men meet with great inequality of understanding and those who are conscious of their inferiority have the modesty not to talk When they have drunk wine every man feels himself happy and loses that modesty and grows impudent and vociferous but he is not improved he is only not sensible of his defects This is rather severe but there may be truth in it In former times when the bottle circulated freely amongst the guests it was necessary for the ladies to retire earlier than they do at present for the gentlemen of the company soon became unfit to conduct themselves with that decorum which is essential in the presence of ladies Thanks however to the improvements in modern society and the high example shown to the nation by its most illustrious personages temperance is in these happy days a striking feature in the character of a gentleman Delicacy of conduct towards the female sex has increased with the esteem in which they are now universally held and thus the very early withdrawing of the ladies from the dining room is to be deprecated A lull in the conversation will seasonably indicate the moment for the ladies departure thirty nine AFTER DINNER INVITATIONS MAY BE GIVEN by which we wish to be understood invitations for the evening The time of the arrival of these visitors will vary according to their engagements or sometimes will be varied in obedience to the caprices of fashion Guests invited for the evening are however generally considered at liberty to arrive whenever it will best suit themselves usually between nine and twelve unless earlier hours are specifically named By this arrangement many fashionable people and others who have numerous engagements to fulfil often contrive to make their appearance at two or three parties in the course of one evening forty THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DINNER PARTY TABLE being disposed of let us now enter slightly into that of an evening party or ball The invitations issued and accepted for either of these will be written in the same style as those already described for a dinner party They should be sent out at least three weeks before the day fixed for the event and should be replied to within a week of their receipt By attending to these courtesies the guests will have time to consider their engagements and prepare their dresses and the hostess will also know what will be the number of her party If the entertainment is to be simply an evening party this must be specified on the card or note of invitation Short or verbal invitations except where persons are exceedingly intimate or are very near relations are very far from proper although of course in this respect and in many other respects very much always depends on the manner in which the invitation is given True politeness however should be studied even amongst the nearest friends and relations for the mechanical forms of good breeding are of great consequence and too much familiarity may have for its effect the destruction of friendship forty one AS THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARRIVE each should be shown to a room exclusively provided for their reception and in that set apart for the ladies attendants should be in waiting to assist in uncloaking and helping to arrange the hair and toilet of those who require it It will be found convenient in those cases where the number of guests is large to provide numbered tickets so that they can be attached to the cloaks and shawls of each lady a duplicate of which should be handed to the guest Coffee is sometimes provided in this or an ante room for those who would like to partake of it forty two AS THE VISITORS ARE ANNOUNCED BY THE SERVANT it is not necessary for the lady of the house to advance each time towards the door but merely to rise from her seat to receive their courtesies and congratulations If indeed the hostess wishes to show particular favour to some peculiarly honoured guests she may introduce them to others whose acquaintance she may imagine will be especially suitable and agreeable It is very often the practice of the master of the house to introduce one gentleman to another but occasionally the lady performs this office when it will of course be polite for the persons thus introduced to take their seats together for the time being The custom of non introduction is very much in vogue in many houses and guests are thus left to discover for themselves the position and qualities of the people around them The servant indeed calls out the names of all the visitors as they arrive but in many instances mispronounces them so that it will not be well to follow this information as if it were an unerring guide In our opinion it is a cheerless and depressing custom although in thus speaking we do not allude to the large assemblies of the aristocracy but to the smaller parties of the middle classes forty three A SEPARATE ROOM OR CONVENIENT BUFFET should be appropriated for refreshments and to which the dancers may retire and cakes and biscuits with wine negus lemonade and ices handed round A supper is also mostly provided at the private parties of the middle classes and this requires on the part of the hostess a great deal of attention and supervision It usually takes place between the first and second parts of the programme of the dances of which there should be several prettily written or printed copies distributed about the ball room In private parties a lady is not to refuse the invitation of a gentleman to dance unless she be previously engaged The hostess must be supposed to have asked to her house only those persons whom she knows to be perfectly respectable and of unblemished character as well as pretty equal in position and thus to decline the offer of any gentleman present would be a tacit reflection on the master and mistress of the house It may be mentioned here more especially for the young who will read this book that introductions at balls or evening parties cease with the occasion that calls them forth no introduction at these times giving a gentleman a right to address afterwards a lady She is consequently free next morning to pass her partner at a ball of the previous evening without the slightest recognition forty four THE BALL IS GENERALLY OPENED that is the first place in the first quadrille is occupied by the lady of the house When anything prevents this the host will usually lead off the dance with the lady who is either the highest in rank or the greatest stranger It will be well for the hostess even if she be very partial to the amusement and a graceful dancer not to participate in it to any great extent lest her lady guests should have occasion to complain of her monopoly of the gentlemen and other causes of neglect A few dances will suffice to show her interest in the entertainment without unduly trenching on the attention due to her guests In all its parts a ball should be perfect The music and the banquet and the wine The garlands the rose odours and the flowers The hostess or host during the progress of a ball will courteously accost and chat with their friends and take care that the ladies are furnished with seats and that those who wish to dance are provided with partners A gentle hint from the hostess conveyed in a quiet ladylike manner that certain ladies have remained unengaged during several dances is sure not to be neglected by any gentleman Thus will be studied the comfort and enjoyment of the guests and no lady in leaving the house will be able to feel the chagrin and disappointment of not having been invited to stand up in a dance during the whole of the evening forty five WHEN ANY OF THE CARRIAGES OF THE GUESTS ARE ANNOUNCED or the time for their departure arrived they should make a slight intimation to the hostess without however exciting any observation that they are about to depart If this cannot be done however without creating too much bustle it will be better for the visitors to retire quietly without taking their leave During the course of the week the hostess will expect to receive from every guest a call where it is possible or cards expressing the gratification experienced from her entertainment This attention is due to every lady for the pains and trouble she has been at and tends to promote social kindly feelings forty six HAVING THUS DISCOURSED of parties of pleasure it will be an interesting change to return to the more domestic business of the house although all the details we have been giving of dinner parties balls and the like appertain to the department of the mistress Without a knowledge of the etiquette to be observed on these occasions a mistress would be unable to enjoy and appreciate those friendly pleasant meetings which give as it were a fillip to life and make the quiet happy home of an English gentlewoman appear the more delightful and enjoyable In their proper places all that is necessary to be known respecting the dishes and appearance of the breakfast dinner tea and supper tables will be set forth in this work forty seven A FAMILY DINNER AT HOME compared with either giving or going to a dinner party is of course of much more frequent occurrence and many will say of much greater importance Both however have to be considered with a view to their nicety and enjoyment and the latter more particularly with reference to economy These points will be especially noted in the following pages on Household Cookery Here we will only say that for both mistress and servants as well in large as small households it will be found by far the better plan to cook and serve the dinner and to lay the tablecloth and the sideboard with the same cleanliness neatness and scrupulous exactness whether it be for the mistress herself alone a small family or for company If this rule be strictly adhered to all will find themselves increase in managing skill whilst a knowledge of their daily duties will become familiar and enable them to meet difficult occasions with ease and overcome any amount of obstacles forty eight OF THE MANNER OF PASSING EVENINGS AT HOME there is none pleasanter than in such recreative enjoyments as those which relax the mind from its severer duties whilst they stimulate it with a gentle delight Where there are young people forming a part of the evening circle interesting and agreeable pastime should especially be promoted It is of incalculable benefit to them that their homes should possess all the attractions of healthful amusement comfort and happiness for if they do not find pleasure there they will seek it elsewhere It ought therefore to enter into the domestic policy of every parent to make her children feel that home is the happiest place in the world that to imbue them with this delicious home feeling is one of the choicest gifts a parent can bestow Light or fancy needlework often forms a portion of the evening s recreation for the ladies of the household and this may be varied by an occasional game at chess or backgammon It has often been remarked too that nothing is more delightful to the feminine members of a family than the reading aloud of some good standard work or amusing publication A knowledge of polite literature may be thus obtained by the whole family especially if the reader is able and willing to explain the more difficult passages of the book and expatiate on the wisdom and beauties it may contain This plan in a great measure realizes the advice of Lord Bacon who says Read not to contradict and refute nor to believe and take for granted nor to find talk and discourse but to weigh and consider forty nine IN RETIRING FOR THE NIGHT it is well to remember that early rising is almost impossible if late going to bed be the order or rather disorder of the house The younger members of a family should go early and at regular hours to their beds and the domestics as soon as possible after a reasonably appointed hour Either the master or the mistress of a house should after all have gone to their separate rooms see that all is right with respect to the lights and fires below and no servants should on any account be allowed to remain up after the heads of the house have retired fifty HAVING THUS GONE FROM EARLY RISING TO EARLY RETIRING there remain only now to be considered a few special positions respecting which the mistress of the house will be glad to receive some specific information fifty one WHEN A MISTRESS TAKES A HOUSE in a new locality it will be etiquette for her to wait until the older inhabitants of the neighbourhood call upon her thus evincing a desire on their part to become acquainted with the new comer It may be that the mistress will desire an intimate acquaintance with but few of her neighbours but it is to be specially borne in mind that all visits whether of ceremony friendship or condolence should be punctiliously returned fifty two YOU MAY PERHAPS HAVE BEEN FAVOURED with letters of introduction from some of your friends to persons living in the neighbourhood to which you have just come In this case inclose the letter of introduction in an envelope with your card Then if the person to whom it is addressed calls in the course of a few days the visit should be returned by you within the week if possible Any breach of etiquette in this respect will not readily be excused In the event of your being invited to dinner under the above circumstances nothing but necessity should prevent you from accepting the invitation If however there is some distinct reason why you cannot accept let it be stated frankly and plainly for politeness and truthfulness should be ever allied An opportunity should also be taken to call in the course of a day or two in order to politely express your regret and disappointment at not having been able to avail yourself of their kindness fifty three IN GIVING A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION it should always be handed to your friend unsealed Courtesy dictates this as the person whom you are introducing would perhaps wish to know in what manner he or she was spoken of Should you receive a letter from a friend introducing to you any person known to and esteemed by the writer the letter should be immediately acknowledged and your willingness expressed to do all in your power to carry out his or her wishes fifty four SUCH ARE THE ONEROUS DUTIES which enter into the position of the mistress of a house and such are happily with a slight but continued attention of by no means difficult performance She ought always to remember that she is the first and the last the Alpha and the Omega in the government of her establishment and that it is by her conduct that its whole internal policy is regulated She is therefore a person of far more importance in a community than she usually thinks she is On her pattern her daughters model themselves by her counsels they are directed through her virtues all are honoured her children rise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her Therefore let each mistress always remember her responsible position never approving a mean action nor speaking an unrefined word Let her conduct be such that her inferiors may respect her and such as an honourable and right minded man may look for in his wife and the mother of his children Let her think of the many compliments and the sincere homage that have been paid to her sex by the greatest philosophers and writers both in ancient and modern times Let her not forget that she has to show herself worthy of Campbell s compliment when he said The world was sad the garden was a wild And man the hermit sigh d till woman smiled Let her prove herself then the happy companion of man and able to take unto herself the praises of the pious prelate Jeremy Taylor who says A good wife is Heaven s last best gift to man his angel and minister of graces innumerable his gem of many virtues his casket of jewels her voice is sweet music her smiles his brightest day her kiss the guardian of his innocence her arms the pale of his safety the balm of his health the balsam of his life her industry his surest wealth her economy his safest steward her lips his faithful counsellors her bosom the softest pillow of his cares and her prayers the ablest advocates of Heaven s blessings on his head Cherishing then in her breast the respected utterances of the good and the great let the mistress of every house rise to the responsibility of its management so that in doing her duty to all around her she may receive the genuine reward of respect love and affection Note Many mistresses have experienced the horrors of house hunting and it is well known that three removes are as good or bad rather as a fire Nevertheless it being quite evident that we must in these days at least live in houses and are sometimes obliged to change our residences it is well to consider some of the conditions which will add to or diminish the convenience and comfort of our homes Although the choice of a house must be dependent on so many different circumstances with different people that to give any specific directions on this head would be impossible and useless yet it will be advantageous perhaps to many if we point out some of those general features as to locality soil aspect c to which the attention of all house takers should be carefully directed Regarding the locality we may say speaking now more particularly of a town house that it is very important to the health and comfort of a family that the neighbourhood of all factories of any kind producing unwholesome effluvia or smells should be strictly avoided Neither is it well to take a house in the immediate vicinity of where a noisy trade is carried on as it is unpleasant to the feelings and tends to increase any existing irritation of the system Referring to soils it is held as a rule that a gravel soil is superior to any other as the rain drains through it very quickly and it is consequently drier and less damp than clay upon which water rests a far longer time A clay country too is not so pleasant for walking exercise as one in which gravel predominates The aspect of the house should be well considered and it should be borne in mind that the more sunlight that comes into the house the healthier is the habitation The close fetid smell which assails one on entering a narrow court or street in towns is to be assigned to the want of light and consequently air A house with a south or south west aspect is lighter warmer drier and consequently more healthy than one facing the north or north east Great advances have been made during the last few years in the principles of sanitary knowledge and one most essential point to be observed in reference to a house is its drainage as it has been proved in an endless number of cases that bad or defective drainage is as certain to destroy health as the taking of poisons This arises from its injuriously affecting the atmosphere thus rendering the air we breathe unwholesome and deleterious Let it be borne in mind then that unless a house is effectually drained the health of its inhabitants is sure to suffer and they will be susceptible of ague rheumatism diarrhoea fevers and cholera We now come to an all important point that of the water supply The value of this necessary article has also been lately more and more recognized in connection with the question of health and life and most houses are well supplied with every convenience connected with water Let it however be well understood that no house however suitable in other respects can be desirable if this grand means of health and comfort is in the slightest degree scarce or impure No caution can be too great to see that it is pure and good as well as plentiful for knowing as we do that not a single part of our daily food is prepared without it the importance of its influence on the health of the inmates of a house cannot be over rated Ventilation is another feature which must not be overlooked In a general way enough of air is admitted by the cracks round the doors and windows but if this be not the case the chimney will smoke and other plans such as the placing of a plate of finely perforated zinc in the upper part of the window must be used Cold air should never be admitted under the doors or at the bottom of a room unless it be close to the fire or stove for it will flow along the floor towards the fireplace and thus leave the foul air in the upper part of the room unpurified cooling at the same time unpleasantly and injuriously the feet and legs of the inmates The rent of a house it has been said should not exceed one eighth of the whole income of its occupier and as a general rule we are disposed to assent to this estimate although there may be many circumstances which would not admit of its being considered infallible Illustration CHAPTER II THE HOUSEKEEPER fifty five AS SECOND IN COMMAND IN THE HOUSE except in large establishments where there is a house steward the housekeeper must consider herself as the immediate representative of her mistress and bring to the management of the household all those qualities of honesty industry and vigilance in the same degree as if she were at the head of her own family Constantly on the watch to detect any wrong doing on the part of any of the domestics she will overlook all that goes on in the house and will see that every department is thoroughly attended to and that the servants are comfortable at the same time that their various duties are properly performed Cleanliness punctuality order and method are essentials in the character of a good housekeeper Without the first no household can be said to be well managed The second is equally all important for those who are under the housekeeper will take their cue from her and in the same proportion as punctuality governs her movements so will it theirs Order again is indispensable for by it we wish to be understood that there should be a place for everything and everything in its place Method too is most necessary for when the work is properly contrived and each part arranged in regular succession it will be done more quickly and more effectually fifty six A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR A HOUSEKEEPER is that she should thoroughly understand accounts She will have to write in her books an accurate registry of all sums paid for any and every purpose all the current expenses of the house tradesmen s bills and other extraneous matter As we have mentioned under the head of the Mistress see sixteen a housekeeper s accounts should be periodically balanced and examined by the head of the house Nothing tends more to the satisfaction of both employer and employed than this arrangement Short reckonings make long friends stands good in this case as in others It will be found an excellent plan to take an account of every article which comes into the house connected with housekeeping and is not paid for at the time The book containing these entries can then be compared with the bills sent in by the various tradesmen so that any discrepancy can be inquired into and set right An intelligent housekeeper will by this means too be better able to judge of the average consumption of each article by the household and if that quantity be at any time exceeded the cause may be discovered and rectified if it proceed from waste or carelessness fifty seven ALTHOUGH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE COOK the housekeeper does not generally much interfere yet it is necessary that she should possess a good knowledge of the culinary art as in many instances it may be requisite for her to take the superintendence of the kitchen As a rule it may be stated that the housekeeper in those establishments where there is no house steward or man cook undertakes the preparation of the confectionary attends to the preserving and pickling of fruits and vegetables and in a general way to the more difficult branches of the art of cookery Much of these arrangements will depend however on the qualifications of the cook for instance if she be an able artiste there will be but little necessity for the housekeeper to interfere except in the already noticed articles of confectionary c On the contrary if the cook be not so clever an adept in her art then it will be requisite for the housekeeper to give more of her attention to the business of the kitchen than in the former case It will be one of the duties of the housekeeper to attend to the marketing in the absence of either a house steward or man cook fifty eight THE DAILY DUTIES OF A HOUSEKEEPER are regulated in a great measure by the extent of the establishment she superintends She should however rise early and see that all the domestics are duly performing their work and that everything is progressing satisfactorily for the preparation of the breakfast for the household and family After breakfast which in large establishments she will take in the housekeeper s room with the lady s maid butler and valet and where they will be waited on by the still room maid she will on various days set apart for each purpose carefully examine the household linen with a view to its being repaired or to a further quantity being put in hand to be made she will also see that the furniture throughout the house is well rubbed and polished and will besides attend to all the necessary details of marketing and ordering goods from the tradesmen The housekeeper s room is generally made use of by the lady s maid butler and valet who take there their breakfast tea and supper The lady s maid will also use this apartment as a sitting room when not engaged with her lady or with some other duties which would call her elsewhere In different establishments according to their size and the rank of the family different rules of course prevail For instance in the mansions of those of very high rank and where there is a house steward there are two distinct tables kept one in the steward s room for the principal members of the household the other in the servants hall for the other domestics At the steward s dinner table the steward and housekeeper preside and here also are present the lady s maid butler valet and head gardener Should any visitors be staying with the family their servants generally the valet and lady s maid will be admitted to the steward s table fifty nine AFTER DINNER the housekeeper having seen that all the members of the establishment have regularly returned to their various duties and that all the departments of the household are in proper working order will have many important matters claiming her attention She will possibly have to give the finishing touch to some article of confectionary or be occupied with some of the more elaborate processes of the still room There may also be the dessert to arrange ice creams to make and all these employments call for no ordinary degree of care taste and attention The still room was formerly much more in vogue than at present for in days of auld lang syne the still was in constant requisition for the supply of sweet flavoured waters for the purposes of cookery scents and aromatic substances used in the preparation of the toilet and cordials in cases of accidents and illness There are some establishments however in which distillation is still carried on and in these the still room maid has her old duties to perform In a general way however this domestic is immediately concerned with the housekeeper For the latter she lights the fire dusts her room prepares the breakfast table and waits at the different meals taken in the housekeeper s room see fifty eight A still room maid may learn a very great deal of useful knowledge from her intimate connection with the housekeeper and if she be active and intelligent may soon fit herself for a better position in the household sixty IN THE EVENING the housekeeper will often busy herself with the necessary preparations for the next day s duties Numberless small but still important arrangements will have to be made so that everything may move smoothly At times perhaps attention will have to be paid to the breaking of lump sugar the stoning of raisins the washing cleansing and drying of currants c The evening too is the best time for setting right her account of the expenditure and duly writing a statement of moneys received and paid and also for making memoranda of any articles she may require for her storeroom or other departments Periodically at some convenient time for instance quarterly or half yearly it is a good plan for the housekeeper to make an inventory of everything she has under her care and compare this with the lists of a former period she will then be able to furnish a statement if necessary of the articles which on account of time breakage loss or other causes it has been necessary to replace or replenish sixty one IN CONCLUDING THESE REMARKS on the duties of the housekeeper we will briefly refer to the very great responsibility which attaches to her position Like Caesar s wife she should be above suspicion and her honesty and sobriety unquestionable for there are many temptations to which she is exposed In a physical point of view a housekeeper should be healthy and strong and be particularly clean in her person and her hands although they may show a degree of roughness from the nature of some of her employments yet should have a nice inviting appearance In her dealings with the various tradesmen and in her behaviour to the domestics under her the demeanour and conduct of the housekeeper should be such as in neither case to diminish by an undue familiarity her authority or influence Note It will be useful for the mistress and housekeeper to know the best seasons for various occupations connected with Household Management and we accordingly subjoin a few hints which we think will prove valuable As in the winter months servants have much more to do in consequence of the necessity there is to attend to the number of fires throughout the household not much more than the ordinary every day work can be attempted In the summer and when the absence of fires gives the domestics more leisure then any extra work that is required can be more easily performed The spring is the usual period set apart for house cleaning and removing all the dust and dirt which will necessarily with the best of housewives accumulate during the winter months from the smoke of the coal oil gas c This season is also well adapted for washing and bleaching linen c as the weather not being then too hot for the exertions necessary in washing counterpanes blankets and heavy things in general the work is better and more easily done than in the intense heats of July which month some recommend for these purposes Winter curtains should be taken down and replaced by the summer white ones and furs and woollen cloths also carefully laid by The former should be well shaken and brushed and then pinned upon paper or linen with camphor to preserve them from the moths Furs c will be preserved in the same way Included under the general description of house cleaning must be understood turning out all the nooks and corners of drawers cupboards lumber rooms lofts c with a view of getting rid of all unnecessary articles which only create dirt and attract vermin sweeping of chimneys taking up carpets painting and whitewashing the kitchen and offices papering rooms when needed and generally speaking the house putting on with the approaching summer a bright appearance and a new face in unison with nature Oranges now should be preserved and orange wine made The summer will be found as we have mentioned above in consequence of the diminution of labour for the domestics the best period for examining and repairing household linen and for putting to rights all those articles which have received a large share of wear and tear during the dark winter days In direct reference to this matter we may here remark that sheets should be turned sides to middle before they are allowed to get very thin Otherwise patching which is uneconomical from the time it consumes and is unsightly in point of appearance will have to be resorted to In June and July gooseberries currants raspberries strawberries and other summer fruits should be preserved and jams and jellies made In July too the making of walnut ketchup should be attended to as the green walnuts will be approaching perfection for this purpose Mixed pickles may also be now made and it will be found a good plan to have ready a jar of pickle juice for the making of which all information will be given in future pages into which to put occasionally some young French beans cauliflowers c In the early autumn plums of various kinds are to be bottled and preserved and jams and jellies made A little later tomato sauce a most useful article to have by you may be prepared a supply of apples laid in if you have a place to keep them as also a few keeping pears and filberts Endeavour to keep also a large vegetable marrow it will be found delicious in the winter In October and November it will be necessary to prepare for the cold weather and get ready the winter clothing for the various members of the family The white summer curtains will now be carefully put away the fireplaces grates and chimneys looked to and the House put in a thorough state of repair so that no loose tile may at a future day interfere with your comfort and extract something considerable from your pocket In December the principal household duty lies in preparing for the creature comforts of those near and dear to us so as to meet old Christmas with a happy face a contented mind and a full larder and in stoning the plums washing the currants cutting the citron beating the eggs and MIXING THE PUDDING a housewife is not unworthily greeting the genial season of all good things Illustration CHAPTER III ARRANGEMENT AND ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN sixty two THE DISTRIBUTION OF A KITCHEN says Count Rumford the celebrated philosopher and physician who wrote so learnedly on all subjects connected with domestic economy and architecture must always depend so much on local circumstances that general rules can hardly be given respecting it the principles however on which this distribution ought in all cases to be made are simple and easy to be understood and in his estimation these resolve themselves into symmetry of proportion in the building and convenience to the cook The requisites of a good kitchen however demand something more special than is here pointed out It must be remembered that it is the great laboratory of every household and that much of the weal or woe as far as regards bodily health depends upon the nature of the preparations concocted within its walls A good kitchen therefore should be erected with a view to the following particulars one Convenience of distribution in its parts with largeness of dimension two Excellence of light height of ceiling and good ventilation three Easiness of access without passing through the house four Sufficiently remote from the principal apartments of the house that the members visitors or guests of the family may not perceive the odour incident to cooking or hear the noise of culinary operations five Plenty of fuel and water which with the scullery pantry and storeroom should be so near it as to offer the smallest possible trouble in reaching them Illustration Fig one The kitchens of the Middle Ages in England are said to have been constructed after the fashion of those of the Romans They were generally octagonal with several fireplaces but no chimneys neither was there any wood admitted into the building The accompanying cut fig one represents the turret which was erected on the top of the conical roof of the kitchen at Glastonbury Abbey and which was perforated with holes to allow the smoke of the fire as well as the steam from cooking to escape Some kitchens had funnels or vents below the eaves to let out the steam which was sometimes considerable as the Anglo Saxons used their meat chiefly in a boiled state From this circumstance some of their large kitchens had four ranges comprising a boiling place for small boiled meats and a boiling house for the great boiler In private houses the culinary arrangements were no doubt different for Du Cange mentions a little kitchen with a chamber even in a solarium or upper floor sixty three THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PRIMITIVE AGES has frequently been an object of poetical admiration and it delights the imagination to picture men living upon such fruits as spring spontaneously from the earth and desiring no other beverages to slake their thirst but such as fountains and rivers supply Thus we are told that the ancient inhabitants of Argos lived principally on pears that the Arcadians revelled in acorns and the Athenians in figs This of course was in the golden age before ploughing began and when mankind enjoyed all kinds of plenty without having to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow This delightful period however could not last for ever and the earth became barren and continued unfruitful till Ceres came and taught the art of sowing with several other useful inventions The first whom she taught to till the ground was Triptolemus who communicated his instructions to his countrymen the Athenians Thence the art was carried into Achaia and thence into Arcadia Barley was the first grain that was used and the invention of bread making is ascribed to Pan The use of fire as an instrument of cookery must have been coeval with this invention of bread which being the most necessary of all kinds of food was frequently used in a sense so comprehensive as to include both meat and drink It was by the Greeks baked under the ashes sixty four IN THE PRIMARY AGES it was deemed unlawful to eat flesh and when mankind began to depart from their primitive habits the flesh of swine was the first that was eaten For several ages it was pronounced unlawful to slaughter oxen from an estimate of their great value in assisting men to cultivate the ground nor was it usual to kill young animals from a sentiment which considered it cruel to take away the life of those that had scarcely tasted the joys of existence At this period no cooks were kept and we know from Homer that his ancient heroes prepared and dressed their victuals with their own hands Ulysses for example we are told like a modern charwoman excelled at lighting a fire whilst Achilles was an adept at turning a spit Subsequently heralds employed in civil and military affairs filled the office of cooks and managed marriage feasts but this no doubt was after mankind had advanced in the art of living a step further than roasting which in all places was the ancient manner of dressing meat sixty five THE AGE OF ROASTING we may consider as that in which the use of the metals would be introduced as adjuncts to the culinary art and amongst these iron the most useful of them all would necessarily take a prominent place This metal is easily oxidized but to bring it to a state of fusibility it requires a most intense heat Of all the metals it is the widest diffused and most abundant and few stones or mineral bodies are without an admixture of it It possesses the valuable property of being welded by hammering and hence its adaptation to the numerous purposes of civilized life Metallic grains of iron have been found in strawberries and a twelfth of the weight of the wood of dried oak is said to consist of this metal Blood owes its colour of redness to the quantity of iron it contains and rain and snow are seldom perfectly free from it In the arts it is employed in three states as cast iron wrought iron and steel In each of these it largely enters into the domestic economy and stoves grates and the general implements of cookery are usually composed of it In antiquity its employment was comparatively speaking equally universal The excavations made at Pompeii have proved this The accompanying cuts present us with specimens of stoves both ancient and modern Fig two is the remains of a kitchen stove found in the house of Pansa at Pompeii and would seem in its perfect state not to have been materially different from such as are in use at the present day Fig three is a self acting simple open range in modern use and may be had of two qualities ranging according to their dimensions from Lthree tens and Lthree eighteens respectively up to Lfour tens and Lseven fives They are completely fitted up with oven boiler sliding cheek wrought iron bars revolving shelves and brass tap Fig four is called the Improved Leamington Kitchener and is said to surpass any other range in use for easy cooking by one fire It has a hot plate which is well calculated for an ironing stove and on which as many vessels as will stand upon it may be kept boiling without being either soiled or injured Besides it has a perfectly ventilated and spacious wrought iron roaster with movable shelves draw out stand double dripping pan and meat stand The roaster can be converted into an oven by closing the valves when bread and pastry can be baked in it in a superior manner It also has a large iron boiler with brass tap and steam pipe round and square gridirons for chops and steaks ash pan open fire for roasting and a set of ornamental covings with plate warmer attached It took a first class prize and medal in the Great Exhibition of eighteen fifty one and was also exhibited with all the recent improvements at the Dublin Exhibition in eighteen fifty three Fig five is another kitchener adapted for large families It has on the one side a large ventilated oven and on the other the fire and roaster The hot plate is over all and there is a back boiler made of wrought iron with brass tap and steam pipe In other respects it resembles Fig four with which it possesses similar advantages of construction Either maybe had at varying prices according to size from Lfive fifteens up to Ltwenty three tens They are supplied by Messrs Richard John Slack three hundred thirty six Strand London Illustration Fig two Illustration Fig three Illustration Fig four Illustration Fig five sixty six FROM KITCHEN RANGES to the implements used in cookery is but a step With these every kitchen should be well supplied otherwise the cook must not be expected to perform her office in a satisfactory manner Of the culinary utensils of the ancients our knowledge is very limited but as the art of living in every civilized country is pretty much the same the instruments for cooking must in a great degree bear a striking resemblance to each other On referring to classical antiquities we find mentioned among household utensils leather bags baskets constructed of twigs reeds and rushes boxes basins and bellows bread moulds brooms and brushes caldrons colanders cisterns and chafing dishes cheese rasps knives and ovens of the Dutch kind funnels and frying pans handmills soup ladles milk pails and oil jars presses scales and sieves spits of different sizes but some of them large enough to roast an ox spoons fire tongs trays trenchers and drinking vessels with others for carrying food preserving milk and holding cheese This enumeration if it does nothing else will to some extent indicate the state of the simpler kinds of mechanical arts among the ancients Illustration Fig six Illustration Fig seven Illustration Fig eight In so far as regards the shape and construction of many of the kitchen utensils enumerated above they bore a great resemblance to our own This will be seen by the accompanying cuts Fig six is an ancient stock pot in bronze which seems to have been made to hang over the fire and was found in the buried city of Pompeii Fig seven is one of modern make and may be obtained either of copper or wrought iron tinned inside Fig eight is another of antiquity with a large ladle and colander with holes attached It is taken from the column of Trajan The modern ones can be obtained at all prices according to size from thirteens sixd up to Lone ones sixty seven IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THESE UTENSILS bronze metal seems to have been much in favour with the ancients It was chosen not only for their domestic vessels but it was also much used for their public sculptures and medals It is a compound composed of from six to twelve parts of tin to one hundred of copper It gives its name to figures and all pieces of sculpture made of it Brass was another favourite metal which is composed of copper and zinc It is more fusible than copper and not so apt to tarnish In a pure state it is not malleable unless when hot and after it has been melted twice it will not bear the hammer To render it capable of being wrought it requires seven lb of lead to be put to one cwt of its own material The Corinthian brass of antiquity was a mixture of silver gold and copper A fine kind of brass supposed to be made by the cementation of copper plates with calamine is in Germany hammered out into leaves and is called Dutch metal in this country It is employed in the same way as gold leaf Brass is much used for watchworks as well as for wire sixty eight The braziers ladles stewpans saucepans gridirons and colanders of antiquity might generally pass for those of the English manufacture of the present day in so far as shape is concerned In proof of this we have placed together the following similar articles of ancient and modern pattern in order that the reader may at a single view see wherein any difference that is between them consists Illustration Fig nine Modern Illustration Fig ten Ancient Illustration Fig eleven Modern Illustration Fig twelve Ancient Illustration Fig thirteen Modern Illustration Fig fourteen Ancient Illustration Fig fifteen Modern Illustration Fig sixteen Modern Illustration Fig seventeen Ancient Illustration Fig eighteen Ancient Figs nine and ten are flat sauce or saute pans the ancient one being fluted in the handle and having at the end a ram s head Figs eleven and twelve are colanders the handle of the ancient one being adorned in the original with carved representations of a cornucopia a satyr a goat pigs and other animals Any display of taste in the adornment of such utensils might seem to be useless but when we remember how much more natural it is for us all to be careful of the beautiful and costly than of the plain and cheap it may even become a question in the economy of a kitchen whether it would not in the long run be cheaper to have articles which displayed some tasteful ingenuity in their manufacture than such as are so perfectly plain as to have no attractions whatever beyond their mere suitableness to the purposes for which they are made Figs thirteen and fourteen are saucepans the ancient one being of bronze originally copied from the cabinet of M l Abbe Charlet and engraved in the Antiquities of Montfaucon Figs fifteen and seventeen are gridirons and sixteen and eighteen dripping pans In all these utensils the resemblance between such as were in use two thousand years ago and those in use at the present day is strikingly manifest sixty nine SOME OF THE ANCIENT UTENSILS represented in the above cuts are copied from those found amid the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii These Roman cities were in the first century buried beneath the lava of an eruption of Vesuvius and continued to be lost to the world till the beginning of the last century when a peasant in digging for a well gradually discovered a small temple with some statues Little notice however was taken of this circumstance till seventeen thirty six when the king of Naples desiring to erect a palace at Portici caused extensive excavations to be made when the city of Herculaneum was slowly unfolded to view Pompeii was discovered about seventeen fifty and being easier cleared from the lava in which it had so long been entombed disclosed itself as it existed immediately before the catastrophe which overwhelmed it nearly two thousand years ago It presented to the modern world the perfect picture of the form and structure of an ancient Roman city The interior of its habitations shops baths theatres and temples were all disclosed with many of the implements used by the workmen in their various trades and the materials on which they were employed when the doomed city was covered with the lavian stream seventy AMONGST THE MOST ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS of the kitchen are scales or weighing machines for family use These are found to have existed among the ancients and must at a very early age have been both publicly and privately employed for the regulation of quantities The modern English weights were adjusted by the twenty seventh chapter of Magna Charta or the great charter forced by the barons from King John at Runnymede in Surrey Therein it is declared that the weights all over England shall be the same although for different commodities there were two different kinds Troy and Avoirdupois The origin of both is taken from a grain of wheat gathered in the middle of an ear The standard of measures was originally kept at Winchester and by a law of King Edgar was ordained to be observed throughout the kingdom Illustration Fig nineteen Illustration Fig twenty Fig nineteen is an ancient pair of common scales with two basins and a movable weight which is made in the form of a head covered with the pileus because Mercury had the weights and measures under his superintendence It is engraved on a stone in the gallery of Florence Fig twenty represents a modern weighing machine of great convenience and generally in use in those establishments where a great deal of cooking is carried on seventy one ACCOMPANYING THE SCALES or weighing machines there should be spice boxes and sugar and biscuit canisters of either white or japanned tin The covers of these should fit tightly in order to exclude the air and if necessary be lettered in front to distinguish them The white metal of which they are usually composed loses its colour when exposed to the air but undergoes no further change It enters largely into the composition of culinary utensils many of them being entirely composed of tinned sheet iron the inside of copper and iron vessels also being usually what is called tinned This art consists of covering any metal with a thin coating of tin and it requires the metal to be covered to be perfectly clean and free from rust and also that the tin itself be purely metallic and entirely cleared from all ashes or refuse Copper boilers saucepans and other kitchen utensils are tinned after they are manufactured by being first made hot and the tin rubbed on with resin In this process nothing ought to be used but pure grain tin Lead however is sometimes mixed with that metal not only to make it lie more easily but to adulterate it a pernicious practice which in every article connected with the cooking and preparation of food cannot be too severely reprobated The following list supplied by Messrs Richard John Slack three hundred thirty six Strand will show the articles required for the kitchen of a family in the middle class of life although it does not contain all the things that may be deemed necessary for some families and may contain more than are required for others As Messrs Slack themselves however publish a useful illustrated catalogue which may be had at their establishment gratis and which it will be found advantageous to consult by those about to furnish it supersedes the necessity of our enlarging

paid to their condition generally but more especially to that of the saucepans stewpans and boilers Inside they should be kept perfectly clean and where an open fire is used the outside as clean as possible With a Leamington range saucepans stewpans c can be kept entirely free from smoke and soot on the outside which is an immense saving of labour to the cook or scullery maid Care should be taken that the lids fit tight and close so that soups or gravies may not be suffered to waste by evaporation They should be made to keep the steam in and the smoke out and should always be bright on the upper rim where they do not immediately come in contact with the fire Soup pots and kettles should be washed immediately After being used and dried before the fire and they should be kept in a dry place in order that they may escape the deteriorating influence of rust and thereby be destroyed Copper utensils should never be used in the kitchen unless tinned and the utmost care should be taken not to let the tin be rubbed off If by chance this should occur have it replaced before the vessel is again brought into use Neither soup nor gravy should at any time be suffered to remain in them longer than is absolutely necessary as any fat or acid that is in them may affect the metal so as to impregnate with poison what is intended to be eaten Stone and earthenware vessels should be provided for soups and gravies not intended for immediate use and also plenty of common dishes for the larder that the table set may not be used for such purposes It is the nature of vegetables soon to turn sour when they are apt to corrode glazed red ware and even metals and frequently thereby to become impregnated with poisonous particles The vinegar also in pickles by its acidity does the same Consideration therefore should be given to these facts and great care also taken that all sieves jelly bags and tapes for collared articles be well scalded and kept dry or they will impart an unpleasant flavour when next used To all these directions the cook should pay great attention nor should they by any means be neglected by the mistress of the household who ought to remember that cleanliness in the kitchen gives health and happiness to home whilst economy will immeasurably assist in preserving them seventy three WITHOUT FUEL A KITCHEN might be pronounced to be of little use therefore to discover and invent materials for supplying us with the means of domestic heat and comfort has exercised the ingenuity of man Those now known have been divided into five classes the first comprehending the fluid inflammable bodies the second peat or turf the third charcoal of wood the fourth pit coal charred and the fifth wood or pit coal in a crude state with the capacity of yielding a copious and bright flame The first may be said seldom to be employed for the purposes of cookery but peat especially amongst rural populations has in all ages been regarded as an excellent fuel It is one of the most important productions of an alluvial soil and belongs to the vegetable rather than the mineral kingdom It may be described as composed of wet spongy black earth held together by decayed vegetables Formerly it covered extensive tracts in England but has greatly disappeared before the genius of agricultural improvement Charcoal is a kind of artificial coal used principally where a strong and clear fire is desired It is a black brittle insoluble inodorous tasteless substance and when newly made possesses the remarkable property of absorbing certain quantities of the different gases Its dust when used as a polishing powder gives great brilliancy to metals It consists of wood half burned and is manufactured by cutting pieces of timber into nearly the same size then disposing them in heaps and covering them with earth so as to prevent communication with the air except when necessary to make them burn When they have been sufficiently charred the fire is extinguished by stopping the vents through which the air is admitted Of coal there are various species as pit culm slate cannel Kilkenny sulphurous bovey jet c These have all their specific differences and are employed for various purposes but are all more or less used as fuel The use of coal for burning purposes was not known to the Romans In Britain it was discovered about fifty years before the birth of Christ in Lancashire not tar from where Manchester now stands but for ages after its discovery so long as forests abounded wood continued to be the fuel used for firing The first public notice of coal is in the reign of Henry III who in twelve seventy two granted a charter to the town of Newcastle permitting the inhabitants to dig for coal It took some centuries more however to bring it into common use as this did not take place till about the first quarter of the seventeenth century in the time of Charles I A few years after the Restoration we find that about two hundred thousand chaldrons were consumed in London Although several countries possess mines of coal the quality of their mineral is in general greatly inferior to that of Great Britain where it is found mostly in undulating districts abounding with valleys and interspersed with plains of considerable extent It lies usually between the strata of other substances and rarely in an horizontal position but with a dip or inclination to one side Our cut Fig twenty one represents a section of coal as it is found in the stratum Illustration Fig twenty one seventy four TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE PERIODS when things are in season is one of the most essential pieces of knowledge which enter into the Art of Cookery We have therefore compiled the following list which will serve to show for every month in the year the TIMES WHEN THINGS ARE IN SEASON JANUARY FISH Barbel brill carp cod crabs crayfish dace eels flounders haddocks herrings lampreys lobsters mussels oysters perch pike plaice prawns shrimps

is how the latter may be best preserved with a view to its being suitably dressed More waste is often occasioned by the want of judgment or of necessary care in this particular than by any other cause In the absence of proper places for keeping provisions a hanging safe suspended in an airy situation is the best substitute A well ventilated larder dry and shady is better for meat and poultry which require to be kept for some time and the utmost skill in the culinary art will not compensate for the want of proper attention to this particular Though it is advisable that annual food should be hung up in the open air till its fibres have lost some degree of their toughness yet if it is kept till it loses its natural sweetness its flavour has become deteriorated and as a wholesome comestible it has lost many of its qualities conducive to health As soon therefore as the slightest trace of putrescence is detected it has reached its highest degree of tenderness and should be dressed immediately During the sultry summer months it is difficult to procure meat that is not either tough or tainted It should therefore be well examined when it comes in and if flies have touched it the part must be cut off and the remainder well washed In very cold weather meat and vegetables touched by the frost should be brought into the kitchen early in the morning and soaked in cold water In loins of meat the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out as it is apt to taint as also the kernels of beef Rumps and edgebones of beef when bruised should not be purchased All these things ought to enter into the consideration of every household manager and great care should be taken that nothing is thrown away or suffered to be wasted in the kitchen which might by proper management be turned to a good account The shank bones of mutton so little esteemed in general give richness to soups or gravies if well soaked and brushed before they are added to the boiling They are also particularly nourishing for sick persons Roast beef bones or shank bones of ham make excellent stock for pea soup When the whites of eggs are used for jelly confectionary or other purposes a pudding or a custard should be made that the yolks may be used All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness sugars of different sorts currants washed picked and perfectly dry spices pounded and kept in very small bottles closely corked or in canisters as we have already directed seventy two Not more of these should be purchased at a time than are likely to be used in the course of a month Much waste is always prevented by keeping every article in the place best suited to it Vegetables keep best on a stone floor if the air be excluded meat in a cold dry place as also salt sugar sweet meats candles dried meats and hams Rice and all sorts of seed for puddings should be closely covered to preserve them from insects but even this will not prevent them from being affected by these destroyers if they are long and carelessly kept Illustration CHAPTER IV INTRODUCTION TO COOKERY seventy six AS IN THE FINE ARTS the progress of mankind from barbarism to civilization is marked by a gradual succession of triumphs over the rude materialities of nature so in the art of cookery is the progress gradual from the earliest and simplest modes to those of the most complicated and refined Plain or rudely carved stones tumuli or mounds of earth are the monuments by which barbarous tribes denote the events of their history to be succeeded only in the long course of a series of ages by beautifully proportioned columns gracefully sculptured statues triumphal arches coins medals and the higher efforts of the pencil and the pen as man advances by culture and observation to the perfection of his facilities So is it with the art of cookery Man in his primitive state lives upon roots and the fruits of the earth until by degrees he is driven to seek for new means by which his wants may be supplied and enlarged He then becomes a hunter and a fisher As his species increases greater necessities come upon him when he gradually abandons the roving life of the savage for the more stationary pursuits of the herdsman These beget still more settled habits when he begins the practice of agriculture forms ideas of the rights of property and has his own both defined and secured The forest the stream and the sea are now no longer his only resources for food He sows and he reaps pastures and breeds cattle lives on the cultivated produce of his fields and revels in the luxuries of the dairy raises flocks for clothing and assumes to all intents and purposes the habits of permanent life and the comfortable condition of a farmer This is the fourth stage of social progress up to which the useful or mechanical arts have been incidentally developing themselves when trade and commerce begin Through these various phases only to live has been the great object of mankind but by and by comforts are multiplied and accumulating riches create new wants The object then is not only to live but to live economically agreeably tastefully and well Accordingly the art of cookery commences and although the fruits of the earth the fowls of the air the beasts of the field and the fish of the sea are still the only food of mankind yet these are so prepared improved and dressed by skill and ingenuity that they are the means of immeasurably extending the boundaries of human enjoyments Everything that is edible and passes under the hands of the cook is more or less changed and assumes new forms Hence the influence of that functionary is immense upon the happiness of a household seventy seven In order that the duties of the Cook may be properly performed and that he may be able to reproduce esteemed dishes with certainty all terms of indecision should be banished from his art Accordingly what is known only to him will in these pages be made known to others In them all those indecisive terms expressed by a bit of this some of that a small piece of that and a handful of the other shall never be made use of but all quantities be precisely and explicitly stated With a desire also that all ignorance on this most essential part of the culinary art should disappear and that a uniform system of weights and measures should be adopted we give an account of the weights which answer to certain measures A TABLE SPOONFUL is frequently mentioned in a recipe in the prescriptions of medical men and also in medical chemical and gastronomical works By it is generally meant and understood a measure or bulk equal to that which would be produced by half an ounce of water A DESSERT SPOONFUL is the half of a table spoonful that is to say by it is meant a measure or bulk equal to a quarter of an ounce of water A TEA SPOONFUL is equal in quantity to a drachm of water A DROP This is the name of a vague kind of measure and is so called on account of the liquid being dropped from the mouth of a bottle Its quantity however will vary either from the consistency of the liquid or the size and shape of the mouth of the bottle The College of Physicians determined the quantity of a drop to be one grain sixty drops making one fluid drachm Their drop or sixtieth part of a fluid drachm is called a minim Illustration Fig twenty two Graduated class measures can be obtained at any chemist s and they save much trouble One of these containing a wine pint is divided into sixteen oz and the oz into eight drachms of water by which any certain weight mentioned in a recipe can be accurately measured out Home made measures of this kind can readily be formed by weighing the water contained in any given measure and marking on any tall glass the space it occupies This mark can easily be made with a file It will be interesting to many readers to know the basis on which the French found their system of weights and measures for it certainly possesses the grandeur of simplicity The metre which is the basis of the whole system of French weights and measures is the exact measurement of one forty millionth part of a meridian of the earth seventy eight EXCELLENCE IN THE ART OF COOKERY as in all other things is only attainable by practice and experience In proportion therefore to the opportunities which a cook has had of these so will be his excellence in the art It is in the large establishments of princes noblemen and very affluent families alone that the man cook is found in this country He also superintends the kitchens of large hotels clubs and public institutions where he usually makes out the bills of fare which are generally submitted to the principal for approval To be able to do this therefore it is absolutely necessary that he should be a judge of the season of every dish as well as know perfectly the state of every article he undertakes to prepare He must also be a judge of every article he buys for no skill however great it may be will enable him to make that good which is really bad On him rests the responsibility of the cooking generally whilst a speciality of his department is to prepare the rich soups stews ragouts and such dishes as enter into the more refined and complicated portions of his art and such as are not usually understood by ordinary professors He therefore holds a high position in a household being inferior in rank as already shown twenty one only to the house steward the valet and the butler In the luxurious ages of Grecian antiquity Sicilian cooks were the most esteemed and received high rewards for their services Among them one called Trimalcio was such an adept in his art that he could impart to common fish both the form and flavour of the most esteemed of the piscatory tribes A chief cook in the palmy days of Roman voluptuousness had about Leight hundred a year and Antony rewarded the one that cooked the supper which pleased Cleopatra with the present of a city With the fall of the empire the culinary art sank into less consideration In the middle ages cooks laboured to acquire a reputation for their sauces which they composed of strange combinations for the sake of novelty as well as singularity seventy nine THE DUTIES OF THE COOK THE KITCHEN AND THE SCULLERY MAIDS are so intimately associated that they can hardly be treated of separately The cook however is at the head of the kitchen and in proportion to her possession of the qualities of cleanliness neatness order regularity and celerity of action so will her influence appear in the conduct of those who are under her as it is upon her that the whole responsibility of the business of the kitchen rests whilst the others must lend her both a ready and a willing assistance and be especially tidy in their appearance and active in their movements In the larger establishments of the middle ages cooks with the authority of feudal chiefs gave their orders from a high chair in which they ensconced themselves and commanded a view of all that was going on throughout their several domains Each held a long wooden spoon with which he tasted without leaving his seat the various comestibles that were cooking on the stoves and which he frequently used as a rod of punishment on the backs of those whose idleness and gluttony too largely predominated over their diligence and temperance eighty IF AS WE HAVE SAID three THE QUALITY OF EARLY RISING be of the first importance to the mistress what must it be to the servant Let it therefore be taken as a long proved truism that without it in every domestic the effect of all things else so far as work is concerned may in a great measure be neutralized In a cook this quality is most essential for an hour lost in the morning will keep her toiling absolutely toiling all day to overtake that which might otherwise have been achieved with ease In large establishments six is a good hour to rise in the summer and seven in the winter eighty one HER FIRST DUTY in large establishments and where it is requisite should be to set her dough for the breakfast rolls provided this has not been done on the previous night and then to engage herself with those numerous little preliminary occupations which may not inappropriately be termed laying out her duties for the day This will bring in the breakfast hour of eight after which directions must be given and preparations made for the different dinners of the household and family eighty two IN THOSE NUMEROUS HOUSEHOLDS where a cook and housemaid are only kept the general custom is that the cook should have the charge of the dining room The hall the lamps and the doorstep are also committed to her care and any other work there may be on the outside of the house In establishments of this kind the cook will after having lighted her kitchen fire carefully brushed the range and cleaned the hearth proceed to prepare for breakfast She will thoroughly rinse the kettle and filling it with fresh water will put it on the fire to boil She will then go to the breakfast room or parlour and there make all things ready for the breakfast of the family Her attention will next be directed to the hall which she will sweep and wipe the kitchen stairs if there be any will now be swept and the hall mats which have been removed and shaken will be again put in their places The cleaning of the kitchen pantry passages and kitchen stairs must always be over before breakfast so that it may not interfere with the other business of the day Everything should be ready and the whole house should wear a comfortable aspect when the heads of the house and members of the family make their appearance Nothing it may be depended on will so please the mistress of an establishment as to notice that although she has not been present to see that the work was done attention to smaller matters has been carefully paid with a view to giving her satisfaction and increasing her comfort eighty three BY THE TIME THAT THE COOK has performed the duties mentioned above and well swept brushed and dusted her kitchen the breakfast bell will most likely summon her to the parlour to bring in the breakfast It is the cook s department generally in the smaller establishments to wait at breakfast as the housemaid by this time has gone up stairs into the bedrooms and has there applied herself to her various duties The cook usually answers the bells and single knocks at the door in the early part of the morning as the tradesmen with whom it is her more special business to speak call at these hours eighty four IT IS IN HER PREPARATION OF THE DINNER that the cook begins to feel the weight and responsibility of her situation as she must take upon herself all the dressing and the serving of the principal dishes which her skill and ingenuity have mostly prepared Whilst these however are cooking she must be busy with her pastry soups gravies ragouts c Stock or what the French call consomme being the basis of most made dishes must be always at hand in conjunction with her sweet herbs and spices for seasoning A place for everything and everything in its place must be her rule in order that time may not be wasted in looking for things when they are wanted and in order that the whole apparatus of cooking may move with the regularity and precision of a well adjusted machine all must go on simultaneously The vegetables and sauces must be ready with the dishes they are to accompany and in order that they may be suitable the smallest oversight must not be made in their preparation When the dinner hour has arrived it is the duty of the cook to dish up such dishes as may without injury stand for some time covered on the hot plate or in the hot closet but such as are of a more important or recherche kind must be delayed until the order to serve is given from the drawing room Then comes haste but there must be no hurry all must work with order The cook takes charge of the fish soups and poultry and the kitchen maid of the vegetables sauces and gravies These she puts into their appropriate dishes whilst the scullery maid waits on and assists the cook Everything must be timed so as to prevent its getting cold whilst great care should be taken that between the first and second courses no more time is allowed to elapse than is necessary for fear that the company in the dining room lose all relish for what has yet to come of the dinner When the dinner has been served the most important feature in the daily life of the cook is at an end She must however now begin to look to the contents of her larder taking care to keep everything sweet and clean so that no disagreeable smells may arise from the gravies milk or meat that may be there These are the principal duties of a cook in a first rate establishment In smaller establishments the housekeeper often conducts the higher department of cooking see fifty eight fifty nine sixty and the cook with the assistance of a scullery maid performs some of the subordinate duties of the kitchen maid When circumstances render it necessary the cook engages to perform the whole of the work of the kitchen and in some places a portion of the house work also eighty five WHILST THE COOK IS ENGAGED WITH HER MORNING DUTIES the kitchen maid is also occupied with hers Her first duty after the fire is lighted is to sweep and clean the kitchen and the various offices belonging to it This she does every morning besides cleaning the stone steps at the entrance of the house the halls the passages and the stairs which lead to the kitchen Her general duties besides these are to wash and scour all these places twice a week with the tables shelves and cupboards She has also to dress the nursery and servants hall dinners to prepare all fish poultry and vegetables trim meat joints and cutlets and do all such duties as may be considered to enter into the cook s department in a subordinate degree eighty six THE DUTIES OF THE SCULLERY MAID are to assist the cook to keep the scullery clean and all the metallic as well as earthenware kitchen utensils The position of scullery maid is not of course one of high rank nor is the payment for her services large But if she be fortunate enough to have over her a good kitchen maid and clever cook she may very soon learn to perform various little duties connected with cooking operations which may be of considerable service in fitting her for a more responsible place Now it will be doubtless thought by the majority of our readers that the fascinations connected with the position of the scullery maid are not so great as to induce many people to leave a comfortable home in order to work in a scullery But we are acquainted with one instance in which the desire on the part of a young girl was so strong to become connected with the kitchen and cookery that she absolutely left her parents and engaged herself as a scullery maid in a gentleman s house Here she showed herself so active and intelligent that she very quickly rose to the rank of kitchen maid and from this so great was her gastronomical genius she became in a short space of time one of the best women cooks in England After this we think it must be allowed that a cook like a poet nascitur non fit eighty seven MODERN COOKERY stands so greatly indebted to the gastronomic propensities of our French neighbours that many of their terms are adopted and applied by English artists to the same as well as similar preparations of their own A vocabulary of these is therefore indispensable in a work of this kind Accordingly the following will be found sufficiently complete for all ordinary purposes EXPLANATION OF FRENCH TERMS USED IN MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY ASPIC A savoury jelly used as an exterior moulding for cold game poultry fish c This being of a transparent

bluish appearance BAIN MARIE An open saucepan or kettle of nearly boiling water in which a smaller vessel can be set for cooking and warming This is very useful for keeping articles hot without altering their quantity or quality If you keep sauce broth or soup by the fireside the soup reduces and becomes too strong and the sauce thickens as well as reduces but this is prevented by using the

au vent Illustration SOUPS CHAPTER V GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SOUPS eighty eight LEAN JUICY BEEF MUTTON AND VEAL form the basis of all good soups therefore it is advisable to procure those pieces which afford the richest succulence and such as are fresh killed Stale meat renders them bad and fat is not so well adapted for making them The principal art in composing good rich soup is so to proportion the several ingredients that the flavour of one shall not predominate over another and that all the articles of which it is composed shall form an agreeable whole To accomplish this care must be taken that the roots and herbs are perfectly well cleaned and that the water is proportioned to the quantity of meat and other ingredients Generally a quart of water may be allowed to a pound of meat for soups and half the quantity for gravies In making soups or gravies gentle stewing or simmering is incomparably the best It may be remarked however that a really good soup can never be made but in a well closed vessel although perhaps greater wholesomeness is obtained by an occasional exposure to the air Soups will in general take from three to six hours doing and are much better prepared the day before they are wanted When the soup is cold the fat may be much more easily and completely removed and when it is poured off care must be taken not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the vessel which are so fine that they will escape through a sieve A tamis is the best strainer and if the soup is strained while it is hot let the tamis or cloth be previously soaked in cold water Clear soups must be perfectly transparent and thickened soups about the consistence of cream To thicken and give body to soups and gravies potato mucilage arrow root bread raspings isinglass flour and butter barley rice or oatmeal in a little water rubbed well together are used A piece of boiled beef pounded to a pulp with a bit of butter and flour and rubbed through a sieve and gradually incorporated with the soup will be found an excellent addition When the soup appears to be too thin or too weak the cover of the boiler should be taken off and the contents allowed to boil till some of the watery parts have evaporated or some of the thickening materials above mentioned should be added When soups and gravies are kept from day to day in hot weather they should be warmed up every day and put into fresh scalded pans or tureens and placed in a cool cellar In temperate weather every other day may be sufficient eighty nine VARIOUS HERBS AND VEGETABLES are required for the purpose of making soups and gravies Of these the principal are Scotch barley pearl barley wheat flour oatmeal bread raspings pease beans rice vermicelli macaroni isinglass potato mucilage mushroom or mushroom ketchup champignons parsnips carrots beetroot turnips garlic shalots and onions Sliced onions fried with butter and flour till they are browned and then rubbed through a sieve are excellent to heighten the colour and flavour of brown soups and sauces and form the basis of many of the fine relishes furnished by the cook The older and drier the onion the stronger will be its flavour Leeks cucumber or burnet vinegar celery or celery seed pounded The latter though equally strong does not impart the delicate sweetness of the fresh vegetable and when used as a substitute its flavour should be corrected by the addition of a bit of sugar Cress seed parsley common thyme lemon thyme orange thyme knotted marjoram sage mint winter savoury and basil As fresh green basil is seldom to be procured and its fine flavour is soon lost the best way of preserving the extract is by pouring wine on the fresh leaves ninety FOR THE SEASONING OF SOUPS bay leaves tomato tarragon chervil burnet allspice cinnamon ginger nutmeg clove mace black and white pepper essence of anchovy lemon peel and juice and Seville orange juice are all taken The latter imparts a finer flavour than the lemon and the acid is much milder These materials with wine mushroom ketchup Harvey s sauce tomato sauce combined in various proportions are with other ingredients manipulated into an almost endless variety of excellent soups and gravies Soups which are intended to constitute the principal part of a meal certainly ought not to be flavoured like sauces which are only designed to give a relish to some particular dish SOUP BROTH AND BOUILLON ninety one IT HAS BEEN ASSERTED that English cookery is nationally speaking far from being the best in the world More than this we have been frequently told by brilliant foreign writers half philosophers half chefs that we are the worst cooks on the face of the earth and that the proverb which alludes to the divine origin of food and the precisely opposite origin of its preparers is peculiarly applicable to us islanders Not however to the inhabitants of the whole island for it is stated in a work which treats of culinary operations north of the Tweed that the broth of Scotland claims for excellence and wholesomeness a very close second place to the bouillon or common soup of France Three hot meals of broth and meat for about the price of ONE roasting joint our Scottish brothers and sisters get they say and we hasten to assent to what we think is now a very well ascertained fact We are glad to note however that soups of vegetables fish meat and game are now very frequently found in the homes of the English middle classes as well as in the mansions of the wealthier and more aristocratic and we take this to be one evidence that we are on the right road to an improvement in our system of cookery One great cause of many of the spoilt dishes and badly cooked meats which are brought to our tables arises we think and most will agree with us from a non acquaintance with common every day things Entertaining this view we intend to preface the chapters of this work with a simple scientific resume of all those causes and circumstances which relate to the food we have to prepare and the theory and chemistry of the various culinary operations Accordingly this is the proper place to treat of the quality of the flesh of animals and describe some of the circumstances which influence it for good or bad We will therefore commence with the circumstance of age and examine how far this affects the quality of meat ninety two DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE BIRTH AND MATURITY OF ANIMALS their flesh undergoes very considerable changes For instance when the animal is young the fluids which the tissues of the muscles contain possess a large proportion of what is called albumen This albumen which is also the chief component of the white of eggs possesses the peculiarity of coagulating or hardening at a certain temperature like the white of a boiled egg into a soft white fluid no longer soluble or capable of being dissolved in water As animals grow older this peculiar animal matter gradually decreases in proportion to the other constituents of the juice of the flesh Thus the reason why veal lamb and young pork are white and without gravy when cooked is that the large quantity of albumen they contain hardens or becomes coagulated On the other hand the reason why beef and mutton are brown and have gravy is that the proportion of albumen they contain is small in comparison with their greater quantity of fluid which is soluble and not coagulable ninety three THE QUALITY OF THE FLESH OF AN ANIMAL is considerably influenced by the nature of the food on which it has been fed for the food supplies the material which produces the flesh If the food be not suitable and good the meat cannot be good either just as the paper on which these words are printed could not be good if the rags from which it is made were not of a fine quality To the experienced in this matter it is well known that the flesh of animals fed on farinaceous produce such as corn pulse c is firm well flavoured and also economical in the cooking that the flesh of those fed on succulent and pulpy substances such as roots possesses these qualities in a somewhat less degree whilst the flesh of those whose food contains fixed oil as linseed is greasy high coloured and gross in the fat and if the food has been used in large quantities possessed of a rank flavour ninety four IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO THE GOOD QUALITY OF MEAT that the animal should be perfectly healthy at the time of its slaughter However slight the disease in an animal may be inferiority in the quality of its flesh as food is certain to be produced In most cases indeed as the flesh of diseased animals has a tendency to very rapid putrefaction it becomes not only unwholesome but absolutely poisonous on account of the absorption of the virus of the unsound meat into the systems of those who partake of it The external indications of good and bad meat will be described under its own particular head but we may here premise that the layer of all wholesome meat when freshly killed adheres firmly to the bone ninety five ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE GREATLY AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF MEAT is the animal s treatment before it is slaughtered This influences its value and wholesomeness in no inconsiderable degree It will be easy to understand this when we reflect on those leading principles by which the life of an animal is supported and maintained These are the digestion of its food and the assimilation of that food into its substance Nature in effecting this process first reduces the food in the stomach to a state of pulp under the name of chyme which passes into the intestines and is there divided into two principles each distinct from the other One a milk white fluid the nutritive portion is absorbed by innumerable vessels which open upon the mucous membrane or inner coat of the intestines These vessels or absorbents discharge the fluid into a common duct or road along which it is conveyed to the large veins in the neighbourhood of the heart Here it is mixed with the venous blood which is black and impure returning from every part of the body and then it supplies the waste which is occasioned in the circulating stream by the arterial or pure blood having furnished matter for the substance of the animal The blood of the animal having completed its course through all parts and having had its waste recruited by the digested food is now received into the heart and by the action of that organ it is urged through the lungs there to receive its purification from the air which the animal inhales Again returning to the heart it is forced through the arteries and thence distributed by innumerable ramifications called capillaries bestowing to every part of the animal life and nutriment The other principle the innutritive portion passes from the intestines and is thus got rid of It will now be readily understood how flesh is affected for bad if an animal is slaughtered when the circulation of its blood has been increased by over driving ill usage or other causes of excitement to such a degree of rapidity as to be too great for the capillaries to perform their functions and causing the blood to be congealed in its minuter vessels Where this has been the case the meat will be dark coloured and become rapidly putrid so that self interest and humanity alike dictate kind and gentle treatment of all animals destined to serve as food for man THE CHEMISTRY AND ECONOMY OF SOUP MAKING ninety six STOCK BEING THE BASIS of all meat soups and also of all the principal sauces it is essential to the success of these culinary operations to know the most complete and economical method of extracting from a certain quantity of meat the best possible stock or broth The theory and philosophy of this process we will therefore explain and then proceed to show the practical course to be adopted ninety seven AS ALL MEAT is principally composed of fibres fat gelatine osmazome and albumen it is requisite to know that the FIBRES are inseparable constituting almost all that remains of the meat after it has undergone a long boiling ninety eight FAT is dissolved by boiling but as it is contained in cells covered by a very fine membrane which never dissolves a portion of it always adheres to the fibres The other portion rises to the surface of the stock and is that which has escaped from the cells which were not whole or which have burst by boiling ninety nine GELATINE is soluble it is the basis and the nutritious portion of the stock When there is an abundance of it it causes the stock when cold to become a jelly one hundred OSMAZOME is soluble even when cold and is that part of the meat which gives flavour and perfume to the stock The flesh of old animals contains more osmazome than that of young ones Brown meats contain more than white and the former make the stock more fragrant By roasting meat the osmazome appears to acquire higher properties so by putting the remains of roast meats into your stock pot you obtain a better flavour one hundred one ALBUMEN is of the nature of the white of eggs it can be dissolved in cold or tepid water but coagulates when it is put into water not quite at the boiling point From this property in albumen it is evident that if the meat is put into the stock pot when the water boils or after this is made to boil up quickly the albumen in both cases hardens In the first it rises to the surface in the second it remains in the meat but in both it prevents the gelatine and osmazome from dissolving and hence a thin and tasteless stock will be obtained It ought to be known too that the coagulation of the albumen in the meat always takes place more or less according to the size of the piece as the parts farthest from the surface always acquire that degree of heat which congeals it before entirely dissolving it one hundred two BONES ought always to form a component part of the stock pot They are composed of an earthy substance to which they owe their solidity of gelatine and a fatty fluid something like marrow Two ounces of them contain as much gelatine as one pound of meat but in them this is so incased in the earthy substance that boiling water can dissolve only the surface of whole bones By breaking them however you can dissolve more because you multiply their surfaces and by reducing them to powder or paste you can dissolve them entirely but you must not grind them dry We have said ninety nine that gelatine forms the basis of stock but this though very nourishing is entirely without taste and to make the stock savoury it must contain osmazome Of this bones do not contain a particle and that is the reason why stock made entirely of them is not liked but when you add meat to the broken or pulverized bones the osmazome contained in it makes the stock sufficiently savoury one hundred three In concluding this part of our subject the following condensed hints and directions should be attended to in the economy of soup making I BEEF MAKES THE BEST STOCK veal stock has less colour and taste whilst mutton sometimes gives it a tallowy smell far from agreeable unless the meat has been previously roasted or broiled Fowls add very little to the flavour of stock unless they be old and fat Pigeons when they are old add the most flavour to it and a rabbit or partridge is also a great improvement From the freshest meat the best stock is obtained II IF THE MEAT BE BOILED solely to make stock it must be cut up into the smallest possible pieces but generally speaking if it is desired to have good stock and a piece of savoury meat as well it is necessary to put a rather large piece into the stock pot say sufficient for two or three days during which time the stock will keep well in all weathers Choose the freshest meat and have it cut as thick as possible for if it is a thin flat piece it will not look well and will be very soon spoiled by the boiling III NEVER WASH MEAT as it deprives its surface of all its juices separate it from the bones and tie it round with tape so that its shape may be preserved then put it into the stock pot and for each pound of meat let there be one pint of water press it down with the hand to allow the air which it contains to escape and which often raises it to the top of the water IV PUT THE STOCK POT ON A GENTLE FIRE so that it may heat gradually The albumen will first dissolve afterwards coagulate and as it is in this state lighter than the liquid it will rise to the surface bringing with it all its impurities It is this which makes the scum The rising of the hardened albumen has the same effect in clarifying stock as the white of eggs and as a rule it may be said that the more scum there is the clearer will be the stock Always take care that the fire is very regular V REMOVE THE SCUM when it rises thickly and do not let the stock boil because then one portion of the scum will be dissolved and the other go to the bottom of the pot thus rendering it very difficult to obtain a clear broth If the fire is regular it will not be necessary to add cold water in order to make the scum rise but if the fire is too large at first it will then be necessary to do so VI WHEN THE STOCK IS WELL SKIMMED and begins to boil put in salt and vegetables which may be two or three carrots two turnips one parsnip a bunch of leeks and celery tied together You can add according to taste a piece of cabbage two or three cloves stuck in an onion and a tomato The latter gives a very agreeable flavour to the stock If fried onion be added it ought according to the advice of a famous French chef to be tied in a little bag without this precaution the colour of the stock is liable to be clouded VII BY THIS TIME we will now suppose that you have chopped the bones which were separated from the meat and those which were left from the roast meat of the day before Remember as was before pointed out that the more these are broken the more gelatine you will have The best way to break them up is to pound them roughly in an iron mortar adding from time to time a little water to prevent them getting heated It is a great saving thus to make use of the bones of meat which in too many English families we fear are entirely wasted for it is certain as previously stated No one hundred two that two ounces of bone contain as much gelatine which is the nutritive portion of stock as one pound of meat In their broken state tie them up in a bag and put them in the stock pot adding the gristly parts of cold meat and trimmings which can be used for no other purpose If to make up the weight you have received from the butcher a piece of mutton or veal broil it slightly over a clear fire before putting it in the stock pot and be very careful that it does not contract the least taste of being smoked or burnt VIII ADD NOW THE VEGETABLES which to a certain extent will stop the boiling of the stock Wait therefore till it simmers well up again then draw it to the side of the fire and keep it gently simmering till it is served preserving as before said your fire always the same Cover the stock pot well to prevent evaporation do not fill it up even if you take out a little stock unless the meat is exposed in which case a little boiling water may be added but only enough to cover it After six hours slow and gentle simmering the stock is done and it should not be continued on the fire longer than is necessary or it will tend to insipidity Note It is on a good stock or first good broth and sauce that excellence in cookery depends If the preparation of this basis of the culinary art is intrusted to negligent or ignorant persons and the stock is not well skimmed but indifferent results will be obtained The stock will never be clear and when it is obliged to be clarified it is deteriorated both in quality and flavour In the proper management of the stock pot an immense deal of trouble is saved inasmuch as one stock in a small dinner serves for all purposes Above all things the greatest economy consistent with excellence should be practised and the price of everything which enters the kitchen correctly ascertained The theory of this part of Household Management may appear trifling but its practice is extensive and therefore it requires the best attention Illustration RECIPES CHAPTER VI FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SOUPS It will be seen by reference to the following Recipes that an entirely original and most intelligible system has been pursued in explaining the preparation of each dish We would recommend the young housekeeper cook or whoever may be engaged in the important task of getting ready the dinner or other meal to follow precisely the order in which the recipes are given Thus let them first place on their table all the INGREDIENTS necessary then the modus operandi or MODE of preparation will be easily managed By a careful reading too of the recipes there will not be the slightest difficulty in arranging a repast for any number of persons and an accurate notion will be gained of the TIME the cooling of each dish will occupy of the periods at which it is SEASONABLE as also of its AVERAGE COST The addition of the natural history and the description of the various properties of the edible articles in common use in every family will be serviceable both in a practical and an educational point of view Speaking specially of the Recipes for Soups it may be added that by the employment of the BEST MEDIUM or COMMON STOCK the quality of the Soups and their cost may be proportionately increased or lessened STOCKS FOR ALL KINDS OF SOUPS RICH STRONG STOCK one hundred four INGREDIENTS four lbs of shin of beef four lbs of knuckle of veal three four lb of good lean ham any poultry trimmings three small onions three small carrots three turnips the latter should be omitted in summer lest they ferment one head of celery a few chopped mushrooms when obtainable one tomato a bunch of savoury herbs not forgetting parsley one one two oz of salt twelve white peppercorns six cloves three small blades of mace four quarts of water Mode Line a delicately clean stewpan with the ham cut in thin broad slices carefully trimming off all its rusty fat cut up the beef and veal in pieces about three inches square and lay them on the ham set it on the stove and draw it down and stir frequently When the meat is equally browned put in the beef and veal bones the poultry trimmings and pour in the cold water Skim well and occasionally add a little cold water to stop its boiling until it becomes quite clear then put in all the other ingredients and simmer very slowly for five hours Do not let it come to a brisk boil that the stock be not wasted and that its colour may be preserved Strain through a very fine hair sieve or tammy and it will be fit for use Time five hours Average cost ones threed per quart MEDIUM STOCK one hundred five INGREDIENTS four lbs of shin of beef or four lbs of knuckle of veal or two lbs of each any bones trimmings of poultry or fresh meat one two a lb of lean bacon or ham two oz of butter two large onions each stuck with three cloves one turnip three carrots one two a leek one head of celery two oz of salt one two a teaspoonful of whole pepper one large blade of mace one small bunch of savoury herbs four quarts and one two pint of cold water Mode Cut up the meat and bacon or ham into pieces about three inches square rub the butter on the bottom of the stewpan put in one two a pint of water the meat and all the other ingredients Cover the stewpan and place it on a sharp fire occasionally stirring its contents When the bottom of the pan becomes covered with a pale jelly like substance add four quarts of cold water and simmer very gently for five hours As we have said before do not let it boil quickly Skim off every particle of grease whilst it is doing and strain it through a fine hair sieve This is the basis of many of the soups afterwards mentioned and will be found quite strong enough for ordinary purposes Time five one two hours Average cost nined per quart ECONOMICAL STOCK one hundred six INGREDIENTS The liquor in which a joint of meat has been boiled say four quarts trimmings of fresh meat or poultry shank bones c roast beef bones any pieces the larder may furnish vegetables spices and the same seasoning as in the foregoing recipe Mode Let all the ingredients simmer gently for six hours taking care to skim carefully at first Strain it off and put by for use Time six hours Average cost threed per quart WHITE STOCK To be Used in the Preparation of White Soups one hundred seven INGREDIENTS four lbs of knuckle of veal any poultry trimmings four slices of lean ham one carrot two onions one head of celery twelve white peppercorns one oz of salt one blade of mace one oz butter four quarts of water Mode Cut up the veal and put it with the bones and trimmings of poultry and the ham into the stewpan which has been rubbed with the butter Moisten with one two a pint of water and simmer till the gravy begins to flow Then add the four quarts of water and the remainder of the ingredients simmer for five hours After skimming and straining it carefully through a very fine hair sieve it will be ready for use Time five one two hours Average cost nined per quart Note When stronger stock is desired double the quantity of veal or put in an old fowl The liquor in which a young turkey has been boiled is an excellent addition to all white stock or soups BROWNING FOR STOCK one hundred eight INGREDIENTS two oz of powdered sugar and one two a pint of water Mode Place the sugar in a stewpan over a slow fire until it begins to melt keeping it stirred with a wooden spoon until it becomes black then add the water and let it dissolve Cork closely and use a few drops when required Note In France burnt onions are made use of for the purpose of browning As a general rule the process of browning is to be discouraged as apt to impart a slightly unpleasant flavour to the stock and consequently all soups made from it TO CLARIFY STOCK one hundred nine INGREDIENTS The whites of two eggs one two pint of water two quarts of stock Mode Supposing that by some accident the soup is not quite clear and that its quantity is two quarts take the whites of two eggs carefully separated from their yolks whisk them well together with the water and add gradually the two quarts of boiling stock still whisking Place the soup on the fire and when boiling and well skimmed whisk the eggs with it till nearly boiling again then draw it from the fire and let it settle until the whites of the eggs become separated Pass through a fine cloth and the soup should be clear Note The rule is that all clear soups should be of a light straw colour and should not savour too strongly of the meat and that all white or brown thick soups should have no more consistency than will enable them to adhere slightly to the spoon when hot All purees should be somewhat thicker ALMOND SOUP one hundred ten INGREDIENTS four lbs of lean beef or veal one two a scrag of mutton one oz of vermicelli four blades of mace six cloves one two lb of sweet almonds the yolks of six eggs one gill of thick cream rather more than two quarts of water Mode Boil the beef or veal and the mutton gently in water that will cover them till the gravy is very strong and the meat very tender then strain off the gravy and set it on the fire with the specified quantities of vermicelli mace and cloves to two quarts Let it boil till it has the flavour of the spices Have ready the almonds blanched and pounded very fine the yolks of the eggs boiled hard mixing the almonds whilst pounding with a little of the soup lest the latter should grow oily Pound them till they are a mere pulp and keep adding to them by degrees a little soup until they are thoroughly mixed together Let the soup be cool when mixing and do it perfectly smooth Strain it through a sieve set it on the fire stir frequently and serve hot Just before taking it up add the cream Time three hours Average cost per quart twos threed

the south of France Italy and Spain It flowers in spring and produces its fruit in August Although there are two kinds of almonds the sweet and the bitter they are considered as only varieties of the same species The best sweet almonds brought to England are called the Syrian or Jordan and come from Malaga the inferior qualities are brought from Valentia and Italy Bitter almonds come principally from Magadore Anciently the almond was much esteemed by the nations of the East Jacob included it among the presents which he designed for Joseph The Greeks called it the Greek or Thasian nut and the Romans believed that by eating half a dozen of them they were secured against drunkenness however deeply they might imbibe Almonds however are considered as very indigestible The bitter contain too principles which produce two violent poisons prussic acid and a kind of volatile oil It is consequently dangerous to eat them in large quantities Almonds pounded together with a little sugar and water however produce a milk similar to that which is yielded by animals Their oil is used for making fine soap and their cake as a cosmetic APPLE SOUP one hundred eleven INGREDIENTS two lbs of good boiling apples three four teaspoonful of white pepper six cloves cayenne or ginger to taste three quarts of medium stock Mode Peel and quarter the apples taking out their cores put them into the stock stew them gently till tender Rub the whole through a strainer add the seasoning give it one boil up and serve Time one hour Average cost per quart ones Seasonable from September to December Sufficient for ten persons Illustration APPLE AND BLOSSOM THE APPLE This useful fruit is mentioned in Holy Writ and Homer describes it as valuable in his time It was brought from the East by the Romans who held it in the highest estimation Indeed some of the citizens of the Eternal city distinguished certain favourite apples by their names Thus the Manlians were called after Manlius the Claudians after Claudius and the Appians after Appius Others were designated after the country whence they were brought as the Sidonians the Epirotes and the Greeks The best varieties are natives of Asia and have by grafting them upon others been introduced into Europe The crab found in our hedges is the only variety indigenous to Britain therefore for the introduction of other kinds we are no doubt indebted to the Romans In the time of the Saxon heptarchy both Devon and Somerset were distinguished as the apple country and there are still existing in Herefordshire some trees said to have been planted in the time of William the Conqueror From that time to this the varieties of this precious fruit have gone on increasing and are now said to number upwards of fifteen hundred It is peculiar to the temperate zone being found neither in Lapland nor within the tropics The best baking apples for early use are the Colvilles the best for autumn are the rennets and pearmains and the best for winter and spring are russets The best table or eating apples are the Margarets for early use the Kentish codlin and summer pearmain for summer and for autumn winter or spring the Dowton golden and other pippins as the ribstone with small russets As a food the apple cannot be considered to rank high as more than the half of it consists of water and the rest of its properties are not the most nourishing It is however a useful adjunct to other kinds of food and when cooked is esteemed as slightly laxative ARTICHOKE JERUSALEM SOUP A White Soup one hundred twelve INGREDIENTS three slices of lean bacon or ham one two a head of celery one turnip one onion three oz of butter four lbs of artichokes one pint of boiling milk or one two pint of boiling cream salt and cayenne to taste two lumps of sugar two one two quarts of white stock Mode Put the bacon and vegetables which should be cut into thin slices into the stewpan with the butter Braise these for one four of an hour keeping them well stirred Wash and pare the artichokes and after cutting them into thin slices add them with a pint of stock to the other ingredients When these have gently stewed down to a smooth pulp put in the remainder of the stock Stir it well adding the seasoning and when it has simmered for five minutes pass it through a strainer Now pour it back into the stewpan let it again simmer five minutes taking care to skim it well and stir it to the boiling milk or cream Serve with small sippets of bread fried in butter Time one hour Average cost per quart ones twod Seasonable from June to October Sufficient for eight persons

marjoram a pint of asparagus tops cut small the crust of one French roll seasoning to taste two quarts of water Mode Put the beef cut in pieces and rolled in flour into a stewpan with the bacon at the bottom cover it close and set it on a slow fire stirring it now and then till the gravy is drawn Put in the water and ale and season to taste with pepper and salt and let it stew gently for two hours then strain the liquor and take off the fat and add the white beet spinach cabbage lettuce and mint sorrel and sweet marjoram pounded Let these boil up in the liquor then put in the asparagus tops cut small and allow them to boil till all is tender Serve hot with the French roll in the dish Time Altogether three hours Average cost per quart ones nined Seasonable from May to August Sufficient for

lettuce and asparagus with the water After this stew altogether and add the colouring and cream and serve Time Peas two one two hours vegetables one hour altogether four hours Average cost per quart ones Illustration ASPARAGUS ASPARAGUS The ancients called all the sprouts of young vegetables asparagus whence the name which is now limited to a particular species embracing artichoke alisander asparagus cardoon rampion and sea kale They are originally mostly wild seacoast plants and in this state asparagus may still be found on the northern as well as southern shores of Britain It is often vulgarly called in London sparrowgrass and in it s cultivated form hardly bears any resemblance to the original plant Immense quantities of it are raised for the London market at Mortlake and Deptford but it belongs rather to the classes of luxurious than necessary food It is light and easily digested but is not very nutritious BAKED SOUP one hundred fifteen INGREDIENTS one lb of any kind of meat any trimmings or odd pieces two onions two carrots two oz of rice one pint of split peas pepper and salt to taste four quarts of water Mode Cut the meat and vegetables in slices add to them the rice and peas season with pepper and salt Put the whole in a jar fill up with the water cover very closely and bake for four hours Time four hours Average cost two one twod per quart Seasonable at any time Sufficient for ten or twelve persons Note This will be found a very cheap and wholesome soup and will be convenient in those cases where baking is more easily performed than boiling BARLEY SOUP one hundred sixteen INGREDIENTS two lbs of shin of beef one four lb of pearl barley a large bunch of parsley four onions six potatoes salt and pepper four quarts of water Mode Put in all the ingredients and simmer gently for three hours Time three hours Average cost two one twod per quart Seasonable all the year but more suitable for winter Illustration BARLEY BARLEY This in the order of cereal grasses is in Britain the next plant to wheat in point of value and exhibits several species and varieties From what country it comes originally is not known but it was cultivated in the earliest ages of antiquity as the Egyptians were afflicted with the loss of it in the ear in the time of Moses It was a favourite grain with the Athenians but it was esteemed as an ignominious food by the Romans Notwithstanding this however it was much used by them as it was in former times by the English and still is in the Border counties in Cornwall and also in Wales In other parts of England it is used mostly for malting purposes It is less nutritive than wheat and in one hundred parts has of starch seventy nine gluten six saccharine matter seven husk eight It is however a lighter and less stimulating food than wheat which renders a decoction of it well adapted for invalids whose digestion is weak BREAD SOUP Economical one hundred seventeen INGREDIENTS one lb of bread crusts two oz butter one quart of common stock Mode Boil the bread crusts in the stock with the butter beat the whole with a spoon and keep it boiling till the bread and stock are well mixed Season with a little salt Time Half an hour Average cost per quart fourd Seasonable at any time Sufficient for four persons Note This is a cheap recipe and will be found useful where extreme economy is an object Illustration QUERN or GRINDING MILL BREAD The origin of bread is involved in the obscurity of distant ages The Greeks attributed its invention to Pan but before they themselves had an existence it was no doubt in use among the primitive nations of mankind The Chaldeans and the Egyptians were acquainted with it and Sarah the companion of Abraham mixed flour and water together kneaded it and covered it with ashes on the hearth The Scriptures inform us that leavened bread was known to the Israelites but it is not known when the art of fermenting it was discovered It is said that the Romans learnt it during their wars with Perseus king of Macedon and that it was introduced to the imperial city about two hundred years before the birth of Christ With them it no doubt found its way into Britain but after their departure from the island it probably ceased to be used We know that King Alfred allowed the unfermented cakes to burn in the neatherd s cottage and that even in the sixteenth century unfermented cakes kneaded by the women were the only kind of bread known to the inhabitants of Norway and Sweden The Italians of this day consume the greater portion of their flour in the form of polenta or soft pudding vermicelli and macaroni and in the remoter districts of Scotland much unfermented bread is still used We give a cut of the quern grinding mill which towards the end of the last century was in use in that country and which is thus described by doctor Johnson in his Journey to the Hebrides It consists of two stones about a foot and half in diameter the lower is a little convex to which the concavity of the upper must be fitted In the middle of the upper stone is a round hole and on one side is a long handle The grinder sheds the corn gradually into the hole with one hand and works the handle round with the other The corn slides down the convexity of the lower stone and by the motion of the upper is ground in its passage Such a primitive piece of machinery it may safely be said has entirely disappeared from this country In other parts of this work we shall have opportunities of speaking of bread and bread making which from its great and general use in the nourishment of mankind has emphatically been called the staff of life The necessity therefore of having it both pure and good is of the first importance CABBAGE SOUP one hundred eighteen INGREDIENTS one large cabbage three carrots two onions four or five slices of lean bacon salt and pepper to taste two quarts of medium stock No one hundred five Mode Scald the cabbage exit it up and drain it Line the stewpan with the bacon put in the cabbage carrots and onions moisten with skimmings from the stock and simmer very gently till the cabbage is tender add the stock stew softly for half an hour and carefully skim off every particle of fat Season and serve Time one one two hour Average cost ones per quart Seasonable in winter Sufficient for eight persons Illustration CABBAGE SEEDING THE CABBAGE It is remarkable that although there is no country in the world now more plentifully supplied with fruits and vegetables than Great Britain yet the greater number of these had no existence in it before the time of Henry VIII Anderson writing under the date of fifteen forty eight says The English cultivated scarcely any vegetables before the last two centuries At the commencement of the reign of Henry VIII neither salad nor carrots nor cabbages nor radishes nor any other comestibles of a like nature were grown in any part of the kingdom they came from Holland and Flanders The original of all the cabbage tribe is the wild plant sea colewort which is to be found wasting whatever sweetness it may have on the desert air on many of the cliffs of the south coast of England In this state it scarcely weighs more than half an ounce yet in a cultivated state to what dimensions can it be made to grow However greatly the whole of the tribe is esteemed among the moderns by the ancients they were held in yet higher estimation The Egyptians adored and raised altars to them and the Greeks and Romans ascribed many of the most exalted virtues to them Cato affirmed that the cabbage cured all diseases and declared that it was to its use that the Romans were enabled to live in health and without the assistance of physicians for six hundred years It was introduced by that people into Germany Gaul and no doubt Britain although in this last it may have been suffered to pass into desuetude for some centuries The whole tribe is in general wholesome and nutritive and forms a valuable adjunct to animal food SOUP A LA CANTATRICE An Excellent Soup very Beneficial for the Voice one hundred nineteen INGREDIENTS three oz of sago one two pint of cream the yolks of three eggs one lump of sugar and seasoning to taste one bay leaf if liked two quarts of medium stock No one hundred five Mode Having washed the sago in boiling water let it be gradually added to the nearly boiling stock Simmer for one two an hour when it should be well dissolved Beat up the yolks of the eggs add to them the boiling cream stir these quickly in the soup and serve immediately Do not let the soup boil or the eggs will curdle Time forty minutes Average cost ones sixd per quart Seasonable all the year Sufficient for eight persons Note This is a soup the principal ingredients of which sago and eggs have always been deemed very beneficial to the chest and throat In various quantities and in different preparations these have been partaken of by the principal singers of the day including the celebrated Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind and as they have always avowed with considerable advantage to the voice in singing CARROT SOUP I one hundred twenty INGREDIENTS four quarts of liquor in which a leg of mutton or beef has been boiled a few beef bones six large carrots two large onions one turnip seasoning of salt and pepper to taste cayenne Mode Put the liquor bones onions turnip pepper and salt into a stewpan and simmer for three hours Scrape and cut the carrots thin strain the soup on them and stew them till soft enough to pulp through a hair sieve or coarse cloth then boil the pulp with the soup which should be of the consistency of pea soup Add cayenne Pulp only the red part of the carrot and make this soup the day before it is wanted Time four one two hours Average cost per quart one one twod Seasonable from October to March Sufficient for ten persons II one hundred twenty one INGREDIENTS two lbs of carrots three oz of butter seasoning to taste of salt and cayenne two quarts of stock or gravy soup Mode Scrape and cut out all specks from the carrots wash and wipe them dry and then reduce them into quarter inch slices Put the butter into a large stewpan and when it is melted add two lbs of the sliced carrots and let them stew gently for an hour without browning Add to them the soup and allow them to simmer till tender say for nearly an hour Press them through a strainer with the soup and add salt and cayenne if required Boil the whole gently for five minutes skim well and serve as hot as possible Time one one four hour Average cost per quart ones oned Illustration TAZZA AND CARROT LEAVES THE CARROT There is a wild carrot which grows in England but it is white and small and not much esteemed The garden carrot in general use was introduced in the reign of Queen Elizabeth and was at first so highly esteemed that the ladies wore leaves of it in their head dresses It is of great value in the culinary art especially for soups and stews It can be used also for beer instead of malt and in distillation it yields a large quantity of spirit The carrot is proportionably valuable as it has more of the red than the yellow part There is a large red variety much used by the farmers for colouring butter As a garden vegetable it is what is called the orange carrot that is usually cultivated As a fattening food for cattle it is excellent but for man it is indigestible on account of its fibrous matter Of one thousand parts ninety five consist of sugar and three of starch The accompanying cut represents a pretty winter ornament obtained by placing a cut from the top of the carrot root in a shallow vessel of water when the young leaves spring forth with a charming freshness and fullness CELERY SOUP one hundred twenty two INGREDIENTS nine heads of celery one teaspoonful of salt nutmeg to taste one lump of sugar one two pint of strong stock a pint of cream and two quarts of boiling water Mode Cut the celery into small pieces throw it into the water seasoned with the nutmeg salt and sugar Boil it till sufficiently tender pass it through a sieve add the stock and simmer it for half an hour Now put in the cream bring it to the boiling point and serve immediately Time one hour Average cost ones per quart Seasonable from September to March Sufficient for ten persons Note This soup can be made brown instead of white by omitting the cream and colouring it a little When celery cannot be procured half a drachm of the seed finely pounded will give a flavour to the soup if put in a quarter of an hour before it is done A little of the essence of celery will answer the same purpose CELERY This plant is indigenous to Britain and in its wild state grows by the side of ditches and along some parts of the seacoast In this state it is called smallaqe and to some extent is a dangerous narcotic By cultivation however it has been brought to the fine flavour which the garden plant possesses In the vicinity of Manchester it is raised to an enormous size When our natural observation is assisted by the accurate results ascertained by the light of science how infinitely does it enhance our delight in contemplating the products of nature To know for example that the endless variety of colour which we see in plants is developed only by the rays of the sun is to know a truism sublime by its very comprehensiveness The cause of the whiteness of celery is nothing more than the want of light in its vegetation and in order that this effect may be produced the plant is almost wholly covered with earth the tops of the leaves alone being suffered to appear above the ground CHANTILLY SOUP one hundred twenty three INGREDIENTS one quart of young green peas a small bunch of parsley two young onions two quarts of medium stock No one hundred five Mode Boil the peas till quite tender with the parsley and onions then rub them through a sieve and pour the stock to them Do not let it boil after the peas are added or you will spoil the colour Serve very hot Time Half an hour Average cost ones sixd per quart Seasonable from June to the end of August Sufficient for eight persons Note Cold peas pounded in a mortar with a little stock added to them make a very good soup in haste Parsley Among the Greeks in the classic ages a crown of parsley was awarded both in the Nemaean and Isthmian games and the voluptuous Anacreon pronounces

part of the tropical regions To the natives of those climates its bark supplies the material for creating their dwellings its leaves the means of roofing them and the leaf stalks a kind of gauze for covering their windows or protecting the baby in the cradle It is also made into lanterns masks to screen the face from the heat of the sun baskets wicker work and even a kind of paper for writing on Combs brooms torches ropes matting and sailcloth are made of its fibers With these too beds are made and cushions stuffed Oars are supplied by the leaves drinking cups spoons and other domestic utensils by the shells of the nuts milk by its juice of which also a kind of honey and sugar are prepared When fermented it furnishes the means of intoxication and when the fibres are burned their ashes supply an alkali for making soap The buds of the tree bear a striking resemblance to cabbage when boiled but when they are cropped the tree dies In a fresh state the kernel is eaten raw and its juice is a most agreeable and refreshing beverage When the nut is imported to this country its fruit is in general comparatively dry and is considered indigestible The tree is one of the least

LEEK As in the case of the cucumber this vegetable was bewailed by the Israelites in their journey through the desert It is one of the alliaceous tribe which consists of the onion garlic chive shallot and leek These as articles of food are perhaps more widely diffused over the face of the earth than any other genus of edible plants It is the national badge of the Welsh and tradition ascribes to saint David its introduction to that part of Britain The origin of the wearing of the leek on saint David s day among that people is thus given in BEETON S DICTIONARY of UNIVERSAL INFORMATION It probably originated from the custom of Cymhortha or the friendly aid practised among farmers In some districts of South Wales all the neighbours of a small farmer were wont to appoint a day when they attended to plough his land and the like and at such time it was the custom for each to bring his portion of leeks with him for making the broth or soup See saint DAVID Others derive the origin of the

the idolatrous Egyptians two thousand years before the Christian era and it still forms a favourite food in the country of these people as well as in other parts of Africa When it was first introduced to England has not been ascertained but it has long been in use and esteemed as a favourite seasoning plant to various dishes In warmer climates it is much milder in its flavour and such as are grown in Spain and Portugal are comparatively speaking very large and are often eaten both in a boiled and roasted state The Strasburg is the most esteemed and although all the species have highly nutritive properties they impart such a disagreeable odour to the breath that they are often rejected even where they are liked Chewing a little raw parsley is said to remove this odour PAN KAIL one hundred

common garden pea and of all the domestic varieties belonging to it The gray or field pea called bisallie by the French is less subject to run into varieties than the garden kinds and is considered by some perhaps on that account to be the wild plant retaining still a large proportion of its original habit From the tendency of all other varieties to run away and become different to what they originally were it is very difficult to determine the races to which they belong The pea was well known to the Romans and probably was introduced to Britain at an early period for we find peas mentioned by Lydgate a poet of the fifteenth century as being hawked in London They seem however for a considerable time to have fallen out of use for in the reign of Queen Elizabeth Fuller tells us they were brought from Holland and were accounted fit dainties for ladies they came so far and cost so dear There are some varieties of peas which have no lining in their pods which are eaten cooked in the same way as kidney beans They are called sugar peas and the best variety is the large crooked sugar which is also very good used in the common way as a culinary vegetable There is also a white sort which readily splits when subjected to the action of millstones set wide apart so as not to grind them These are used largely for soups and especially for sea stores From the quantity of farinaceous and saccharine matter contained in the pea it is highly nutritious as an article of food PEA SOUP inexpensive one hundred forty four INGREDIENTS one four lb of onions one four lb of

to be distributed among the poor of a considerable village when the Prince of Wales attained his majority on the ninth November eighteen fifty nine Accompanying this fact the following notice which appears in BEETON S DICTIONARY OF UNIVERSAL INFORMATION may appropriately be introduced premising that British princes attain their majority in their eighteenth year whilst mortals of ordinary rank do not arrive at that period till their twenty first ALBERT EDWARD Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne merits a place in this work on account of the high responsibilities which he is in all probability destined to fulfil as sovereign of the British empire On the tenth of November eighteen fifty eight he was gazetted as having been invested with the rank of a colonel in the army Speaking of this circumstance the Times said The significance of this event is that it marks the period when the heir to the British throne is about to take rank among men and to enter formally upon a career which every loyal subject of the queen will pray may be a long and a happy one for his own sake and for the sake of the vast empire which in the course of nature he will one day be called to govern The best wish that we can offer for the young prince is that in his own path he may ever keep before him the bright example of his royal mother and show himself worthy of her name There are few in

Dioscorides class it with the cereals though Galen places it among the vegetables Be this as it may however it was imported to Greece from India about two hundred eighty six years before Christ and by the ancients it was esteemed both nutritious and fattening There are three kinds of rice the Hill rice the Patna and the Carolina of the United States Of these only the two latter are imported to this country and the Carolina is considered the best as it is the dearest The nourishing properties of rice are greatly inferior to those of wheat but it is both a light and a wholesome food In combination with other foods its nutritive qualities are greatly increased but from its having little stimulating power it is apt when taken in large quantities alone to lie long on the stomach II one hundred

constitutes the pith of the SAGO tree the Sagus farinifera of Linnaeus which grows spontaneously in the East Indies and in the archipelago of the Indian Ocean There it forms the principal farinaceous diet of the inhabitants In order to procure it the tree is felled and sawn in pieces The pith is then taken out and put in receptacles of cold water where it is stirred until the flour separates from the filaments and sinks to the bottom where it is suffered to remain until the water is poured off when it is taken out and spread on wicker frames to dry To give it the round granular form in which we find it come to this country it is passed through a colander then rubbed into little balls and dried The tree is not fit for felling until it has attained a growth of seven years when a single trunk will yield six hundred lbs weight and as an acre of ground will grow four hundred thirty of these trees a large return of flour is the result The best quality has a slightly reddish hue and easily dissolves to a jelly in hot water As a restorative diet it is much used SEMOLINA SOUP one hundred fifty three INGREDIENTS five oz of semolina two quarts of boiling stock No one hundred five or

natural weapons of defence Providence has endowed it with an extraordinary amount of the passion of fear As if to awaken the vigilance of this passion too He has furnished it with long and tubular ears in order that it may catch the remotest sounds and with full prominent eyes which enable it to see at one and the same time both before and behind it The hare feeds in the evenings and sleeps in its form during the day and as it generally lies on the ground its feet both below and above are protected with a thick covering of hair Its flesh though esteemed by the Romans was forbidden by the Druids and by the earlier Britons It is now though very dark and dry and devoid of fat much esteemed by Europeans on account of the peculiarity of its flavour In purchasing this animal it ought to be remembered that both hares and rabbits when old have their claws rugged and blunt their haunches thick and their ears dry and tough The ears of a young hare easily tear and it has a narrow cleft in

the globe although as a domestic animal it depends almost entirely upon man for its support Its value however amply repays him for whatever care and kindness he may bestow upon it for like the ox there is scarcely a part of it that he cannot convert to some useful purpose The fleece which serves it for a covering is appropriated by man to serve the same end to himself whilst its skin is also applied to various purposes in civilized life Its entrails are used as strings for musical instruments and its bones are calcined and employed as tests in the trade of the refiner Its milk being thicker than that of the cow yields a greater quantity of butter and cheese and its flesh is among the most wholesome and nutritive that can be eaten Thomson has beautifully described the appearance of the sheep when bound to undergo the operation of being shorn of its wool Behold where bound and of its robe bereft By needy man that all depending lord How meek how patient the mild creature lies

winter Sufficient for twelve persons THE OX Of the quadrupedal animals the flesh of those that feed upon herbs is the most wholesome and nutritious for human food In the early ages the ox was used as a religious sacrifice and in the eyes of the Egyptians was deemed so sacred as to be worthy of exaltation to represent Taurus one of the twelve signs of the zodiac To this day the Hindoos venerate the cow whose flesh is forbidden to be eaten and whose fat supposed to have been employed to grease the cartridges of the Indian army was one of the proximate causes of the great Sepoy rebellion of eighteen fifty seven There are no animals of greater use to man than the tribe to which the ox belongs There is hardly a part of them that does not enter into some of the arts and purposes of civilized life Of their horns are made combs knife handles boxes spoons and drinking cups They are also made into transparent plates for lanterns an invention ascribed in England to King Alfred Glue is made from their gristles cartilages and portions of their hides Their bones often form a substitute for ivory their skins when calves are manufactured into vellum their blood is the basis of

Romans whose tables it helped to furnish with food Formerly the Red was scarce in Italy but its place was supplied by the White which at considerable expense was frequently procured from the Alps The Athenians trained this bird for fighting and Severus used to lighten the cares of royalty by witnessing the spirit of its combats The Greeks esteemed its leg most highly and rejected the other portions as unfashionable to be eaten The Romans however ventured a little further and ate the breast whilst we consider the bird as wholly palatable It is an inhabitant of all the temperate countries

of cookery but they ought not to be used without the greatest caution and not at all unless the cook is perfectly aware of their effects It ought to be known that there are two kinds of bay trees the Classic laurel whose leaves are comparatively harmless and the Cherry laurel which is the one whose leaves are employed in cookery They have a kernel like flavour and are used in blanc mange puddings

slices of ham two knuckles of veal one large bunch of sweet herbs three bay leaves parsley green onions one onion six cloves four blades of mace one four lb of fresh butter one bottle of Madeira one lump of sugar For the Quenelles a Tortue one lb of veal one lb of bread crumbs milk seven eggs cayenne salt spices chopped parsley the juice of two lemons Mode To make this soup with less difficulty cut off the head of the turtle the preceding day In the morning open the turtle by leaning heavily with a knife on the shell of the animal s back whilst you cut this off all round Turn it upright on its end that all the water c may run out when the flesh should be cut off along the spine with the knife sloping towards the bones for fear of touching the gall which sometimes might escape the eye When all the flesh about the members is obtained wash these clean and let them drain Have ready on the fire a large vessel full of boiling water into which put the shells and when you perceive that they come easily off take them out of the water and prick them all with those of the back belly fins head c Boil the back and belly till the bones can be taken off without however allowing the softer parts to be sufficiently done as they will be boiled again in the soup When these latter come off easily lay them on earthen dishes singly for fear they should stick together and put them to cool Keep the liquor in which you have blanched the softer parts and let the bones stew thoroughly in it as this liquor must be used to moisten all the sauces All the flesh of the interior parts the four legs and head must be drawn down in the following manner Lay the slices of ham on the bottom of a very large stewpan over them the knuckles of veal according to the size of the turtle then the inside flesh of the turtle and over the whole the members Now moisten with the water in which you are boiling the shell and draw it down thoroughly It may now be ascertained if it be thoroughly done by thrusting a knife into the fleshy part of the meat If no blood appears it is time to moisten it again with the liquor in which the bones c have been boiling Put in a large bunch of all such sweet herbs as are used in the cooking of a turtle sweet basil sweet marjoram lemon thyme winter savory two or three bay leaves common thyme a handful of parsley and green onions and a large onion stuck with six cloves Let the whole be thoroughly done With respect to the members probe them to see whether they are done and if so drain and send them to the larder as they are to make their appearance only when the soup is absolutely completed When the flesh is also completely done strain it through a silk sieve and make a very thin white roux for turtle soup must not be much thickened When the flour is sufficiently done on a slow fire and has a good colour moisten it with the liquor keeping it over the fire till it boils Ascertain that the sauce is neither too thick nor too thin then draw the stewpan on the side of the stove to skim off the white scum and all the fat and oil that rise to the surface of the sauce By this time all the softer parts will be sufficiently cold when they must be cut to about the size of one or two inches square and thrown into the soup which must now be left to simmer gently When done skim off all the fat and froth Take all the leaves of the herbs from the stock sweet basil sweet marjoram lemon thyme winter savory two or three bay leaves common thyme a handful of parsley and green onions and a large onion cut in four pieces with a few blades of mace Put these in a stewpan with about one four lb of fresh butter and let it simmer on a slow fire till quite melted when pour in one bottle of good Madeira adding a small bit of sugar and let it boil gently for one hour When done rub it through a tammy and add it to the soup Let this boil till no white scum rises then take with a skimmer all the bits of turtle out of the sauce and put them in a clean stewpan when you have all out pour the soup over the bits of turtle through a tammy and proceed as follows QUENELLES A TORTUE Make some quenelles a tortue which being substitutes for eggs do not require to be very delicate Take out the fleshy part of a leg of veal about one lb scrape off all the meat without leaving any sinews or fat and soak in milk about the same quantity of crumbs of bread When the bread is well soaked squeeze it and put it into a mortar with the veal a small quantity of calf s udder a little butter the yolks of four eggs boiled hard a little cayenne pepper salt and spices and pound the whole very fine then thicken the mixture with two whole eggs and the yolk of another Next try this farce or stuffing in boiling hot water to ascertain its consistency if it is too thin add the yolk of an egg When the farce is perfected take half of it and put into it some chopped parsley Let the whole cool in order to roll it of the size of the yolk of an egg poach it in salt and boiling water and when very hard drain on a sieve and put it into the turtle Before you send up squeeze the juice of two or three lemons with a little cayenne pepper and pour that into the soup THE FINS may be served as a plat d entree with a little turtle sauce if not on the following day you may warm the turtle au bain marie and serve the members entire with a matelote sauce garnished with mushrooms cocks combs quenelles c When either lemon juice or cayenne pepper has been introduced no boiling must take place Note It is necessary to observe that the turtle prepared a day before it is used is generally preferable the flavour being more uniform Be particular when you dress a very large turtle to preserve the green fat be cautious not to study a very brown colour the natural green of the fish is preferred by every epicure and true connoisseur in a separate stewpan and likewise when the turtle is entirely done to have as many tureens as you mean to serve each time You cannot put the whole in a large vessel for many reasons first it will be long in cooling secondly when you take some out it will break all the rest into rags If you warm in a bain marie the turtle will always retain the same taste but if you boil it often it becomes strong and loses the delicacy of its flavour THE COST OF TURTLE SOUP This is the most expensive soup brought to table It is sold by the quart one guinea being the standard price for that quantity The price of live turtle ranges from eightd to twos per lb according to supply and demand When live turtle is dear many cooks use the tinned turtle which is killed when caught and preserved by being put in hermetically sealed canisters and so sent over to England The cost of a tin containing two quarts or four lbs is about Ltwo and for a small one containing the green fat sevens sixd From these about six quarts of good soup may be made Illustration THE TURTLE THE GREEN TURTLE This reptile is found in large numbers on the coasts of all the islands and continents within the tropics in both the old and new worlds Their length is often five feet and upwards and they range in weight from fifty to five hundred or six hundred lbs As turtles find a constant supply of food on the coasts which they frequent they are not of a quarrelsome disposition as the submarine meadows in which they pasture yield plenty for them all Like other species of amphibia too they have the power of living many months without food so that they live harmlessly and peaceably together notwithstanding that they seem to have no common bond of association but merely assemble in the same places as if entirely by accident England is mostly supplied with them from the West Indies whence they are brought alive and in tolerable health The green turtle is highly prized on account of the delicious quality of its flesh the fat of the upper and lower shields of the animal being esteemed the richest and most delicate parts The soup however is apt to disagree with weak stomachs As an article of luxury the turtle has only come into fashion within the last one hundred years and some hundreds of tureens of turtle soup are served annually at the lord mayor s dinner in Guildhall A GOOD FAMILY SOUP one hundred ninety INGREDIENTS Remains of a cold tongue two lbs of shin of beef any cold pieces of meat or beef bones two turnips two carrots two onions

the fourth class in the system of Linnaeus and are described as having long under jaws eggs without white organs of sense fins for supporters bodies covered with concave scales gills to supply the place of lungs for respiration and water for the natural element of their existence Had mankind no other knowledge of animals than of such as inhabit the land and breathe their own atmosphere they would listen with incredulous wonder if told that there were other kinds of beings which existed only in the waters and which would die almost as soon as they were taken from them However strongly these facts might be attested they would hardly believe them without the operation of their own senses as they would recollect the effect produced on their own bodies when immersed in water and the impossibility of their sustaining life in it for any lengthened period of time Experience however has taught them that the great deep is crowded with inhabitants of various sizes and of vastly different constructions with modes of life entirely distinct from those which belong to the animals of the land and with peculiarities of design equally wonderful with those of any other works which have come from the hand of the Creator The history of these races however must remain for ever more or less in a state of darkness since the depths in which they live are beyond the power of human exploration and since the illimitable expansion of their domain places them almost entirely out of the reach of human accessibility two hundred IN STUDYING THE CONFORMATION OF FISHES we naturally conclude that they are in every respect well adapted to the element in which they have their existence Their shape has a striking resemblance to the lower part of a ship and there is no doubt that the form of the fish originally suggested the form of the ship The body is in general slender gradually diminishing towards each of its extremities and flattened on each of its sides This is precisely the form of the lower part of the hull of a ship and it enables both the animal and the vessel with comparative ease to penetrate and divide the resisting medium for which they have been adapted The velocity of a ship however in sailing before the wind is by no means to be compared to that of a fish It is well known that the largest fishes will with the greatest ease overtake a ship in full sail play round it without effort and shoot ahead of it at pleasure This arises from their great flexibility which to compete with mocks the labours of art and enables them to migrate thousands of miles in a season without the slightest indications of languor or fatigue two hundred one THE PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENTS EMPLOYED BY FISHES to accelerate their motion are their air bladder fins and tail By means of the air bladder they enlarge or diminish the specific gravity of their bodies When they wish to sink they compress the muscles of the abdomen and eject the air contained in it by which their weight compared with that of the water is increased and they consequently descend On the other hand when they wish to rise they relax the compression of the abdominal muscles when the air bladder fills and distends and the body immediately ascends to the surface How simply yet how wonderfully has the Supreme Being adapted certain means to the attainment of certain ends Those fishes which are destitute of the air bladder are heavy in the water and have no great alacrity in rising The larger proportion of them remain at the bottom unless they are so formed as to be able to strike their native element downwards with sufficient force to enable them to ascend When the air bladder of a fish is burst its power of ascending to the surface has for ever passed away From a knowledge of this fact the fishermen of cod are enabled to preserve them alive for a considerable time in their well boats The means they adopt to accomplish this is to perforate the sound or air bladder with a needle which disengages the air when the fishes immediately descend to the bottom of the well into which they are thrown Without this operation it would be impossible to keep the cod under water whilst they had life In swimming the fins enable fishes to preserve their upright position especially those of the belly which act like two feet Without those they would swim with their bellies upward as it is in their backs that the centre of gravity lies In ascending and descending these are likewise of great assistance as they contract and expand accordingly The tail is an instrument of great muscular force and largely assists the fish in all its motions In some instances it acts like the rudder of a ship and enables it to turn sideways and when moved from side to side with a quick vibratory motion fishes are made in the same manner as the screw propeller makes a steamship to dart forward with a celerity proportioned to the muscular force with which it is employed two hundred two THE BODIES OF FISHES are mostly covered with a kind of horny scales but some are almost entirely without them or have them so minute as to be almost invisible as is the case with the eel The object of these is to preserve them from injury by the pressure of the water or the sudden contact with pebbles rocks or sea weeds Others again are enveloped in a fatty oleaginous substance also intended as a defence against the friction of the water and those in which the scales are small are supplied with a larger quantity of slimy matter two hundred three THE RESPIRATION OF FISHES is effected by means of those comb like organs which are placed on each side of the neck and which are called gills It is curious to watch the process of breathing as it is performed by the finny tribes It seems to be so continuous that it might almost pass for an illustration of the vexed problem which conceals the secret of perpetual motion In performing it they fill their mouths with water which they drive backwards with a force so great as to open the large flap to allow it to escape behind In this operation all or a great portion of the air contained in the water is left among the feather like processes of the gills and is carried into the body there to perform its part in the animal economy In proof of this it has been ascertained that if the water in which fishes are put is by any means denuded of its air they immediately seek the surface and begin to gasp for it Hence distilled water is to them what a vacuum made by an air pump is to most other animals For this reason when a fishpond or other aqueous receptacle in which fishes are kept is entirely frozen over it is necessary to make holes in the ice not so especially for the purpose of feeding them as for that of giving them air to breathe two hundred four THE POSITIONS OF THE TEETH OF FISHES are well calculated to excite our amazement for in some cases these are situated in the jaws sometimes on the tongue or palate and sometimes even in the throat They are in general sharp pointed and immovable but in the carp they are obtuse and in the pike so easily moved as to seem to have no deeper hold than such as the mere skin can afford In the herring the tongue is set with teeth to enable it the better it is supposed to retain its food two hundred five ALTHOUGH NATURALISTS HAVE DIVIDED FISHES into two great tribes the osseous and the cartilaginous yet the distinction is not very precise for the first have a great deal of cartilage and the second at any rate a portion of calcareous matter in their bones It may therefore be said that the bones of fishes form a kind of intermediate substance between true bones and cartilages The backbone extends through the whole length of the body and consists of vertebrae strong and thick towards the head but weaker and more slender as it approaches the tail Each species has a determinate number of vertebrae which are increased in size in proportion with the body The ribs are attached to the processes of the vertebrae and inclose the breast and abdomen Some kinds as the rays have no ribs whilst others as the sturgeon and eel have very short ones Between the pointed processes of the vertebrae are situated the bones which support the dorsal back and the anal below the tail fins which are connected with the processes by a ligament At the breast are the sternum or breastbone clavicles or collar bones and the scapulae or shoulder blades on which the pectoral or breast fins are placed The bones which support the ventral or belly fins are called the ossa pelvis Besides these principal bones there are often other smaller ones placed between the muscles to assist their motion two hundred six SOME OF THE ORGANS OF SENSE IN FISHES are supposed to be possessed by them in a high degree and others much more imperfectly Of the latter kind are the senses of touch and taste which are believed to be very slightly developed On the other hand those of hearing seeing and smelling are ascertained to be acute but the first in a lesser degree than both the second and third Their possession of an auditory organ was long doubted and even denied by some physiologists but it has been found placed on the sides of the skull or in the cavity which contains the brain It occupies a position entirely distinct and detached from the skull and in this respect differs in the local disposition of the same sense in birds and quadrupeds In some fishes as in those of the ray kind the organ is wholly encompassed by those parts which contain the cavity of the skull whilst in the cod and salmon kind it is in the part within the skull Its structure is in every way much more simple than that of the same sense in those animals which live entirely in the air but there is no doubt that they have the adaptation suitable to their condition In some genera as in the rays the external orifice or ear is very small and is placed in the upper surface of the head whilst in others there is no visible external orifice whatever However perfect the sight of fishes may be experience has shown that this sense is of much less use to them than that of smelling in searching for their food The optic nerves in fishes have this peculiarity that they are not confounded with one another in their middle progress between their origin and their orbit The one passes over the other without any communication so that the nerve which comes from the left side of the brain goes distinctly to the right eye and that which comes from the right goes distinctly to the left In the greater part of them the eye is covered with the same transparent skin that covers the rest of the head The object of this arrangement perhaps is to defend it from the action of the water as there are no eyelids The globe in front is somewhat depressed and is furnished behind with a muscle which serves to lengthen or flatten it according to the necessities of the animal The crystalline humour which in quadrupeds is flattened is in fishes nearly globular The organ of smelling in fishes is large and is endued at its entry with a dilating and contracting power which is employed as the wants of the animal may require It is mostly by the acuteness of their smell that fishes are enabled to discover their food for their tongue is not designed for nice sensation being of too firm a cartilaginous substance for this purpose two hundred seven WITH RESPECT TO THE FOOD OF FISHES this is almost universally found in their own element They are mostly carnivorous though they seize upon almost anything that comes in their way they even devour their own offspring and manifest a particular predilection for all living creatures Those to which Nature has meted out mouths of the greatest capacity would seem to pursue everything with life and frequently engage in fierce conflicts with their prey The animal with the largest mouth is usually the victor and he has no sooner conquered his foe than he devours him Innumerable shoals of one species pursue those of another with a ferocity which draws them from the pole to the equator through all the varying temperatures and depths of their boundless domain In these pursuits a scene of universal violence is the result and many species must have become extinct had not Nature accurately proportioned the means of escape the production and the numbers to the extent and variety of the danger to which they are exposed Hence the smaller species are not only more numerous but more productive than the larger whilst their instinct leads them in search of food and safety near the shores where from the shallowness of the waters many of their foes are unable to follow them two hundred eight THE FECUNDITY OF FISHES has been the wonder of every natural philosopher whose attention has been attracted to the subject They are in general oviparous or egg producing but there are a few such as the eel and the blenny which are viviparous or produce their young alive The males have the milt and the females the roe but some individuals as the sturgeon and the cod tribes are said to contain both The greater number deposit their spawn in the sand or gravel but some of those which dwell in the depths of the ocean attach their eggs to sea weeds In every instance however their fruitfulness far surpasses that of any other race of animals According to Lewenhoeck the cod annually spawns upwards of nine millions of eggs contained in a single roe The flounder produces one million the mackerel above five hundred thousand a herring of a moderate size at least ten thousand a carp fourteen inches in length according to Petit contained two hundred and sixty two thousand two hundred and twenty four a perch deposited three hundred and eighty thousand six hundred and forty and a female sturgeon seven millions six hundred and fifty three thousand two hundred The viviparous species are by no means so prolific yet the blenny brings forth two or three hundred at a time which commence sporting together round their parent the moment they have come into existence two hundred nine IN REFERENCE TO THE LONGEVITY OF FISHES it is affirmed to surpass that of all other created beings and it is supposed they are to a great extent exempted from the diseases to which the flesh of other animals is heir In place of suffering from the rigidity of age which is the cause of the natural decay of those that live and move and have their being on the land their bodies continue to grow with each succeeding supply of food and the conduits of life to perform their functions unimpaired The age of fishes has not been properly ascertained although it is believed that the most minute of the species has a longer lease of life than man The mode in which they die has been noted by the reverend mister White the eminent naturalist of Selbourne As soon as the fish sickens the head sinks lower and lower till the animal as it were stands upon it After this as it becomes weaker it loses its poise till the tail turns over when it comes to the surface and floats with its belly upwards The reason for its floating in this manner is on account of the body being no longer balanced by the fins of the belly and the broad muscular back preponderating by its own gravity over the belly from this latter being a cavity and consequently lighter two hundred ten FISHES ARE EITHER SOLITARY OR GREGARIOUS and some of them migrate to great distances and into certain rivers to deposit their spawn Of sea fishes the cod herring mackerel and many others assemble in immense shoals and migrate through different tracts of the ocean but whether considered in their solitary or gregarious capacity they are alike wonderful to all who look through Nature up to Nature s God and consider with due humility yet exalted admiration the sublime variety beauty power and grandeur of His productions as manifested in the Creation FISH AS AN ARTICLE OF HUMAN FOOD two hundred eleven AS THE NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF FISH are deemed inferior to those of what is called butchers meat it would appear from all we can learn that in all ages it has held only a secondary place in the estimation of those who have considered the science of gastronomy as a large element in the happiness of mankind Among the Jews of old it was very little used although it seems not to have been entirely interdicted as Moses prohibited only the use of such as had neither scales nor fins The Egyptians however made fish an article of diet notwithstanding that it was rejected by their priests Egypt however is not a country favourable to the production of fish although we read of the people when hungry eating it raw of epicures among them having dried it in the sun and of its being salted and preserved to serve as a repast on days of great solemnity The modern Egyptians are in general extremely temperate in regard to food Even the richest among them take little pride and perhaps experience as little delight in the luxuries of the table Their dishes mostly consist of pilaus soups and stews prepared principally of onions cucumbers and other cold vegetables mixed with a little meat cut into small pieces On special occasions however a whole sheep is placed on the festive board but during several of the hottest months of the year the richest restrict themselves entirely to a vegetable diet The poor are contented with a little oil or sour milk in which they may dip their bread two hundred twelve PASSING FROM AFRICA TO EUROPE we come amongst a people who have almost from time immemorial occupied a high place in the estimation of every civilized country yet the Greeks in their earlier ages made very little use of fish as an article of diet In the eyes of the heroes of Homer it had little favour for Menelaus complained that hunger pressed their digestive organs and they had been obliged to live upon fish Subsequently however fish became one of the principal articles of diet amongst the Hellenes and both Aristophanes and Athenaeus allude to it and even satirize their countrymen for their excessive partiality to the turbot and mullet So infatuated were many of the Greek gastronomes with the love of fish that some of them would have preferred death from indigestion to the relinquishment of the precious dainties with which a few of the species supplied them Philoxenes of Cythera was one of these On being informed by his physician that he was going to die of indigestion on account of the quantity he was consuming of a delicious fish Be it so he calmly observed but before I die let me finish the remainder two hundred thirteen THE GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION OF GREECE was highly favourable for the development of a taste for the piscatory tribes and the skill of the Greek cooks was so great that they could impart every variety of relish to the dish they were called upon to prepare Athenaeus has transmitted to posterity some very important precepts upon their ingenuity in seasoning with salt oil and aromatics At the present day the food of the Greeks through the combined influence of poverty and the long fasts which their religion imposes upon them is to a large extent composed of fish accompanied with vegetables and fruit Caviare prepared from the roes of sturgeons is the national ragout which like all other fish dishes they season with aromatic herbs Snails dressed in garlic are also a favourite dish two hundred fourteen AS THE ROMANS in a great measure took their taste in the fine arts from the Greeks so did they in some measure their piscine appetites The eel pout and the lotas s liver were the favourite fish dishes of the Roman epicures whilst the red mullet was esteemed as one of the most delicate fishes that could be brought to the table With all the elegance taste and refinement of Roman luxury it was sometimes promoted or accompanied by acts of great barbarity In proof of this the mention of the red mullet suggests the mode in which it was sometimes treated for the to us horrible entertainment of the fashionable in Roman circles It may be premised that as England has Rome in her palmy days had her fops who had no doubt through the medium of their cooks discovered that when the scales of the red mullet were removed the flesh presented a fine pink colour Having discovered this it was further observed that at the death of the animal this colour passed through a succession of beautiful shades and in order that these might be witnessed and enjoyed in their fullest perfection the poor mullet was served alive in a glass vessel two hundred fifteen THE LOVE OF FISH among the ancient Romans rose to a real mania Apicius offered a prize to any one who could invent a new brine compounded of the liver of red mullets and Lucullus had a canal cut through a mountain in the neighbourhood of Naples that fish might be the more easily transported to the gardens of his villa Hortensius the orator wept over the death of a turbot which he had fed with his own hands and the daughter of Druses adorned one that she had with rings of gold These were surely instances of misplaced affection but there is no accounting for tastes It was but the other day that we read in the Times of a wealthy living English hermit who delights in the companionship of rats The modern Romans are merged in the general name of Italians who with the exception of macaroni have no specially characteristic article of food two hundred sixteen FROM ROME TO GAUL is considering the means of modern locomotion no great way but the ancient sumptuary laws of that kingdom give us little information regarding the ichthyophagous propensities of its inhabitants Louis XII engaged six fishmongers to furnish his board with fresh water animals and Francis I had twenty two whilst Henry the Great extended his requirements a little further and had twenty four In the time of Louis XIV the cooks had attained to such a degree of perfection in their art that they could convert the form and flesh of the trout pike or carp into the very shape and flavour of the most delicious game The French long enjoyed a European reputation for their skill and refinement in the preparing of food In place of plain joints French cookery delights in the marvels of what are called made dishes ragouts stews and fricassees in which no trace of the original materials of which they are compounded is to be found two hundred seventeen FROM GAUL WE CROSS TO BRITAIN where it has been asserted by at least one authority that the ancient inhabitants ate no fish However this may be we know that the British shores particularly those of the North Sea have always been well supplied with the best kinds of fish which we may reasonably infer was not unknown to the inhabitants or likely to be lost upon them for the lack of knowledge as to how they tasted By the time of Edward II fish had in England become a dainty especially the sturgeon which was permitted to appear on no table but that of the king In the fourteenth century a decree of King John informs us that the people ate both seals and porpoises whilst in the days of the Troubadours whales were fished for and caught in the Mediterranean Sea for the purpose of being used as human food Whatever checks the ancient British may have had upon their piscatory appetites there are happily none of any great consequence upon the modern who delight in wholesome food of every kind Their taste is perhaps too much inclined to that which is accounted solid and substantial but they really eat more moderately even of animal food than either the French or the Germans Roast beef or other viands cooked in the plainest manner are with them a sufficient luxury yet they delight in living well whilst it is easy to prove how largely their affections are developed by even the prospect of a substantial cheer In proof of this we will just observe that if a great dinner is to be celebrated it is not uncommon for the appointed stewards and committee to meet and have a preliminary dinner among themselves in order to arrange the great one and after that to have another dinner to discharge the bill which the great one cost This enjoyable disposition we take to form a very large item in the aggregate happiness of the nation two hundred eighteen THE GENERAL USE OF FISH as an article of human food among civilized nations we have thus sufficiently shown and will conclude this portion of our subject with the following hints which ought to be remembered by all those who are fond of occasionally varying their dietary with a piscine dish I Fish shortly before they spawn are in general best in condition When the spawning is just over they are out of season and unfit for human food II When fish is out of season it has a transparent bluish tinge however much it may be boiled when it is in season its muscles are firm and boil white and curdy III As food for invalids white fish such as the ling cod haddock coal fish and whiting are the best flat fish as soles skate turbot and flounders are also good IV Salmon mackerel herrings and trout soon spoil or decompose after they are killed therefore to be in perfection they should be prepared for the table on the day they are caught With flat fish this is not of such consequence as they will keep longer The turbot for example is improved by being kept a day or two GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR DRESSING FISH two hundred nineteen IN DRESSING FISH of any kind the first point to be attended to is to see that it be perfectly clean It is a common error to wash it too much as by doing so the flavour is diminished If the fish is to be boiled a little salt and vinegar should be put into the water to give it firmness after it is cleaned Cod fish whiting and haddock are far better if a little salted and kept a day and if the weather be not very hot they will be good for two days two hundred twenty WHEN FISH IS CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL and a larger quantity is purchased than is immediately wanted the overplus of such as will bear it should be potted or pickled or salted and hung up or it may be fried that it may serve for stewing the next day Fresh water fish having frequently a muddy smell and taste should be soaked in strong salt and water after it has been well cleaned If of a sufficient size it may be scalded in salt and water and afterwards dried and dressed two hundred twenty one FISH SHOULD BE PUT INTO COLD WATER and set on the fire to do very gently or the outside will break before the inner part is done Unless the fishes are small they should never be put into warm water nor should water either hot or cold be poured on to the fish as it is liable to break the skin if it should be necessary to add a little water whilst the fish is cooking it ought to be poured in gently at the side of the vessel The fish plate may be drawn up to see if the fish be ready which may be known by its easily separating from the bone It should then be immediately taken out of the water or it will become woolly The fish plate should be set crossways over the kettle to keep hot for serving and a clean cloth over the fish to prevent its losing its colour two hundred twenty two IN GARNISHING FISH great attention is required and plenty of parsley horseradish and lemon should be used If fried parsley be used it must be washed and picked and thrown into fresh water When the lard or dripping boils throw the parsley into it immediately from the water and instantly it will be green and crisp and must be taken up with a slice When well done and with very good sauce fish is more appreciated than almost any other dish The liver and roe in some instances should be placed on the dish in order that they may be distributed in the course of serving but to each recipe will be appended the proper mode of serving and garnishing two hundred twenty three IF FISH IS TO BE FRIED OR BROILED it must be dried in a nice soft cloth after it is well cleaned and washed If for frying brush it over with egg and sprinkle it with some fine crumbs of bread If done a second time with the egg and bread the fish will look so much the better If required to be very nice a sheet of white blotting paper must be placed to receive it that it may be free from all grease It must also be of a beautiful colour and all the crumbs appear distinct Butter gives a bad colour lard and clarified dripping are most frequently used but oil is the best if the expense be no objection The fish should be put into the lard when boiling and there should be a sufficiency of this to cover it two hundred twenty four WHEN FISH IS BROILED it must be seasoned floured and laid on a very clean gridiron which when hot should be rubbed with a bit of suet to prevent the fish from sticking It must be broiled over a very clear fire that it may not taste smoky and not too near that it may not be scorched two hundred twenty five IN CHOOSING FISH it is well to remember that it is possible it may be fresh and yet not good Under the head of each particular fish in this work are appended rules for its choice and the months when it is in season Nothing can be of greater consequence to a cook than to have the fish good as if this important course in a dinner does not give satisfaction it is rarely that the repast goes off well RECIPES CHAPTER VIII

betakes itself to isolated ponds apparently for no other pleasure than that which may be supposed to be found in a change of habitation This of course accounts for eels being found in waters which

to be once on a visit to a friend s house on Dee side in Aberdeenshire I frequently delighted to walk by the banks of the river I one day observed something like a black string moving along the edge of the water where it was quite shallow Upon closer inspection I discovered that this was a shoal of young eels so closely joined together as to appear on a superficial view on continued body moving briskly up against the stream To avoid the retardment they experienced from the force of the current they kept close along the water s edge the whole of the way following all the bendings and sinuosities of the river Where they were embayed and in still water the shoal dilated in breadth so as to be sometimes nearly a foot broad but when they turned a cape where the current was strong they were forced to occupy less space and press close to the shore struggling very hard till they passed it This shoal continued to move on night and day without interruption for several weeks Their progress might be at the rate of about a mile an hour It was easy to catch the animals though they were very active and nimble They were eels perfectly well formed in every respect but not exceeding two inches in length I conceive that the shoal did not contain on an average less than from twelve to twenty in breadth so that the number that passed on the whole must have been very great Whence they came or whither they went I know not but the place where I saw this was six miles from the sea EEL PIE two hundred fifty three INGREDIENTS one lb of eels a little chopped parsley one shalot

by the Scotch a great delicacy In London an imitation of them is made by washing the fish over with pyroligneous acid and hanging it up in a dry place for a few days RED HERRINGS or YARMOUTH BLOATERS

portions of the great deep In June they are found about Shetland whence they proceed down to the Orkneys where they divide and surround the islands of Great Britain and Ireland The principal British herring fisheries are off the Scotch and Norfolk coasts and the fishing is always carried on by means of nets which are usually laid at night for if stretched by day they are supposed to frighten the fish away The moment the herring is taken out of the water it dies Hence the origin of the common saying dead as a herring KEGEREE two hundred sixty nine INGREDIENTS Any cold fish one teacupful of

sixd Seasonable all the year but best from March to October TO CHOOSE LOBSTERS This shell fish if it has been cooked alive as it ought to have been will have a stiffness in the tail which if gently raised will return with a spring Care however must be taken in thus proving it for if the tail is pulled straight out it will not return when the fish might be pronounced inferior which in reality may not be the case In order to be good lobsters should be weighty for their bulk if light they will be watery and those of the medium size are always the best Small sized lobsters are cheapest and answer very well for sauce In boiling lobsters the appearance of the shell will be much improved by rubbing over it a little butter or salad oil on being immediately taken from the pot Illustration THE LOBSTER THE LOBSTER This is one of the crab tribe and is found on most of the rocky coasts of Great Britain Some are caught with the hand but the larger number in pots which serve all the purposes of a trap being made of osiers and baited with garbage They are shaped like a wire mousetrap so that when the lobsters once enter them they cannot get out again They are fastened to a cord and sunk in the sea and their place marked by a buoy The fish is very prolific and deposits of its eggs in the sand where they are soon hatched On the coast of Norway they are very abundant and it is from there

course of a few days it is entirely invested in its new coat of armour Whilst it is in a defenceless state however it seeks some lonely place where it may lie undisturbed and escape the horrid fate of being devoured by some of its own species who have the advantage of still being encased in their mail LOBSTER a la Mode Francaise two hundred seventy three INGREDIENTS one lobster four tablespoonfuls

dragged by a rope from a boat over the beds As soon as taken from their native beds they are stored in pits formed for the purpose furnished with sluices through which at the spring tides the water is suffered to flow This water being stagnant soon becomes green in warm weather and in a few days afterwards the oysters acquire the same tinge which increases their value in the market They do not

unwholesome Neither let it remain in the kettle after it is sufficiently cooked as that would render it insipid watery and colourless Drain it and if not wanted for a few minutes keep it warm by means of warm cloths laid over it Serve on a hot napkin garnish with cut lemon and parsley and send lobster or shrimp sauce and plain melted butter to table with it A dish of dressed cucumber usually

squeezed over it is considered by many persons a most agreeable addition Boiled peas are also by some connoisseurs considered especially adapted to be served with salmon TO CHOOSE SALMON To be good the belly should be firm and thick which may readily be ascertained by feeling it with the thumb and finger The circumstance of this fish having red gills though given as a standing rule in most cookery books as a sign of its goodness is not at all to be relied on as this quality can be easily given them by art SALMON AND CAPER SAUCE three hundred two INGREDIENTS two slices of salmon one four

with tomato sauce is very delicious Time About three four hour Average cost ones threed per lb Seasonable from April to August Sufficient for four or five persons THE MIGRATORY HABITS OF THE SALMON The instinct with which the salmon revisits its native river is one of the most curious circumstances in its natural history As the swallow returns annually to its nest so it returns to the same spot to deposit its ova This fact would seem to have been repeatedly proved M De Lande fastened a copper ring round a salmon s tail and found that for three successive seasons it returned to the same place doctor Bloch states that gold and silver rings have been attached by eastern princes to salmon to prove that a communication existed between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian and Northern Seas and that the experiment succeeded COLLARED SALMON three hundred three INGREDIENTS A piece of salmon say three lbs a high seasoning of salt pounded mace and pepper water and vinegar three bay leaves Mode Split

collared fish boil up the liquor in which it was cooked and add a little more vinegar Pour over when cold Time three four hour or rather more HABITAT OF THE SALMON The salmon is styled by Walton the king of fresh water fish and is found distributed over the north of Europe and Asia from Britain to Kamschatka but is never found in warm latitudes nor has it ever been caught even so far south as the Mediterranean It lives in fresh as well as in salt waters depositing its spawn in the former hundreds of miles from the mouths of some of those rivers to which it has been known to resort In eighteen fifty nine great efforts were made to introduce this fish into the Australian colonies and it is believed that the attempt after many difficulties which were very skilfully overcome has been successful CRIMPED SALMON three hundred four Salmon is frequently dressed in this way at many fashionable tables but must be very fresh and cut into slices two or three inches thick Lay these in cold salt and water for one hour have ready some boiling water salted as in recipe No three hundred one and well skimmed put in the fish and simmer gently for one four hour or rather more should it be very thick garnish the same as boiled salmon and serve with the same sauces Time one four hour more or less according to size Note Never use vinegar with salmon as it spoils the taste and colour of the fish Illustration THE SALMON THE SALMON TRIBE This is the Abdominal fish forming the fourth of the orders of Linnaeus They are distinguished from the other fishes by having two dorsal fins of which the hindmost is fleshy and without rays They have teeth both on the tongue and in the jaws whilst the body is covered with round and minutely striated scales CURRIED SALMON three hundred five

salmon begin to press up the rivers as far as they can reach in order to deposit their spawn which they do in the sand or gravel about eighteen inches deep Here it lies buried till the spring when about the latter end of March it begins to exclude the young which gradually increase to four or five inches in length and are then termed smelts or smouts About the beginning of May the river seems to be alive with them and there is no forming an idea of their numbers without having seen them A seasonable flood however comes and hurries them to the great deep whence about the middle of June they commence their return to the river again By this time they are twelve or sixteen inches long and progressively increase both in number and size till about the end of July when they have become large enough to be denominated grilse Early in August they become fewer in numbers but of greater size haying advanced to a weight of from six to nine pounds This rapidity of growth appears surprising and realizes the remark of Walton that the salmlet becomes a salmon in as short a time as a gosling becomes a goose Recent writers have however thrown considerable doubts on this quick growth of the salmon SALMON CUTLETS three hundred six Cut the slices one inch thick and season them with pepper and salt butter a sheet of white paper lay each slice on a separate piece with their ends twisted

two hour AN AVERSION IN THE SALMON The salmon is said to have an aversion to anything red hence fishermen engaged in catching it do not wear jackets or caps of that colour Pontoppidan also says that it has an abhorrence of carrion and if any happens to be thrown into the places it haunts it immediately forsakes them The remedy adopted for this in Norway is to throw into the polluted water a lighted torch As food salmon when in perfection is one of the most delicious and nutritive of our fish BAKED SEA BREAM three hundred ten INGREDIENTS one bream Seasoning to taste of salt pepper and

BREAM This is an abundant fish in Cornwall and it is frequently found in the fish market of Hastings during the summer months but it is not in much esteem mister YARRELL S RECIPE When thoroughly cleansed the fish should be wiped dry but none of the scales should be taken off In this state it should be broiled turning it often and if the skin cracks flour it a little to keep the outer case

SKATE THE SKATE This is one of the ray tribe and is extremely abundant and cheap in the fishing towns of England The flesh is white thick and nourishing but we suppose from its being so plentiful it is esteemed less than it ought to be on account of its nutritive properties and the ease with which it is digested It is much improved by crimping in which state it is usually sold in London The

lemon sole but if the bottom be muddy then it is called the black sole Small sized soles caught in shallow water on the coasts are the best in flavour FRICASSEED SOLES three hundred twenty five

vessel and on the art of the fisherman in its employment in a great measure depends the quality of the fish he catches If for example he drags the net too quickly all that are caught are swept rapidly to the end of the net where they are smothered and sometimes destroyed A medium has to be observed in order that as few as possible escape being caught in the net and as many as possible preserved alive in it FRIED FILLETED SOLES three hundred twenty six Soles for filleting should be large as the flesh can be more easily separated from the bones and there is less waste Skin and wash the fish and raise the meat carefully from the bones and divide it into nice handsome pieces The more usual way is to roll the fillets after dividing each one in two pieces and either bind them round with twine or run a small skewer through them Brush over with egg and cover with bread crumbs fry them as directed in the foregoing recipe and garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon When a pretty dish is

sieve and soft paper to absorb the fat Particular attention should be paid to this as nothing is more disagreeable than greasy fish this may be always avoided by dressing them in good time and

The poet Martial passes a high eulogium upon it and assigns it a place on the luxurious tables of the Palatine Mount If we may credit a modern traveller in China the people of that country generally entirely abstain from it and the sovereign of the Celestial Empire confines it to his own kitchen or dispenses it to only a few of his greatest favourites MATELOT OF TENCH three hundred thirty four

Illustration THE TENCH THE TENCH This fish is generally found in foul and weedy waters and in such places as are well supplied with rushes They thrive best in standing waters and are more numerous in pools and ponds than in rivers Those taken in the latter however are preferable for the table It does not often exceed four or five pounds in weight and is in England esteemed as a delicious and wholesome food As however they are sometimes found in waters where the mud is excessively fetid their flavour if cooked immediately on being caught is often very unpleasant but if they are transferred

It is said that the tench is possessed of such healing properties among the finny tribes that even the voracious pike spares it on this account The pike fell tyrant of the liquid plain With ravenous waste devours his fellow train Yet howsoe er with raging famine pined The tench he spares a medicinal kind For when by wounds distress d or sore disease He courts the salutary fish for ease Close to his scales the kind physician glides And sweats a healing balsam from his sides In our estimation however this self denial in the pike may be attributed to a less poetical cause namely from the mud loving disposition of the tench it is enabled to keep itself so completely concealed at the bottom of its aqueous haunts that it remains secure from the attacks of its predatory neighbour STEWED TROUT

time Sufficient for four persons Trout may be served with anchovy or caper sauce baked in buttered paper or fried whole like smelts Trout dressed a la Genevese is extremely delicate for this proceed the same as with salmon No three hundred seven Illustration THE TROUT THE TROUT This fish though esteemed by the moderns for its delicacy was little regarded by the ancients Although it abounded in the lakes of the Roman empire it is generally mentioned by writers only on account of the beauty of its colours About the end of September they quit the deep water to which they had retired during the hot weather for the purpose of spawning This they always do on a gravelly bottom or where gravel and sand are mixed among stones towards the end or by the sides of streams At this period they become black about the head and body and become soft and unwholesome They are never good when they are large with roe but there are in all trout rivers some barren female fish which continue good throughout the winter In the common trout the stomach is uncommonly strong and muscular shell fish forming a portion of the food of the animal and it takes into its stomach gravel or small stones in order to assist in comminuting it BOILED TURBOT three hundred thirty seven INGREDIENTS six oz of salt to each gallon of water Mode Choose a middling sized turbot for they are invariably the most valuable if very large the meat will be tough and thready Three or four hours before dressing soak the fish in salt and water to take off the slime then thoroughly cleanse it and with a knife make an incision down the middle of the back to prevent the skin of the belly from cracking Rub it over with lemon and be particular not to cut off the fins Lay the fish in a very clean turbot kettle with sufficient cold water to cover it and salt in the above proportion Let it gradually come to a boil and skim very carefully keep it gently simmering and on no account let it boil fast as the fish would have a very unsightly appearance When the meat separates easily from the bone it is done then take it out let it drain well and dish it on a hot napkin Rub a little lobster spawn through a sieve sprinkle it over the fish and garnish with tufts of parsley and cut lemon Lobster or shrimp sauce and plain melted butter should be sent to table with it See Coloured Plate E Time After the water boils about one two hour for a large turbot middling size about twenty minutes Average cost large turbot from tens to twelves middling size from twelves to fifteens Seasonable at any time Sufficient one middling sized turbot for eight persons Note An amusing anecdote is related by Miss Edgeworth of a bishop who descending to his kitchen to superintend the dressing of a turbot and discovering that his cook had stupidly cut off the fins immediately commenced sewing them on again with his own episcopal fingers This dignitary knew the value of a turbot s gelatinous appendages GARNISH FOR TURBOT OR OTHER LARGE FISH three hundred thirty eight Take the crumb of a stale loaf cut it into small pyramids with flat tops and on the top of each pyramid put rather more than a tablespoonful of white of egg beaten to a stiff froth Over this sprinkle finely chopped parsley and fine raspings of a dark colour Arrange these on the napkin round the fish one green and one brown alternately TO CHOOSE TURBOT See that it is thick and of a yellowish white for if of a bluish tint it is not good Illustration THE TURBOT THE TURBOT This is the most esteemed of all our flat fish The northern parts of the English coast and some places off the coast of Holland produce turbot in great abundance and in greater excellence than any other parts of the world The London market is chiefly supplied by Dutch fishermen who bring to it nearly ninety thousand a year The flesh is firm white rich and gelatinous and is the better for being kept a day or two previous to cooking it In many parts of the country turbot and halibut are indiscriminately sold for each other They are however perfectly distinct the upper parts of the former being marked with large unequal and obtuse tubercles while those of the other are quite smooth and covered with oblong soft scales which firmly adhere to the body Illustration TURBOT KETTLE FISH KETTLES are made in an oblong form and have two handles with a movable bottom pierced full of holes on which the fish is laid and on which it may be lifted from the water by means of two long handles attached to each side of the movable bottom This is to prevent the liability of breaking the fish as it would necessarily be if it were cooked in a common saucepan In the list of Messrs Richard and John Slack see seventy one the price of two of these is set down at tens The turbot kettle as will be seen by our cut is made differently from ordinary fish kettles it being less deep whilst it is wider and more pointed at the sides thus exactly answering to the shape of the fish which it is intended should be boiled in it It may be obtained from the same manufacturers and its price is Lone BAKED FILLETS OF TURBOT three hundred thirty nine INGREDIENTS The remains of cold turbot lobster sauce left from the preceding day egg and bread crumbs cayenne and salt to taste minced parsley nutmeg lemon juice Mode After having cleared the fish from all skin and bone divide it into square pieces of an

hour and do not forget to keep them well moistened with the butter Put a little lemon juice and grated nutmeg to the cold lobster sauce make it hot and pour over the fish which must be well drained from the butter Garnish with parsley and cut lemon Time Altogether one two hour Seasonable at any time Note Cold turbot thus warmed in the remains of lobster sauce will be found much nicer than putting the fish again in water FILLETS OF TURBOT A L ITALIENNE three hundred forty INGREDIENTS The remains of cold turbot Italian sauce See Sauces Mode Clear the fish carefully from the bone and take away all skin which gives an unpleasant flavour to the sauce Make the sauce hot lay in the fish to warm through but do not let it boil Garnish with croutons Time five minutes Seasonable all the year THE ANCIENT ROMANS ESTIMATE OF TURBOT As this luxurious people compared soles to partridges and sturgeons to peacocks so they found a resemblance to the turbot in the pheasant In the time of Domitian it is said one was taken of such dimensions as to require in the imperial kitchen a new stove to be erected and a new dish to be made for it in order that it might be cooked and served whole not even imperial Rome could furnish a stove or a dish large enough for the monstrous animal Where it was caught we are not aware but the turbot of the Adriatic Sea held a high rank in the Eternal City TURBOT A LA CREME three hundred forty one INGREDIENTS The remains of cold turbot For sauce two oz of butter four tablespoonfuls of cream salt cayenne and pounded mace to taste Mode Clear away all skin and bone from the flesh of the turbot which should be done when it comes from table as it causes less waste when trimmed hot Cut the flesh into nice square pieces as equally as possible put into a stewpan

as in the northern seas the pout is plentiful It bears a striking resemblance to the whiting and is esteemed as an excellent fish The pollack is also taken all round our coasts and likewise bears a striking resemblance to the whiting indeed it is sometimes mistaken by the inexperienced for that fish its flesh being considered by many equally delicate TO DRESS WHITEBAIT three hundred forty eight

forms served with lemon and brown bread and butter a tempting dish to vast numbers of Londoners who flock to the various taverns of these places in order to gratify their appetites The fish has been supposed be the fry of the shad the sprat the smelt or the bleak mister Yarrell however maintains that it is a species in itself distinct from every other fish When fried with flour it is esteemed a great delicacy The ministers of the Crown have had a custom for many years of having a whitebait dinner just before the close of the session It is invariably the precursor of the prorogation of Parliament and the repast is provided by the proprietor of the Trafalgar Greenwich FISH PIE WITH TENCH AND EELS three hundred forty nine INGREDIENTS two tench two eels two onions a faggot of herbs

enormous number of three billion fish with a weight of three hundred thousand tons ADDENDUM AND ANECDOTE It will be seen from the number and variety of the recipes which we have been enabled to give under the head of FISH that there exists in the salt ocean and fresh water rivers an abundance of aliment which the present state of gastronomic art enables the cook to introduce to the table in the most agreeable forms and oftentimes at a very moderate cost Less nutritious as a food than the flesh of animals more succulent than vegetables fish may be termed a middle dish suited to all temperaments and constitutions and one which those who are recovering from illness may partake of with safety and advantage As to which is the best fish there has been much discussion The old Latin proverb however de gustibus non disputandum and the more modern Spanish one sobre los gustos no hai disputa declare with equal force that where taste is concerned no decision can be arrived at Each person s palate may be differently affected pleased or displeased and there is no standard by which to judge why a red mullet a sole or a turbot should be better or worse than a salmon trout pike or a tiny tench Fish as we have explained is less nourishing than meat for it is lighter in weight size for size and contains no ozmazome see No one hundred Shell fish oysters particularly furnish but little nutriment and this is the reason why so many of the latter can be eaten without injury to the system In Brillat Savarin s Footnote Brillat Savarin was a French lawyer and judge of considerable eminence and great talents and wrote under the above title a book on gastronomy full of instructive information enlivened with a fund of pleasantly told anecdote clever and amusing volume The Physiology of Taste he says that towards the end of the eighteenth century it was a most common thing for a well arranged entertainment in Paris to commence with oysters and that many guests were not contented without swallowing twelve dozen Being anxious to know the weight of this advanced guard he ascertained that a dozen oysters fluid included weighed four ounces thus the twelve dozen would weigh about three lbs and there can be no doubt that the same persons who made no worse a dinner on account of having partaken of the oysters would have been completely satisfied if they had eaten the same weight of chicken or mutton An anecdote perfectly well authenticated is narrated of a French gentleman M Laperte residing at Versailles who was extravagantly fond of oysters declaring he never had enough Savarin resolved to procure him the satisfaction and gave him an invitation to dinner which was duly accepted The guest arrived and his host kept company with him in swallowing the delicious bivalves up to the tenth dozen when exhausted he gave up and let M Laperte go on alone This gentleman managed to eat thirty two dozen within an hour and would doubtless have got through more but the person who opened them is described as not being very skilful In the interim Savarin was idle and at length tired with his painful state of inaction he said to Laperte whilst the latter was still in full career Mon cher you will not eat as many oysters to day as you meant let us dine They dined and the insatiable oyster eater acted at the repast as if he had fasted for a week FISH CARVING GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING FISH In carving fish care should be taken to help it in perfect flakes as if these are broken the beauty of the fish is lost The carver should be acquainted too with the choicest parts and morsels and to give each guest an equal share of these titbits should be his maxim Steel knives and forks should on no account be used in helping fish as these are liable to impart to it a very disagreeable flavour Where silver fish carvers are considered too dear to be bought good electro plated ones answer very well and are inexpensive The prices set down for them by Messrs Slack of the Strand are from a guinea upwards COD S HEAD AND SHOULDERS For recipe see No two hundred thirty two and for mode of serving Coloured Plate C Illustration First run the knife along the centre of the side of the fish namely from d to b down to the bone then carve it in unbroken slices downwards from d to e or upwards from d to c as shown in the engraving The carver should ask the guests if they would like a portion of the roe and liver Note Of this fish the parts about the backbone and shoulders are the firmest and most esteemed by connoisseurs The sound which lines the fish beneath the backbone is considered a delicacy as are also the gelatinous parts about the head and neck SALMON For recipe see No three hundred one and for mode of dressing Coloured Plate B Illustration First run the knife quite down to the bone along the side of the fish from a to b and also from c to d Then help the thick part lengthwise that is in the direction of the lines from a to b and the thin part breadthwise that is in the direction of the lines from e to f as shown in the engraving A slice of the thick part should always be accompanied by a smaller piece of the thin from the belly where lies the fat of the fish Note Many persons in carving salmon make the mistake of slicing the thick part of this fish in the opposite direction to that we have stated and thus by the breaking of the flakes the beauty of its appearance is destroyed BOILED OR FRIED SOLE For recipes see Nos three hundred twenty one and three hundred twenty seven The usual way of helping this fish is to cut it quite through bone and all distributing it in nice and not too large pieces A moderately sized sole will be sufficient for three slices namely the head middle and tail The guests should be asked which of these they prefer A small one will only give two slices If the sole is very large the upper side may be raised from the bone and then divided into pieces and the under side afterwards served in the same way In helping FILLETED SOLES one fillet is given to each person For mode of serving see Coloured Plate A TURBOT For recipe see No three hundred thirty seven and for mode of serving Coloured Plate E First run the fish slice down the thickest part of the fish quite through to the bone from a to b and then cut handsome and regular slices in the direction of the lines downwards from c to e and upwards from c to d as shown in the engraving When the carver has removed all the meat from the upper side of the fish the backbone should be raised put on one side of the dish and the under side helped as the upper A BRILL and JOHN DORY are carved in the same manner as a Turbot Illustration Note The thick parts of the middle of the back are the best slices in a turbot and the rich gelatinous skin covering the fish as well as a little of the thick part of the fins are dainty morsels and should be placed on each plate WHITING c Whiting pike haddock and other fish when of a sufficiently large size may be carved in the same manner as salmon When small they may be cut through bone and all and helped in nice pieces a middling sized whiting serving for two slices Note The THICK part of the EEL is reckoned the best and this holds good of all flat fish The TAIL of the LOBSTER is the prime part and next to that the CLAWS Illustration FISH CARVERS Illustration SAUCES PICKLES GRAVIES AND FORCEMEATS CHAPTER IX GENERAL REMARKS three hundred fifty four AN ANECDOTE IS TOLD of the prince de Soubise who intending to give an entertainment asked for the bill of fare His chef came presenting a list adorned with vignettes and the first article of which that met the prince s eye was fifty hams Bertrand said the prince I think you must be extravagant Fifty hams do you intend to feast my whole regiment No Prince there will be but one on the table and the surplus I need for my Espagnole blondes garnitures c Bertrand you are robbing me this item will not do Monseigneur said the artiste you do not appreciate me Give me the order and I will put those fifty hams in a crystal flask no longer than my thumb The prince smiled and the hams were passed This was all very well for the prince de Soubise but as we do not write for princes and nobles alone but that our British sisters may make the best dishes out of the least expensive ingredients we will also pass the hams and give a few general directions concerning Sauces c three hundred fifty five THE PREPARATION AND APPEARANCE OF SAUCES AND GRAVIES are of the highest consequence and in nothing does the talent and taste of the cook more display itself Their special adaptability to the various viands they are to accompany cannot be too much studied in order that they may harmonize and blend with them as perfectly so to speak as does a pianoforte accompaniment with the voice of the singer three hundred fifty six THE GENERAL BASIS OF MOST GRAVIES and some sauces is the same stock as that used for soups see Nos one hundred four one hundred five one hundred six and one hundred seven and by the employment of these with perhaps an additional slice of ham a little spice a few herbs and a slight flavouring from some cold sauce or ketchup very nice gravies may be made for a very small expenditure A milt either of a bullock or sheep the shank end of mutton that has already been dressed and the necks and feet of poultry may all be advantageously used for gravy where much is not required It may then be established as a rule that there exists no necessity for good gravies to be expensive and that there is no occasion as many would have the world believe to buy ever so many pounds of fresh meat in order to furnish an ever so little quantity of gravy three hundred fifty seven BROWN SAUCES generally speaking should scarcely be so thick as white sauces and it is well to bear in mind that all those which are intended to mask the various dishes of poultry or meat should be of a sufficient consistency to slightly adhere to the fowls or joints over which they are poured For browning and thickening sauces c browned flour may be properly employed three hundred fifty eight SAUCES SHOULD POSSESS A DECIDED CHARACTER and whether sharp or sweet savoury or plain they should carry out their names in a distinct manner although of course not so much flavoured as to make them too piquant on the one hand or too mawkish on the other three hundred fifty nine GRAVIES AND SAUCES SHOULD BE SENT TO TABLE VERY HOT and there is all the more necessity for the cook to see to this point as from their being usually served in small quantities they are more liable to cool quickly than if they were in a larger body Those sauces of which cream or eggs form a component part should be well stirred as soon as these ingredients are added to them and must never be allowed to boil as in that case they would instantly curdle three hundred sixty ALTHOUGH PICKLES MAY BE PURCHASED at shops at as low a rate as they can usually be made for at home or perhaps even for less yet we would advise all housewives who have sufficient time and convenience to prepare their own The only general rules perhaps worth stating here as in the recipes all necessary details will be explained are that the vegetables and fruits used should be sound and not over ripe and that the very best vinegar should be employed three hundred sixty one FOR FORCEMEATS SPECIAL ATTENTION IS NECESSARY The points which cooks should in this branch of cookery more particularly observe are the thorough chopping of the suet the complete mincing of the herbs the careful grating of the bread crumbs and the perfect mixing of the whole These are the three principal ingredients of forcemeats and they can scarcely be cut too small as nothing like a lump or fibre should be anywhere perceptible To conclude the flavour of no one spice or herb should be permitted to predominate RECIPES CHAPTER X SAUCES PICKLES GRAVIES AND FORCEMEATS ANCHOVY SAUCE FOR FISH three hundred sixty two INGREDIENTS four anchovies one oz of butter one two pint of melted butter cayenne to taste Mode Bone the anchovies and pound them in a mortar to a paste with one oz of butter Make the melted butter hot stir in the pounded anchovies and cayenne simmer for three or four minutes and if liked add a squeeze of lemon juice A more general and expeditious way of making this sauce is to stir in one one two tablespoonfuls of anchovy essence to one two pint of melted butter and to add seasoning to taste Boil the whole up for one minute and serve hot Time five minutes Average cost fived for one two pint Sufficient this quantity for a brill small turbot three or four soles c ANCHOVY BUTTER see No two hundred twenty seven Illustration THE CAPISCUM CAYENNE This is the most acrid and stimulating spice with which we are acquainted It is a powder prepared from several varieties of the capsicum annual East India plants of which there are three so far naturalized in this country as to be able to grow in the open air these are the Guinea the Cherry and the Bell pepper All the pods of these are extremely pungent to the taste and in the green state are used by us as a pickle When ripe they are ground into cayenne pepper and sold as a condiment The best of this however is made in the West Indies from what is called the Bird pepper on account of hens and turkeys being extremely partial to it It is imported ready for use Of the capiscum species of plants there are five but the principal are one Capsicum annuum the common long podded capsicum which is cultivated in our gardens and of which there are two varieties one with red and another with yellow fruit two Capsicum baccatum or bird pepper which rises with a shrubby stalk four or five feet high with its berries growing at the division of the branches this is small oval shaped and of a bright red colour from which as we have said the best cayenne is made three Capsicum grossum the bell pepper the fruit of this is red and is the only kind fit for pickling APPLE SAUCE FOR GEESE PORK c three hundred sixty three INGREDIENTS six good sized apples sifted sugar to taste a piece of butter the size of a walnut water Mode Pare core and quarter the apples and throw them into cold water to preserve their whiteness Put them in a saucepan with sufficient water to moisten them and boil till soft enough to pulp Beat them up

page forty four Tarragon vinegar may be added to give an additional flavour Time Altogether four one two hours Average cost for this quantity fours WHITE PEPPER This is the produce of the same plant as that which produces the black pepper from which it is manufactured by steeping this in lime and water and rubbing it between the hands till the coats come off The best berries only will bear this operation hence the superior qualities of white pepper fetch a higher price than those of the other It is less acrid than the black and is much prized among the Chinese It is sometimes adulterated with rice flour as the black is with burnt bread The berries of the pepper plant grow in spikes of from twenty to thirty and are when ripe of a bright red colour After being gathered which is done

arrived at their clove state When they become dry they assume a yellowish hue which subsequently changes into a dark brown As an aromatic the clove is highly stimulating and yields an abundance of oil There are several varieties of the clove the best is called the royal clove which is scarce and which is blacker and smaller than the other kinds It is a curious fact that the flowers when fully

cultivated in Malabar and the eastern islands of Borneo Sumatra and Java and others in the same latitude It was formerly confined to these countries but it has now been introduced to Cayenne It is generally employed as a condiment but it should never be forgotten that even in small quantities it produces detrimental effects on inflammatory constitutions doctor Paris in his work on Diet says Foreign spices were not intended by Nature for the inhabitants of temperate climes they are heating and highly stimulant I am however not anxious to give more weight to this objection than it deserves Man is no longer the child of Nature nor the passive inhabitant of any particular region He ranges over every part of the globe and elicits nourishment from the productions of every climate Nature is very kind in favouring the growth of those productions which are most likely to answer our local wants Those climates for instance which engender endemic diseases are in general congenial to the growth of plants that operate as antidotes to them But if we go to the East for tea there is no reason why we should not go to the West for sugar The dyspeptic invalid however should be cautious in their use they may afford temporary benefit at the expense of permanent mischief It has been well said that the best quality of spices is to stimulate the appetite and their worst to destroy by insensible degrees the tone of the stomach The intrinsic goodness of meats should always be suspected when they require spicy seasonings to compensate for their natural want of sapidity The quality of pepper is known by rubbing it between the hands that which withstands this operation is good that which is reduced to powder by it is bad The quantity of pepper imported into Europe is very great

found wild It is very generally cultivated in gardens and has much improved on its original form Various dishes are frequently ornamented and garnished with its graceful leaves and these are sometimes boiled in soups although it is more usually confined in English cookery to the mackerel sauce as here given FISH SAUCE four hundred thirteen INGREDIENTS one one two oz of cayenne two tablespoonfuls of

mortar with the other ingredients mentioned above Pound well and bind with one or two eggs which have been previously beaten and strained Work the whole well together and the forcemeat will be ready for use If the pie is not to be eaten immediately omit the herbs and parsley as these would prevent it from keeping Mushrooms or truffles may be added Sufficient for two small pies Illustration MARJORAM MARJORAM Although there are several species of marjoram that which is known as the sweet or knotted marjoram is the one usually preferred in cookery It is a native of Portugal and when its leaves are used as a seasoning herb they have an agreeable aromatic flavour The winter sweet marjoram used for the same purposes is a native of Greece and the pot marjoram is another variety brought from Sicily All of them are favourite ingredients in soups stuffings c FORCEMEAT FOR PIKE CARP HADDOCK AND VARIOUS KINDS OF FISH four hundred sixteen INGREDIENTS one oz of fresh butter one oz of suet one oz of fat bacon one small teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs including parsley a little onion when liked shredded very fine salt nutmeg and cayenne to taste four oz of bread crumbs one egg Mode

lard or put them on a tin and bake for one two hour in a moderate oven As we have stated before no one flavour should predominate greatly and the forcemeat should be of sufficient body to cut with a knife and yet not dry and heavy For very delicate forcemeat it is advisable to pound the ingredients together before binding with the egg but for ordinary cooking mincing very finely answers the purpose Average cost eightd Sufficient for a turkey a moderate sized fillet of veal or a hare Note In forcemeat for HARE the liver of the animal is sometimes added Boil for five minutes mince it very small and mix it with the other ingredients If it should be in an unsound state it must be on no account made use of Illustration BASIL SWEET HERBS Those most usually employed for purposes of cooking such as the flavouring of soups sauces forcemeats c are thyme sage mint marjoram savory and basil Other sweet herbs are cultivated for purposes of medicine and perfumery they are most grateful both to the organs of taste and smelling and to the aroma derived from them is due in a great measure the sweet and exhilarating fragrance of our flowery meads In town sweet herbs have to be procured at the greengrocers or herbalists whilst in the country the garden should furnish all that are wanted the cook taking great care to have some dried in the autumn for her use throughout the winter months FORCEMEAT FOR BAKED PIKE four hundred eighteen INGREDIENTS three oz of bread crumbs one teaspoonful of minced savoury herbs eight oysters two anchovies these may be dispensed with two oz of suet salt

recipe that French forcemeat or quenelles consist of the blending of three separate processes namely panada udder and whatever meat you intend using PANADA four hundred twenty INGREDIENTS The crumb of two penny rolls four tablespoonfuls of white stock No one hundred seven one oz of butter one slice of ham one bay leaf a little minced parsley two shalots one clove two blades of mace a few mushrooms when obtainable butter the yolks of two eggs Mode Soak the crumb of the rolls in milk for about one two hour then take it out and squeeze so as to press the milk from it put the soaked bread into a stewpan with the above quantity of white stock and set it on one side then put into a separate stewpan one oz of butter a slice of lean ham cut small with a bay leaf herbs mushrooms spices c in the above proportions and fry them gently over a slow fire When done moisten with two teacupfuls of white stock boil for twenty minutes and strain the whole through a sieve over the panada in the other stewpan Place it over the fire keep constantly stirring to prevent its burning and when quite dry put in a small piece of butter Let this again dry up by stirring over the fire then add the yolks of two eggs mix well put the panada to cool on a clean plate and use it when required Panada should always be well flavoured as the forcemeat receives no taste from any of the other ingredients used in its preparation Boiled Calf s Udder for French Forcemeats four hundred twenty one Put the udder into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover it let it stew gently till quite done when take it out to cool Trim all the upper parts cut it into small pieces and pound well in a mortar till it can be rubbed through a sieve That portion which passes through the strainer is one of the three ingredients of which French forcemeats are generally composed but many cooks substitute butter for this being a less troublesome and more expeditious mode of preparation Illustration PESTLE AND MORTAR PESTLE AND MORTAR No cookery can be perfectly performed without the aid of the useful instruments shown in the engraving For pounding things sufficiently fine they are invaluable and the use of them will save a good deal of time besides increasing the excellence of the preparations They are made of iron and in that material can be bought cheap but as these are not available for all purposes we should recommend as more economical in the end those made of Wedgwood although these are considerably more expensive than the former Veal Quenelles four hundred twenty two INGREDIENTS Equal quantities of veal panada No four hundred twenty and calf s udder No four hundred twenty one two eggs seasoning to taste of pepper salt and pounded mace or grated nutmeg a little flour Mode Take the fleshy part of veal scrape it with a knife till all the meat is separated from the sinews and allow about one two lb for an entree Chop the meat and pound it in a mortar till reduced to a paste then roll it into a ball make another of panada No four hundred twenty the same size and another of udder No four hundred twenty one taking care that these three balls be of the same size It is to be remembered that equality of size and not of weight is here necessary When the three ingredients are properly prepared pound them altogether in a mortar for some time for the more quenelles are pounded the more delicate they are Now moisten with the eggs whites and yolks and continue pounding adding a seasoning of pepper spices c When the whole is well blended together mould it into balls or whatever shape is intended roll them in flour and poach in boiling water to which a little salt should have been added If the quenelles are not firm enough add the yolk of another egg but omit the white which only makes them hollow and puffy inside In the preparation of this recipe it would be well to bear in mind that the ingredients are to be well pounded and seasoned and must be made hard or soft according to the dishes they are intended for For brown or white ragouts they should be firm and when the quenelles are used very small extreme delicacy will be necessary in their preparation Their flavour may be varied by using the flesh of rabbit fowl hare pheasant grouse or an extra quantity of mushroom parsley c Time About one four hour to poach in boiling water Sufficient one two lb of veal or other meat with other ingredients in proportion for one entree Note The French are noted for their skill in making forcemeats one of the principal causes of their superiority in this respect being that they pound all the ingredients so diligently and thoroughly Any one with the slightest pretensions to refined cookery must in this particular implicitly follow the example of our friends across the Channel FORCEMEAT or QUENELLES FOR TURTLE SOUP See No one hundred eighty nine four hundred twenty three SOYER S RECIPE FOR FORCEMEATS Take a pound and a half of lean veal from the fillet and cut it in long thin slices scrape with a knife till nothing but the fibre remains put it in a mortar pound it ten minutes or until in a puree pass it through a wire sieve use the remainder in stock then take one

twenty four Cut the bread into thin slices place them in a cool oven overnight and when thoroughly dry and crisp roll them down into fine crumbs Put some lard or clarified dripping into a frying pan bring it to the boiling point throw in the crumbs and fry them very quickly Directly they are done lift them out with a slice and drain them before the fire from all greasy moisture When quite crisp they are ready for use The fat they are fried in should be clear and the crumbs should not have the slightest appearance or taste of having been in the least degree burnt FRIED SIPPETS OF BREAD for Garnishing many Dishes four hundred twenty five Cut the bread into thin slices and stamp them out in whatever shape you like rings crosses diamonds c c Fry them in the same manner as the bread crumbs in clear boiling lard or clarified dripping and drain them until thoroughly crisp before the fire When variety is desired fry some of a pale colour and others of a darker hue FRIED BREAD FOR BORDERS four hundred twenty six Proceed as above by frying some slices of bread cut in any fanciful shape When quite crisp dip one side of the sippet into the beaten white of an egg mixed with a little flour and place it on the edge of the dish Continue in this manner till the border is completed arranging the sippets a pale and a dark one alternately GENEVESE SAUCE FOR SALMON TROUT c four hundred twenty seven INGREDIENTS one small carrot a small faggot of sweet herbs including parsley one onion five or six mushrooms when obtainable one bay leaf six cloves one blade of mace two oz of butter one glass

when it will be ready for table Time Altogether two hours Average cost ones threed per pint Sufficient half this quantity for two slices of salmon Illustration SAGE SAGE This was originally a native of the south of Europe but it has long been cultivated in the English garden There are several kinds of it known as the green the red the small leaved and the broad leaved balsamic In cookery its principal use is for stuffings and sauces for which purpose the red is the most agreeable and the green the next The others are used for medical purposes PICKLED GHERKINS four hundred twenty eight INGREDIENTS Salt and water one oz of bruised ginger one two oz of whole black pepper one four oz of whole allspice four cloves two blades of mace a little horseradish This proportion of pepper spices c for one quart of vinegar Mode Let the gherkins remain in salt and water for three or four days when take them out wipe perfectly dry and put them into a stone jar Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them with spices and pepper c in the above proportion for ten minutes pour it quite boiling over the gherkins cover the jar with vine leaves and put over them a plate setting them near the fire where they must remain all night Next day drain off the vinegar boil it up again and pour it hot over them Cover up with fresh leaves and let the whole remain till quite cold Now tie down closely with bladder to exclude the air and in a month or two they will be fit for use Time four days Seasonable from the middle of July to the end of August Illustration GHERKINS GHERKINS Gherkins are young cucumbers and the only way in which they are used for cooking purposes is pickling them as by the recipe here given Not having arrived at maturity they have not of course so strongly a developed flavour as cucumbers and as a pickle they are very general favourites GOOSEBERRY SAUCE FOR BOILED MACKEREL four hundred twenty nine INGREDIENTS one pint of green gooseberries three tablespoonfuls of Bechamel No three hundred sixty seven veal gravy may be substituted for this two oz of fresh butter seasoning to taste of salt pepper and grated nutmeg Mode Boil the gooseberries in water until quite tender strain them and rub them through a sieve Put into a saucepan the Bechamel or gravy with the butter and seasoning add the pulp from the gooseberries mix all well together and heat gradually through A little pounded sugar added to this sauce is by many persons considered an improvement as the saccharine matter takes off the extreme acidity of the unripe fruit Time Boil the gooseberries from twenty minutes to one two hour Sufficient this quantity for a large dish of mackerel Seasonable from May to July Illustration THE GOOSEBERRY THE GOOSEBERRY This useful and wholesome fruit Ribes grossularia is thought to be indigenous to the British Isles and may be occasionally found in a wild state in some of the eastern counties although when uncultivated it is but a very small and inferior berry The high state of perfection to which it has been here brought is due to the skill of the English gardeners for in no other country does it attain the same size and flavour The humidity of the British climate however has doubtless something to do with the result and it is said that gooseberries produced in Scotland as far north as Inverness are of a very superior character Malic and citric acid blended with sugar produce the pleasant flavour of the gooseberry and upon the proper development of these properties depends the success of all cooking operations with which they are connected GLAZE FOR COVERING COLD HAMS TONGUES c four hundred thirty INGREDIENTS Stock No one hundred four or one hundred seven doubling the quantity of meat in each Mode We may remark at the outset that unless glaze is wanted in very large quantities it is seldom made expressly Either of the stocks mentioned above boiled down and reduced very considerably will be found to produce a very good glaze Put the stock into a stewpan over a nice clear fire let it boil till it becomes somewhat stiff when keep stirring to prevent its burning The moment it is sufficiently reduced and comes to a glaze turn it out into the glaze pot of which we have here given an engraving As however this is not to be found in every establishment a white earthenware jar would answer the purpose and this may be placed in a vessel of boiling water to melt the glaze when required It should never be warmed in a saucepan except on the principle of the bain marie lest it should reduce too much and become black and bitter If the glaze is wanted of a pale colour more veal than beef should be used in making the stock and it is as well to omit turnips and celery as these impart a disagreeable bitter flavour TO GLAZE COLD JOINTS c Melt the glaze by placing the vessel which contains it into the bain marie or saucepan of boiling water brush it over the meat with a paste brush and if in places it is not quite covered repeat the operation The glaze should not be too dark a colour See Coloured Cut of Glazed Ham P Illustration GLAZE KETTLE Illustration THE BAIN MARIE GLAZE KETTLE This is a kettle used for keeping the strong stock boiled down to a jelly which is known by the name of glaze It is composed of two tin vessels as shown in the cut one of which the upper containing the glaze is inserted into one of larger diameter and containing boiling water A brush is put in the small hole at the top of the lid and is employed for putting the glaze on anything that may require it THE BAIN MARIE So long ago as the time when emperors ruled in Rome and the yellow Tiber passed through a populous and wealthy city this utensil was extensively employed and it is frequently mentioned by that profound culinary chemist of the ancients Apicius It is an open kind of vessel as shown in the engraving and explained in our paragraph No eighty seven on the French terms used in modern cookery filled with boiling or nearly boiling water and into this water should be put all the stewpans containing those ingredients which it is desired to keep hot The quantity and quality of the contents of these vessels are not at all affected and if the hour of dinner is uncertain in any establishment by reason of the nature of the master s business nothing is so certain a means of preserving the flavour of all dishes as the employment of the bain marie GREEN SAUCE FOR GREEN GEESE OR DUCKLINGS four hundred thirty one INGREDIENTS one four pint of sorrel juice one glass of sherry one two pint of green gooseberries one teaspoonful of pounded sugar one oz of fresh butter Mode Boil the gooseberries in water until they are quite tender mash them and press them through a sieve put the pulp into a saucepan with the above ingredients simmer for three or four minutes and serve very hot Time three or four minutes Note We have given this recipe as a sauce for green geese thinking that some of our readers might sometimes require it but at the generality of fashionable tables it is now seldom or never served Illustration SORREL SORREL We gather from the pages of Pliny and Apicius that sorrel was cultivated by the Romans in order to give it more strength and flavour and that they also partook of it sometimes stewed with mustard being seasoned with a little oil and vinegar At the present day English cookery is not much indebted to this plant Rumex Acetosa although the French make use of it to a considerable extent It is found in most parts of Great Britain and also on the continent growing wild in the grass meadows and in a few gardens it is cultivated The acid of sorrel is very prononce and is what chemists term a binoxalate of potash that is a combination of oxalic acid with potash GENERAL STOCK FOR GRAVIES four hundred thirty two Either of the stocks Nos one hundred four one hundred five or one hundred seven will be found to answer very well for the basis of many gravies unless these are wanted very rich indeed By the addition of various store sauces thickening and flavouring the stocks here referred to may be converted into very good gravies It should be borne in mind however that the goodness and strength of spices wines flavourings c evaporate and that they lose a great deal of their fragrance if added to the gravy a long time before they are wanted If this point is attended to a saving of one half the quantity of these ingredients will be effected as with long boiling the flavour almost entirely passes away The shank bones of mutton previously well soaked will be found a great assistance in enriching gravies a kidney or melt beef skirt trimmings of meat c c answer very well when only a small quantity is wanted and as we have before observed a good gravy need not necessarily be so very expensive for economically prepared dishes are oftentimes found as savoury and wholesome as dearer ones The cook should also remember that the fragrance of gravies should not be overpowered by too much spice or any strong essences and that they should always be warmed in a bain marie after they are flavoured or else in a jar or jug placed in a saucepan full of boiling water The remains of roast meat gravy should always be saved as when no meat is at hand a very nice gravy in haste may be made from it and when added to hashes ragouts c is a great improvement Illustration GRAVY KETTLE GRAVY KETTLE This is a utensil which will not be found in every kitchen but it is a useful one where it is necessary to keep gravies hot for the purpose of pouring over various dishes as they are cooking It is made of copper and should consequently be heated over the hot plate if there be one or a charcoal stove The price at which it can be purchased is set down by Messrs Slack at fourteens GRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT four hundred thirty three INGREDIENTS Gravy salt Mode Put a common dish with a small quantity of salt in it under the meat about a quarter of an hour before it is removed from the fire When the dish is full take it away baste the meat and pour the gravy into the dish on which the joint is to be served SAUCES AND GRAVIES IN THE MIDDLE AGES Neither poultry butcher s meat nor roast game were eaten dry in the middle ages any more than fried fish is now Different sauces each having its own peculiar flavour were served with all these dishes and even with the various parts of each animal Strange and grotesque sauces as for example eggs cooked on the spit butter fried and roasted were invented by the cooks of those days but these preparations had hardly any other merit than that of being surprising and difficult to make A QUICKLY MADE GRAVY four hundred thirty four INGREDIENTS one two lb of shin of beef one two onion one four carrot two or three sprigs of parsley and savoury herbs a piece of butter about the size of a walnut cayenne and mace to taste three four pint of water Mode Cut up the meat into very small pieces

how much care and attention and foresight are necessary in order to serve well a little dinner for six or eight persons a dinner which will give credit to the menage and satisfaction and pleasure to the guests A quickly made gravy under some circumstances that we have known occur will be useful to many housekeepers when they have not much time for preparation But talking of speed and time and preparation what a combination of all these must have been necessary for the feast at the wedding of Charles VI of France On that occasion as Froissart the chronicler tells us the art of cooking with its innumerable paraphernalia of sauces with gravy pepper cinnamon garlic scallion brains gravy soups milk potage and ragouts had a signal triumph The skilful chef de cuisine of the royal household covered the great marble table of the regal palace with no less than a hundred different dishes prepared in a hundred different ways A GOOD BEEF GRAVY FOR POULTRY GAME c four hundred thirty five

colour when cold add it to the strained gravy and boil it up quickly This thickening may be made in larger quantities and kept in a stone jar for use when wanted Time Altogether two hours Average cost fourd per pint CLOVES This very agreeable spice is the unexpanded flower buds of the Caryophyllus aromaticus a handsome branching tree a native of the Malacca Islands They take their name from the Latin word clavus or the French clou both meaning a nail and to which the clove has a considerable resemblance Cloves were but little known to the ancients and Pliny appears to be the only writer who mentions them and he says vaguely enough that some were brought to Rome very similar to grains of pepper but somewhat longer that they were only to be found in India in a wood consecrated to the gods and that they served in the manufacture of perfumes The Dutch as in the case of the nutmeg see three hundred seventy eight endeavoured when they gained possession of the Spice Islands to secure a monopoly of cloves and so that the cultivation of the tree might be confined to Amboyna their chief island bribed the surrounding chiefs to cut down all trees found elsewhere The Amboyna or royal clove is said to be the best and is rare but other kinds nearly equally good are produced in other parts of the world and they come to Europe from Mauritius Bourbon Cayenne and Martinique as also from saint Kitts saint Vincent s and Trinidad The clove contains about twenty per cent of volatile aromatic oil to which it owes its peculiar pungent flavour its other parts being composed of woody fibre water gum and resin BROWN GRAVY WITHOUT MEAT four hundred thirty seven INGREDIENTS two large onions one large carrot two oz of butter three pints of boiling water one bunch of savoury herbs a

CELERY As in the above recipe the roots of celery are principally used in England for flavouring soups sauces and gravies and for serving with cheese at the termination of a dinner and as an ingredient for salad In Italy however the green leaves and stems are also employed for stews and soups and the seeds are also more frequently made use of on the continent than in our own islands In Germany celery is very highly esteemed and it is there boiled and served up as a dish by itself as well as used in the composition of mixed dishes We ourselves think that this mild aromatic plant might oftener be cooked than it is for there are very few nicer vegetable preparations brought to table than a well dressed plate of stewed celery VEAL GRAVY FOR WHITE SAUCES FRICASSEES c four hundred

two pint of water one onion one four teaspoonful of minced lemon peel one four teaspoonful of salt one blade of pounded mace the juice of one four lemon thickening of butter and flour Mode Put all the ingredients into a stewpan except the thickening and lemon juice and let them simmer very gently for rather more than one hour or until the liquor is reduced to a pint when strain through a hair sieve Add a thickening of butter and flour and the lemon juice set it on the fire and let it just boil up when it will be ready for use It may be flavoured with a little tomato sauce and where a rather dark

bones and water simmer gently for two hours strain and skim and add the walnut ketchup and a seasoning of salt Let it just boil when it is ready to serve Time two hours Illustration THE DEER VENISON Far far away in ages past our fathers loved the chase and what it brought and it is usually imagined that when Isaac ordered his son Esau to go out with his weapons his quiver and his bow and to prepare for him savoury meat such as he loved that it was venison he desired The wise Solomon too delighted in this kind of fare for we learn that at his table every day were served the wild ox the roebuck and the stag Xenophon informs us in his History that Cyrus king of Persia ordered that venison should never be wanting at his repasts and of the effeminate Greeks it was the delight The Romans also were devoted admirers of the flesh of the deer and our own kings and princes from the Great Alfred down to the Prince Consort have hunted although it must be confessed under vastly different circumstances the swift buck and relished their haunch all the more keenly that they had borne themselves bravely in the pursuit of the animal TO DRY HERBS FOR WINTER USE four hundred forty five On a very dry day gather the herbs just before they begin to flower If this is done when the weather is damp the herbs will not be so good a colour It is very necessary to be particular in little matters like this for trifles constitute perfection and herbs nicely dried will be found very acceptable when frost and snow are on the ground It is hardly necessary however to state that the flavour and fragrance of fresh herbs are incomparably finer They should be perfectly freed from dirt and dust and be divided into small bunches with their roots cut off Dry them quickly in a very hot oven or before the fire as by this means most of their flavour will be preserved and be careful not to burn them tie them up in paper bags and keep in a dry place This is a very general way of preserving dried herbs but we would recommend the plan described in a former recipe Seasonable From the month of July to the end of September is the proper time for storing herbs for winter use HERB POWDER FOR FLAVOURING when Fresh Herbs are not obtainable four hundred forty six INGREDIENTS one oz of dried lemon thyme one oz of dried winter savory one oz of dried sweet marjoram and basil two oz of dried parsley one oz of dried lemon peel Mode Prepare and dry the herbs by recipe No four hundred forty five pick the leaves from the stalks pound them and sift them through a hair sieve mix in the above proportions and keep in glass bottles carefully excluding the air This we think a far better method of keeping herbs as the flavour and fragrance do not evaporate so much as when they are merely put in paper bags Preparing them in this way you have them ready for use at a moment s notice Mint sage parsley c dried pounded and each put into separate bottles will be found very useful in winter Illustration CORK WITH WOODEN TOP CORKS WITH WOODEN TOPS These are the best corks to use when it is indispensable that the air should not be admitted to the ingredients contained in bottles which are in constant use The top which as will be seen by the accompanying little cut is larger than the cork is made of wood and besides effectually covering the whole top of the bottle can be easily removed and again used as no corkscrew is necessary to pull it out SAVORY This we find described by Columella a voluminous Roman writer on agriculture as an odoriferous herb which in the brave days of old entered into the seasoning of nearly every dish Verily there are but few new things under the sun and we don t find that we have made many discoveries in gastronomy at least beyond what was known to the ancient inhabitants of Italy We possess two varieties of this aromatic herb known to naturalists as Satureja They are called summer and winter savory according to the time of the year when they are fit for gathering Both sorts are in general cultivation throughout England HORSERADISH SAUCE to serve with Roast Beef four hundred forty seven INGREDIENTS four tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish one teaspoonful of pounded sugar one teaspoonful of salt one two teaspoonful of pepper two teaspoonfuls of made mustard vinegar Mode Grate the horseradish and mix it well with the sugar salt pepper and mustard moisten it with sufficient vinegar to give it the consistency of cream and serve in a tureen three or four tablespoonfuls of cream added to the above very much improve the appearance and flavour of this sauce To heat it to serve with hot roast beef put it in a bain marie or a jar which place in a saucepan of boiling water make it hot but do not allow it to boil or it will curdle Note This sauce is a great improvement on the old fashioned way of serving cold scraped horseradish with hot roast beef The mixing of the cold vinegar with the warm gravy cools and spoils everything on the plate Of course with cold meat the sauce should be served cold Illustration THE HORSERADISH THE HORSERADISH This has been for many years a favourite accompaniment of roast beef and is a native of England It grows wild in wet ground but has long been cultivated in the garden and is occasionally used in winter salads and in sauces On account of the great volatility of its oil it should never be preserved by drying but should be kept moist by being buried in sand So rapidly does its volatile oil evaporate that even when scraped for the table it almost immediately spoils by exposure to the air HORSERADISH VINEGAR four hundred forty eight INGREDIENTS one four lb of scraped horseradish one oz of minced shalot one drachm of cayenne one quart of vinegar Mode Put all the ingredients into a bottle which shake well every day for a fortnight When it is thoroughly steeped strain and bottle and it will be fit for use immediately This will be found an agreeable relish to cold beef c Seasonable This vinegar should be made either in October or November as horseradish is then in its highest perfection INDIAN CURRY POWDER founded on doctor Kitchener s Recipe four hundred forty nine INGREDIENTS one four lb of coriander seed one four lb of turmeric two oz of cinnamon seed one two oz of cayenne one oz of mustard one oz of ground ginger one two ounce of allspice two oz of fenugreek seed Mode Put all the ingredients in a cool oven where they should remain one night then pound them in a mortar rub them through a sieve and mix thoroughly together keep the powder in a bottle from which the air should be completely excluded Note We have given this recipe for curry powder as some persons prefer to make it at home but that purchased at any respectable shop is generally speaking far superior and taking all things into consideration very frequently more economical INDIAN MUSTARD an excellent Relish to Bread and Butter or any cold Meat four hundred fifty INGREDIENTS one four lb of the best mustard one four lb of flour one two oz of salt four shalots four tablespoonfuls of vinegar four tablespoonfuls of ketchup one four bottle of anchovy sauce Mode Put the mustard flour and salt into a basin and make them into a stiff paste with boiling water Boil the shalots with the vinegar ketchup and anchovy sauce for ten minutes and pour the whole boiling over the mixture in the basin stir well and reduce it to a proper thickness put it into a bottle with a bruised shalot at the bottom and store away for use This makes an excellent relish and if properly prepared will keep for years Illustration MUSTARD MUSTARD Before the year seventeen twenty nine mustard was not known at English tables About that time an old woman of the name of Clements residing in Durham began to grind the seed in a mill and to pass the flour through several processes necessary to free the seed from its husks She kept her secret for many years to herself during which she sold large quantities of mustard throughout the country but especially in London Here it was introduced to the royal table when it received the approval of George I From the circumstance of missus Clements being a resident at Durham it obtained the name of Durham mustard In the county of that name it is still principally cultivated and the plant is remarkable for the rapidity of its growth It is the best stimulant employed to impart strength to the digestive organs and even in its previously coarsely pounded state had a high reputation with our ancestors INDIAN PICKLE very Superior four hundred fifty one INGREDIENTS To each gallon of vinegar allow six cloves of garlic twelve shalots two sticks of sliced horseradish one four lb of bruised ginger two oz of whole black pepper one oz of long pepper one oz of allspice twelve cloves one four oz of cayenne two oz of mustard seed one four lb of mustard one oz of turmeric a white cabbage cauliflowers radish pods French beans gherkins small round pickling onions nasturtiums capsicums chilies c Mode Cut the cabbage which must be hard and white into slices and the cauliflowers into small branches sprinkle salt over them in a large dish and let them remain two days then dry them and put them into a very large jar with garlic shalots horseradish ginger pepper allspice and cloves in the above proportions Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them which pour over and when cold cover up to keep them free from dust As the other things for the pickle ripen at different times they may be added as they are ready these will be radish pods French beans gherkins small onions nasturtiums capsicums chilies c c As these are procured they must first of all be washed in a little cold vinegar wiped and then simply added to the other ingredients in the large jar only taking care that they are covered by the vinegar If more vinegar should be wanted to add to the pickle do not omit first to boil it before adding it to the rest When you have collected all the things you require turn all out in a large pan and thoroughly mix them Now put the mixed vegetables into smaller jars without any of the vinegar then boil the vinegar again adding as much more as will be required to fill the different jars and also cayenne mustard seed turmeric and mustard which must be well mixed with a little cold vinegar allowing the quantities named above to each gallon of vinegar Pour the vinegar boiling hot over the pickle and when cold tie down with a bladder If the pickle is wanted for immediate use the vinegar should be boiled twice more but the better way is to make it during one season for use during the next It will keep for years if care is taken that the vegetables are quite covered by the vinegar This recipe was taken from the directions of a lady whose pickle was always pronounced excellent by all who tasted it and who has for many years exactly followed the recipe given above Note For small families perhaps the above quantity of pickle will be considered too large but this may be decreased at pleasure taking care to properly proportion the various ingredients Illustration INDIA PICKLE KEEPING PICKLES Nothing shows more perhaps the difference between a tidy thrifty housewife and a lady to whom these desirable epithets may not honestly be applied than the appearance of their respective store closets The former is able the moment anything is wanted to put her hand on it at once no time is lost no vexation incurred no dish spoilt for the want of just little something the latter on the contrary hunts all over her cupboard for the ketchup the cook requires or the pickle the husband thinks he should like a little of with his cold roast beef or mutton chop and vainly seeks for the Embden groats or arrowroot to make one of her little boys some gruel One plan then we strenuously advise all who do not follow to begin at once and that is to label all their various pickles and store sauces in the same way as the cut here shows It will occupy a little time at first but there will be economy of it in the long run VINEGAR This term is derived from the two French words vin aigre sour wine and should therefore be strictly applied to that which is made only from wine As the acid is the same however it is procured that made from ale also takes the same name Nearly all ancient nations were acquainted with the use of vinegar We learn in Ruth that the reapers in the East soaked their bread in it to freshen it The Romans kept large quantities of it in their cellars using it to a great extent in their seasonings and sauces This people attributed very beneficial qualities to it as it was supposed to be digestive antibilious and antiscorbutic as well as refreshing Spartianus a Latin historian tells us that mixed with water it was the drink of the soldiers and that thanks to this beverage the veterans of the Roman army braved by its use the inclemency and variety of all the different seasons and climates of Europe Asia and Africa It is said the Spanish peasantry and other inhabitants of the southern parts of Europe still follow this practice and add to a gallon of water about a gill of wine vinegar with a little salt and that this drink with a little bread enables them under the heat of their burning sun to sustain the labours of the field INDIAN CHETNEY SAUCE four hundred fifty two INGREDIENTS eight oz of sharp sour apples pared and cored eight oz of tomatoes eight oz of salt eight oz of brown sugar eight oz of stoned raisins four oz of cayenne four oz of powdered ginger two oz of garlic two oz

Keep this in a warm place and stir every day for a month taking care to put on the lid after this operation strain but do not squeeze it dry store it away in clean jars or bottles for use and the liquor will serve as an excellent sauce for meat or fish Seasonable Make this sauce when tomatoes are in full season that is from the beginning of September to the end of October PICKLES The ancient Greeks and Romans held their pickles in high estimation They consisted of flowers herbs roots and vegetables preserved in vinegar and which were kept for a long time in cylindrical vases with wide mouths Their cooks prepared pickles with the greatest care and the various ingredients were macerated in oil brine and vinegar with which they were often impregnated drop by drop Meat also after having been cut into very small pieces was treated in the same manner ITALIAN SAUCE Brown four hundred fifty three INGREDIENTS A few chopped mushrooms and shalots one two pint of stock No one hundred

with all the above ingredients allowing the same proportion as stated to each quart of vinegar Pack the lemons in a jar pour over the vinegar c boiling hot and tie down with a bladder They will be fit for use in about twelve months or rather sooner Seasonable This should be made from November to April THE LEMON In the earlier ages of the world the lemon does not appear to have been at all known and the Romans only became acquainted with it at a very late period and then only used it to keep moths from their garments Its acidity would seem to have been unpleasant to them and in Pliny s time at the commencement of the Christian era this fruit was hardly accepted otherwise than as an excellent antidote against the effects of poison Many anecdotes have been related concerning the anti venomous properties of the lemon Athenaeus a Latin writer telling us that on one occasion two men felt no effects from the bites of dangerous serpents because they had previously eaten of this fruit TO PICKLE LEMONS WITHOUT THE PEEL four hundred fifty six INGREDIENTS six lemons one lb of fine salt to each quart of vinegar the same ingredients as No four hundred fifty five Mode Peel the lemons slit each one

foregoing recipe tie down closely and in about nine months they will be fit for use Seasonable The best time to make this is from November to April Note After this pickle has been made from four to five months the liquor may be strained and bottled and will be found an excellent lemon ketchup LEMON JUICE Citric acid is the principal component part of lemon juice which in addition to the agreeableness of its flavour is also particularly cooling and grateful It is likewise an antiscorbutic and this quality enhances its value In order to combat the fatal effects of scurvy amongst the crews of ships at sea a regular allowance of lemon juice is served out to the men and by this practice the disease has almost entirely disappeared By putting the juice into bottles and pouring on the top sufficient oil to cover it it may be preserved for a considerable time Italy and Turkey export great quantities of it in this manner LEMON SAUCE FOR BOILED FOWLS four hundred fifty seven INGREDIENTS one small lemon three four pint of melted butter No three hundred eighty Mode Cut the lemon into very thin slices and these again into very small dice Have ready three four pint of melted

herb compartment of the kitchen garden It is a trailing evergreen is of smaller growth than the common kind see No one hundred sixty six and is remarkable for its smell which closely resembles that of

quart of walnut liquor allow the above proportion of vinegar soy cayenne shalots garlic and port wine Pound each ingredient separately in a mortar then mix them well together and store away for use in

bottle with the brandy and let them infuse for twenty four hours when they should be strained Now boil the sugar with the water for a few minutes skim it and when cold add it to the brandy A dessertspoonful of this will be found an excellent flavouring for boiled custards LEMON RIND OR PEEL This contains an essential oil of a very high flavour and fragrance and is consequently esteemed both a wholesome and agreeable stomachic It is used as will be seen by many recipes in this book as an ingredient for flavouring a number of various dishes Under the name of CANDIED LEMON PEEL it is cleared of the pulp and preserved by sugar when it becomes an excellent sweetmeat By the ancient medical philosopher Galen and others it may be added that dried lemon peel was considered as one of the best digestives and recommended to weak and delicate persons LIAISON OF EGGS FOR THICKENING SAUCES four hundred sixty one INGREDIENTS The yolks of three eggs eight tablespoonfuls of milk or cream Mode Beat up the yolks of the eggs to which add the milk and strain the whole through a hair sieve When the liaison is being added to the sauce it is intended to thicken care must be exercised to keep

middling sized hen lobster three four pint of melted butter No three hundred seventy six one tablespoonful of anchovy sauce one two oz of butter salt and cayenne to taste a little pounded mace when

wanted Make three four pint of melted butter by recipe No three hundred seventy six put in all the ingredients except the lobster meat and well mix the sauce before the lobster is added to it as it should retain its square form and not come to table shredded and ragged Put in the meat let it get thoroughly hot but do not allow it to boil as the colour would immediately be spoiled for it should be remembered that this sauce should always have a bright red appearance If it is intended to be served with turbot or brill a little of the spawn dried and rubbed through a sieve without butter should be saved to garnish with but as the goodness flavour and appearance of the sauce so much depend on having a proper quantity of spawn the less used for garnishing the better Time one minute to simmer Average cost for this quantity twos Seasonable at any time Sufficient to serve with a small turbot a brill or salmon for six persons Note Melted butter made with milk No three hundred eighty will be found to answer very well for lobster sauce as by employing it a nice white colour will be obtained Less quantity than the above may be made by using a very small lobster to which add only one two pint of melted butter and season as above Where economy is desired the cream may be dispensed with and the remains of a cold lobster left from table may with a little care be converted into a very good sauce MAITRE D HOTEL BUTTER for putting into Broiled Fish just before it is sent to Table four hundred sixty five INGREDIENTS one four lb of butter two dessertspoonfuls of minced parsley salt and

seven with two oz of the above maitre d hotel butter stirred into it and just allowed to simmer for one minute will be found an excellent hot maitre d hotel sauce THE MAITRE D HOTEL The house steward of England is synonymous with the maitre d hotel of France and in ancient times amongst the Latins he was called procurator or major domo In Rome the slaves after they had procured the various articles necessary for the repasts of the day would return to the spacious kitchen laden with meat game sea fish vegetables fruit c Each one would then lay his basket at the feet of the major domo who would examine its contents and register them on his tablets placing in the pantry contiguous to the dining room those of the provisions which need no preparation and consigning the others to the more immediate care of the cooks MAITRE D HOTEL SAUCE HOT to serve with Calf s Head Boiled Eels and different Fish four hundred sixty six INGREDIENTS one slice of minced ham a few poultry trimmings two

vessels add them very gradually to the eggs continue stirring and rubbing the mixture with a wooden spoon as herein consists the secret of having a nice smooth sauce It cannot be stirred too frequently and it should be made in a very cool place or if ice is at hand it should be mixed over it When the vinegar and oil are well incorporated with the eggs add the stock and cream stirring all the time and it will then be ready for use For a fish Mayonnaise this sauce may be coloured with lobster spawn pounded and for poultry or meat where variety is desired a little parsley juice may be used to add to its appearance Cucumber Tarragon or any other flavoured vinegar may be substituted for plain where they are liked Average cost for this quantity sevend Sufficient for a small salad Note In mixing the oil and vinegar with the eggs put in first a few drops of oil and then a few drops of vinegar never adding a large quantity of either at one time By this means you can be more certain of the sauce not curdling Patience and practice let us add are two essentials for making this sauce good MINT SAUCE to serve with Roast Lamb four hundred sixty nine INGREDIENTS four dessertspoonfuls of chopped mint two dessertspoonfuls of pounded white sugar one four pint of vinegar Mode Wash the mint which should be young and fresh gathered free from grit pick the leaves from the stalks mince them very fine and put them into a tureen add the sugar and vinegar and stir till the former is dissolved This sauce is better by being made two or three hours before wanted for table as the vinegar then becomes impregnated with the flavour of the mint By many persons the above proportion of sugar would not be considered sufficient but as tastes vary we have given the quantity which we have found to suit the general palate Average cost threed Sufficient to serve with a middling sized joint of lamb Note Where green mint is scarce and not obtainable mint vinegar may be substituted for it and will be found very acceptable in early spring Illustration MINT MINT The common mint cultivated in our gardens is known as the Mentha viridis and is employed in different culinary processes being sometimes boiled with certain dishes and afterwards withdrawn It has an agreeable aromatic flavour and forms an ingredient in soups and sometimes is used in spring salads It is valuable as a stomachic and antispasmodic on which account it is generally served at table with pea soup Several of its species grow wild in low situations in the country MINT VINEGAR four hundred seventy INGREDIENTS Vinegar mint Mode Procure some nice fresh mint pick the leaves from the stalks and fill a bottle or jar with them Add vinegar to them until the bottle is full cover closely to exclude the air and let it

of ground black pepper one four oz of cayenne cauliflowers onions celery sliced cucumbers gherkins French beans nasturtiums capsicums Mode Have a large jar with a tightly fitting lid in which put as much vinegar as required reserving a little to mix the various powders to a smooth paste Put into a basin the mustard turmeric pepper and cayenne mix them with vinegar and stir well until no lumps remain add all the ingredients to the vinegar and mix well Keep this liquor in a warm place and thoroughly stir every morning for a month with a wooden spoon when it will be ready for the different vegetables to be added to it As these come into season have them gathered on a dry day and after merely wiping them with a cloth to free them from moisture put them into the pickle The cauliflowers it may be said must be divided into small bunches Put all these into the pickle raw and at the end of the season when there have been added as many of the vegetables as could be procured store it away in jars and tie over with bladder As none of the ingredients are boiled this pickle will not be fit to eat till twelve months have elapsed Whilst the pickle is being made keep a wooden spoon tied to the jar and its contents it may be repeated must be stirred every morning Seasonable Make the pickle liquor in May or June as the season arrives for the various vegetables to be picked MUSHROOM KETCHUP four hundred seventy two INGREDIENTS To each peck of mushrooms one two lb of salt to each quart of mushroom liquor one four oz of cayenne one two oz of allspice one two oz of ginger two blades of pounded mace Mode Choose full grown mushroom flaps and take care they are perfectly fresh gathered when the weather is tolerably dry for if they are picked during very heavy rain the ketchup from which they are made is liable to get musty and will not keep long Put a layer of them in a deep pan sprinkle salt over them and then another layer of mushrooms and so on alternately Let them remain for a few hours when break them up with the hand put them in a nice cool place for three days occasionally stirring and mashing them well to extract from them as much juice as possible Now measure the quantity of liquor without straining and to each quart allow the above proportion of spices c Put all into a stone jar cover it up very closely put it in a saucepan of boiling water set it over the fire and let it boil for three hours Have ready a nice clean stewpan turn into it the contents of the jar and let the whole simmer very gently for one two hour pour it into a jug where it should stand in a cool place till the next day then pour it off into another jug and strain it into very dry clean bottles and do not squeeze the mushrooms To each pint of ketchup add a few drops of brandy Be careful not to shake the contents but leave all the sediment behind in the jug cork well and either seal or rosin the cork so as perfectly to exclude the air When a very clear bright ketchup is wanted the liquor must be strained through a very fine hair sieve or flannel bag after it has been very gently poured off if the operation is not successful it must be repeated until you have quite a clear liquor It should be examined occasionally and if it is spoiling should be reboiled with a few peppercorns Seasonable from the beginning of September to the middle of October when this ketchup should be made Note This flavouring ingredient if genuine and well prepared is one of the most useful store sauces to the experienced cook and no trouble should be spared in its preparation Double ketchup is made by reducing the liquor to half the quantity for example one quart must be boiled down to one pint This goes farther than ordinary ketchup as so little is required to flavour a good quantity of gravy The sediment may also be bottled for immediate use and will be found to answer for flavouring thick soups or gravies HOW TO DISTINGUISH MUSHROOMS FROM TOADSTOOLS The cultivated mushroom known as Agaricus campestris may be distinguished from other poisonous kinds of fungi by its having pink or flesh coloured gills or under side and by its invariably having an agreeable smell which the toadstool has not When young mushrooms are like a small round button both the stalk and head being white As they grow larger they expand their heads by degrees into a flat form the gills underneath being at first of a pale flesh colour but becoming as they stand longer dark brown or blackish Nearly all the poisonous kinds are brown and have in general a rank and putrid smell Edible mushrooms are found in closely fed pastures but seldom grow in woods where most of the poisonous sorts are to be found TO DRY MUSHROOMS four hundred seventy three Mode Wipe them clean take away the brown part and peel off the skin lay them on sheets of paper to dry in a cool oven when they will shrivel considerably Keep them in paper bags which hang in a dry place When wanted for use put them into cold gravy bring them gradually to simmer and it will be found that they will regain nearly their usual size Illustration THE MUSHROOM THE MUSHROOM The cultivated or garden mushroom is a species of fungus which in England is considered the best and is there usually eaten The tribe however is numerous and a large proportion of them are poisonous hence it is always dangerous to make use of mushrooms gathered in their wild state In some parts of Europe as in Germany Russia and Poland many species grow wild and are used as food but in Britain two only are generally eaten These are mostly employed for the flavouring of dishes and are also dried and pickled CATSUP or KETCHUP is made from them by mixing spices and salt with their juice The young called buttons are the best for pickling when in the

October GROWTH OF THE MUSHROOM AND OTHER FUNGI The quick growth of the mushroom and other fungi is no less wonderful than the length of time they live and the numerous dangers they resist while they continue in the dormant state To spring up like a mushroom in a night is a scriptural mode of expressing celerity and this completely accords with all the observations which have been made concerning this curious class of plants mister Sowerby remarks I have often placed specimens of the Phallus caninus by a window over night while in the egg form and they have been fully grown by the morning

Seasonable Make this the same time as ketchup from the beginning of September to the middle of October NATURE OF THE MUSHROOM Locality has evidently a considerable influence on the nature of the juices of the mushroom for it has been discovered after fatal experience that some species which are perfectly harmless when raised in open meadows and pasturelands become virulently poisonous when they happen to grow in contact with stagnant water or putrescent animal and vegetable substances What the precise nature of the poison in fungi may be has not been accurately ascertained A VERY RICH

tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup or a small quantity of port wine HISTORY OF THE ONION It is not supposed that any variety of the onion is indigenous to Britain as when the large and mild roots imported from warmer climates have been cultivated in these islands a few years they deteriorate both in size and sweetness It is therefore most likely that this plant was first introduced into England from continental Europe and that it originally was produced in a southern climate and has gradually become acclimatized to a colder atmosphere See No one hundred thirty nine PICKLED ONIONS a

skimmer those at the bottom to the top and vice versa and let the milk and water run through the holes of the skimmer Remember the onions must never boil or if they do they will be good for nothing

Dolichos Soja The Chinese also manufacture it but that made by the Japanese is said to be the best All sorts of statements have been made respecting the very general adulteration of this article in

to take off their rawness Chop both these very fine add the bread seasoning and butter and work the whole together with the yolk of an egg when the stuffing will be ready for use It should be rather highly seasoned and the sage leaves should be very finely chopped Many cooks do not parboil the onions in the manner just stated but merely use them raw The stuffing then however is not nearly so mild

by the editress to whom it was given by an intimate friend noted for her salads SCARCITY OF SALADS IN ENGLAND Three centuries ago very few vegetables were cultivated in England and an author writing of the period of Henry VIII s reign tells us that neither salad nor carrots nor cabbages nor radishes nor any other comestibles of a like nature were grown in any part of the kingdom they came from Holland and Flanders We further learn that Queen Catharine herself with all her royalty could not procure a salad of English growth for her dinner The king was obliged to mend this sad state of affairs and send to Holland for a gardener in order to cultivate those pot herbs in the growth of which England is now perhaps not behind any other country in Europe Illustration THE OLIVE THE OLIVE AND OLIVE OIL This tree assumes a high degree of interest from the historical circumstances with which it is connected A leaf of it was brought into the ark by the dove when that vessel was still floating on the waters of the great deep and gave the first token that the deluge was subsiding Among the Greeks the prize of the victor in the Olympic games was a wreath of wild olive and the Mount of Olives is rendered familiar to our ears by its being mentioned in the Scriptures as near to Jerusalem The tree is indigenous in the north of Africa Syria and Greece and the Romans introduced it to Italy In Spain and the south of France it is now cultivated and although it grows in England its fruit does not ripen in the open air Both in Greece and Portugal the fruit is eaten in its ripe state but its taste is not agreeable to many palates To the Italian shepherd bread and olives with a little wine form a nourishing diet but in England olives are usually only introduced by way of dessert to destroy the taste of the viands which have been previously eaten that the flavour of the wine may be the better enjoyed There are three kinds of olives imported to London the French Spanish and Italian the first are from Provence and are generally accounted excellent the second are larger but more bitter and the last are from Lucca and are esteemed the best The oil extracted from olives called olive oil or salad oil is with the continentals in continual request more dishes being prepared with than without it we should imagine With us it is principally used in mixing a salad and when thus employed it tends to prevent fermentation and is an antidote against flatulency II five hundred seven INGREDIENTS four eggs one teaspoonful of mixed mustard one four teaspoonful of white pepper

beautiful evergreen was consecrated by the ancients to priests and heroes and used in their sacrifices A crown of bay was the earnestly desired reward for great enterprises and for the display of uncommon genius in oratory or writing It was more particularly sacred to Apollo because according to the fable the nymph Daphne was changed into a laurel tree The ancients believed too that the laurel had the power of communicating the gift of prophecy as well as poetic genius and when they wished to procure pleasant dreams would place a sprig under the pillow of their bed It was the symbol too of

to yield its assistance the same soil being adapted to the growth of both plants The stem of the pepper plant entwines round its support to a considerable height the flexile branches then droop downwards bearing at their extremities as well as at other parts spikes of green flowers which are followed by the pungent berries These hang in large bunches resembling in shape those of grapes but the fruit grows distinct each on a little stalk like currants Each berry contains a single seed of a globular form and brownish colour but which changes to a nearly black when dried and this is the

six we have described the gradual progress of mankind in the art of cookery the probability being that the human race for a long period lived wholly on fruits Man s means of attacking animals even if he had the desire of slaughtering them were very limited until he acquired the use of arms He however made weapons for himself and impelled by a carnivorous instinct made prey of the animals that surrounded him It is natural that man should seek to feed on flesh he has too small a stomach to be supported alone by fruit which has not sufficient nourishment to renovate him It is possible he might subsist on vegetables but their preparation needs the knowledge of art only to be obtained after the lapse of many centuries Man s first weapons were the branches of trees which were succeeded by bows and arrows and it is worthy of remark that these latter weapons have been found with the natives of all climates and latitudes It is singular how this idea presented itself to individuals so differently placed five hundred forty one BRILLAT SAVARIN says that raw flesh has but one inconvenience from its viscousness it attaches itself to the teeth He goes on to say that it is not however disagreeable but when seasoned with salt that it is easily digested He tells a story of a Croat captain whom he invited to dinner in eighteen fifteen during the occupation of Paris by the allied troops This officer was amazed at his host s preparations and said When we are campaigning and get hungry we knock over the first animal we find cut off a steak powder it with salt which we always have in the sabretasche put it under the saddle gallop over it for half a mile and then dine like princes Again of the huntsmen of Dauphiny it is said that when they are out shooting in September they take with them both pepper and salt If they kill a very fat bird they pluck and season it and after carrying it some time in their caps eat it This they declare is the best way of serving it up five hundred forty two SUBSEQUENTLY TO THE CROAT MODE which doubtless was in fashion in the earlier ages of the world fire was discovered This was an accident for fire is not although we are accustomed to call it so an element or spontaneous Many savage nations have been found utterly ignorant of it and many races had no other way of dressing their food than by exposing it to the rays of the sun five hundred forty three THE INHABITANTS OF THE MARIAN ISLANDS which were discovered in fifteen twenty one had no idea of fire Never was astonishment greater than theirs when they first saw it on the descent of Magellan the navigator on one of their isles At first they thought it a kind of animal that fixed itself to and fed upon wood Some of them who approached too near being burnt the rest were terrified and durst only look upon it at a distance They were afraid they said of being bit or lest that dreadful animal should wound with his violent respiration and dreadful breath for these were the first notions they formed of the heat and flame Such too probably were the notions the Greeks originally formed of them five hundred forty four FIRE HAVING BEEN DISCOVERED mankind endeavoured to make use of it for drying and afterwards for cooking their meat but they were a considerable time before they hit upon proper and commodious methods of employing it in the preparation of their food five hundred forty five MEAT THEN PLACED ON BURNING FUEL was found better than when raw it had more firmness was eaten with less difficulty and the ozmazome being condensed by the carbonization gave it a pleasing perfume and flavour Still however the meat cooked on the coal would become somewhat befouled certain portions of the fuel adhering to it This disadvantage was remedied by passing spits through it and placing it at a suitable height above the burning fuel Thus grilling was invented and it is well known that simple as is this mode of cookery yet all meat cooked in this way is richly and pleasantly flavoured In Homer s time the art of cookery had not advanced much beyond this for we read in the Iliad how the great Achilles and his friend Patroclus regaled the three Grecian leaders on bread wine and broiled meat It is noticeable too that Homer does not speak of boiled meat anywhere in his poems Later however the Jews coming out of their captivity in Egypt had made much greater progress They undoubtedly possessed kettles and in one of these Esau s mess of pottage for which he sold his birthright must have been prepared five hundred forty six HAVING THUS BRIEFLY TRACED A HISTORY OF GASTRONOMICAL PROGRESSES we will now proceed to describe the various methods of cooking meat and make a few observations on the chemical changes which occur in each of the operations five hundred forty seven IN THIS COUNTRY plain boiling roasting and baking are the usual methods of cooking animal food To explain the philosophy of these simple culinary operations we must advert to the effects that are produced by heat on the principal constituents of flesh When finely chopped mutton or beef is steeped for some time in a small quantity of clean water and then subjected to slight pressure the juice of the meat is extracted and there is left a white tasteless residue consisting chiefly of muscular fibres When this residue is heated to between one hundred fifty eight deg and one hundred seventy seven deg Fahrenheit the fibres shrink together and become hard and horny The influence of an elevated temperature on the soluble extract of flesh is not less remarkable When the watery infusion which contains all the savoury constituents of the meat is gradually heated it soon becomes turbid and when the temperature reaches one hundred thirty three deg flakes of whitish matter separate These flakes are albumen a substance precisely similar in all its properties to the white of egg see No one hundred one When the temperature of the watery extract is raised to one hundred fifty eight deg the colouring matter of the blood coagulates and the liquid which was originally tinged red by this substance is left perfectly clear and almost colourless When evaporated even at a gentle heat this residual liquid gradually becomes brown and acquires the flavour of roast meat five hundred forty eight THESE INTERESTING FACTS discovered in the laboratory throw a flood of light upon the mysteries of the kitchen The fibres of meat are surrounded by a liquid which contains albumen in its soluble state just as it exists in the unboiled egg During the operation of boiling or roasting this substance coagulates and thereby prevents the contraction and hardening of the fibres The tenderness of well cooked meat is consequently proportioned to the amount of albumen deposited in its substance Meat is underdone when it has been heated throughout only to the temperature of coagulating albumen it is thoroughly done when it has been heated through its whole mass to the temperature at which the colouring matter of the blood coagulates it is overdone when the heat has been continued long enough to harden the fibres five hundred forty nine THE JUICE OF FLESH IS WATER holding in solution many substances besides albumen which are of the highest possible value as articles of food In preparing meat for the table great care should be taken to prevent the escape of this precious juice as the succulence and sapidity of the meat depend on its retention The meat to be cooked should be exposed at first to a quick heat which immediately coagulates the albumen on and near the surface A kind of shell is thus formed which effectually retains the whole of the juice within the meat five hundred fifty DURING THE OPERATIONS OF BOILING BOASTING AND BAKING fresh beef and mutton when moderately fat lose according to Johnston on an average about In boiling In baking In roasting four lbs of beef lose one lb one lb three oz one lb five oz four lbs of mutton lose fourteen oz one lb four oz one lb six oz BAKING Illustration BAKING DISH five hundred fifty one THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROASTING MEAT AND BAKING IT may be generally described as consisting in the fact that in baking it the fumes caused by the operation are not carried off in the same way as occurs in roasting Much however of this disadvantage is obviated by the improved construction of modern ovens and of especially those in connection with the Leamington kitchener of which we give an engraving here and a full description of which will be seen at paragraph No sixty five with the prices at which they can be purchased of Messrs R and J Slack of the Strand With meat baked in the generality of ovens however which do not possess ventilators on the principle of this kitchener there is undoubtedly a peculiar taste which does not at all equal the flavour developed by roasting meat The chemistry of baking may be said to be the same as that described in roasting five hundred fifty two SHOULD THE OVEN BE VERY BRISK it will be found necessary to cover the joint with a piece of white paper to prevent the meat from being scorched and blackened outside before the heat can penetrate into the inside This paper should be removed half an hour before the time of serving dinner so that the joint may take a good colour five hundred fifty three BY MEANS OF A JAR many dishes which will be enumerated under their special heads may be economically prepared in the oven The principal of these are soup gravies jugged hare beef tea and this mode of cooking may be advantageously adopted with a ham which has previously been covered with a common crust of flour and water five hundred fifty four ALL DISHES PREPARED FOR BAKING should be more highly seasoned than when intended to be roasted There are some dishes which it may be said are at least equally well cooked in the oven as by the roaster thus a shoulder of mutton and baked potatoes a fillet or breast of veal a sucking pig a hare well basted will be received by connoisseurs as well when baked as if they had been roasted Indeed the baker s oven or the family oven may often as has been said be substituted for the cook and the spit with greater economy and convenience five hundred fifty five A BAKING DISH of which we give an engraving should not be less than six or seven inches deep so that the meat which of course cannot be basted can stew in its own juices In the recipe for each dish full explanations concerning any special points in relation to it will be given BOILING five hundred fifty six BOILING or the preparation of meat by hot water though one of the easiest processes in cookery requires skilful management Boiled meat should be tender savoury and full of its own juice or natural gravy but through the carelessness and ignorance of cooks it is too often sent to table hard tasteless and innutritious To insure a successful result in boiling flesh the heat of the fire must be judiciously regulated the proper quantity of water must be kept up in the pot and the scum which rises to the surface must be carefully removed five hundred fifty seven MANY WRITERS ON COOKERY assert that the meat to be boiled should be put into cold water and that the pot should be heated gradually but Liebig the highest authority on all matters connected with the chemistry of food has shown that meat so treated loses some of its most nutritious constituents If the flesh says the great chemist be introduced into the boiler when the water is in a state of brisk ebullition and if the boiling be kept up for a few minutes and the pot then placed in a warm place so that the temperature of the water is kept at one hundred fifty eight deg to one hundred sixty five deg we have the united conditions for giving to the flesh the qualities which best fit it for being eaten When a piece of meat is plunged into boiling water the albumen which is near the surface immediately coagulates forming an envelope which prevents the escape of the internal juice and most effectually excludes the water which by mixing with this juice would render the meat insipid Meat treated thus is juicy and well flavoured when cooked as it retains most of its savoury constituents On the other hand if the piece of meat be set on the fire with cold water and this slowly heated to boiling the flesh undergoes a loss of soluble and nutritious substances while as a matter of course the soup becomes richer in these matters The albumen is gradually dissolved from the surface to the centre the fibre loses more or less its quality of shortness or tenderness and becomes hard and tough the thinner the piece of meat is the greater is its loss of savoury constituents In order to obtain well flavoured and eatable meat we must relinquish the idea of making good soup from it as that mode of boiling which yields the best soup gives the driest toughest and most vapid meat Slow boiling whitens the meat and we suspect that it is on this account that it is in such favour with the cooks The wholesomeness of food is however a matter of much greater moment than the appearance it presents on the table It should be borne in mind that the whiteness of meat that has been boiled slowly is produced by the loss of some important alimentary properties five hundred fifty eight THE OBJECTIONS WE HAVE RAISED to the practice of putting meat on the fire in cold water apply with equal force to the practice of soaking meat before cooking it which is so strongly recommended by some cooks Fresh meat ought never to be soaked as all its most nutritive constituents are soluble in water Soaking however is an operation that cannot be entirely dispensed with in the preparation of animal food Salted and dried meats require to be soaked for some time in water before they are cooked five hundred fifty nine FOR BOILING MEAT the softer the water is the better When spring water is boiled the chalk which gives to it the quality of hardness is precipitated This chalk stains the meat and communicates to it an unpleasant earthy taste When nothing but hard water can be procured it should be softened by boiling it for an hour or two before it is used for culinary purposes five hundred sixty THE FIRE MUST BE WATCHED with great attention during the operation of boiling so that its heat may be properly regulated As a rule the pot should be kept in a simmering state a result which cannot be attained without vigilance five hundred sixty one THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH WATER BOILS under usual circumstances is two hundred twelve deg Fahr Water does not become hotter after it has begun to boil however long or with whatever violence the boiling is continued This fact is of great importance in cookery and attention to it will save much fuel Water made to boil in a gentle way by the application of a moderate heat is just as hot as when it is made to boil on a strong fire with the greatest possible violence When once water has been brought to the boiling point the fire may be considerably reduced as a very gentle heat will suffice to keep the water at its highest temperature five hundred sixty two THE SCUM WHICH RISES to the surface of the pot during the operation of boiling must be carefully removed otherwise it will attach itself to the meat and thereby spoil its appearance The cook must not neglect to skim during the whole process though by far the greater part of the scum rises at first The practice of wrapping meat in a cloth may be dispensed with if the skimming be skillfully managed If the scum be removed as fast as it rises the meat will be cooked clean and pure and come out of the vessel in which it was boiled much more delicate and firm than when cooked in a cloth five hundred sixty three WHEN TAKEN FROM THE POT the meat must be wiped with a clean cloth or what will be found more convenient a sponge previously dipped in water and wrung dry The meat should not be allowed to stand a moment longer than necessary as boiled meat as well as roasted cannot be eaten too hot five hundred sixty four THE TIME ALLOWED FOR THE OPERATION OF BOILING must be regulated according to the size and quality of the meat As a general rule twenty minutes reckoning from the moment when the boiling commences may be allowed for every pound of meat All the best authorities however agree in this that the longer the boiling the more perfect the operation five hundred sixty five A FEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE NUTRITIVE VALUE OF SALTED MEAT may be properly introduced in this place Every housewife knows that dry salt in contact with fresh meat gradually becomes fluid brine The application of salt causes the fibres of the meat to contract and the juice to flow out from its pores as much as one third of the juice of the meat is often forced out in this manner Now as this juice is pure extract of meat containing albumen osmazome and other valuable principles it follows that meat which has been preserved by the action of salt can never have the nutritive properties of fresh meat five hundred sixty six THE VESSELS USED FOR BOILING should be made of cast iron well tinned within and provided with closely fitting lids They must be kept scrupulously clean otherwise they will render the meat cooked in them unsightly and unwholesome Copper pans if used at all should be reserved for operations that are performed with rapidity as by long contact with copper food may become dangerously contaminated The kettle in which a joint is dressed should be large enough to allow room for a good supply of water if the meat be cramped and be surrounded with but little water it will be stewed not boiled five hundred sixty seven IN STEWING IT IS NOT REQUISITE to have so great a heat as in boiling A gentle simmering in a small quantity of water so that the meat is stewed almost in its own juices is all that is necessary It is a method much used on the continent and is wholesome and economical Illustration BOILING POT Illustration STEWPAN Two useful culinary vessels are represented above One is a boiling pot in which large joints may be boiled the other is a stewpan with a closely fitting lid to which is attached a long handle so that the cover can be removed without scalding the fingers Illustration HOT PLATE five hundred sixty eight THE HOT PLATE is a modern improvement on the old kitchen ranges being used for boiling and stewing It is a plate of cast iron having a closed fire burning beneath it by which it is thoroughly well heated On this plate are set the various saucepans stewpans c and by this convenient and economical method a number of dishes may be prepared at one time The culinary processes of braising and stewing are in this manner rendered more gradual and consequently the substance acted on becomes more tender and the gravy is not so much reduced BROILING Illustration REVOLVING GRIDIRON five hundred sixty nine GENERALLY SPEAKING small dishes only are prepared by this mode of cooking amongst these the beef steak and mutton chop of the solitary English diner may be mentioned as celebrated all the world over Our beef steak indeed has long crossed the Channel and with a view of pleasing the Britons there is in every carte at every French restaurant by the side of a la Marengo and a la Mayonnaise bifteck d Angleterre In order to succeed in a broil the cook must have a bright clear fire so that the surface of the meat may be quickly heated The result of this is the same as that obtained in roasting namely that a crust so to speak is formed outside and thus the juices of the meat are retained The appetite of an invalid so difficult to minister to is often pleased with a broiled dish as the flavour and sapidity of the meat are so well preserved five hundred seventy THE UTENSILS USED FOR BROILING need but little description The common gridiron for which see engraving at No sixty eight is the same as it has been for ages past although some little variety has been introduced into its manufacture by the addition of grooves to the bars by means of which the liquid fat is carried into a small trough One point it is well to bear in mind viz that the gridiron should be kept in a direction slanting towards the cook so that as little fat as possible may fall into the fire It has been observed that broiling is the most difficult manual office the general cook has to perform and one that requires the most unremitting attention for she may turn her back upon the stewpan or the spit but the gridiron can never be left with impunity The revolving gridiron shown in the engraving possesses some advantages of convenience which will be at once apparent FRYING Illustration SAUTE PAN five hundred seventy one THIS VERY FAVOURITE MODE OF COOKING may be accurately described as boiling in fat or oil Substances dressed in this way are generally well received for they introduce an agreeable variety possessing as they do a peculiar flavour By means of frying cooks can soon satisfy many requisitions made on them it being a very expeditious mode of preparing dishes for the table and one which can be employed when the fire is not sufficiently large for the purposes of roasting and boiling The great point to be borne in mind in frying is that the liquid must be hot enough to act instantaneously as all the merit of this culinary operation lies in the invasion of the boiling liquid which carbonizes or burns at the very instant of the immersion of the body placed in it It may be ascertained if the fat is heated to the proper degree by cutting a piece of bread and dipping it in the frying pan for five or six seconds and if it be firm and of a dark brown when taken out put in immediately what you wish to prepare if it be not let the fat be heated until of the right temperature This having been effected moderate the fire so that the action may not be too hurried and that by a continuous heat the juices of the substance may be preserved and its flavour enhanced five hundred seventy two THE PHILOSOPHY OF FRYING consists in this that liquids subjected to the action of fire do not all receive the same quantity of heat Being differently constituted in their nature they possess different capacities for caloric Thus you may with impunity dip your finger in boiling spirits of wine you would take it very quickly from boiling brandy yet more rapidly from water whilst the effects of the most rapid immersion in boiling oil need not be told As a consequence of this heated fluids act differently on the sapid bodies presented to them Those put in water dissolve and are reduced to a soft mass the result being bouillon stock c see No one hundred three Those substances on the contrary treated with oil harden assume a more or less deep colour and are finally carbonized The reason of these different results is that in the first instance water dissolves and extracts the interior juices of the alimentary substances placed in it whilst in the second the juices are preserved for they are insoluble in oil five hundred seventy three IT IS TO BE ESPECIALLY REMEMBERED in connection with frying that all dishes fried in fat should be placed before the fire on a piece of blotting paper or sieve reversed and there left for a few minutes so that any superfluous greasy moisture may be removed five hundred seventy four THE UTENSILS USED FOR THE PURPOSES OF FRYING are confined to frying pans although these are of various sizes and for small and delicate dishes such as collops fritters pancakes c the saute pan of which we give an engraving is used COOKING BY GAS Illustration GAS STOVE five hundred seventy five GAS COOKING can scarcely now be considered a novelty many establishments both small and large have been fitted with apparatus for cooking by this mode which undoubtedly exhibits some advantages Thus the heat may be more regularly supplied to the substance cooking and the operation is essentially a clean one because there can be no cinders or other dirt to be provided for Some labour and attention necessary too with a coal fire or close stove may be saved and besides this it may perhaps be said that culinary operations are reduced by this means to something like a certainty five hundred seventy six THERE ARE HOWEVER WE THINK MANY OBJECTIONS to this mode of cooking more especially when applied to small domestic establishments For instance the ingenious machinery necessary for carrying it out requires cooks perfectly conversant with its use and if the gas when the cooking operations are finished be not turned off there will be a large increase in the cost of cooking instead of the economy which it has been supposed to bring For large establishments such as some of the immense London warehouses where a large number of young men have to be catered for daily it may be well adapted as it is just possible that a slight increase in the supply of gas necessary for a couple of joints may serve equally to cook a dozen dishes ROASTING five hundred seventy seven OF THE VARIOUS METHODS OF PREPARING MEAT ROASTING is that which most effectually preserves its nutritive qualities Meat is roasted by being exposed to the direct influence of the fire This is done by placing the meat before an open grate and keeping it in motion to prevent the scorching on any particular part When meat is properly roasted the outer layer of its albumen is coagulated and thus presents a barrier to the exit of the juice In roasting meat the heat must be strongest at first and it should then be much reduced To have a good juicy roast therefore the fire must be red and vigorous at the very commencement of the operation In the most careful roasting some of the juice is squeezed out of the meat this evaporates on the surface of the meat and gives it a dark brown colour a rich lustre and a strong aromatic taste Besides these effects on the albumen and the expelled juice roasting converts the cellular tissue of the meat into gelatine and melts the fat out of the fat cells five hundred seventy eight IF A SPIT is used to support the meat before the fire it should be kept quite bright Sand and water ought to be used to scour it with for brickdust and oil may give a disagreeable taste to the meat When well scoured it must be wiped quite dry with a clean cloth and in spitting the meat the prime parts should be left untouched so as to avoid any great escape of its juices five hundred seventy nine KITCHENS IN LARGE ESTABLISHMENTS are usually fitted with what are termed smoke jacks By means of these several spits if required may be turned at the same time This not being of course necessary in smaller establishments a roasting apparatus more economical in its consumption of coal is more frequently in use Illustration BOTTLE JACK WITH WHEEL AND HOOK five hundred eighty THE BOTTLE JACK of which we here give an illustration with the wheel and hook and showing the precise manner of using it is now commonly used in many kitchens This consists of a spring inclosed in a brass cylinder and requires winding up before it is used and sometimes also during the operation of roasting The joint is fixed to an iron hook which is suspended by a chain connected with a wheel and which in its turn is connected with the bottle jack Beneath it stands the dripping pan which we have also engraved together with the basting ladle the use of which latter should not be spared as there can be no good roast without good basting Spare the rod and spoil the child might easily be paraphrased into Spare the basting and spoil the meat If the joint is small and light and so turns unsteadily this may be remedied by fixing to the wheel one of the kitchen weights Sometimes this jack is fixed inside a screen but there is this objection to this apparatus that the meat cooked in it resembles the flavour of baked meat This is derived from its being so completely surrounded with the tin that no sufficient current of air gets to it It will be found preferable to make use of a common meat screen such as is shown in the woodcut This contains shelves for warming plates and dishes and with this the reflection not being so powerful and more air being admitted to the joint the roast may be very excellently cooked Illustration DRIPPING PAN AND BASTING LADLE five hundred eighty one IN STIRRING THE FIRE or putting fresh coals on it the dripping pan should always be drawn back so that there may be no danger of the coal cinders or ashes falling down into it five hundred eighty two UNDER EACH PARTICULAR RECIPE there is stated the time required for roasting each joint but as a general rule it may be here given that for every pound of meat in ordinary sized joints a quarter of an hour may be allotted Illustration HEAT SCREEN five hundred eighty three WHITE MEATS AND THE MEAT OF YOUNG ANIMALS require to be very well roasted both to be pleasant to the palate and easy of digestion Thus veal pork and lamb should be thoroughly done to the centre five hundred eighty four MUTTON AND BEEF on the other hand do not generally speaking require to be so thoroughly done and they should be dressed to the point that in carving them the gravy should just run but not too freely Of course in this as in most other dishes the tastes of individuals vary and there are many who cannot partake with satisfaction of any joint unless it is what others would call overdressed Illustration Illustration QUADRUPEDS CHAPTER XII GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON QUADRUPEDS five hundred eighty five BY THE GENERAL ASSENT OF MANKIND THE EMPIRE OF NATURE has been divided into three kingdoms the first consisting of minerals the second of vegetables and the third of animals The Mineral Kingdom comprises all substances which are without those organs necessary to locomotion and the due performance of the functions of life They are composed of the accidental aggregation of particles which under certain circumstances take a constant and regular figure but which are more frequently found without any definite conformation They also occupy the interior parts of the earth as well as compose those huge masses by which we see the land in some parts guarded against the encroachments of the sea The Vegetable Kingdom covers and beautifies the earth with an endless variety of form and colour It consists of organized bodies but destitute of the power of locomotion They are nourished by means of roots they breathe by means of leaves and propagate by means of seed dispersed within certain limits The Animal Kingdom consists of sentient beings that enliven the external parts of the earth They possess the powers of voluntary motion respire air and are forced into action by the cravings of hunger or the parching of thirst by the instincts of animal passion or by pain Like the vegetable kingdom they are limited within the boundaries of certain countries by the conditions of climate and soil and some of the species prey upon each other Linnaeus has divided them into six classes Mammalia Birds Fishes Amphibious Animals Insects and Worms The three latter do not come within the limits of our domain of fishes we have already treated of birds we shall treat and of mammalia we will now treat five hundred eighty six THIS CLASS OF ANIMALS embraces all those that nourish their young by means of lacteal glands or teats and are so constituted as to have a warm or red blood In it the whale is placed an order which from external habits has usually been classed with the fishes but although this animal exclusively inhabits the water and is supplied with fins it nevertheless exhibits a striking alliance to quadrupeds It has warm blood and produces its young alive it nourishes them with milk and for that purpose is furnished with teats It is also supplied with lungs and two auricles and two ventricles to the heart all of which bring it still closer into an alliance with the quadrupedal species of the animal kingdom five hundred eighty seven THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAMMALIA have been frequently noticed The bodies of nearly the whole species are covered with hair a kind of clothing which is both soft and warm little liable to injury and bestowed in proportion to the necessities of the animal and the nature of the climate it inhabits In all the higher orders of animals the head is the principal seat of the organs of sense It is there that the eyes the ears the nose and the mouth are placed Through the last they receive their nourishment In it are the teeth which in most of the mammalia are used not only for the mastication of food but as weapons of offence They are inserted into two movable bones called jaws and the front teeth are so placed that their sharp edges may easily be brought in contact with their food in order that its fibres may readily be separated Next to these on each side are situated the canine teeth or tusks which are longer than the other teeth and being pointed are used to tear the food In the back jaws are placed another form of teeth called grinders These are for masticating the food and in those animals that live on vegetables they are flattened at the top but in carnivora their upper surfaces are furnished with sharp pointed protuberances From the numbers form and disposition of the teeth the various genera of quadrupeds have been arranged The nose is a cartilaginous body pierced with two holes which are called nostrils Through these the animal is affected by the sense of smell and in some it is prominent whilst in others it is flat compressed turned upwards or bent downwards In beasts of prey it is frequently longer than the lips and in some other animals it is elongated into a movable trunk or proboscis whilst in the rhinoceros tribe it is armed with a horn The eyes of quadrupeds are generally defended by movable lids on the outer margins of which are fringes of hair called eyelashes The opening of the pupil is in general circular but to some species as in those of the Cat and Hare it is contracted into a perpendicular line whilst in the Horse the Ox and a few others it forms a transverse bar The ears are openings generally accompanied with a cartilage which defends and covers them called the external ears In water animals the latter are wanting sound in them being transmitted merely through orifices in the head which have the name of auditory holes The most defenceless animals are extremely delicate in the sense of hearing as are likewise most beasts of prey Most of the mammiferous animals walk on four feet which at the extremities are usually divided into toes or fingers In some however the feet end in a single corneous substance called a hoof The toes of a few end in broad flat nails and of most others in pointed claws Some again have the toes connected by a membrane which is adapted to those that are destined to pass a considerable portion of their lives in water Others again as in the Bat have the digitations of the anterior feet greatly elongated the intervening space being filled by a membrane which extends round the hinder legs and tail and by means of which they are enabled to rise into the air In Man the hand alone comprises fingers separate free and flexible but Apes and some other kinds of animals have fingers both to the hands and feet These therefore are the only animals that can hold movable objects in a single hand Others such as Rats and Squirrels have the fingers sufficiently small and flexible to enable them to pick up objects but they are compelled to hold them in both hands Others again have the toes shorter and must rest on the fore feet as is the case with dogs and cats when they wish to hold a substance firmly on the ground with their paws There are still others that have their toes united and drawn under the skin or enveloped in corneous hoofs and are thereby enabled to exercise no prehensile power whatever five hundred eighty eight ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN AND END OF NATURE mammiferous animals are calculated when arrived at maturity to subsist on various kinds of food some to live wholly upon flesh others upon grain herbs or fruits but in their infant state milk is the appropriate food of the whole That this food may never fail them it is universally ordained that the young should no sooner come into the world than the milk should flow in abundance into the members with which the mother is supplied for the secretion of that nutritious fluid By a wonderful instinct of Nature too the young animal almost as soon as it has come into life searches for the teat and knows perfectly at the first how by the process of suction it will be able to extract the fluid necessary to its existence five hundred eighty nine IN THE GENERAL ECONOMY OF NATURE this class of animals seems destined to preserve a constant equilibrium in the number of animated beings that hold their existence on the surface of the earth To man they are immediately useful in various ways Some of their bodies afford him food their skin shoes and their fleece clothes Some of them unite with him in participating the dangers of combat with an enemy and others assist him in the chase in exterminating wilder sorts or banishing them from the haunts of civilization Many indeed are injurious to him but most of them in some shape or other he turns to his service Of these there is none he has made more subservient to his purposes than the common ox of which there is scarcely a part that he has not been able to convert into some useful purpose Of the horns he makes drinking vessels knife handles combs and boxes and when they are softened by means of boiling water he fashions them into transparent plates for lanterns This invention is ascribed to King Alfred who is said to have been the first to use them to preserve his candle time measures from the wind Glue is made of the cartilages gristles and the finer pieces of the parings and cuttings of the hides Their bone is a cheap substitute for ivory The thinnest of the calf skins are manufactured into vellum Their blood is made the basis of Prussian blue and saddlers use a fine sort of thread prepared from their sinews The hair is used in various valuable manufactures the suet fat and tallow are moulded into candles and the milk and cream of the cow yield butter and cheese Thus is every part of this animal valuable to man who has spared no pains to bring it to the highest state of perfection Illustration SHORT HORN COW Illustration SHORT HORN BULL five hundred ninety AMONG THE VARIOUS BREEDS OF THE OX upon which man has bestowed his highest powers of culture there is now none takes a higher place than that known by the name of Short Horns From the earliest ages Great Britain has been distinguished for the excellence of her native breeds of cattle and there are none in England that have obtained greater celebrity than those which have this name and which originated about seventy years ago on the banks of the Tees Thence they have spread into the valleys of the Tweed thence to the Lothians in Scotland and southward into the fine pastures of England They are now esteemed the most profitable breed of cattle as there is no animal which attains sooner to maturity and none that supplies meat of a superior quality The value of some of the improved breeds is something enormous At the sale of mister Charles Colling a breeder in Yorkshire in eighteen ten his bull Comet sold for one thousand guineas At the sale of Earl Spencer s herd in eighteen forty six one hundred four cows heifers and calves with nineteen bulls fetched Leight thousand four hundred sixty eight fives being an average of Lsixty eight seventeens apiece The value of such animals is scarcely to be estimated by those who are unacquainted with the care with which they are tended and with the anxious attention which is paid to the purity of their breed A modern writer well acquainted with this subject says There are now at least five hundred herds large and small in this kingdom and from six to seven thousand head registered every alternate year in the herd book The necessity for thus recording the breeds is greater than might at first sight be imagined as it tends directly to preserve the character of the cattle while it sometimes adds to the value and reputation of the animal thus entered Besides many of the Americans and large purchasers for the foreign market will not look at an animal without the breeder has taken care to qualify him for such reference Of short horned stock there is annually sold from Lforty thousand to Lfifty thousand worth by public auction independent of the vast numbers disposed of by private contract The brood is highly prized in Belgium Prussia France Italy and Russia it is imported into most of the British colonies and is greatly esteemed both for its meat and its dairy produce wherever it is known The quickness with which it takes on flesh and the weight which it frequently makes are well known but we may mention that it is not uncommon to tee steers of from four to five years old realize a weight of from eight hundred to one thousand lbs Such animals command from the butcher from Lthirty to Lforty per head according to the quality whilst others of two or three years old and of course of less Weight bring as much as Ltwenty apiece Illustration LONG HORN BULL Illustration LONG HORN COW five hundred ninety one LONG HORNS This is the prevailing breed in our midland counties and in Ireland but they are greatly inferior to the short horns and are fast being supplanted by them Even where they have been cultivated with the nicest care and brought to the greatest perfection they are inferior to the others and must ultimately be driven from the farm Illustration ALDERNEY COW Illustration ALDERNEY BULL five hundred ninety two THE ALDERNEY Among the dairy breeds of England the Alderney takes a prominent place not on account of the quantity of milk which it yields but on account of the excellent quality of the cream and butter which are produced from it Its docility is marvellous and in appearance it greatly resembles the Ayrshire breed of Scotland the excellence of which is supposed to be in some degree derived from a mixture of the Alderney blood with that breed The distinction between them however lies both in the quantity and quality of the milk which they severally produce that of the Alderney being rich in quality and that of the Ayrshire abundant in quantity The merit of the former however ends with its milk for as a grazer it is worthless Illustration GALLOWAY BULL Illustration GALLOWAY COW five hundred ninety three SCOTTISH BREEDS Of these the Kyloe which belongs to the Highlands of Scotland the Galloway which has been called the Kyloe without horns and the Ayrshire are the breeds most celebrated The first has kept his place and on account of the compactness of his form and the excellent quality of his flesh he is a great favourite with butchers who have a select family trade It is alike unsuitable for the dairy and the arable farm but in its native Highlands it attains to great perfection thriving upon the scanty and coarse herbage which it gathers on the sides of the mountains The Galloway has a larger frame and when fattened makes excellent beef But it has given place to the short horns in its native district where turnip husbandry is pursued with advantage The Ayrshire is peculiarly adapted for the dairy and for the abundance of its milk cannot be surpassed in its native district In this it stands unrivalled and there is no other breed capable of converting the produce of a poor soil into such fine butter and cheese It is difficult to fatten however and its beef is of a coarse quality We have chosen these as among the principal representative breeds of the ox species but there are other breeds which at all events have a local if not a general celebrity Illustration SIDE OF BEEF SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS five hundred ninety four The general Mode of Slaughtering Oxen in this country is by striking them a smart blow with a hammer or poleaxe on the head a little above the eyes By this means when the blow is skilfully given the beast is brought down at one blow and to prevent recovery a cane is generally inserted by which the spinal cord is perforated which instantly deprives the ox of all sensation of pain In Spain and some other countries on the continent it is also usual to deprive oxen of life by the operation of pithing or dividing the spinal cord in the neck close to the back part of the head This is in effect the same mode as is practised in the celebrated Spanish bull fights by the matador and it is instantaneous in depriving the animal of sensation if the operator be skilful We hope and believe that those men whose disagreeable duty it is to slaughter the beasts of the field to provide meat for mankind inflict as little punishment and cause as little suffering as possible five hundred ninety five THE MANNER IN WHICH A SIDE OF BEEF is cut up in London is shown in the engraving on this page In the metropolis on account of the large number of its population possessing the means to indulge in the best of everything the demand for the most delicate joints of meat is great the price at the same time being much higher for these than for the other parts The consequence is that in London the carcass is there divided so as to obtain the greatest quantity of meat on the most esteemed joints In many places however where from a greater equality in the social condition and habits of the inhabitants the demand and prices for the different parts of the carcasses are more equalized there is not the same reason for the butcher to cut the best joints so large five hundred ninety six THE MEAT ON THOSE PARTS OF THE ANIMAL in which the muscles are least called into action is most tender and succulent as for instance along the back from the rump to the hinder part of the shoulder whilst the limbs shoulder and neck are the toughest driest and least esteemed five hundred ninety seven THE NAMES OF THE SEVERAL JOINTS in the hind and fore quarters of a side of beef and the purposes for which they are used are as follows HIND QUARTER one Sirloin The two sirloins cut together in one joint form a baron this when roasted is the famous national dish of Englishmen at entertainments on occasion of rejoicing two Rump the finest part for steaks three Aitch bone boiling piece four Buttock prime boiling piece five Mouse round boiling or stewing six Hock stewing seven Thick flank cut with the udder fat primest boiling piece eight Thin flank boiling FORE QUARTER nine Five ribs called the fore rib This is considered the primest roasting piece ten Four ribs called the middle rib greatly esteemed by housekeepers as the most economical joint for roasting eleven Two ribs called the chuck rib used for second quality of steaks twelve Leg of mutton piece the muscles of the shoulder dissected from the breast thirteen Brisket or breast used for boiling after being salted fourteen Neck clod and sticking piece used for soups gravies stocks pies and mincing for sausages fifteen Shin stewing The following is a classification of the qualities of meat according to the several joints of beef when cut up in the London manner First class includes the sirloin with the kidney suet one the rump steak piece two the fore rib nine Second class The buttock four the thick flank seven the middle rib ten Third class The aitch bone three the mouse round five the thin flank eight the chuck eleven the leg of mutton piece twelve the brisket

About two lbs of cold roast beef two small onions one large carrot or two small ones one turnip a small bunch of savoury herbs salt and pepper to taste four tablespoonfuls of gravy three tablespoonfuls of ale crust or mashed potatoes Mode Cut the beef in slices allowing a small amount of fat to each slice place a layer of this in the bottom of a pie dish with a portion of the onions

time BEEF The quality of beef depends on various circumstances such as the age the sex the breed of the animal and also on the food upon which it has been raised Bull beef is in general dry and tough and by no means possessed of an agreeable flavour whilst the flesh of the ox is not only highly nourishing and digestible but if not too old extremely agreeable The flesh of the cow is also nourishing but it is not so agreeable as that of the ox although that of a heifer is held in high estimation The flesh of the smaller breeds is much sweeter than that of the larger which is best when the animal is about seven years old That of the smaller breeds is best at about five years and that of the cow can hardly be eaten too young BAKED BEEF STEAK PUDDING six hundred INGREDIENTS six oz of flour two

add the port wine just let it boil pour it over the beef and it is ready to serve Great care must be taken that this does not boil fast or the meat will be tough and tasteless it should only just

perfect health adheres firmly to the bones Beef of the best quality is of a deep red colour and when the animal has approached maturity and been well fed the lean is intermixed with fat giving it the mottled appearance which is so much esteemed It is also full of juice which resembles in colour claret wine The fat of the best beef is of a firm and waxy consistency of a colour resembling that of the finest grass butter bright in appearance neither greasy nor friable to the touch but moderately unctuous in a medium degree between the last mentioned properties BEEF STEAKS AND OYSTER SAUCE six hundred three INGREDIENTS three dozen oysters ingredients for oyster sauce see No four hundred ninety two two lbs of rump steak seasoning to taste of pepper and salt Mode Make the oyster sauce by recipe No four hundred ninety two and when that is ready put it by the side of the fire but do not let it keep boiling Have the steaks cut of an equal thickness broil them over a very clear fire

yolk of an egg make a hole in the top of the crust and bake in a hot oven for about one one two hour Time In a hot oven one one two hour Average cost for this size threes sixd Sufficient for six or eight persons Seasonable at any time Note Beef steak pies may be flavoured in various ways with oysters and their liquor mushrooms minced onions c For family pies suet may be used instead of butter or lard for the crust and clarified beef dripping answers very well where economy is an object Pieces of underdone roast or boiled meat may in pies be used very advantageously but always remove the bone from pie meat unless it be chicken or game We have directed that the meat shall be cut smaller than is usually the case for on trial we have found it much more tender more easily helped and with more gravy than when put into the dish in one or two large steaks Illustration SHERRY PUDDING DISH BEEF STEAK AND KIDNEY PUDDING six hundred five INGREDIENTS two lbs of rump steak two kidneys seasoning to taste of salt and black pepper suet crust made with milk see Pastry in the proportion of six oz of suet to each one lb of flour Mode Procure some tender rump steak that which has been hung a little time and divide it into pieces about an inch square and cut each kidney into eight pieces Line the dish of which we have given an engraving with crust made with suet and flour in the above proportion leaving a small piece of crust to overlap the edge Then cover the bottom with a portion of the steak and a few pieces of kidney season with salt and pepper some add a little flour to thicken the gravy but it is not necessary and then add another layer of steak kidney and seasoning Proceed in this manner till the dish is full when pour in sufficient water to come within two inches of the top of the basin Moisten the edges of the crust cover the pudding over press the two crusts together that the gravy may not escape and turn up the overhanging paste Wring out a cloth in hot water flour it and tie up the pudding put it into boiling water and let it boil for at least four hours If the water diminishes always replenish with some hot in a jug as the pudding should be kept covered all the time and not allowed to stop boiling When the cloth is removed cut out a round piece in the top of the crust to prevent the pudding bursting and send it to table in the basin either in an ornamental dish or with a napkin pinned round it Serve quickly Time For a pudding with two lbs of steak and two kidneys allow four hours Average cost twos eightd Sufficient for six persons Seasonable all the year but more suitable in winter Note Beef steak pudding may be very much enriched by adding a few oysters or mushrooms The above recipe was contributed to this work by a Sussex lady in which county the inhabitants are noted for their savoury puddings It differs from the general way of making them as the meat is cut up into very small pieces and the basin is differently shaped on trial this pudding will be found far nicer and more full of gravy than when laid in large pieces in the dish BAD MEAT In the flesh of animals slaughtered whilst suffering acute inflammation or fever the hollow fibres or capillaries as they are called which form the substance of the lyer are filled with congested and unassimilated animal fluid which from its impurity gives the lyer a dark colour and produces a tendency to rapid putrefaction In a more advanced stage of such disease serous and sometimes purulent matter is formed in the cellular tissues between the muscles of the flesh and when such is the case nothing can be more poisonous than such abominable carrion In the flesh of animals killed whilst under the influence of any disease of an emaciating effect the lyer adheres but slightly to the bones with its fibres contracted and dry and the little fat that there may be is friable and shrunk within its integuments The flesh of animals slaughtered whilst under considerable depression of vital energy as from previous bleeding has a diminished tendency to stiffen after death the feebleness of this tendency being in proportion to the degree of depression It presents also an unnatural blue or pallid appearance has a faint and slightly sour smell and soon becomes putrid When an animal has died otherwise than by slaughtering its flesh is flaccid and clammy emits a peculiar faint and disagreeable smell and it need scarcely be added spontaneous decomposition proceeds very rapidly BEEF STEAKS WITH FRIED POTATOES or BIFTEK AUX POMMES DE TERRE a la mode Francaise six hundred six INGREDIENTS two lbs of steak eight potatoes one four lb of butter salt and pepper to taste one teaspoonful of minced herbs Mode Put the butter into a frying or saute pan set it over the fire and let it get very hot peel and cut the potatoes into long thin slices put them into the hot butter and fry them till of a nice brown colour Now broil the steaks over a bright clear fire turning them frequently that every part may be equally done as they should not be thick five minutes will broil them Put the herbs and seasoning in the butter the potatoes were fried in pour it under the steak and place the fried potatoes round as a garnish To have this dish in perfection a portion of the fillet of the sirloin should be used as the meat is generally so much more tender than that of the rump and the steaks should be cut about one three of an inch in thickness Time five minutes to broil the steaks and about the same time to fry the potatoes Average cost ones per lb Sufficient for four persons Seasonable all the year but not so good in warm weather as the meat cannot hang to get tender Illustration AITCH BONE OF BEEF BOILED AITCH BONE OF BEEF six hundred seven INGREDIENTS Beef water Mode After this joint has been in salt five or six days it will be ready for use and will not take so long boiling as a round for it is not so solid Wash the meat and if too salt soak it for a few hours changing the water once or twice till the required freshness is obtained Put into a saucepan or boiling pot sufficient water to cover the meat set it over the fire and when it boils plunge in the joint see No five hundred fifty seven and let it boil up quickly Now draw the pot to the side of the fire and let the process be very gradual as the water must only simmer or the meat will be hard and tough Carefully remove the scum from the surface of the water and continue doing this for a few minutes after it first boils Carrots and turnips are served with this dish and sometimes suet dumplings which may be boiled with the beef Garnish with a few of the carrots and turnips and serve the remainder in a vegetable dish Time An aitch bone of ten lbs two one two hours after the water boils one of twenty lbs four hours Average cost sixd per lb Sufficient ten lbs for seven or eight persons Seasonable all the year but best from September to March Note The liquor in which the meat has been boiled may be easily converted into a very excellent pea soup It will require very few vegetables as it will be impregnated with the flavour of those boiled with the meat THE ACTION OF SALT ON MEAT The manner in which salt acts in preserving meat is not difficult to understand By its strong affinity it in the first place extracts the juices from the substance of meat in sufficient quantity to form a saturated solution with the water contained in the juice and the meat then absorbs the saturated brine in place of the juice extracted by the salt In this way matter incapable of putrefaction takes the places of that portion in the meat which is most perishable Such however is not the only office of salt as a means of preserving meat it acts also by its astringency in contracting the fibres of the muscles and so excludes the action of air on the interior of the substance of the meat The last mentioned operation of salt as an antiseptic is evinced by the diminution of the volume of meat to which it is applied The astringent action of saltpetre on meat is much greater than that of salt and thereby renders meat to which it is applied very hard but in small quantities it considerably assists the antiseptic action of salt and also prevents the destruction of the florid colour of meat which is caused by the application of salt Thus it will be perceived from the foregoing statement that the application of salt and saltpetre diminishes in a considerable degree the nutritive and to some extent the wholesome qualities of meat and therefore in their use the quantity applied should be as small as possible consistent with the perfect preservation of the meat BOILED ROUND OF BEEF six hundred eight INGREDIENTS Beef water Mode As a whole round of beef generally speaking is too large for small families and very seldom required we here give the recipe for dressing a portion of the silver side of the round Take from twelve to sixteen lbs after it has been in salt about ten days just wash off the salt skewer it up in a nice round looking form and bind it with tape to keep the skewers in their places Put it in a saucepan of boiling water as in the preceding recipe set it upon a good fire and when it begins to boil carefully remove all scum from the surface as if this is not attended to it sinks on to the meat and when brought to table presents a very unsightly appearance When it is well skimmed draw the pot to the corner of the fire and let it simmer very gently until done Remove the tape and skewers which should be replaced by a silver one pour over a little of the pot liquor and garnish with carrots See coloured plate two Carrots turnips parsnips and sometimes suet dumplings accompany this dish and these may all be boiled with the beef The pot liquor should be saved and converted into pea soup and the outside slices which are generally hard and of an uninviting appearance may be out off before being sent to table and potted These make an excellent relish for the breakfast or luncheon table Time Part of a round of beef weighing twelve lbs about three hours after the water boils Average cost eightd per lb Sufficient for ten persons Seasonable all the year but more suitable for winter six hundred nine SOYER S RECIPE FOR PRESERVING THE GRAVY IN SALT MEAT WHEN IT IS TO BE SERVED COLD Fill two tubs with cold water into which throw a few pounds of rough ice and when the meat is done put it into one of the tubs of ice water let it remain one minute when take out and put it into the other tub Fill the first tub again with water and continue this process for about twenty minutes then set it upon a dish and let it remain until quite cold When cut the fat will be as white as possible besides having saved the whole of the gravy If there is no ice spring water will answer the same purpose but will require to be more frequently changed Note The BRISKET and RUMP may be boiled by the above recipe of course allowing more or less time according to the size of the joint BEEF CAKE six hundred ten INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast beef to each pound of cold meat allow one four lb of bacon or ham seasoning to taste of pepper and salt one small

perfectly free from smoke and do not add any fresh fuel just before you require to use the gridiron Sprinkle a little salt over the fire put on the gridiron for a few minutes to get thoroughly hot through rub it with a piece of fresh suet to prevent the meat from sticking and lay on the steaks which should be cut of an equal thickness about three four of an inch or rather thinner and level them by beating them as little as possible with a rolling pin Turn them frequently with steak tongs if these are not at hand stick a fork in the edge of the fat that no gravy escapes and in from eight to ten minutes they will be done Have ready a very hot dish into which put the ketchup and when liked a little minced shalot dish up the steaks rub them over with butter and season with pepper and salt The exact time for broiling steaks must be determined by taste whether they are liked underdone or well done more than from eight to ten minutes for a steak three four inch in thickness we think would spoil and dry up the juices of the meat Great expedition is necessary in sending broiled steaks to table and to have them in perfection they should not be cooked till everything else prepared for dinner has been dished up as their excellence entirely depends on their being served very hot Garnish with scraped horseradish or slices of cucumber Oyster tomato onion and many other sauces are frequent accompaniments to rump steak but true lovers of this English dish generally reject all additions but pepper and salt Time eight to ten minutes Average cost ones per lb Sufficient Allow one two lb to each person if the party consist entirely of gentlemen three four lb will not be too much Seasonable all the year but not good in the height of summer as the meat cannot hang long enough to be tender DIFFERENT SEASONS FOR BEEF We have already stated see No five hundred ninety three that the Scots breed of oxen like the South down in mutton stands first in excellence It should be borne in mind however that each county has its particular season and that the London and other large markets are always supplied by those counties whose meat from local circumstances is in the best condition at the time Thus the season in Norfolk from which the Scots come these being the principal oxen bred by the Norfolk and Suffolk graziers commences about Christmas and terminates about June when this

qualities is generally easily digested stock is made from it and it is eaten boiled broiled roasted stewed braised and in a hundred other different ways Beef is the foundation of stock gravies braises

smoky flavour it may be hung for some time in a chimney corner or smoked in any other way it will keep a long time HUNTER S BEEF six hundred thirty one INGREDIENTS For a round of beef weighing twenty five lbs allow three oz of saltpetre three oz of coarse sugar one oz of cloves one grated nutmeg one two oz of allspice one lb of salt one two lb bay salt Mode Let the beef hang for two or three days and remove the bone Pound spices salt c in the above proportion and let them be reduced to the finest powder Put the beef into a pan rub all the ingredients well into it and turn and rub it every day for rather more than a fortnight When it has been sufficiently long in pickle wash the meat bind it up securely with tape and put it into a pan with one two pint of water at the bottom mince some suet cover the top of the meat with it and over the pan put a common crust of flour and water bake for six hours and when cold remove the paste Save the gravy that flows from it as it adds greatly to the flavour of hashes stews c The beef may be glazed and garnished with meat jelly Time six hours Seasonable all the year Note In salting or pickling beef or pork for family consumption it not being generally required to be kept for a great length of time a less quantity of salt and a larger quantity of other matters more adapted to retain mellowness in meat may be employed which could not be adopted by the curer of the immense quantities of meat required to be preserved for victualling the shipping of this maritime country Sugar which is well known to possess the preserving principle in a very great degree without the pungency and astringency of salt may be and is very generally used in the preserving of meat for family consumption Although it acts without corrugating or contracting the fibres of meat as is the case in the action of salt and therefore does not impair its mellowness yet its use in sufficient quantities for preservative effect without the addition of other antiseptics would impart a flavour not agreeable to the taste of many persons It may be used however together with salt with the greatest advantage in imparting mildness and mellowness to cured meat in a proportion of about one part by weight to four of the mixture and perhaps now that sugar is so much lower in price than it was in former years one of the obstructions to its more frequent use is removed TO DRESS BEEF KIDNEY I six hundred thirty two INGREDIENTS one kidney clarified butter pepper and salt to taste a small quantity of highly seasoned gravy one tablespoonful of lemon juice one four teaspoonful of powdered sugar Mode Cut the kidneys into neat slices put them into warm water to soak for two hours and change the water two or three times then put them on a clean cloth to dry

preparing them as in the preceding recipe they should be laid in a deep dish and baked for two hours Illustration MARROW BONES MARROW BONES Bones are formed of a dense cellular tissue of membranous matter made stiff and rigid by insoluble earthy salts of which phosphate of lime is the most abundant In a large bone the insoluble matter is generally deposited in such a manner as to leave a cavity into which a fatty substance distinguished by the name of marrow is thrown Hollow cylindrical bones possess the qualities of strength and lightness in a remarkable degree If bones were entirely solid they would be unnecessarily heavy and if their materials were brought into smaller compass they would be weaker because the strength of a bone is in proportion to the distance at which its fibres are from the centre Some animals it must however be observed have no cavities in the centre of their bones such as the whale tribe skate and turtles MINCED BEEF Cold Meat Cookery six hundred thirty six

ANIMALS In the class Mammalia the vertebral column or backbone presents only slight modifications and everywhere shows the same characteristics as in man who stands at the head of this division of the animal kingdom The length of this column however varies much and the number of vertebrae of which it is composed is far from being uniform These numerical differences principally depend on the unequal development of the caudal portion or tail end of the column Thus the tail forming vertebrae sometimes do not exist at all amongst certain bats for example in other instances we reckon forty fifty and even upwards of sixty of these bones Among the greater number of mammals the tail is of little use for locomotion except that it acts in many cases as does the rudder of a ship steadying the animal in his rapid movements and enabling him to turn more easily and quickly Among some animals it becomes a very powerful instrument of progression Thus in the kangaroos and jerboas the tail forms with the hind feet a kind of tripod from which the animal makes its spring With most of the American monkeys it is prehensile and serves the animal as a fifth hand to suspend itself from the branches of trees and lastly among the whales it grows to an enormous size and becomes the principal instrument for swimming A PICKLE FOR TONGUES OR BEEF Newmarket Recipe six hundred forty one INGREDIENTS one gallon of soft water three lbs of coarse salt six oz of coarse brown sugar one two oz of saltpetre Mode Put all the ingredients into a saucepan and let them boil for one two hour clear off the scum as it rises

hundred forty three INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast or boiled beef one four lb of butter cayenne to taste two blades of pounded mace Mode As we have stated in recipe No six hundred eight the outside slices of boiled beef may with a little trouble be converted into a very nice addition to the breakfast table Cut up the meat into small pieces and pound it well with a little butter in a mortar add a seasoning of cayenne and mace and be very particular that the latter ingredient is reduced to the finest powder When all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed put it into glass or earthen potting pots and pour on the top a coating of clarified butter Seasonable at any time Note If cold roast beef is used remove all pieces of gristle and dry outside pieces as these do not pound well PRESERVED MEATS When an organic substance like the flesh of animals is heated to the boiling point it loses the property of passing into a state of fermentation and decay Fresh animal milk as is well known coagulates after having been kept for two or three days into a gelatinous mass but it may be preserved for an indefinite period as a perfectly sweet liquid if it be heated daily to the boiling point The knowledge of this effect of an elevated temperature has given rise to a most important branch of industry namely the preparation of preserved meats for the use of the navy and merchant service At Leith in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh at Aberdeen at Bordeaux at Marseilles and in many parts of Germany establishments of enormous magnitude exist in which soup vegetables and viands of every description are prepared in such a manner that they retain their freshness for years The prepared aliments are inclosed in canisters of tinned iron plate the covers are soldered air tight and the canisters exposed to the temperature of boiling water for three or four hours The aliments thus acquire a stability which one may almost say is eternal and when a canister is opened after the lapse of several years its contents are found to be unaltered in taste colour and smell We are indebted to the French philosopher Gay Lussac for this beautiful practical application of the discovery that boiling checks fermentation An exclusive salt meat diet is extremely injurious to the health and in former times thousands of mariners lost their lives for the want of fresh aliments during long voyages We are sorry to say that the preserved meats are sometimes carelessly prepared and though the statement seems incredible sometimes adulterated doctor Lankester who has done so much to expose the frauds of trade that he ought to be regarded as a public benefactor says that he has seen things which were utterly unfit for food shipped as preserved meats Surely as he observes there ought to be some superintendent to examine the so called articles of food that are taken on board ship so that the poor men who have been fighting our battles abroad may run no risk of being starved or poisoned on their way home RIB OF BEEF BONES A Pretty Dish six hundred forty four INGREDIENTS Rib of beef bones one onion chopped fine a few slices of carrot and turnip one four pint of gravy Mode The

Seasonable at any time FRENCH BEEF It has been all but universally admitted that the beef of France is greatly inferior in quality to that of England owing to inferiority of pasturage M Curmer however one of the latest writers on the culinary art tells us that this is a vulgar error and that French beef is far superior to that of England This is mere vaunting on the part of our neighbours who seem to want la gloire in everything and we should not deign to notice it if it had occurred in a work of small pretensions but M Curmer s book professes to be a complete exposition of the scientific principles of cookery and holds a high rank in the didactic literature of France We half suspect that M Curmer obtained his knowledge of English beef in the same way as did the poor Frenchman whom the late mister Mathews the comedian so humorously described mister Lewis in his Physiology of Common Life has thus revived the story of the beef eating son of France A Frenchman was one day blandly remonstrating against the supercilious scorn expressed by Englishmen for the beef of France which he for his part did not find so inferior to that of England I have been two times in England he remarked but I nevere find the bif so superieur to ours I find it vary conveenient that they bring it you on leetle pieces of stick for one penny but I do not find the bif superieur On hearing this the Englishman red with astonishment exclaimed Good heavens sir you have been eating cat s meat No M Curmer we are ready to acknowledge the superiority of your cookery but we have long since made up our minds as to the inferiority of your raw material BEEF OLIVES I six hundred fifty INGREDIENTS two lbs of rump steak one egg one tablespoonful of minced savoury herbs pepper and salt to taste one

Seasonable at any time Note These may be more easily prepared by putting the tails in a brisk oven after they have been dipped in egg and bread crumb and when brown they are done They must be boiled the same time as for broiling STRANGE TAILS Naturalists cannot explain the uses of some of the strange tails borne by animals In the Egyptian and Syrian sheep for instance the tail grows so large that it is not infrequently supported upon a sort of little cart in order to prevent inconvenience to the animal Thin monstrous appendage sometimes attains a weight of seventy eighty or even a hundred pounds TO DRESS BEEF PALATES an Entree six hundred fifty three INGREDIENTS four palates sufficient gravy to cover them No four hundred thirty eight cayenne to taste one tablespoonful of mushroom

hundred fifty four INGREDIENTS six lbs of salt two lbs of fine sugar three oz of powdered saltpetre three gallons of spring water Mode Boil all the ingredients gently together so long as any scum or impurity arises which carefully remove when quite cold pour it over the meat every part of which must be covered with the brine This may be used for pickling any kind of meat and may be kept for some time if boiled up occasionally with an addition of the ingredients Time A ham should be kept in the pickle for a fortnight a piece of beef weighing fourteen lbs twelve or fifteen days a tongue ten days or a fortnight Note For salting and pickling meat it is a good plan to rub in only half the quantity of salt directed and to let it remain for a day or two to disgorge and effectually to get rid of the blood and slime then rub in the remainder of the salt and other ingredients and proceed as above This rule may be applied to all the recipes we have given for salting and pickling meat TO PICKLE PART OF A ROUND OF BEEF FOR HANGING six hundred fifty five INGREDIENTS For fourteen lbs of a round of beef allow one one two lb of salt one two oz of powdered saltpetre or one lb of salt one

during three weeks then bind up the beef tightly with coarse linen tape and hang it in a kitchen in which a fire is constantly kept for three weeks Pork hams and bacon may be cured in a similar way but will require double the quantity of the salting mixture and if not smoke dried they should be taken down from hanging after three or four weeks and afterwards kept in boxes or tubs amongst dry oat husks Time two or three weeks to remain in the brine to be hung three weeks Seasonable at any time Note The meat may be boiled fresh from this pickle instead of smoking it BEEP RAGOUT Cold Meat

boiled Put the meat down to a nice clear fire put some clean dripping into the pan dredge the joint with a little flour and keep continually basting the whole time Sprinkle some fine salt over it this must never be done until the joint is dished as it draws the juices from the meat pour the dripping from the pan put in a little boiling water slightly salted and strain the gravy over the meat Garnish with tufts of scraped horseradish and send horseradish sauce to table with it see No four hundred forty seven A Yorkshire pudding see Puddings sometimes accompanies this dish and if lightly made and well cooked will be found a very agreeable addition Time ten lbs of beef two one two hours fourteen to sixteen lbs from three one two to four hours Average cost eight one twod per lb Sufficient A joint of ten lbs sufficient for eight or nine persons Seasonable at any time MEMORANDA IN ROASTING The management of the fire is a point of primary importance in roasting A radiant fire throughout the operation is absolutely necessary to insure a good result When the article to be dressed is thin and delicate the fire may be small but when the joint is large the fire must fill the grate Meat must never be put down before a hollow or exhausted fire which may soon want recruiting on the other hand if the heat of the fire becomes too fierce the meat must be removed to a considerable distance till it is somewhat abated Some cooks always fail in their roasts though they succeed in nearly everything else A French writer on the culinary art says that anybody can learn how to cook but one must be born a roaster According to Liebig beef or mutton cannot be said to be sufficiently roasted until it has acquired throughout the whole mass a temperature of one hundred fifty eight deg but poultry may be well cooked when the inner parts have attained a temperature of from one hundred thirty deg to one hundred forty deg This depends on the greater amount of blood which beef and mutton contain the colouring matter of blood not being coagulable under one hundred fifty eight deg ROAST RIBS OF BEEF Boned and Rolled a very Convenient Joint for a Small Family six hundred fifty eight INGREDIENTS one or two ribs of beef Mode Choose a fine rib of beef and have it cut according to the weight you require either wide or narrow Bone and roll the meat round secure it with wooden skewers and if necessary bind it round with a piece of tape Spit the beef firmly or if a bottle jack is used put the joint on the hook and place it near a nice clear fire Let it remain so till the outside of the meat is set when draw it to a distance and keep continually basting until the meat is done which can be ascertained by the steam from it drawing towards the fire As this joint is solid rather more than one four hour must be allowed for each lb Remove the skewers put in a plated or silver one and send the joint to table with gravy in the dish and garnish with tufts of horseradish Horseradish sauce No four hundred forty seven is a great improvement to roast beef Time For ten lbs of the rolled ribs three hours as the joint is very solid we have allowed an extra one two hour for six lbs one one two hour Average cost eight one twod per lb Sufficient A joint of ten lbs for six or eight persons Seasonable all the year Note When the weight exceeds ten lbs we would not advise the above method of boning and rolling only in the case of one or two ribs when the joint cannot stand upright in the dish and would look awkward The bones should be put in with a few vegetables and herbs and made into stock ROAST BEEF has long been a national dish in England In most of our patriotic songs it is contrasted with the fricasseed frogs popularly supposed to be the exclusive diet of Frenchmen O the roast beef of old England And O the old English roast beef This national chorus is appealed to whenever a song writer wishes to account for the valour displayed by Englishmen at sea or on land ROAST SIRLOIN OF BEEF six hundred fifty nine INGREDIENTS Beef a little salt Mode As a joint cannot be well roasted without a good fire see that it is well made up about three four hour before it is required so that when the joint is put down it is clear and bright Choose a nice sirloin the weight of which should not exceed sixteen lbs as the outside would be too much done whilst the inside would not be done enough Spit it or hook it on to the jack firmly dredge it slightly with flour and place it near the fire at first as directed in the preceding recipe Then draw it to a distance and keep continually basting until the meat is done Sprinkle a small quantity of salt over it empty the dripping pan of all the dripping pour in some boiling water slightly salted stir it about and strain over the meat Garnish with tufts of horseradish and send horseradish sauce and Yorkshire pudding to table with it For carving see p three hundred seventeen Time A sirloin of ten lbs two one two hours fourteen to sixteen lbs about four or four one two hours Average cost eight one twod per lb Sufficient A joint of ten lbs for eight or nine persons Seasonable at any time The rump round and other pieces of beef are roasted in the same manner allowing for solid joints one four hour to every lb Note The above is the usual method of roasting moat but to have it in perfection and the juices kept in the meat should at first be laid close to the fire and when the outside is set and firm drawn away to a good distance and then left to roast very slowly where economy is studied this plan would not answer as the meat requires to be at the fire double the time of the ordinary way of cooking consequently double the quantity of fuel would be consumed ORIGIN OF THE WORD SIRLOIN The loin of beef is said to have been knighted by King Charles II at Friday Hall Chingford The Merry Monarch returned to this hospitable mansion for Epping Forest literally as hungry as a hunter and beheld with delight a huge loin of beef steaming upon the table A noble joint exclaimed the king By saint George it shall have a title Then drawing his sword he raised it above the meat and cried with mock dignity Loin we dub thee knight henceforward be Sir Loin This anecdote is doubtless apocryphal although the oak table upon which the joint was supposed to have received its knighthood might have been seen by any one who visited Friday Hill House a few years ago It is perhaps a pity to spoil so noble a story but the interests of truth demand that we declare that sirloin is probably a corruption of surloin which signifies the upper part of a loin the prefix sur being equivalent to over or above In French we find this joint called surlonge which so closely resembles our sirloin that we may safely refer the two words to a common origin TO SALT BEEF six hundred sixty INGREDIENTS one two round of beef four oz of sugar one oz of powdered saltpetre two oz of black pepper one four lb

should be turned once or twice Time four hours Average cost sevend per lb Seasonable at any time BAKING MEAT Baking exerts some unexplained influence on meat rendering it less savoury and less agreeable than meat which has been roasted Those who have travelled in Germany and France writes mister Lewis one of our most popular scientific authors must have repeatedly marvelled at the singular uniformity in the flavour or want of flavour of the various roasts served up at the table d hote The general explanation is that the German and French meat is greatly inferior in quality to that of England and Holland owing to the inferiority of pasturage and doubtless this is one cause but it is not the chief cause The meat is inferior but the cooking is mainly at fault The meat is scarcely ever roasted because there is no coal and firewood is expensive The meat is therefore baked and the consequence of this baking is that no meat is eatable or eaten with its own gravy but is always accompanied by some sauce more or less piquant The Germans generally believe that in England we eat our beef and mutton almost raw they shudder at our gravy as if it were so much blood STEWED BEEF or RUMP STEAK an Entree six hundred sixty six INGREDIENTS About two lbs of beef or rump steak three onions two turnips three carrots two or three oz of butter one two pint of water one teaspoonful of

above proportions and thicken with a tablespoonful of flour mixed with two of cold water Let it boil up for a minute or two after the thickening is added and serve When a vegetable scoop is at hand use it to cut the vegetables in fanciful shapes and tomato Harvey s sauce or walnut liquor may be used to flavour the gravy It is less rich if stewed the previous day so that the fat may be taken off

vinegar and salt six carrots six turnips six small onions one blade of pounded mace two whole allspice pounded thickening of butter and flour two tablespoonfuls of ketchup stock or water Mode About an hour before dressing it rub the meat over with vinegar and salt put it into a stewpan with sufficient stock to cover it when this is not at hand water may be substituted for it and be particular that the stewpan is not much larger than the meat Skim well and when it has simmered very gently for one hour put in the vegetables and continue simmering till the meat is perfectly tender Draw out the bones dish the meat and garnish either with tufts of cauliflower or braised cabbage cut in quarters Thicken as much gravy as required with a little butter and flour add spices and ketchup in the above proportion give one boil pour some of it over the meat and the remainder send in a tureen Time rather more than three hours Average cost sevend per lb Sufficient for seven or eight persons Seasonable

butter and flour add a glass of port wine and any flavouring to make the gravy rich and palatable let it boil up pour over the meat and serve This dish may be very much enriched by garnishing with forcemeat balls or filling up the space whence the bone is taken with a good forcemeat sliced carrots turnips and onions boiled with the meat are also a great improvement and where expense is not objected to it may be glazed This however is not necessary where a good gravy is poured round and over the meat Time one two rump stewed gently from four to five hours Average cost tend per lb Sufficient for eight or ten persons Seasonable at any time Note A stock or gravy in which to boil the meat may be made of the bone and trimmings by boiling them with water and adding carrots onions turnips and a bunch of sweet herbs To make this dish richer and more savoury half roast the rump and afterwards stew it in strong stock and a little Madeira This is an expensive method and is not after all much better than a plainer dressed joint THE BARON OF BEEF This noble joint which consisted of two sirloins not cut asunder was a favourite dish of our ancestors It is rarely seen nowadays indeed it seems out of place on a modern table as it requires the grim boar s head and Christmas pie as supporters Sir Walter Scott has described a feast at which the baron of beef would have appeared to great advantage We will quote a few lines to remind us of those days when England was merry England and when hospitality was thought to be the highest virtue The fire with well dried logs supplied Went roaring up the chimney wide The huge hall table s oaken face Scrubb d till it shone the day to grace Bore then upon its massive board No mark to part the squire and lord Then was brought in the lusty brawn By old blue coated serving man Then the grim boar s head frown d on high Crested with bays and rosemary Well can the green garb d ranger tell How when and where the monster fell What dogs before his death he tore And all the baiting of the boar While round the merry wassel bowl Garnish d with ribbons blithe did trowl There the huge sirloin reek d hard by Plum porridge stood and Christmas pie Nor fail d old Scotland to produce At such high tide her savoury goose When a lord s son came of age in the olden time the baron of beef was too small a joint by many degrees to satisfy the retainers who would flock to the hall a whole ox was therefore generally roasted over a fire built up of huge logs We may here mention that an ox was roasted entire on the frozen Thames in the early part of the present century STEWED SHIN OF BEEF six hundred seventy one INGREDIENTS A shin of beef one head of celery one onion a faggot of savoury herbs one two teaspoonful of allspice one two teaspoonful of whole black pepper four carrots twelve button onions two turnips thickening of butter and flour three tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup two tablespoonfuls of port wine pepper and salt

simmer very gently until the meat is tender Peel the vegetables cut them into any shape fancy may dictate and boil them with the onions until tender lift out the beef put it on a dish which keep hot and thicken with butter and flour as much of the liquor as will be wanted for gravy keep stirring till it boils then strain and skim Put the gravy back in the stewpan add the seasoning port wine and ketchup give one boil and pour it over the beef garnish with the boiled carrots turnips and onions Time The meat to be stewed about four hours Average cost fourd per lb with bone Sufficient for seven or eight persons Seasonable at any time TOAD IN THE HOLE a Homely but Savoury Dish six hundred seventy two INGREDIENTS one one two lb of rump steak one sheep s kidney pepper and salt to taste For the batter three eggs one pint of milk four tablespoonfuls of flour one two saltspoonful of salt Mode Cut up the steak and kidney into convenient sized pieces and put them into a pie dish with a good seasoning of salt and pepper mix the flour with a small quantity of milk at first to prevent its being lumpy add the remainder and the three eggs which should be well beaten put in the salt stir the batter for about five minutes and pour it over the steak Place it in a tolerably brisk oven immediately and bake for one one two hour Time one one two hour Average cost ones nined Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable at any time Note The remains of cold beef rather underdone may be substituted for the steak and when liked the smallest possible quantity of minced onion or shalot may be added BOILED TONGUE six hundred seventy three INGREDIENTS one tongue a bunch of savoury herbs water Mode In choosing a tongue ascertain how long it has been dried or pickled and select one with a smooth skin which denotes its being young and tender If a dried one and rather hard soak it at least for twelve hours previous to cooking it if however it is fresh from the pickle two or three hours will be sufficient for it to remain in sock Put the tongue in a stewpan with plenty of cold water and a bunch of savoury herbs let it gradually come to a boil skim well and simmer very gently until tender Peel off the skin garnish with tufts of cauliflowers or Brussels sprouts and serve Boiled tongue is frequently sent to table with boiled poultry instead of ham and is by many persons preferred If to serve cold peel it fasten it down to a piece of board by sticking a fork through the root and another through the top to straighten it When cold glaze it and put a paper ruche round the root and garnish with tufts of parsley Time A large smoked tongue four to four one two hours a small one two one two to three hours A large unsmoked tongue three to three one two hours a small one two to two

oz of black pepper four oz of sugar three oz of juniper berries six oz of salt Mode Rub the above ingredients well into the tongue and let it remain in the pickle for ten days or a fortnight then drain it tie it up in brown paper and have it smoked for about twenty days over a wood fire or it may be boiled out of this pickle Time From ten to fourteen days to remain in the pickle to be smoked twenty four days Average cost for a medium sized uncured tongue twos sixd Seasonable at any time Note If not wanted immediately the tongue will keep three or four weeks without being too salt then it must not be rubbed but only turned in the pickle II six hundred seventy five INGREDIENTS nine lbs of salt eight oz of sugar nine oz of powdered saltpetre Mode Rub the above ingredients well into the tongues and keep them in this curing mixture for two months turning them every day Drain them from the pickle cover with brown paper and have them smoked for about three weeks Time The tongues to remain in pickle two months to be smoked three weeks Sufficient The above quantity of brine sufficient for twelve tongues of five lbs each Seasonable at any time Illustration BEEF TONGUE THE TONGUES OF ANIMALS The tongue whether in the ox or in man is the seat of the sense of taste This sense warns the animal against swallowing deleterious substances doctor Carpenter says that among the lower animals the instinctive perceptions connected with this sense are much more remarkable than our own thus an omnivorous monkey will seldom touch fruits of a poisonous character although their taste may be agreeable However this may be man s instinct has decided that ox tongue is better than horse tongue nevertheless the latter is frequently substituted by dishonest dealers for the former The horse s tongue may be readily distinguished by a spoon like expansion at its end TO PICKLE AND DRESS A TONGUE TO EAT COLD six hundred seventy six INGREDIENTS six oz of salt two oz of bay salt one oz of saltpetre three oz of coarse sugar cloves mace and allspice to taste butter common crust of flour and water Mode Lay the tongue for a fortnight in the above pickle turn it every day and be particular that the spices are well pounded put it into a small pan just large enough to hold it place some pieces of butter on it and cover with a common crust Bake in a slow oven until so tender that a straw would penetrate it take off the skin fasten it down to a piece of board by running a fork through the root and another through the tip at the same time straightening it and putting it into shape When cold glaze it put a paper ruche round the root which is generally very unsightly and garnish with tufts of parsley Time From three or four hours in a slow oven according to size Average cost for a medium sized uncured tongue twos sixd Seasonable at any time TO DRESS TRIPE six hundred seventy seven INGREDIENTS Tripe onion sauce No four hundred eighty four milk and water Mode Ascertain that the tripe is quite fresh and have it cleaned and dressed Cut away the coarsest fat and boil it in equal proportions of milk and water for three four hour Should the tripe be entirely undressed more than double that time should be allowed for it Have ready some onion sauce made by recipe No fourSfour dish the tripe smother it with the sauce and the remainder send to table in a tureen Time one hour for undressed tripe from two one two to three hours Average cost sevend per lb Seasonable at any time Note Tripe may be dressed in a variety of ways it may be cut in pieces and fried in batter stewed in gravy with mushrooms or cut into collops sprinkled with minced onion and savoury herbs and fried a nice brown in clarified butter BEEF CARVING AITCHBONE OF BEEF A boiled aitch bone of beef is not a difficult joint to carve as will be seen on reference to the accompanying engraving By following with the knife the direction of the line from one to two nice slices will be easily cut It may be necessary as in a round of beef to cut a thick slice off the outside before commencing to serve Illustration BRISKET OF BEEF There is but little description necessary to add to show the carving of a boiled brisket of beef beyond the engraving here inserted The only point to be observed is that the joint should be cut evenly and firmly quite across the bones so that on its reappearance at table it should not have a jagged and untidy look Illustration RIBS OF BEEF This dish resembles the sirloin except that it has no fillet or undercut As explained in the recipes the end piece is often cut off salted and boiled The mode of carving is similar to that of the sirloin viz in the direction of the dotted line from one to two This joint will be the more easily cut if the plan be pursued which is suggested in carving the sirloin namely the inserting of the knife immediately between the bone and the moat before commencing to cut it into slices All joints of roast beef should be cut in even and thin slices Horseradish finely scraped may be served as a garnish but horseradish sauce is preferable for eating with the beef Illustration SIRLOIN OF BEEF This dish is served differently at various tables some preferring it to come to table with the fillet or as it is usually called the undercut uppermost The reverse way as shown in the cut is that most usually adopted Still the undercut is best eaten when hot consequently the carver himself may raise the joint and cut some slices from the under side in the direction of from one to two as the fillet is very much preferred by some eaters The upper part of the sirloin should be cut in the direction of the line from five to six and care should be taken to carve it evenly and in thin slices It will be found a great assistance in carving this joint well if the knife be first inserted just above the bone at the bottom and run sharply along between the bone and meat and also to divide the meat from the bone in the same way at the side of the joint The slices will then come away more readily Illustration Some carvers cut the upper side of the sirloin across as shown by the line from three to four but this is a wasteful plan and one not to be recommended With the sirloin very finely scraped horseradish is usually served and a little given when liked to each guest Horseradish sauce is preferable however for serving on the plate although the scraped horseradish may still be used as a garnish Illustration A ROUND OF BEEF A round of beef is not so easily carved as many other joints of beef and to manage it properly a thin bladed and very sharp knife is necessary Off the outside of the joint at its top a thick slice should first be cut so as to leave the surface smooth then thin and even slices should be cleverly carved in the direction of the line one to two and with each slice of the lean a delicate morsel of the fat should be served Illustration BEEF TONGUE Passing the knife down in the direction of from one to two a not too thin slice should be helped and the carving of a tongue may be continued in this way until the best portions of the upper side are served The fat which lies about the root of the tongue can be served by turning the tongue and cutting in the direction of from three to four Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XIV GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE SHEEP AND LAMB six hundred seventy eight OF ALL WILD or DOMESTICATED ANIMALS the sheep is without exception the most useful to man as a food and the most necessary to his health and comfort for it not only supplies him with the lightest and most nutritious of meats but in the absence of the cow its udder yields him milk cream and a sound though inferior cheese while from its fat he obtains light and from its fleece broadcloth kerseymere blankets gloves and hose Its bones when burnt make an animal charcoal ivory black to polish his boots and when powdered a manure for the cultivation of his wheat the skin either split or whole is made into a mat for his carriage a housing for his horse or a lining for his hat and many other useful purposes besides being extensively employed in the manufacture of parchment and finally when oppressed by care and sorrow the harmonious strains that carry such soothing contentment to the heart are elicited from the musical strings prepared almost exclusively from the intestines of the sheep six hundred seventy nine THIS VALUABLE ANIMAL of which England is estimated to maintain an average stock of thirty two million belongs to the class already indicated under the ox the Mammalia to the order of Rumenantia or cud chewing animal to the tribe of Capridae or horned quadrupeds and the genus Ovis or the sheep The sheep may be either with or without horns when present however they have always this peculiarity that they spring from a triangular base are spiral in form and lateral at the side of the head in situation The fleece of the sheep is of two sorts either short and harsh or soft and woolly the wool always preponderating in an exact ratio to the care attention and amount of domestication bestowed on the animal The generic peculiarities of the sheep are the triangular and spiral form of the horns always larger in the male when present but absent in the most cultivated species having sinuses at the base of all the toes of the four feet with two rudimentary hoofs on the fore legs two inguinal teats to the udder with a short tail in the wild breed but of varying length in the domesticated have no incisor teeth in the upper jaw but in their place a hard elastic cushion along the margin of the gum on which the animal nips and breaks the herbage on which it feeds in the lower jaw there are eight incisor teeth and six molars on each side of both jaws making in all thirty two teeth The fleece consists of two coats one to keep the animal warm the other to carry off the water without wetting the skin The first is of wool the weight and fineness of which depend on the quality of the pasture and the care bestowed on the flock the other of hair that pierces the wool and overlaps it and is in excess in exact proportion to the badness of the keep and inattention with which the animal is treated six hundred eighty THE GREAT OBJECT OF THE GRAZIER is to procure an animal that will yield the greatest pecuniary return in the shortest time or in other words soonest convert grass and turnips into good mutton and fine fleece All sheep will not do this alike some like men are so restless and irritable that no system of feeding however good will develop their frames or make them fat The system adopted by the breeder to obtain a valuable animal for the butcher is to enlarge the capacity and functions of the digestive organs and reduce those of the head and chest or the mental and respiratory organs In the first place the mind should be tranquillized and those spaces that can never produce animal fibre curtailed and greater room afforded as in the abdomen for those that can And as nothing militates against the fattening process so much as restlessness the chief wish of the grazier is to find a dull indolent sheep one who instead of frisking himself leaping his wattles or even condescending to notice the butting gambols of his silly companions silently fills his paunch with pasture and then seeking a shady nook indolently and luxuriously chows his cud with closed eyes and blissful satisfaction only rising when his delicious repast is ended to proceed silently and without emotion to repeat the pleasing process of laying in more provender and then returning to his dreamy siesta to renew the delightful task of rumination Such animals are said to have a lymphatic temperament and are of so kindly a nature that on good pasturage they may be said to grow daily The Leicestershire breed is the best example of this lymphatic and contented animal and the active Orkney who is half goat in his habits of the restless and unprofitable The rich pasture of our midland counties would take years in making the wiry Orkney fat and profitable while one day s fatigue in climbing rocks after a coarse and scanty herbage would probably cause the actual death of the pampered and short winded Leicester six hundred eighty one THE MORE REMOVED FROM THE NATURE of the animal is the food on which it lives the more difficult is the process of assimilation and the more complex the chain of digestive organs for it must be evident to all that the same apparatus that converts flesh into flesh is hardly calculated to transmute grass into flesh As the process of digestion in carnivorous animals is extremely simple these organs are found to be remarkably short seldom exceeding the length of the animal s body while where digestion is more difficult from the unassimilating nature of the aliment as in the ruminant order the alimentary canal as is the case with the sheep is twenty seven times the length of the body The digestive organ in all ruminant animals consists of four stomachs or rather a capacious pouch divided by doorways and valves into four compartments called in their order of position the Paunch the Reticulum the Omasum and the Abomasum When the sheep nibbles the grass and is ignorantly supposed to be eating he is in fact only preparing the raw material of his meal in reality only mowing the pasture which as he collects is swallowed instantly passing into the first receptacle the paunch where it is surrounded by a quantity of warm saliva in which the herbage undergoes a process of maceration or softening till the animal having filled this compartment the contents pass through a valve into the second or smaller bag the reticulum where having again filled the paunch with a reserve the sheep lies down and commences that singular process of chewing the cud or in other words masticating the food he has collected By the operation of a certain set of muscles a small quantity of this softened food from the reticulum or second bag is passed into the mouth which it now becomes the pleasure of the sheep to grind under his molar teeth into a soft smooth pulp the operation being further assisted by a flow of saliva answering the double purpose of increasing the flavour of the aliment and promoting the solvency of the mass Having completely comminuted and blended this mouthful it is swallowed a second time but instead of returning to the paunch or reticulum it passes through another valve into a side cavity the omasum where after a maceration in more saliva for some hours it glides by the same contrivance into the fourth pouch the abomasum an apartment in all respects analogous to the ordinary stomach of animals and where the process of digestion begun and carried on in the previous three is here consummated and the nutrient principle by means of the bile eliminated from the digested aliment Such is the process of digestion in sheep and oxen six hundred eighty two NO OTHER ANIMAL even of the same order possesses in so remarkable a degree the power of converting pasture into flesh as the Leicestershire sheep the South Down and Cheviot the two next breeds in quality are in consequence of the greater vivacity of the animal s nature not equal to it in that respect though in both the brain and chest are kept subservient to the greater capacity of the organs of digestion Besides the advantage of increased bulk and finer fleeces the breeder seeks to obtain an augmented deposit of tissue in those parts of the carcase most esteemed as food or what are called in the trade prime joints and so far has this been effected that the comparative weight of the hind quarters over the fore has become a test of quality in the breed the butchers in some markets charging twopence a pound more for that portion of the sheep Indeed so superior are the hind quarters of mutton now regarded that very many of the West end butchers never deal in any other part of the sheep six hundred eighty three THE DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF THE FLESH in various breeds is a well established fact not alone in flavour but also in tenderness and that the nature of the pasture on which the sheep is fed influences the flavour of the meat is equally certain and shown in the estimation in which those flocks are held which have grazed on the thymy heath of Bamstead in Sussex It is also a well established truth that the larger the frame of the animal the coarser is the meat and that small bones are both guarantees for the fineness of the breed and the delicacy of the flesh The sex too has much to do in determining the quality of the meat in the males the lean is closer in fibre deeper in colour harder in texture less juicy and freer from fat than in the female and is consequently tougher and more difficult of digestion but probably age and the character of the pasturage on which they are reared has more than any other cause an influence on the quality and tenderness of the meat six hundred eighty four THE NUMEROUS VARIETIES of sheep inhabiting the different regions of the earth have been reduced by Cuvier to three or at most four species the Ovis Amman or the Argali the presumed parent stock of all the rest the Ovis Tragelaphus the bearded sheep of Africa the Ovis Musmon the Musmon of Southern Europe and the Ovis Montana the Mouflon of America though it is believed by many naturalists that this last is so nearly identical with the Indian Argali as to be undeserving a separate place It is still a controversy to which of these three we are indebted for the many breeds of modern domestication the Argali however by general belief has been considered as the most probable progenitor of the present varieties six hundred eighty five THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY CHANGE OF CLIMATE accident and other causes must have been great to accomplish so complete a physical alteration as the primitive Argali must have undergone before the Musmon or Mouflon of Corsica the immediate progenitor of all our European breeds assumed his present appearance The Argali is about a fifth larger in size than the ordinary English sheep and being a native of a tropical clime his fleece is of hair instead of wool and of a warm reddish brown approaching to yellow a thick mane of darker hair about seven inches long commences from two long tufts at the angle of the jaws and running under the throat and neck descends down the chest dividing at the fore fork into two parts one running down the front of each leg as low as the shank The horns unlike the character of the order generally have a quadrangular base and sweeping inwards terminate in a sharp point The tail about seven inches long ends in a tuft of stiff hairs From this remarkable muffler looking beard the French have given the species the name of Mouflon a manchettes From the primitive stock eleven varieties have been reared in this country of the domesticated sheep each supposed by their advocates to possess some one or more special qualities These eleven embracing the Shetland or Orkney the Dun woolled Black faced or heath bred the Moorland or Devonshire the Cheviot the Horned of Norfolk the Ryeland South Down the Merino the Old Leicester and the Teeswater or New Leicester have of late years been epitomized and for all useful and practical purposes reduced to the following four orders six hundred eighty six THE SOUTH DOWN the LEICESTER the BLACK FACED and the CHEVIOT Illustration SOUTH DOWN RAM Illustration SOUTH DOWN EWE six hundred eighty seven SOUTH DOWNS It appears as far as our investigation can trace the fact that from the very earliest epoch of agricultural history in England the breezy range of light chalky hills running through the south west and south of Sussex and Hampshire and known as the South Downs has been famous for a superior race of sheep and we find the Romans early established mills and a cloth factory at Winchester where they may be said to terminate which rose to such estimation from the fineness of the wool and texture of the cloth that the produce was kept as only worthy to clothe emperors From this it may be inferred that sheep have always been indigenous to this hilly tract Though boasting so remote a reputation it is comparatively within late years that the improvement and present state of perfection of this breed has been effected the South Down new ranking for symmetry of shape constitution and early maturity with any stock in the kingdom The South Down has no horns is covered with a fine wool from two to three inches long has a small head and legs and face of a grey colour It is however considered deficient in depth and breadth of chest A marked peculiarity of this breed is that its hind quarters stand higher than the fore the quarters weighing from fifteen to eighteen pounds Illustration LEICESTER RAM Illustration LEICESTER EWE six hundred eighty eight THE LEICESTER It was not till the year seventeen fifty five that mister Robert Bakewell directed his attention to the improvement of his stock of sheep and ultimately effected that change in the character of his flock which has brought the breed to hold so prominent a place The Leicester is regarded as the largest example of the improved breeds very productive and yielding a good fleece He has a small head covered with short white hairs a clean muzzle an open countenance full eye long thin ear tapering neck well arched ribs and straight back The meat is indifferent its flavour not being so good as that of the South Down and there is a very large proportion of fat Average weight of carcase from ninety to one hundred lbs Illustration HEATH RAM Illustration HEATH EWE six hundred eighty nine BLACK FACED on HEATH BRED SHEEP This is the most hardy of all our native breeds and originally came from Ettrick Forest The face and legs are black or sometimes mottled the horns spiral and on the top of the forehead it has a small round tuft of lighter coloured wool than on the face has the muzzle and lips of the same light hue and what shepherds call a mealy mouth the eye is full of vivacity and fire and well open the body long round and firm and the limbs robust The wool is thin coarse and light Weight of the quarter from ten to sixteen lbs six hundred ninety THE CHEVIOT From the earliest traditions these hills in the North like the chalk ridges in the South have possessed a race of large carcased sheep producing a valuable fleece To these physical advantages they added a sound constitution remarkable vigour and capability to endure great privation Both sexes are destitute of horns face white legs long and clean carries the head erect has the throat and neck well covered the cars long and open and the face animated The Cheviot is a small boned sheep and well covered with wool to the hough the only defect in this breed is in a want of depth in the chest Weight of the quarter from twelve to eighteen lbs Illustration ROMNEY MARSH RAM Illustration ROMNEY MARSH EWE six hundred ninety one THOUGH THE ROMNEY MARSHES that wide tract of morass and lowland moor extending from the Weald or ancient forest of Kent into Sussex has rather been regarded as a general feeding ground for any kind of sheep to be pastured on it has yet from the earliest date been famous for a breed of animals almost peculiar to the locality and especially for size length thickness and quantity of wool and what is called thickness of stocking and on this account for ages held pre eminence over every other breed in the kingdom So satisfied were the Kentish men with the superiority of their sheep that they long resisted any crossing in the breed At length however this was effected and from the Old Romney and New Leicester a stock was produced that proved in an eminent degree the advantage of the cross and though the breed was actually smaller than the original it was found that the new stock did not consume so much food the stocking was increased they were ready for the market a year sooner that the fat formed more on the exterior of the carcase where it was of most advantage to the grazier rather than as formerly in the interior where it went to the butcher as offal and though the wool was shorter and lighter it was of a better colour finer and possessed of superior felting properties six hundred ninety two THE ROMNEY MARSH BREED is a large animal deep close and compact with white face and legs and yields a heavy fleece of a good staple quality The general structure is however considered defective the chest being narrow and the extremities coarse nevertheless its tendency to fatten and its early maturity are universally admitted The Romney Marsh therefore though not ranking as a first class in respect of perfection and symmetry of breed is a highly useful profitable and generally advantageous variety of the English domestic sheep six hundred ninety three DIFFERENT NAMES HAVE BEEN GIVEN to sheep by their breeders according to their age and sex The male is called a ram or tup after weaning he is said to be a hog or hogget or a lamb hog tup hog or teg later he is a wether or wether hog after the first shearing a shearing or dinmont and after each succeeding shearing a two three or four shear ram tup or wether according to circumstances The female is called a ewe or gimmer lamb till weaned when she becomes according to the shepherd s nomenclature a gimmer ewe hog or teg after shearing a gimmer or shearing ewe or theave and in future a two three or four shear ewe or theave six hundred ninety four THE MODE OF SLAUGHTERING SHEEP is perhaps as humane and expeditious a process as could be adopted to attain the objects sought the animal being laid on its side in a sort of concave stool the butcher while pressing the body with his knee transfixes the throat near the angle of the jaw passing his knife between the windpipe and bones of the neck thus dividing the jugulars carotids and large vessels the death being very rapid from such a hemorrhage Illustration SIDE OF MUTTON SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS six hundred ninety five ALMOST EVERY LARGE CITY has a particular manner of cutting up or as it is called dressing the carcase In London this process is very simple and as our butchers have found that much skewering back doubling one part over another or scoring the inner cuticle or fell tends to spoil the meat and shorten the time it would otherwise keep they avoid all such treatment entirely The carcase when flayed which operation is performed while yet warm the sheep when hung up and the head removed presents the profile shown in our cut the small numerals indicating the parts or joints into which one half of the animal is cut After separating the hind from the fore quarters with eleven ribs to the latter the quarters are usually subdivided in the manner shown in the sketch in which the several joins are defined by the intervening lines and figures Hind quarter No one the leg two the loin the two when cut in one piece being called the saddle Fore quarter No three the shoulder four and five the neck No five being called for distinction the scrag which is generally afterwards separated from four the lower and better joint No six the breast The haunch of mutton so often served at public dinners and special entertainments comprises all the leg and so much of the loin short of the ribs or lap as is indicated on the upper part of the carcase by a dotted line six hundred ninety six THE GENTLE AND TIMID DISPOSITION of the sheep and its defenceless condition must very early have attached it to man for motives less selfish than either its fleece or its flesh for it has been proved beyond a doubt that obtuse as we generally regard it it is susceptible of a high degree of domesticity obedience and affection In many parts of Europe where the flocks are guided by the shepherd s voice alone it is no unusual thing for a sheep to quit the herd when called by its name and follow the keeper like a dog In the mountains of Scotland when a flock is invaded by a savage dog the rams have been known to form the herd into a circle and placing themselves on the outside line keep the enemy at bay or charging on him in a troop have despatched him with their horns six hundred ninety seven THE VALUE OF THE SHEEP seems to have been early understood by Adam in his fallen state his skin not only affording him protection for his body but a covering for his tent and accordingly we find Abel intrusted with this portion of his father s stock for the Bible tells us that Abel was a keeper of sheep What other animals were domesticated at that time we can only conjecture or at what exact period the flesh of the sheep was first eaten for food by man is equally if not uncertain open to controversy For though some authorities maintain the contrary it is but natural to suppose that when Abel brought firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof as a sacrifice the less dainty portions not being oblations were hardly likely to have been flung away as refuse Indeed without supposing Adam and his descendants to have eaten animal food we cannot reconcile the fact of Jubal Cain Cain s son and his family living in tents as they are reported to have done knowing that both their own garments and the coverings of the tents were made from the hides and skins of the animals they bred for the number of sheep and oxen slain for oblations only would not have supplied sufficient material for two such necessary purposes The opposite opinion is that animal food was not eaten till after the Flood when the Lord renewed his covenant with Noah From Scriptural authority we learn many interesting facts as regards the sheep the first that mutton fat was considered the most delicious portion of any meat and the tail and adjacent part the most exquisite morsel in the whole body consequently such were regarded as especially fit for the offer of sacrifice From this fact we may reasonably infer that the animal still so often met with in Palestine and Syria and known as the Fat tailed sheep was in use in the days of the patriarchs though probably not then of the size and weight it now attains to a supposition that gains greater strength when it is remembered that the ram Abraham found in the bush when he went to offer up Isaac was a horned animal being entangled in the brake by his curved horns so far proving that it belonged to the tribe of the Capridae the fat tailed sheep appertaining to the same family LAMBS six hundred ninety eight THOUGH THE LAMBING SEASON IN THIS COUNTRY usually commences in March under the artificial system so much pursued now to please the appetite of luxury lambs can be procured at all seasons When however the sheep lambs in mid winter or the inclemency of the weather would endanger the lives of mother and young if exposed to its influence it is customary to rear the lambs within doors and under the shelter of stables or barns where foddered on soft hay and part fed on cow s milk the little creatures thrive rapidly to such it is customary to give the name of House Lamb to distinguish it from that reared in the open air or grass fed The ewe goes five months with her young about one hundred fifty two days or close on twenty two weeks The weaning season commences on poor lands about the end of the third month but on rich pasture not till the close of the fourth sometimes longer six hundred ninety nine FROM THE LARGE PROPORTION OF MOISTURE OR FLUIDS contained in the tissues of all young animals the flesh of lamb and veal is much more prone in close damp weather to become tainted and spoil than the flesh of the more mature drier and closer textured beef and mutton Among epicures the most delicious sorts of lamb are those of the South Down breed known by their black feet and of these those which have been exclusively suckled on the milk of the parent ewe are considered the finest Next to these in estimation are those fed on the milk of several dams and last of all though the fattest the grass fed lamb this however implies an age much greater than either of the others Illustration SIDE OF LAMB seven hundred LAMB in the early part of the season however reared is in London and indeed generally sold in quarters divided with eleven ribs to the forequarter but as the season advances these are subdivided into two and the hind quarter in the same manner the first consisting of the shoulder and the neck and breast the latter of the leg and the loin as shown in the cut illustrative of mutton As lamb from the juicy nature of its flesh is especially liable to spoil in unfavourable weather it should be frequently wiped so as to remove any moisture that may form on it seven hundred one IN THE PURCHASING OF LAMB FOR THE TABLE there are certain signs by which the experienced judgment is able to form an accurate opinion whether the animal has been lately slaughtered and whether the joints possess that condition of fibre indicative of good and wholesome meat The first of these doubts may be solved satisfactorily by the bright and dilated appearance of the eye the quality of the fore quarter can always be guaranteed by the blue or healthy ruddiness of the jugular or vein of the neck while the rigidity of the knuckle and the firm compact feel of the kidney will answer in an equally positive manner for the integrity of the hind quarter seven hundred two MODE OF CUTTING UP A SIDE OF LAMB IN LONDON one one Ribs two Breast three Shoulder four Loin five Leg one hundred twenty three

complete dependence upon the shepherd for protection from its numerous enemies is frequently referred to in the Bible thus the Psalmist likens himself to a lost sheep and prays the Almighty to seek his servant and our Saviour when despatching his twelve chosen disciples to preach the Gospel amongst their unbelieving brethren compares them to lambs going amongst wolves The shepherd of the East by kind treatment calls forth from his sheep unmistakable signs of affection The sheep obey his voice and recognize the names by which he calls them and they follow him in and out of the fold The beautiful figure of the good shepherd which so often occurs in the New Testament expresses the tenderness of the Saviour for mankind The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep John x eleven I am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known by mine John x fourteen And other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd John x sixteen BONED LEG OF MUTTON STUFFED seven hundred six INGREDIENTS A small leg of mutton weighing six or seven lbs forcemeat No four hundred seventeen two shalots finely

by connoisseurs and medical men it stands first in favour whether its the favour digestible qualifications or general wholesomeness be considered Of all mutton that furnished by South Down sheep is the most highly esteemed it is also the dearest on account of its scarcity and the great demand of it Therefore if the housekeeper is told by the butcher that he has not any in his shop it should not occasion disappointment to the purchaser The London and other markets are chiefly supplied with sheep called half breeds which are a cross between the Down and Lincoln or Leicester These half breeds make a greater weight of mutton than the true South Downs and for this very desirable qualification they are preferred by the great sheep masters The legs of this mutton range from seven to eleven lbs in weight the shoulders necks or loins about six to nine lbs and if care is taken not to purchase it the shoulders necks or loins about eight to nine lbs and it cure is taken not to purchase it too fat it will be found the most satisfactory and economical mutton that can be bought BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON seven hundred eight INGREDIENTS one small leg of mutton four carrots three onions one faggot

the Good duke of Burgundy in fourteen twenty nine on the day of his marriage with the Princess Isabella of Portugal The number of the members was originally fixed at thirty one including the sovereign as the head and chief of the institution In fifteen sixteen Pope Leo X consented to increase the number to fifty two including the head In seventeen hundred the German emperor Charles VI and King Philip of Spain both laid claim to the order The former however on leaving Spain which he could not maintain by force of arms took with him to Vienna the archives of the order the inauguration of which he solemnized there in seventeen thirteen with great magnificence but Philip V of Spain declared himself Grand Master and formally protested at the congress of Cambrai seventeen twenty one against the pretensions of the emperor The dispute though subsequently settled by the intercession of France England and Holland was frequently renewed until the order was tacitly introduced into both countries and it now passes by the respective names of the Spanish or Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece according to the country where it is issued AN EXCELLENT WAY TO COOK A BREAST OF MUTTON seven

June to August NAMES OF ANIMALS SAXON AND OF THEIR FLESH NORMAN The names of all our domestic animals are of Saxon origin but it is curious to observe that Norman names have been given to the different sorts of flesh which these animals yield How beautifully this illustrates the relative position of Saxon and Norman after the Conquest The Saxon hind had the charge of tending and feeding the domestic animals but only that they might appear on the table of his Norman lord Thus ox steer cow are Saxon but beef is Norman calf is Saxon but veal Norman sheep is Saxon but mutton Norman so it is severally with deer and venison swine and pork fowl and pullet Bacon the only flesh which perhaps ever came within his reach is the single exception BROILED MUTTON AND TOMATO SAUCE Cold Meat

minutes to broil the mutton Seasonable in September and October when tomatoes are plentiful and seasonable SHEPHERDS AND THEIR FLOCKS The shepherd s crook is older than either the husbandman s plough or the warrior s sword We are told that Abel was a keeper of sheep Many passages in holy writ enable us to appreciate the pastoral riches of the first eastern nations and we can form an idea of the number of their flocks when we read that Jacob gave the children of Hamor a hundred sheep for the price of a field and that the king of Israel received a hundred thousand every year from the king of Moab his tributary and a like number of rams covered with their fleece The tendency which most sheep have to ramble renders it necessary for them to be attended by a shepherd To keep a flock within bounds is no easy task but the watchful shepherd manages to accomplish it without harassing the sheep In the Highlands of Scotland where the herbage is scanty the sheep farm requires to be very large and to be watched over by many shepherds The farms of some of the great Scottish landowners are of enormous extent How many sheep have you on your estate asked Prince Esterhazy of the duke of Argyll I have not the most remote idea replied the duke but I know the shepherds number several thousands BROILED MUTTON CHOPS seven hundred eleven INGREDIENTS Loin of mutton pepper and salt a small piece of

the Golden Fleece may be thus briefly told Phryxus a son of Athamus king of Thebes to escape the persecutions of his stepmother Ino paid a visit to his friend Aeetes king of Colchis A ram whose fleece was of pure gold carried the youth through the air in a most obliging manner to the court of his friend When safe At Colchis Phryxus offered the ram on the altars of Mars and pocketed the fleece The king received him with great kindness and gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage but some time after he murdered him in order to obtain possession of the precious fleece The murder of Phryxus was amply revenged by the Greeks It gave rise to the famous Argonautic expedition undertaken by Jason and fifty of the most celebrated heroes of Greece The Argonauts recovered the fleece by the help of the celebrated sorceress Medea daughter of Aeetes who fell desperately in love with the gallant but faithless Jason In the story of the voyage of the Argo a substratum of truth probably exists though overlaid by a mass of fiction The ram which carried Phryxus to Colchis is by some supposed to have been the name of the ship in which he embarked The fleece of gold is thought to represent the immense treasures he bore away from Thebes The alchemists of the fifteenth century were firmly convinced that the Golden Fleece was a treatise on the transmutation of metals written on sheepskin HARICOT

Many persons express a decided aversion to hashed mutton and doubtless this dislike has arisen from the fact that they have unfortunately never been properly served with this dish If properly done however the meat tender it ought to be as tender as when first roasted the gravy abundant and well flavoured and the sippets nicely toasted and the whole served neatly then hashed mutton is by no means to be despised and is infinitely more wholesome and appetizing than the cold leg or shoulder of which fathers and husbands and their bachelor friends stand in such natural awe HODGE PODGE Cold

minute shells and corals forms the sub soil of the hilly districts of the south east of England The chalk hills known as the South Downs start from the bold promontory of Beachy Head traverse the county of Sussex from east to west and pass through Hampshire into Surrey The North Downs extend from Godalming by Godstone into Kent and terminate in the line of cliffs which stretches from Dover to Ramsgate The Downs are clothed with short verdant turf but the layer of soil which rests upon the chalk is too thin to support trees and shrubs The hills have rounded summits and their smooth undulated outlines are unbroken save by the sepulchral monuments of the early inhabitants of the country The coombes and furrows which ramify and extend into deep valleys appear like dried up channels of streams and rivulets From time immemorial immense flocks of sheep have been reared on these downs The herbage of these hills is remarkably nutritious and whilst the natural healthiness of the climate consequent on the dryness of the air and the moderate elevation of the land is eminently favourable to rearing a superior race of sheep the arable land in the immediate neighbourhood of the Downs affords the means of a supply of other food when the natural produce of the hills fails The mutton of the South Down breed of sheep is highly valued for its delicate flavour and the wool for its fineness but the best specimens of this breed when imported from England into the West Indies become miserably lean in the course of a year or two and their woolly fleece gives place to a covering of short crisp brownish hair BROILED KIDNEYS a Breakfast or Supper Dish seven hundred twenty four INGREDIENTS Sheep kidneys pepper and salt to taste Mode Ascertain that the kidneys are fresh and cut them

oftentimes an opportunity for her to save as much money in her purchases of meat as will pay for the bread to eat with it It often occurs for instance that the butcher may have a superfluity of certain joints and these he would be glad to get rid of at a reduction of sometimes as much as oned or one one twod per lb and thus in a joint of eight or nine lbs will be saved enough to buy two quartern loaves It frequently happens with many butchers that in consequence of a demand for legs and loins of mutton they have only shoulders left and these they will be glad to sell at a reduction

keeping of flocks seems to have been the first employment of mankind and the most ancient sort of poetry was probably pastoral The poem known as the Pastoral gives a picture of the life of the simple shepherds of the golden age who are supposed to have beguiled their time in singing In all pastorals repeated allusions are made to the fleecy flocks the milk white lambs and the tender ewes indeed the sheep occupy a position in these poems inferior only to that of the shepherds who tend them The nibbling sheep has ever been a favourite of the poets and has supplied them with figures and similes without end Shakspere frequently compares men to sheep When Gloster rudely drives the lieutenant from the side of Henry VI the poor king thus touchingly speaks of his helplessness So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece And next his throat unto the butcher s knife In the Two Gentlemen of Verona we meet with the following humorous comparison Proteus The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep Speed Such another proof will make me cry baa The descriptive poets give us some charming pictures of sheep Every one is familiar with the sheep shearing scene in Thomson s Seasons Heavy and dripping to the breezy brow Slow move the harmless race where as they spread Their dwelling treasures to the sunny ray Inly disturb d and wond ring what this wild Outrageous tumult means their loud complaints The country fill and toss d from rock to rock Incessant bleatings run around the hills What an exquisite idea of stillness is conveyed in the oft quoted line from Gray s Elegy And drowsy tinklings lull the distant fold From Dyer s quaint poem of The Fleece we could cull a hundred passages relating to sheep but we have already exceeded our space We cannot however close this brief notice of the allusions that have been made to sheep by our poets without quoting a couple of verses from Robert Burns s Elegy on Poor Mailie his only pet yowe Thro a the town she troll d by him A lang half mile she could descry him Wi kindly bleat when she did spy him She ran wi speed A friend mair faithfu ne er cam nigh him Than Mailie dead I wat she was a sheep o sense An could behave hersel wi mense I ll say t she never brak a fence Thro thievish greed Our bardie lanely keeps the spence Sin Mailie s dead MUTTON COLLOPS Cold Meat Cookery seven hundred thirty one INGREDIENTS A few slices

and wool is rather arbitrary than natural consisting in the greater or less degrees of fineness softness and pliability of the fibres When the fibres possess these properties so far as to admit of their being spun and woven into a texture sufficiently pliable to be used as an article of dress they are called wool The sheep llama Angora goat and the goat of Thibet are the animals from which most of the wool used in manufactures is obtained The finest of all wools is that from the goat of Thibet of which the Cashmere shawls are made Of European wools the finest is that yielded by the Merino sheep the Spanish and Saxon breeds taking the precedence The Merino sheep as now naturalized in Australia furnishes an excellent fleece but all varieties of sheep wool reared either in Europe or Australia are inferior in softness of feel to that grown in India and to that of the llama of the Andes The best of our British wools are inferior in fineness to any of the above mentioned being

enough he was in most of these things even after no inconsiderable experience of society the world soon discovered a true poet He taught himself to write by copying the letters of a printed book as he lay watching his flock on the hillside and believed that he had reached the utmost pitch of his ambition when he first found that his artless rhymes could touch the heart of the ewe milker who partook the shelter of his mantle during the passing storm If the shepherd of Professor Wilson s Noctes Ambrosianae may be taken as a true portrait of James Hogg we must admit that for quaintness of humour the poet of Ettrick Forest had few rivals Sir Walter Scott said that Hogg s thousand little touches of absurdity afforded him more entertainment than the best comedy that ever set the pit in a roar Among the written productions of the shepherd poet is an account of his own experiences in sheep tending called The Shepherd s Calender This work contains a vast amount of useful information upon sheep their diseases habits and management The Ettrick Shepherd died in eighteen thirty five SHEEP S BRAINS EN MATELOTE an Entree seven hundred forty INGREDIENTS six sheep s brains vinegar salt a few

number of lambs consumed in sacrifices by the Hebrews must have been very considerable Two lambs of the first year were appointed to be sacrificed daily for the morning and evening sacrifice and a lamb served as a substitute for the first born of unclean animals such as the ass which could not be accepted as an offering to the Lord Every year also on the anniversary of the deliverance of the children of Israel from the bondage of Egypt every family was ordered to sacrifice a lamb or kid and to sprinkle some of its blood upon the door posts in commemoration of the judgment of God upon the Egyptians It was to be eaten roasted with unleavened bread and bitter herbs in haste with the loins girded the shoes on the feet and the staff in the hand and whatever remained until the morning was to be burnt The sheep was also used in the numerous special individual and national sacrifices ordered by the Jewish law On extraordinary occasions vast quantities of sheep were sacrificed at once

Sufficient three sweetbreads for one entree Seasonable from Easter to Michaelmas MUTTON AND LAMB CARVING HAUNCH OF MUTTON Illustration HAUNCH OF MUTTON seven hundred fifty nine A deep cut should in the first place be made quite down to the bone across the knuckle end of the joint along the line one to two This will let the gravy escape and then it should be carved in not too thick slices along the whole length of the haunch in the direction of the line from four to three Illustration LEG OF MUTTON LEG OF MUTTON seven hundred sixty This homely but capital English joint is almost invariably served at table as shown in the engraving The carving of it is not very difficult the knife should be carried sharply down in the direction of the line from one to two and slices taken from either side as the guests may desire some liking the knuckle end as well done and others preferring the more underdone part The fat should be sought near the line three to four Some connoisseurs are fond of having this joint dished with the under side uppermost so as to get at the finely grained meat lying under that part of the meat known as the Pope s eye but this is an extravagant fashion and one that will hardly find favour in the eyes of many economical British housewives and housekeepers LOIN OF MUTTON Illustration LOIN OF MUTTON seven hundred sixty one There is one point in connection with carving a loin of mutton which includes every other that is that the joint should be thoroughly well jointed by the butcher before it is cooked This knack of jointing requires practice and the proper tools and no one but the butcher is supposed to have these If the bones be not well jointed the carving of a loin of mutton is not a gracious business whereas if that has been attended to it is an easy and untroublesome task The knife should be inserted at fig one and after feeling your way between the bones it should be carried sharply in the direction of the line one to two As there are some people who prefer the outside cut while others do not like it the question as to their choice of this should be asked SADDLE OF MUTTON Illustration SADDLE OF MUTTON seven hundred sixty two Although we have heard at various intervals growlings expressed at the inevitable saddle of mutton at the dinner parties of our middle classes yet we doubt whether any other joint is better liked when it has been well hung and artistically cooked There is a diversity of opinion respecting the mode of sending this joint to table but it has only reference to whether or no there shall be any portion of the tail or if so how many joints of the tail We ourselves prefer the mode as shown in our coloured illustration O but others may upon equally good grounds like the way shown in the engraving on this page Some trim the tail with a paper frill The carving is not difficult it is usually cut in the direction of the line from two to one quite down to the bones in evenly sliced pieces A fashion however patronized by some is to carve it obliquely in the direction of the line from four to three in which case the joint would be turned round the other way having the tail end on the right of the carver SHOULDER OF MUTTON Illustration SHOULDER OF MUTTON seven hundred sixty three This is a joint not difficult to carve The knife should be drawn from the outer edge of the shoulder in the direction of the line from one to two until the bone of the shoulder is reached As many slices as can be carved in this manner should be taken and afterwards the meat lying on either side of the blade bone should be served by carving in the direction of three to four and three to four The uppermost side of the shoulder being now finished the joint should be turned and slices taken off along its whole length There are some who prefer this under side of the shoulder for its juicy flesh although the grain of the meat is not so fine as that on the other side FORE QUARTER OF LAMB Illustration FORE QUARTER OF LAMB seven hundred sixty four We always think that a good and practised carver delights in the manipulation of this joint for there is a little field for his judgment and dexterity which does not always occur The separation of the shoulder from the breast is the first point to be attended to this is done by passing the knife lightly round the dotted line as shown by the figures one two three four and five so as to cut through the skin and then by raising with a little force the shoulder into which the fork should be firmly fixed it will come away with just a little more exercise of the knife In dividing the shoulder and breast the carver should take care not to cut away too much of the meat from the latter as that would rather spoil its appearance when the shoulder is removed The breast and shoulder being separated it is usual to lay a small piece of butter and sprinkle a little cayenne lemon juice and salt between them and when this is melted and incorporated with the meat and gravy the shoulder may as more convenient be removed into another dish The next operation is to separate the ribs from the brisket by cutting through the meat on the line five to six The joint is then ready to be served to the guests the ribs being carved in the direction of the lines from nine to ten and the brisket from seven to eight The carver should ask those at the table what parts they prefer ribs brisket or a piece of the shoulder LEG OF LAMB LOIN OF LAMB SADDLE OF LAMB SHOULDER OF LAMB are carved in the same manner as the corresponding joints of mutton See Nos seven hundred sixty seven hundred sixty one seven hundred sixty two seven hundred sixty three Illustration CHAPTER XVI GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE COMMON HOG seven hundred sixty five THE HOG belongs to the order Mammalia the genus Sus scrofa and the species Pachydermata or thick skinned and its generic characters are a small head with long flexible snout truncated forty two teeth divided into four upper incisors converging six lower incisors projecting two upper and two lower canine or tusks the former short the latter projecting formidable and sharp and fourteen molars in each jaw cloven feet furnished with four toes and tail small short and twisted while in some varieties this appendage is altogether wanting seven hundred sixty six FROM THE NUMBER AND POSITION OF THE TEETH physiologists are enabled to define the nature and functions of the animal and from those of the Sus or hog it is evident that he is as much a grinder as a biter or can live as well on vegetable as on animal food though a mixture of both is plainly indicated as the character of food most conducive to the integrity and health of its physical system seven hundred sixty seven THUS THE PIG TRIBE though not a ruminating mammal as might be inferred from the number of its molar teeth is yet a link between the herbivorous and the carnivorous tribes and is consequently what is known as an omnivorous quadruped or in other words capable of converting any kind of aliment into nutriment seven hundred sixty eight THOUGH THE HOOF IN THE HOG is as a general rule cloven there are several remarkable exceptions as in the species native to Norway Illyria Sardinia and formerly to the Berkshire variety of the British domesticated pig in which the hoof is entire and un cleft seven hundred sixty nine WHATEVER DIFFERENCE IN ITS PHYSICAL NATURE climate and soil may produce in this animal his functional characteristics are the same in whatever part of the world he may be found and whether in the trackless forests of South America the coral isles of Polynesia the jungles of India or the spicy brakes of Sumatra he is everywhere known for his gluttony laziness and indifference to the character and quality of his food And though he occasionally shows an epicure s relish for a succulent plant or a luscious carrot which he will discuss with all his salivary organs keenly excited he will the next moment turn with equal gusto to some carrion offal that might excite the forbearance of the unscrupulous cormorant It is this coarse and repulsive mode of feeding that has in every country and language obtained for him the opprobrium of being an unclean animal seven hundred seventy IN THE MOSAICAL LAW the pig is condemned as an unclean beast and consequently interdicted to the Israelites as unfit for human food And the swine though he divideth the hoof and be cloven footed yet he cheweth not the cud He is unclean to you Lev xi seven Strict however as the law was respecting the cud chewing and hoof divided animals the Jews with their usual perversity and violation of the divine commands seem afterwards to have ignored the prohibition for unless they ate pork it is difficult to conceive for what purpose they kept troves of swine as from the circumstance recorded in Matthew xviii thirty two when Jesus was in Galilee and the devils cast out of the two men were permitted to enter the herd of swine that were feeding on the hills in the neighbourhood of the Sea of Tiberias it is very evident they did There is only one interpretation by which we can account for a prohibition that debarred the Jews from so many foods which we regard as nutritious luxuries that being fat and the texture more hard of digestion than other meats they were likely in a hot dry climate where vigorous exercise could seldom be taken to produce disease and especially cutaneous affections indeed in this light as a code of sanitary ethics the book of Leviticus is the most admirable system of moral government ever conceived for man s benefit seven hundred seventy one SETTING HIS COARSE FEEDING AND SLOVENLY HABITS OUT OF THE QUESTION there is no domestic animal so profitable or so useful to man as the much maligned pig or any that yields him a more varied or more luxurious repast The prolific powers of the pig are extraordinary even under the restraint of domestication but when left to run wild in favourable situations as in the islands of the South Pacific the result in a few years from two animals put on shore and left undisturbed is truly surprising for they breed so fast and have such numerous litters that unless killed off in vast numbers both for the use of the inhabitants and as fresh provisions for ships crews they would degenerate into vermin In this country the pig has usually two litters or farrows in a year the breeding seasons being April and October and the period the female goes with her young is about four months sixteen weeks or one hundred twenty two days The number produced at each litter depends upon the character of the breed twelve being the average number in the small variety and ten in the large in the mixed breeds however the average is between ten and fifteen and in some instances has reached as many as twenty But however few or however many young pigs there may be to the farrow there is always one who is the dwarf of the family circle a poor little shrivelled half starved anatomy with a small melancholy voice a staggering gait a woe begone countenance and a thread of a tail whose existence the complacent mother ignores his plethoric brothers and sisters repudiate and for whose emaciated jaws there is never a spare or supplemental teat till one of the favoured gormandizers overtaken by momentary oblivion drops the lacteal fountain and gives the little squeaking straggler the chance of a momentary mouthful This miserable little object which may be seen bringing up the rear of every litter is called the Tony pig or the Anthony so named it is presumed from being the one always assigned to the Church when tithe was taken in kind and as saint Anthony was the patron of husbandry his name was given in a sort of bitter derision to the starveling that constituted his dues for whether there are ten or fifteen farrows to the litter the Anthony is always the last of the family to come into the world seven hundred seventy two FROM THE GROSSNESS OF HIS FEEDING the large amount of aliment he consumes his gluttonous way of eating it from his slothful habits laziness and indulgence in sleep the pig is particularly liable to disease and especially indigestion heartburn and affections of the skin seven hundred seventy three TO COUNTERACT THE CONSEQUENCE OF A VIOLATION OF THE PHYSICAL LAWS a powerful monitor in the brain of the pig teaches him to seek for relief and medicine To open the pores of his skin blocked up with mud and excite perspiration he resorts to a tree a stump or his trough anything rough and angular and using it as a curry comb to his body obtains the luxury of a scratch and the benefit of cuticular evaporation he next proceeds with his long supple snout to grub up antiscorbutic roots cooling salads of mallow and dandelion and greatest treat of all he stumbles on a piece of chalk or a mouthful of delicious cinder which he knows by instinct is the most sovereign remedy in the world for that hot unpleasant sensation he has had all the morning at his stomach seven hundred seventy four IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT that though every one who keeps a pig knows how prone he is to disease how that disease injures the quality of the meat and how eagerly he pounces on a bit of coal or cinder or any coarse dry substance that will adulterate the rich food on which he lives and by affording soda to his system correct the vitiated fluids of his body yet very few have the judgment to act on what they see and by supplying the pig with a few shovelfuls of cinders in his sty save the necessity of his rooting for what is so needful to his health Instead of this however and without supplying the animal with what its instinct craves for his nostril is bored with a red hot iron and a ring clinched in his nose to prevent rooting for what he feels to be absolutely necessary for his health and ignoring the fact that in a domestic state at least the pig lives on the richest of all food scraps of cooked animal substances boiled vegetables bread and other items given in that concentrated essence of aliment for a quadruped called wash and that he eats to repletion takes no exercise and finally sleeps all the twenty four hours he is not eating and then when the animal at last seeks for those medicinal aids which would obviate the evil of such a forcing diet his keeper instead of meeting his animal instinct by human reason and giving him what he seeks has the inhumanity to torture him by a ring that keeping up a perpetual raw in the pig s snout prevents his digging for those corrective drugs which would remove the evils of his artificial existence seven hundred seventy five THOUGH SUBJECT TO SO MANY DISEASES no domestic animal is more easily kept in health cleanliness and comfort and this without the necessity of ringing or any excessive desire of the hog to roam break through his sty or plough up his pound Whatever the kind of food may be on which the pig is being fed or fattened a teaspoonful or more of salt should always be given in his mess of food and a little heap of well burnt cinders with occasional bits of chalk should always be kept by the side of his trough as well as a vessel of clean water his pound or the front part of his sty should be totally free from straw the brick flooring being every day swept out and sprinkled with a layer of sand His lair or sleeping apartment should be well sheltered by roof and sides from cold wet and all changes of weather and the bed made up of a good supply of clean straw sufficiently deep to enable the pig to burrow his unprotected body beneath it All the refuse of the garden in the shape of roots leaves and stalks should be placed in a corner of his pound or feeding chamber for the delectation of his leisure moments and once a week on the family washing day a pail of warm soap suds should be taken into his sty and by means of a scrubbing brush and soap his back shoulders and flanks should be well cleaned a pail of clean warm water being thrown over his body at the conclusion before he is allowed to retreat to his clean straw to dry himself By this means the excessive nutrition of his aliment will be corrected a more perfect digestion insured and by opening the pores of the skin a more vigorous state of health acquired than could have been obtained under any other system seven hundred seventy six WE HAVE ALREADY SAID that no other animal yields man so many kinds and varieties of luxurious food as is supplied to him by the flesh of the hog differently prepared for almost every part of the animal either fresh salted or dried is used for food and even those viscera not so employed are of the utmost utility in a domestic point of view seven hundred seventy seven THOUGH DESTITUTE OF THE HIDE HORNS AND HOOFS constituting the offal of most domestic animals the pig is not behind the other mammalia in its usefulness to man Its skin especially that of the boar from its extreme closeness of texture when tanned is employed for the seats of saddles to cover powder shot and drinking flasks and the hair according to its colour flexibility and stubbornness is manufactured into tooth nail and hairbrushes others into hat clothes and shoe brushes while the longer and finer qualities are made into long and short brooms and painters brushes and a still more rigid description under the name of bristles are used by the shoemaker as needles for the passage of his wax end Besides so many benefits and useful services conferred on man by this valuable animal his fat in a commercial sense is quite as important as his flesh and brings a price equal to the best joints in the carcase This fat is rendered or melted out of the caul or membrane in which it is contained by boiling water and while liquid run into prepared bladders when under the name of lard it becomes an article of extensive trade and value seven hundred seventy eight OF THE NUMEROUS VARIETIES OF THE DOMESTICATED HOG the following list of breeds may be accepted as the best presenting severally all those qualities aimed at in the rearing of domestic stock as affecting both the breeder and the consumer Native Berkshire Essex York and Cumberland Foreign the Chinese Before however proceeding with the consideration of the different orders in the series we have placed them it will be necessary to make a few remarks relative to the pig generally In the first place the Black Pig is regarded by breeders as the best and most eligible animal not only from the fineness and delicacy of the skin but because it is less affected by the heat in summer and far less subject to cuticular disease than either the white or brindled hog but more particularly from its kindlier nature and greater aptitude to fatten seven hundred seventy nine THE GREAT QUALITY FIRST SOUGHT FOR IN A HOG is a capacious stomach and next a healthy power of digestion for the greater the quantity he can eat and the more rapidly he can digest what he has eaten the more quickly will he fatten and the faster he can be made to increase in flesh without a material increase of bone the better is the breed considered and the more valuable the animal In the usual order of nature the development of flesh and enlargement of bone proceed together but here the object is to outstrip the growth of the bones by the quicker development of their fleshy covering seven hundred eighty THE CHIEF POINTS SOUGHT FOR IN THE CHOICE OF A HOG are breadth of chest depth of carcase width of loin chine and ribs compactness of form docility cheerfulness and general beauty of appearance The head in a well bred hog must not be too long the forehead narrow and convex cheeks full snout fine mouth small eyes small and quick ears short thin and sharp pendulous and pointing forwards neck full and broad particularly on the top where it should join very broad shoulders the ribs loin and haunch should be in a uniform line and the tail well set neither too high nor too low at the same time the back is to be straight or slightly curved the chest deep broad and prominent the legs short and thick the belly when well fattened should nearly touch the ground the hair be long thin fine and having few bristles and whatever the colour uniform either white black or blue but not spotted speckled brindled or sandy Such are the features and requisites that among breeders and judges constitute the beau ideal of a perfect pig Illustration BERKSHIRE SOW seven hundred eighty one THE BERKSHIRE PIG IS THE BEST KNOWN AND MOST ESTEEMED of all our English domestic breeds and so highly is it regarded that even the varieties of the stock are in as great estimation as the parent breed itself The characteristics of the Berkshire hog are that it has a tawny colour spotted with black large ears hanging over the eyes a thick close and well made body legs short and small in the bone feeds up to a great weight fattens quickly and is good either for pork or bacon The New or Improved Berkshire possesses all the above qualities but is infinitely more prone to fatten while the objectionable colour has been entirely done away with being now either all white or completely black Illustration ESSEX SOW seven hundred eighty two NEXT TO THE FORMER THE ESSEX takes place in public estimation always competing and often successfully with the Berkshire The peculiar characters of the Essex breed are that it is tip eared has a long sharp head is roach backed with a long flat body standing high on the legs is rather bare of hair is a quick feeder has an enormous capacity of stomach and belly and an appetite to match its receiving capability Its colour is white or else black and white and it has a restless habit and an unquiet disposition The present valuable stock has sprung from a cross between the common native animal and either the White Chinese or Black Neapolitan breeds Illustration YORKSHIRE SOW seven hundred eighty three THE YORKSHIRE CALLED ALSO THE OLD LINCOLNSHIRE was at one time the largest stock of the pig family in England and perhaps at that time the worst It was long legged weak in the loins with coarse white curly hair and flabby flesh Now however it has undergone as great a change as any breed in the kingdom and by judicious crossing has become the most valuable we possess being a very well formed pig throughout with a good head a pleasant docile countenance with moderate sized drooping ears a broad back slightly curved large chine and loins with deep sides full chest and well covered with long thickly set white hairs Besides these qualities of form he is a quick grower feeds fast and will easily make from twenty to twenty five stone before completing his first year The quality of the meat is also uncommonly good the fat and lean being laid on in almost equal proportions So capable is this species of development both in flesh and stature that examples of the Yorkshire breed have been exhibited weighing as much as a Scotch ox Illustration CUMBERLAND SOW seven hundred eighty four THOUGH ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY IN ENGLAND can boast some local variety or other of this useful animal obtained from the native stock by crossing with some of the foreign kinds Cumberland and the north west parts of the kingdom have been celebrated for a small breed of white pigs with a thick compact and well made body short in the legs the head and back well formed ears slouching and a little downwards and on the whole a hardy profitable animal and one well disposed to fatten seven hundred eighty five THERE IS NO VARIETY OF THIS USEFUL ANIMAL that presents such peculiar features as the species known to us as the Chinese pig and as it is the general belief that to this animal and the Neapolitan hog we are indebted for that remarkable improvement which has taken place in the breeds of the English pig it is necessary to be minute in the description of this in all respects singular animal The Chinese in the first place consists of many varieties and presents as many forms of body as differences of colour the best kind however has a beautiful white skin of singular thinness and delicacy the hair too is perfectly white and thinly set over the body with here and there a few bristles He has a broad snout short head eyes bright and fiery very small fine pink ears wide cheeks high chine with a neck of such immense thickness that when the animal is fat it looks like an elongated carcase a mass of fat without shape or form like a feather pillow The belly is dependent and almost trailing on the ground the legs very short and the tail so small as to be little more than a rudiment It has a ravenous appetite and will eat anything that the wonderful assimilating powers of its stomach can digest and to that capability there seems no limit in the whole range of animal or vegetable nature The consequence of this perfect and singularly rapid digestion is an unprecedented proneness to obesity a process of fattening that once commenced goes on with such rapid development that in a short time it loses all form depositing such an amount of fat that it in fact ceases to have any refuse part or offal and beyond the hair on its back and the callous extremity of the snout the whole carcase is eatable Illustration CHINESE SOW seven hundred eighty six WHEN JUDICIOUSLY FED ON VEGETABLE DIET and this obese tendency checked the flesh of the Chinese pig is extremely delicate and delicious but when left to gorge almost exclusively on animal food it becomes oily coarse and unpleasant Perhaps there is no other instance in nature where the effect of rapid and perfect digestion is so well shown as in this animal which thrives on everything and turns to the benefit of its physical economy food of the most opposite nature and of the most unwholesome and offensive character When fully fattened the thin cuticle that is one of its characteristics cracks from the adipose distension beneath exposing the fatty mass which discharges a liquid oil from the adjacent tissues The great fault in this breed is the remarkably small quantity of lean laid down to the immense proportion of fat Some idea of the growth of this species may be inferred from the fact of their attaining to eighteen stone before two years and when further advanced as much as forty stone In its pure state except for roasters the Chinese pig is too disproportionate for the English market but when crossed with some of our lean stock the breed becomes almost invaluable Illustration WESTPHALIAN BOAR seven hundred eighty seven THE WILD BOAR is a much more cleanly and sagacious animal than the domesticated hog he is longer in the snout has his ears shorter and his tusks considerably longer very frequently measuring as much as ten inches They are extremely sharp and are bent in an upward circle Unlike his domestic brother who roots up here and there or wherever his fancy takes the wild boar ploughs the ground in continuous lines or furrows The boar when selected as the parent of a stock should have a small head be deep and broad in the chest the chine should be arched the ribs and barrel well rounded with the haunches falling full down nearly to the hock and he should always be more compact and smaller than the female The colour of the wild boar is always of a uniform hue and generally of an iron grey shading off into a black The hair of the boar is of considerable length especially about the head and mane he stands in general from twenty to thirty inches in height at the shoulders though instances have occurred where he has reached forty two inches The young are of a pale yellowish tint irregularly brindled with light brown The boar of Germany is a large and formidable animal and the hunting of him with a small species of mastiff is still a national sport From living almost exclusively on acorns and nuts his flesh is held in great esteem and in Westphalia his legs are made into hams by a process which it is said enhances the flavour and quality of the meat in a remarkable degree seven hundred eighty eight THERE ARE TWO POINTS to be taken into consideration by all breeders of pigs to what ultimate use is the flesh to be put for if meant to be eaten fresh or simply salted the small breed of pigs is host suited for the purpose if for hams or bacon the large variety of the animal is necessary Pigs are usually weaned between six and eight weeks after birth after which they are fed on soft food such as mashed potatoes in skimmed or butter milk The general period at which the small hogs are killed for the market is from twelve to sixteen weeks from four to five mouths they are called store pigs and are turned out to graze till the animal has acquired its full stature As soon as this point has been reached the pig should be forced to maturity as quickly as possible he should therefore be taken from the fields and farm yard and shut up on boiled potatoes buttermilk and peas meal after a time to be followed by grains oil cake wash barley and Indian meal supplying his sty at the same time with plenty of water cinders and a quantity of salt in every mess of food presented to him seven hundred eighty nine THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF PIGS IN GREAT BRITAIN is supposed to exceed twenty millions and considering the third of the number as worth Ltwo apiece and the remaining two thirds as of the relative value of tens each would give a marketable estimate of over Ltwenty million for this animal alone seven hundred ninety THE BEST AND MOST HUMANE MODE OF KILLING ALL LARGE HOGS is to strike them down like a bullock with the pointed end of a poleaxe on the forehead which has the effect of killing the animal at once all the butcher has then to do is to open the aorta and great arteries and laying the animal s neck over a trough let out the blood as quickly as possible The carcase is then to be scalded either on a board or by immersion in a tub of very hot water and all the hair and dirt rapidly scraped off till the skin is made perfectly white when it is hung up opened and dressed as it is called in the usual way It is then allowed to cool a sheet being thrown around the carcase to prevent the air from discolouring the newly cleaned skin When meant for bacon the hair is singed instead of being scalded off seven hundred ninety one IN THE COUNTRY where for ordinary consumption the pork killed for sale is usually both larger and fatter than that supplied to the London consumer it is customary to remove the skin and fat down to the lean and salting that roast what remains of the joint Pork goes further and is consequently a more economical food than other meats simply because the texture is closer and there is less waste in the cooking either in roasting or boiling seven hundred ninety two IN FRESH PORK the leg is the most economical family joint and the loin the richest seven hundred ninety three COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING very little difference exists between the weight of the live and dead pig and this simply because there is neither the head nor the hide to be removed It has been proved that pork loses in cooking thirteen one two per cent of its weight A salted hand weighing four lbs five oz lost in the cooking eleven oz after cooking the meat weighing only three lbs one oz and the bone nine oz The original cost was seven one twod a pound but by this deduction the cost rose to nined per pound with the bone and ten one fourd without it seven hundred ninety four PORK TO BE PRESERVED is cured in several ways either by covering it with salt or immersing it in ready made brine where it is kept till required or it is only partially salted and then hung up to dry when the meat is called white bacon or after salting it is hung in wood smoke till the flesh is impregnated with the aroma from the wood The Wiltshire bacon which is regarded as the finest in the kingdom is prepared by laying the sides of a hog in large wooden troughs and then rubbing into the flesh quantities of powdered bay salt made hot in a frying pan This process is repeated for four days they are then left for three weeks merely turning the flitches every other day After that time they are hung up to dry The hogs usually killed for purposes of bacon in England average from eighteen to twenty stone on the other hand the hogs killed in the country for farm house purposes seldom weigh less than twenty six stone The legs of boars hogs and in Germany those of bears are prepared differently and called hams seven hundred ninety five THE PRACTICE IN VOGUE FORMERLY in this country was to cut out the hams and cure them separately then to remove the ribs which were roasted as spare ribs and curing the remainder of the side call it a gammon of bacon Small pork to cut for table in joints is cut up in most places throughout the kingdom as represented in the engraving The sale is divided with nine ribs to the fore quarter and the following is an enumeration of the joints in the two respective quarters one The leg HIND QUARTER two The loin three The spring or belly four The hand FORE QUARTER five The fore loin six The cheek Illustration SIDE OF A PIG SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS The weight of the several joints of a good pork pig of four stone may be as follows viz The leg eight lbs The loin and spring seven lbs The hand six lbs The chine seven lbs The cheek from two to three lbs Of a bacon pig the legs are reserved for curing and when cured are called hams when the meat is separated from the shoulder blade and bones and cured it is called bacon The bones with part of the meat left on them are divided into spare ribs griskins and chines CHAPTER XVII PORK CUTLETS Cold Meat Cookery seven hundred ninety six INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast loin

wild swine while among the wandering tribes peopling the interior of Hungary and spreading over the vast steppes of that country droves of swine form a great portion of the wealth of the people who chiefly live on a coarse bread and wind dried bacon In German Switzerland the Tyrol and other mountainous districts of continental Europe though the inhabitants almost everywhere as in England keep one or more pigs they are at little or no trouble in feeding them one or more men being employed by one or several villages as swine herds who at a certain hour every morning call for the pig or pigs and driving them to their feeding grounds on the mountain side and in the wood take custody of the herd till on the approach of night they are collected into a compact body and driven home for a night s repose in their several sties The amount of intelligence and docility displayed by the pigs in these mountain regions is much more considerable than that usually allowed to this animal and the manner in which these immense herds of swine are collected and again distributed without an accident or mistake is a sight both curious and interesting for it is all done without the assistance of a dog or the aid even of the human voice and solely by the crack of the long lashed and heavily loaded whip which the swine herd carries and cracks much after the fashion of the French postilion and which though he frequently cracks waking a hundred sharp echoes from the woods and rocks he seldom has to use correctionally the animal soon acquiring a thorough knowledge of the meaning of each crack and once having felt its leaded thong a lasting remembrance of its power At early dawn the swine herd takes his stand at the outskirts of the first village and begins flourishing through the misty air his immensely long lash keeping a sort of rude time with the crack crack crack crack crack crack of his whip The nearest pigs hearing the well remembered sound rouse from their straw and rush from their sties into the road followed by all their litters As soon as a sufficient number are collected the drove is set in motion receiving right and left as they advance fresh numbers whole communities or solitary individuals streaming in from all quarters and taking their place without distinction in the general herd and as if conscious where their breakfast lay without wasting a moment on idle investigation all eagerly push on to the mountains In this manner village after village is collected till the drove not unfrequently consists of several thousands The feeding ground has of course often to be changed and the drove have sometimes to be driven many miles and to a considerable height up the mountain before the whip gives the signal for the dispersion of the body and the order to feed when the herdsman proceeds to form himself a shelter and look after his own comfort for the rest of the day As soon as twilight sets in the whip is again heard echoing the signal for muster and in the same order in which they were collected the swine are driven back each group tailing off to its respective sty as the herd approaches the villages till the last grunter having found his home the drover seeks his cottage and repose PORK CUTLETS OR CHOPS I seven hundred ninety seven INGREDIENTS Loin of pork pepper and salt to taste Mode Cut the cutlets from a delicate loin of pork bone and

Nimrod has only been considered second to the more dangerous sport of lion hunting The buried treasures of Nineveh restored to us by mister Layard show us on their sculptured annals the kings of Assyria in their royal pastime of boar hunting That the Greeks were passionately attached to this sport we know both from history and the romantic fables of the poets Marc Antony at one of his breakfasts with Cleopatra had eight wild boars roasted whole and though the Romans do not appear to have been addicted to hunting wild boar fights formed part of their gladiatorial shows in the amphitheatre In France Germany and Britain from the earliest time the boar hunt formed one of the most exciting of sports but it was only in this country that the sport was conducted without dogs a real hand to hand contest of man and beast the hunter armed only with a boar spear a weapon about four feet long the ash staff guarded by plates of steel and terminating in a long narrow and very sharp blade this with a hunting knife or hanger completed his offensive arms Thus equipped the hunter would either encounter his enemy face to face confront his desperate charge as with erect tail depressed head and flaming eyes he rushed with his foamy tusks full against him who either sought to pierce his vitals through his counter or driving his spear through his chine transfix his heart or failing those more difficult aims plunge it into his flank and without withdrawing the weapon strike his ready hanger into his throat But expert as the hunter might be it was not often the formidable brute was so quickly dispatched for he would sometimes seize the spear in his powerful teeth and nip it off like a reed or coming full tilt on his enemy by his momentum and weight bear him to the earth ripping up with a horrid gash his leg or side and before the writhing hunter could draw his knife the infuriated beast would plunge his snout in the wound and rip with savage teeth the bowels of his victim At other times he would suddenly swerve from his charge and doubling on his opponent attack the hunter in the rear From his speed great weight and savage disposition the wild boar is always a dangerous antagonist and requires great courage coolness and agility on the part of the hunter The continental sportsman rides to the chase in a cavalcade with music and dogs a kind of small hound or mastiff and leaving all the honorary part of the contest to them when the boar is becoming weary and while beset by the dogs rides up and drives his lance home in the beast s back or side Boar hunting has been for some centuries obsolete in England the animal no longer existing in a wild state among us but in our Indian empire and especially in Bengal the pastime is pursued by our countrymen with all the daring of the national character and as the animal which inhabits the cane brakes and jungles is a formidable foe the sport is attended with great excitement The hunters mounted on small active horses and armed only with long lances ride at early daylight to the skirts of the jungle and having sent in their attendants to beat the cover wait till the tusked monster comes crashing from among the canes when chase is immediately given till he is come up with and transfixed by the first weapon Instead of flight however he often turns to bay and by more than one dead horse and wounded hunter shows how formidable he is and what those polished tusks sharp as pitch forks can effect when the enraged animal defends his life TO GLAZE HAM See Recipe No four hundred

FORMERLY PASTURED AND FED Though unquestionably far greater numbers of swine are now kept in England than formerly every peasant having one or more of that useful animal in feudal times immense droves of pigs were kept by the franklings and barons in those days the swine herds being a regular part of the domestic service of every feudal household their duty consisted in daily driving the herd of swine from the castle yard or outlying farm to the nearest woods chase or forest where the frankling or vavasour had either by right or grant what was called free warren or the liberty to feed his hogs off the acorns beech and chestnuts that lay in such abundance on the earth and far exceeded the power of the royal or privileged game to consume Indeed it was the license granted the nobles of free warren especially for their swine that kept up the iniquitous forest laws to so late a date and covered so large a portion of the land with such immense tracts of wood and brake to the injury of agriculture and the misery of the people Some idea of the extent to which swine were grazed in the feudal times may be formed by observing the number of pigs still fed in Epping Forest the Forest of Dean and the New Forest in Hampshire where for several months of the year the beech nuts and acorns yield them so plentiful a diet In Germany where the chestnut is so largely cultivated the amount of food shed every autumn is enormous and consequently the pig both wild and domestic has for a considerable portion of the year an unfailing supply of admirable nourishment Impressed with the value of this fruit for the food of pigs the Prince Consort has with great judgment of late encouraged the collection of chestnuts in Windsor Park and by giving a small reward to old people and children for every bushel collected has not only found an occupation for many of the unemployed poor but by providing a gratuitous food for their pig encouraged a feeling of providence and economy FOR CURING BACON AND KEEPING IT FREE FROM RUST Cobbett s Recipe eight hundred six THE TWO SIDES THAT REMAIN and which are called flitches are to be cured for bacon They are first rubbed with salt on their insides or flesh sides then placed one on the other the flesh sides uppermost in a salting trough which has a gutter round its edges to drain away the brine for to have sweet and fine bacon the flitches must not be sopping in brine which gives it the sort of vile taste that barrel and sea pork have Every one knows how different is the taste of fresh dry salt from that of salt in a dissolved state therefore change the salt often once in four or five days let it melt and sink in but not lie too long twice change the flitches put that at bottom which was first on the top this mode will cost you a great deal more in salt than the sopping mode but without it your bacon will not be so sweet and fine nor keep so well As for the time required in making your flitches sufficiently salt it depends on circumstances It takes a longer time for a thick than a thin flitch and longer in dry than in damp weather or in a dry than in a damp place but for the flitches of a hog of five score in weather not very dry or damp about six weeks may do and as yours is to be fat which receives little injury from over salting give time enough for you are to have bacon until Christmas comes again eight hundred seven THE PLACE FOR SALTING SHOULD like a dairy always be cool but well ventilated confined air though cool will taint meat sooner than the midday day sun accompanied by a breeze With regard to smoking the bacon two precautions are necessary first to hang the flitches where no rain comes down upon them and next that the smoke must proceed from wood not peat turf or coal As to the time required to smoke a flitch it depends a good deal upon whether there be a constant fire beneath and whether the fire be large or small a month will do if the fire be pretty constant and rich as a farmhouse fire usually is but over smoking or rather too long hanging in the air makes the bacon rust great attention should therefore be paid to this matter The flitch ought not to be dried up to the hardness of a board and yet it ought to be perfectly dry Before you hang it up lay it on the floor scatter the flesh side pretty thickly over with bran or with some fine sawdust not of deal or fir rub it on the flesh or pat it well down upon it this keeps the smoke from getting into the little openings and makes a sort of crust to be dried on eight hundred eight To KEEP THE BACON SWEET AND GOOD and free from hoppers sift fine some clean and dry wood ashes Put some at the bottom of a box or chest long enough to hold a flitch of bacon lay in one flitch and then put in more ashes then another flitch and cover this with six or eight inches of the ashes The place where the box or chest is kept ought to be dry and should the ashes become damp they should be put in the fireplace to dry and when cold put back again With these precautions the bacon will be as good at the end of the year as on the first day eight hundred nine FOR SIMPLE GENERAL RULES these may be safely taken as a guide and those who implicitly follow the directions given will possess at the expiration of from six weeks to two months well flavoured and well cured bacon HOG NOT BACON ANECDOTE OF LORD BACON As Lord Bacon on one occasion was about to pass sentence of death upon a man of the name of Hogg who had just been tried for a long career of crime the prisoner suddenly claimed to be heard in arrest of judgment saying with an expression of arch confidence as he addressed the bench I claim indulgence my lord on the plea of relationship for I am convinced your lordship will never be unnatural enough to hang one of your own family Indeed replied the judge with some amazement I was not aware that I had the honour of your alliance perhaps you will be good enough to name the degree of our mutual affinity I am sorry my lord returned the impudent thief I cannot trace the links of consanguinity but the moral evidence is sufficiently pertinent My name my lord is Hogg your lordship s is Bacon and all the world will allow that bacon and hog are very closely allied I am sorry replied his lordship I cannot admit the truth of your instance hog cannot be bacon till it is hanged and so before I can admit your plea or acknowledge the family compact Hogg must be hanged to morrow morning TO BAKE A HAM eight hundred ten INGREDIENTS Ham a common crust Mode As a ham for baking should be well soaked let it remain in water for at least twelve hours Wipe it dry trim away any rusty places underneath and cover it with a common crust taking care that this is of sufficient thickness all over to keep the gravy in Place it in a moderately heated oven and bake for nearly four hours Take off the crust and skin and cover with raspings the same as for boiled ham and garnish the knuckle with a paper frill This method of cooking a ham is by many persons considered far superior to boiling it as it cuts fuller of gravy and has a finer flavour besides keeping a much longer time good Time A medium sized ham four hours Average cost from eightd to tend per lb by the whole ham Seasonable all the year TO BOIL A HAM Illustration BOILED HAM eight hundred eleven INGREDIENTS Ham water glaze or raspings Mode In choosing a ham ascertain that it is perfectly sweet by running a sharp knife into it close to the bone and if when the knife is withdrawn it has an agreeable smell the ham is good if on the contrary the blade has a greasy appearance and offensive smell the ham is bad If it has been long hung and is very dry and salt let it remain in soak for twenty four hours changing the water frequently This length of time is only necessary in the case of its being very hard from eight to twelve hours would be sufficient for a Yorkshire or Westmoreland ham Wash it thoroughly clean and trim away from the under side all the rusty and smoked parts which would spoil the appearance Put it into a boiling pot with sufficient cold water to cover it bring it gradually to boil and as the scum rises carefully remove it Keep it simmering very gently until tender and be careful that it does not stop boiling nor boil too quickly When done take it out of the pot strip off the skin and sprinkle over it a few fine bread raspings put a frill of cut paper round the knuckle and serve If to be eaten cold let the ham remain in the water until nearly cold by this method the juices are kept in and it will be found infinitely superior to one taken out of the water hot it should however be borne in mind that the ham must not remain in the saucepan all night When the skin is removed sprinkle over bread raspings or if wanted particularly nice glaze it Place a paper frill round the knuckle and garnish with parsley or cut vegetable flowers See Coloured Plate P Time A ham weighing ten lbs four

ANECDOTE OF CHARLES V When the emperor Charles V was one day walking in the neighbourhood of Vienna full of pious considerations engendered by the thoughts of the Dominican cloister he was about to visit he was much annoyed by the noise of a pig which a country youth was carrying a little way before him At length irritated by the unmitigated noise Have you not learned how to quiet a pig demanded the imperial traveller tartly Noa replied the ingenuous peasant ignorant of the quality of his interrogator noa and I should very much like to know how to do it changing the position of his burthen and giving his load a surreptitious pinch of the ear which immediately altered the tone and volume of his complaining Why take the pig by the tail said the emperor and you will see how quiet he will become Struck by the novelty of the suggestion the countryman at once dangled his noisy companion by the tail and soon discovered that under the partial congestion caused by its inverted position the pig had indeed become silent when looking with admiration on his august adviser he exclaimed Ah you must have learned the trade much longer than I for you understand it a great deal better FRIED HAM

Seasonable at any time IMPORTANCE OF THE BOAR S HEAD SCOTTISH FEUDS c The boar s head in ancient times formed the most important dish on the table and was invariably the first placed on the board upon Christmas day being preceded by a body of servitors a flourish of trumpets and other marks of distinction and reverence and carried into the hall by the individual of next rank to the lord of the feast At some of our colleges and inns of court the serving of the boar s head on a silver platter on Christmas day is a custom still followed and till very lately a bore s head was competed for at Christmas time by the young men of a rural parish in Essex Indeed so highly was the grizzly boar s head regarded in former times that it passed into a cognizance of some of the noblest families in the realm thus it was not only the crest of the Nevills and Warwicks with their collateral houses but it was the cognizance of Richard III that Wretched bloody and usurping boar That spoil d your summer fields and fruitful vines Swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough In your embowell d bosoms and whose nature it was supposed to typify and was universally used as a sign to taverns The Boar s Head in Eastcheap which till within the last twenty five years still stood in all its primitive quaintness though removed to make way for the London bridge approaches will live vividly in the mind of every reader of Shakspeare as the resort of the prince of Wales Poins and his companions and the residence of Falstaff and his coney catching knaves Bardolph Pistol and Nym and whose sign was a boar s head carved in stone over the door and a smaller one in wood on each side of the doorway The traditions and deeds of savage vengeance recorded in connection with this grim trophy of the chase are numerous in all parts of Europe But the most remarkable connected with the subject in this country were two events that occurred in Scotland about the eleventh and fifteenth centuries A border family having been dispossessed of their castle and lands by a more powerful chief were reduced for many years to great indigence the expelled owner only living in the hope of wreaking a terrible vengeance which agreeably to the motto of his house he was content to bide his time for The usurper having invited a large number of his kindred to a grand hunt in his new domains and a feast after in the great hall returned from the chase and discovering the feast not spread vented his wrath in no measured terms on the heads of the tardy servitors At length a menial approached followed by a line of servants and placing the boar s head on the table the guests rushed forward to begin the meal when to their horror they discovered not a boar s but a bull s head a sign of death The doors were immediately closed and the false servants who were the adherents of the dispossessed chief threw off their disguise and falling on the usurper and his friends butchered them and every soul in the castle belonging to the rival faction A tribe of caterans or mountain robbers in the Western Highlands having been greatly persecuted by a powerful chief of the district waylaid him and his retinue put them all to the sword and cutting off the chief s head repaired to his castle where they ordered the terrified wife to supply them with food and drink To appease their savage humour the lady gave order for their entertainment and on returning to the hall to see her orders were complied with discovered in place of the boar s head that should have graced the board her husband s bleeding head the savage caterans in rude derision as a substitute for the apple or lemon usually placed between the jaws having thrust a slice of bread in the dead man s mouth FOR CURING HAMS Mons Ude s Recipe eight

of conveying the morsel to its mouth upon which the robbed child cried so loud that the mother rushed out of her hovel to ascertain the cause and seeing the purloining pig make off munching his booty the woman in her heat struck the grunter so smart a blow that the surly rascal took it into his head to go home very much indisposed and after a certain time resolved to die a resolution that he accordingly put into practice upon which the owner instituted judicial proceedings before the Star Chamber court of his tribe against the husband and family of the woman whose rash act had led to such results and as the pig happened to be a sow in the very flower of her age the prospective loss to the owner in unnumbered teems of pigs with the expenses attending so high a tribunal swelled the damages and costs to such a sum that it was found impossible to pay them And as in the barbarous justice existing among these rude people every member of a family is equally liable as the individual who committed the wrong the father mother children relatives an entire community to the number of thirty two souls were sold as slaves and a fearful sum of human misery perpetrated to pay the value of

well known fact that in Ireland the pig is in every respect a domesticated animal sharing often both the bed and board of the family and making an outer ring to the domestic circle as seated round the pot of potatoes they partake of the midday meal called dinner An Irishman upon one occasion having lost an interesting member of his household in the form of a promising young porker consulted his priest on the occasion and having hinted at the person he suspected of purloining the illegant slip of a pig he was advised to take no further notice of the matter but leave the issue to his spiritual adviser Next Sunday his reverence after mass came to the front of the altar rails and looking very hard at the supposed culprit exclaimed Who stole Pat Doolan s pig To this inquiry there was of course no answer the priest did not expect there would be any The following Sunday the same query was propounded a little stronger Who of you was it I say who stole poor Pat Doolan s pig It now became evident that the culprit was a hardened sinner so on the third Sunday instead of repeating the unsatisfactory inquiry the priest after as usual eyeing the obdurate offender said in a tone of pious sorrow Mike Regan Mike Regan you treat me with contempt That night when the family was all asleep the latch of the door was noiselessly lifted and the illegant slip of a pig cautiously slipped into the cabin TO SMOKE HAMS AND FISH AT HOME eight hundred twenty Take an old hogshead stop up all the crevices and fix a place to put a cross stick near the bottom to hang the articles to be smoked on

the hams c be well rubbed and turned daily if the meat is small a fortnight will be sufficient for the sides and shoulders to remain in the pickle and the hams three weeks if from thirty lbs and upwards three weeks will be required for the sides c and from four to five weeks for the hams On taking the pieces out let them drain for an hour cover with dry sawdust and smoke from a fortnight to

thick part of the tongue so as to allow the pickle to penetrate more readily A fortnight or three weeks according to the size of the tongue will be sufficient Time Small meat to remain in the pickle a fortnight hams three weeks to be smoked from a fortnight to three weeks The following is from Morton s Cyclopaedia of Agriculture and will be found fully worthy of the high character of that publication CURING OF HAMS AND BACON eight hundred twenty two The carcass of the hog after hanging over night to cool is laid on a strong bench or stool and the head is separated from the body at the neck close behind the ears the feet and also the internal fat are removed The carcass is next divided into two sides in the following manner The ribs are divided about an inch from the spine on each side and the spine with the ends of the ribs attached together with the internal flesh between it and the kidneys and also the flesh above it throughout the whole length of the sides are removed The portion of the carcass thus cut out is in the form of a wedge the breadth of the interior consisting of the breadth of the spine and about an inch of the ribs on each side being diminished to about half an inch at the exterior or skin along the back The breast bone and also the first anterior rib are also dissected from the side Sometimes the whole of the ribs are removed but this for reasons afterwards to be noticed is a very bad practice When the hams are cured separately from the sides which is generally the case they are cut out so as to include the hock bone in a similar manner to the London mode of cutting a haunch of mutton The carcass of the hog thus cut up is ready for being salted which process in large caring establishments is generally as follows The skin side of the pork is rubbed over with a mixture of fifty parts by weight of salt and one part of saltpetre in powder and the incised parts of the ham or flitch and the inside of the flitch covered with the same The salted bacon in pairs of flitches with the insides to each other is piled one pair of flitches above another on benches slightly inclined and furnished with spouts or troughs to convey the brine to receivers in the floor of the salting house to be afterwards used for pickling pork for navy purposes In this state the bacon remains a fortnight which is sufficient for flitches cut from nogs of a carcass weight less than fifteen stone fourteen lbs to the stone Flitches of a larger size at the expiration of that time are wiped dry and reversed in their place in the pile having at the same time about half the first quantity of fresh dry common salt sprinkled over the inside and incised parts after which they remain on the benches for another week Hams being thicker than flitches will require when less than twenty lbs weight three weeks and when above that weight four weeks to remain under the above described process The next and last process in the preparation of bacon and hams previous to being sent to market is drying This is effected by hanging the flitches and hams for two or three weeks in a room heated by stoves or in a smoke house in which they are exposed for the same length of time to the smoke arising from the slow combustion of the sawdust of oak or other hard wood The latter mode of completing the curing process has some advantages over the other as by it the meat is subject to the action of creosote a volatile oil produced by the combustion of the sawdust which is powerfully antiseptic The process also furnishing a thin covering of a resinous varnish excludes the air not only from the muscle but also from the fat thus effectually preventing the meat from becoming rusted and the principal reasons for condemning the practice of removing the ribs from the flitches of pork are that by so doing the meat becomes unpleasantly hard and pungent in the process of salting and by being more opposed to the action of the air becomes sooner and more extensively rusted Notwithstanding its superior efficacy in completing the process of curing the flavour which smoke drying imparts to meat is disliked by many persons and it is therefore by no means the most general mode of drying adopted by mercantile curers A very impure variety of pyroligneous acid or vinegar made from the destructive distillation of wood is sometimes used on account of the highly preservative power of the creosote which it contains and also to impart the smoke flavour in which latter object however the coarse flavour of tar is given rather than that derived from the smoke from combustion of wood A considerable portion of the bacon and hams salted in Ireland is exported from that country packed amongst salt in bales immediately from the salting process without having been in any degree dried In the process of salting above described pork loses from eight to ten per cent of its weight according to the size and quality of the meat and a further diminution of weight to the extent of five to six per cent takes place in drying during the first fortnight after being taken out of salt so that the total loss in weight occasioned by the preparation of bacon and hams in a proper state for market is not less on an average than fifteen per cent on the weight of the fresh pork COLLARED PIG S FACE a Breakfast or Luncheon Dish eight hundred twenty three INGREDIENTS one pig

dishes with a heavy weight on the top and when cold remove the cloth and tape It should be sent to table on a napkin or garnished with a piece of deep white paper with a ruche at the top Time four hours Average cost from twos to twos sixd Seasonable from October to March THE WILD AND DOMESTIC HOG The domestic hog is the descendant of a race long since banished from this island and it is remarkable that while the tamed animal has been and is kept under surveillance the wild type whence this race sprung has maintained itself in its ancient freedom the fierce denizen of the forest and one of the renowned beasts of the chase Whatever doubt may exist as to the true origin of the dog the horse the ox and others or as to whether their original race is yet extant or not these doubts do not apply to the domestic hog Its wild source still exists and is universally recognized like the wolf however it has been expelled from our island but like that animal it still roams through the vast wooded tracts of Europe and Asia TO DRESS PIG S FRY a Savoury Dish eight hundred twenty four INGREDIENTS one one two lb of pig s fry two onions a few sage leaves three lbs of potatoes pepper and salt to taste Mode Put the lean fry at the bottom of a pie dish sprinkle over it some minced sage and onion and a seasoning of pepper and salt slice the potatoes put a layer of these on the seasoning then the fat fry then more seasoning and a layer of potatoes at the top Fill the dish with boiling water and bake for two hours or rather longer Time Rather more than two hours Average cost sixd per lb Sufficient for three or four persons Seasonable from October to March TO MELT LARD eight hundred twenty five Melt the inner fat of the pig by putting it in a stone jar and placing this in a saucepan of boiling water previously stripping off the skin Let it simmer gently over a bright fire and as it melts pour it carefully from the sediment Put it into small jars or bladders for use and keep it in a cool place The flead or inside fat of the pig before it is melted makes exceedingly light crust and is particularly wholesome It may be preserved a length of time by salting it well and occasionally changing the brine When wanted for use wash and wipe it and it will answer for making into paste as well as fresh lard Average cost tend per lb BOILED LEG OF PORK eight hundred twenty six INGREDIENTS Leg of pork salt Mode For boiling choose a small compact well filled leg and rub it well with salt let it remain in pickle for a week or ten days turning and rubbing it every day An hour before dressing it put it into cold water for an hour which improves the colour If the pork is purchased ready salted ascertain how long the meat has been in pickle and soak it accordingly Put it into a boiling pot with sufficient cold water to cover it let it gradually come to a boil and remove the scum as it rises Simmer it very gently until tender and do not allow it to boil fast or the knuckle will fall to pieces before the middle of the leg is done Carrots turnips or parsnips may be boiled with the pork some of which should be laid round the dish as a garnish and a well made pease pudding is an indispensable accompaniment Time A leg of pork weighing eight lbs three hours after the water boils and to be simmered very gently Average cost nined per lb Sufficient for seven or eight persons Seasonable from September to March Note The liquor in which a leg of pork has been boiled makes excellent pea soup ANTIQUITY OF THE HOG The hog has survived changes which have swept multitudes of pachydermatous animals from the surface of our earth It still presents the same characteristics both physical and moral which the earliest writers whether sacred or profane have faithfully delineated Although the domestic has been more or less modified by long culture yet the wild species remains unaltered insomuch that the fossil relics may be identified with the bones of their existing descendants ROAST GRISKIN OF PORK eight hundred twenty seven INGREDIENTS Pork a little powdered sage Illustration SPARE RIB OF PORK Illustration GRISKIN OF PORK Mode As this joint frequently comes to table hard and dry particular care should be taken that it is well basted Put it down to a bright fire and flour it About ten minutes before taking it up sprinkle over some powdered sage make a little gravy in the dripping pan strain it over the meat and serve with a tureen of apple sauce This joint will be done in far less time than when the skin is left on consequently should have the greatest attention that it be not dried up Time Griskin of pork weighing six lbs one one two hour Average cost sevend per lb Sufficient for five or six persons Seasonable from September to March Note A spare rib of pork is roasted in the same manner as above and would take one one two hour for one weighing about six lbs Illustration BACON FOR LARDING AND LARDING NEEDLE LARDING eight hundred twenty eight INGREDIENTS Bacon and larding needle Mode Bacon for larding should be firm and fat and ought to be cured without any saltpetre as this reddens white meats Lay it on a table the rinds downwards trim off any rusty part and cut it into slices of an equal thickness Place the slices one on the top of another and cut them evenly into narrow strips so arranging it that every piece of bacon is of the same size Bacon for fricandeau poultry and game should be about two inches in length and rather more than one eighth of an inch in width If for larding fillets of beef or loin of veal the pieces of bacon must be thicker The following recipe of Soyer is we think very explicit and any cook by following the directions here given may be able to lard if not well sufficiently for general use Have the fricandeau trimmed lay it lengthwise upon a clean napkin across your hand forming a kind of bridge with your thumb at the part you are about to commence at then with the point of the larding needle make three distinct lines across one two inch apart run the needle into the third line at the further side of the fricandeau and bring it out at the first placing one of the lardoons in it draw the needle through leaving out one four inch of the bacon at each line proceed thus to the end of the row then make another line one two inch distant stick in another row of lardoons bringing them out at the second line leaving the ends of the bacon out all the same length make the next row again at the same distance bringing the ends out between the lardoons of the first row proceeding in this manner until the whole surface is larded in chequered rows Everything else is larded in a similar way and in the case of poultry hold the breast over a charcoal fire for one minute or dip it into boiling water in order to make the flesh firm ROAST LOIN OF PORK eight hundred twenty nine INGREDIENTS Pork a little salt Illustration FORE LOIN OF PORK Illustration HIND LOIN OF PORK Mode Score the skin in strips rather more than one four inch apart and place the joint at a good distance from the fire on account of the crackling which would harden before the meat would be heated through were it placed too near If very lean it should be rubbed over with a little salad oil and kept well basted all the time it is at the fire Pork should be very thoroughly cooked but not dry and be careful never to send it to table the least underdone as nothing is more unwholesome and disagreeable than underdressed white meats Serve with apple sauce No three hundred sixty three and a little gravy made in the dripping pan A stuffing of sage and onion may be made separately and baked in a flat dish this method is better than putting it in the meat as many persons have so great an objection to the flavour Time A loin of pork weighing five lbs about two hours allow more time should it be very fat Average cost nined per lb Sufficient for five or six persons Seasonable from September to March FOSSIL REMAINS OF THE HOG In British strata the oldest fossil remains of the hog which Professor Owen states that he has examined were from fissures in the red crag probably miocene of Newbourne near Woodbridge Suffolk They were associated with teeth of an extinct felis about the size of a leopard with those of a bear and with remains of a large cervus These mammalian remains were found with the ordinary fossils of the red crag they had undergone the same process of trituration and were impregnated with the same colouring matter as the associated bones and teeth of fishes acknowledged to be derived from the regular strata of the red crag These mammaliferous beds have been proved by mister Lyell to be older than the fluvio marine or Norwich crag in which remains of the mastodon rhinoceros and horse have been discovered and still older than the fresh water pleistocene deposits from which the remains of the mammoth rhinoceros c are obtained in such abundance I have met says the professor in addition with some satisfactory instances of the association of fossil remains of a species of hog with those of the mammoth in the newer pliocene freshwater formations of England TO DRY PIGS CHEEKS eight hundred thirty INGREDIENTS Salt four oz of saltpetre two oz of bay salt four oz of coarse sugar Mode Cut out the snout remove the brains and split the head taking off the upper bone to make the jowl a good shape rub it well with salt next day take away the brine and salt it again the following day cover the head with saltpetre bay salt and coarse sugar in the above proportion adding

forty minutes Sufficient for three or four persons Seasonable from September to March TO PICKLE PORK eight hundred thirty three INGREDIENTS one four lb of saltpetre salt Mode As pork does not keep long without being salted cut it into pieces of a suitable size as soon as the pig is cold Rub the pieces of pork well with salt and put them into a pan with a sprinkling of it between each piece as it melts on the top strew on more Lay a coarse cloth over the pan a board over that and a weight on the board to keep the pork down in the brine If excluded from the air it will continue good for nearly two years Average cost tend per lb for the prime parts Seasonable The best time for pickling meat is late in the autumn THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE HOG A singular circumstance in the domestic history of the hog is the extent of its distribution over the surface of the earth being found even in insulated places where the inhabitants are semi barbarous and where the wild species is entirely unknown The South Sea islands for example were found on their discovery to be well stocked with a small black hog and the traditionary belief of the people was that these animals were coeval with the origin of themselves Yet they possessed no knowledge of the wild boar or any other animal of the hog kind from which the domestic breed might be supposed to be derived In these islands the hog is the principal quadruped and the fruit of the bread tree is its principal food although it is also fed with yams eddoes and other vegetables This nutritious diet which it has in great abundance is according to Foster the reason of its flesh being so delicious so full of juice and so rich in fat which is not less delicate to the taste than the finest butter TO BOIL PICKLED PORK eight hundred thirty four INGREDIENTS Pork water Mode Should the pork be very salt let it remain in water about two hours before it is dressed put it into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover it let it gradually come to a boil then gently simmer until quite tender Allow ample time for it to cook as nothing is more disagreeable than underdone pork and when boiled fast the meat becomes hard This is sometimes served with boiled poultry and roast veal instead of bacon when tender and not over salt it will be found equally good Time A piece of pickled pork weighing two lbs one one four hour four lbs rather more than two hours Average cost tend per lb for the primest parts Seasonable at any time THE ANTIQUITY OF THE HOG By what nation and in what period the hog was reclaimed is involved in the deepest obscurity So far back as we have any records of history we find notices of this animal and of its flesh being used as the food of man By some nations however its flesh was denounced as unclean and therefore prohibited to be used whilst by others it was esteemed as a great delicacy By the Mosaic law it was forbidden to be eaten by the Jews and the Mahometans hold it in utter abhorrence doctor Kitto however says that there does not appear to be any reason in the law of Moses why the hog should be held in such peculiar abomination There seems nothing to have prevented the Jews if they had been so inclined to rear pigs for sale or for the use of the land In the Talmud there are some indications that this was actually done and it was probably for such purposes that the herds of swine mentioned in the New Testament were kept although it is usual to consider that they were kept by the foreign settlers in the land Indeed the story which accounts for the peculiar aversion of the Hebrews to the hog assumes that it did not originate until about one hundred thirty years before Christ and that previously some Jews were in the habit of rearing hogs for the purposes indicated PORK PIES Warwickshire Recipe eight hundred thirty five INGREDIENTS For the crust five lbs of lard to fourteen lbs of flour milk and water For filling the pies to every three lbs of meat allow one oz of salt two one four oz of pepper a small quantity of cayenne one pint of water Mode Rub into the flour a portion of the lard the remainder put with sufficient milk and water to mix the crust and boil this gently for one four hour Pour it boiling on the flour and knead and beat it till perfectly smooth Now raise the crust in either a round or oval form cut up the pork into pieces the size of a nut season it in the above proportion and press it compactly into the pie in alternate layers of fat and lean and pour in a small quantity of water lay on the lid cut the edges smoothly round and pinch them together Bake in a brick oven which should be slow as the meat is very solid Very frequently the inexperienced cook finds much difficulty in raising the crust She should bear in mind that it must not be allowed to get cold or it will fall immediately to prevent this the operation should be performed as near the fire as possible As considerable dexterity and expertness are necessary to raise the crust with the hand only a glass bottle or small jar may be placed in the middle of the paste and the crust moulded on this but be particular that it is kept warm the whole time Sufficient The proportions for one pie are one lb of flour and three lbs of meat Seasonable from September to March THE FLESH OF SWINE IN HOT CLIMATES It is observed by M Sonini that the flesh of swine in hot climates is considered unwholesome and therefore may account for its proscription by the legislators and priests of the East In Egypt Syria and even the southern parts of Greece although both white and delicate it is so flabby and surcharged with fat that it disagrees with the strongest stomachs Abstinence from it in general was therefore indispensable to health under the burning suns of Egypt and Arabia The Egyptians were permitted to eat it only once a year on the feast of the moon and then they sacrificed a number of these animals to that planet At other seasons should any one even touch a hog he was obliged immediately to plunge into the river Nile as he stood with his clothes on in order to purify himself from the supposed contamination he had contracted by the touch LITTLE RAISED PORK PIES eight hundred thirty six INGREDIENTS two lbs of flour one two lb of butter one two lb of mutton suet salt and white pepper to taste four lbs of the neck of pork one dessertspoonful of powdered sage Mode Well dry the flour mince the suet and put these with the butter into a saucepan to be made hot and add a little salt When melted mix it up into a stiff paste and put it before the fire with a cloth over it until ready to make up chop the pork into small pieces season it with white pepper salt and powdered sage divide the paste into rather small pieces raise it in a round or oval form fill with the meat and bake in a brick oven These pies will require a fiercer oven than those in the preceding recipe as they are made so much smaller and consequently do not require so soaking a heat Time If made small about one one two hour Seasonable from September to March SWINEHERDS OF ANTIQUITY From the prejudice against the hog among the ancients those who tended them formed an isolated class and were esteemed as the outcasts of society However much the flesh of the animal was esteemed by the Greeks and Romans yet the swineherd is not mentioned by either the classic writers or the poets who in ancient Greece and Rome painted rural life We have no descriptions of gods or heroes descending to the occupation of keeping swine The swineherd is never introduced into the idyls of Theocritus nor has Virgil admitted him into his eclogues The Eumaeus of Homer is the only exception that we have of a swineherd meeting with favour in the eyes of a poet of antiquity This may be accounted for on the supposition that the prejudices of the Egyptians relative to this class of men extended to both Greece and Italy and imparted a bias to popular opinion TO MAKE SAUSAGES Author s Oxford Recipe eight hundred thirty seven INGREDIENTS one lb of pork fat and lean without skin or gristle one lb of lean veal one lb of beef suet one two lb of bread crumbs the rind of one two lemon one small nutmeg six sage leaves one teaspoonful of pepper two teaspoonfuls of salt one two teaspoonful of savory one two teaspoonful of marjoram Mode Chop the pork veal and suet finely together add the bread crumbs lemon peel which should be well minced and a small nutmeg grated Wash and chop the sage leaves very finely add these with the remaining ingredients to the sausage meat and when thoroughly mixed either put the meat into skins or when wanted for table form it into little cakes which should be floured and fried Average cost for this quantity twos sixd Sufficient for about thirty moderate sized sausages Seasonable from October to March THE HOG IN ENGLAND From time immemorial in England this animal has been esteemed as of the highest importance In the Anglo Saxon period vast herds of swine were tended by men who watched over their safety and who collected them under shelter at night At that time the flesh of the animal was the staple article of consumption in every family and a large portion of the wealth of the rich freemen of the country consisted of these animals Hence it was common to make bequests of swine with lands for their support and to these were attached rights and privileges in connection with their feeding and the extent of woodland to be occupied by a given number was granted in accordance with established rules This is proved by an ancient Saxon grant quoted by Sharon Turner in his History of the Anglo Saxons where the right of pasturage is conveyed in a deed by the following words I give food for seventy swine in that woody allotment which the countrymen call Wolferdinlegh FRIED SAUSAGES Illustration FRIED SAUSAGES eight hundred thirty eight INGREDIENTS Sausages a small piece of butter Mode Prick the sausages with a fork this prevents them from bursting and put them into a frying pan with a small piece of butter Keep moving the pan about and turn the sausages three or four times In from ten to twelve minutes they will be sufficiently cooked unless they are very large when a little more time should be allowed for them Dish them with or without a piece of toast under them and serve very hot In some counties sausages are boiled and served on toast They should be plunged into boiling water and simmered for about ten or twelve minutes Time ten to twelve minutes Average cost tend per lb Seasonable Good from September to March Note Sometimes in close warm weather sausages very soon turn sour to prevent this put them in the oven for a few minutes with a small piece of butter to keep them moist When wanted for table they will not require so long frying as uncooked sausages THE SAXON SWINEHERD The men employed in herding swine during the Anglo Saxon period of our history were in general thralls or born slaves of the soil who were assisted by powerful dogs capable even of singly contending with the wolf until his master came with his spear to the rescue In the Ivanhoe of Sir Walter Scott we have an admirable picture in the character of Gurth an Anglo Saxon swineherd as we also have of his master a large landed proprietor a great portion of whose wealth consisted of swine and whose rude but plentiful board was liberally supplied with the flesh SAUSAGE MEAT CAKES eight hundred thirty nine INGREDIENTS To every lb of lean pork add three four lb of fat bacon one four oz of salt one saltspoonful of pepper one four teaspoonful of grated nutmeg one teaspoonful of minced parsley Mode Remove from the pork all skin gristle and bone and chop it finely with the bacon add the remaining ingredients and carefully mix altogether Pound it well in a mortar make it into convenient sized cakes flour these and fry them a nice brown for about ten minutes This is a very simple method of making sausage meat and on trial will prove very good its great recommendation being that it is so easily made Time ten minutes Seasonable from September to March TO SCALD A SUCKING PIG eight hundred forty Put the pig into cold water directly it is killed let it remain for a few minutes then immerse it in a large pan of boiling water for two minutes Take it out lay it on a table and pull off the hair as quickly as possible When the skin looks clean make a slit down the belly take out the entrails well clean the nostrils and ears wash the pig in cold water and wipe it thoroughly dry Take off the feet at the first joint and loosen and leave sufficient skin to turn neatly over If not to be dressed immediately fold it in a wet cloth to keep it from the air THE LEARNED PIG That the pig is capable of education is a fact long known to the world and though like the ass naturally stubborn and obstinate that he is equally amenable with other animals to caresses and kindness has been shown from very remote time the best modern evidence of his docility however is the instance of the learned pig first exhibited about a century since but which has been continued down to our own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put together all the letters or figures that compose the day month hour and date of the exhibition besides many other unquestioned evidences of memory The instance already given of breaking a sow into a pointer till she became more stanch even than the dog itself though surprising is far less wonderful than that evidence of education where so generally obtuse an animal may be taught not only to spell but couple figures and give dates correctly ROAST SUCKING PIG eight hundred forty one INGREDIENTS Pig six oz of bread crumbs sixteen sage leaves pepper and salt to taste a piece of butter the size of an egg salad oil or butter to baste with about one two pint of gravy one tablespoonful of lemon juice Illustration ROAST SUCKING PIG Mode A sucking pig to be eaten in perfection should not be more than three weeks old and should be dressed the same day that it is killed After preparing the pig for cooking as in the preceding recipe stuff it with finely grated bread crumbs minced sage pepper salt and a piece of butter the size of an egg all of which should be well mixed together and put into the body of the pig Sew up the slit neatly and truss the legs back to allow the inside to be roasted and the under part to be crisp Put the pig down to a bright clear fire not too near and let it lay till thoroughly dry then have ready some butter tied up in a piece of thin cloth and rub the pig with this in every part Keep it well rubbed with the butter the whole of the time it is roasting and do not allow the crackling to become blistered or burnt When half done hang a pig iron before the middle part if this is not obtainable use a flat iron to prevent its being scorched and dried up before the ends are done Before it is taken from the fire cut off the head and part that and the body down the middle Chop the brains and mix them with the stuffing add one two pint of good gravy a tablespoonful of lemon juice and the gravy that flowed from the pig put a little of this on the dish with the pig and the remainder send to table in a tureen Place the pig back to back in the dish with one half of the head on each side and one of the ears at each end and send it to table as hot as possible Instead of butter many cooks take salad oil for basting which makes the crackling crisp and as this is one of the principal things to be considered perhaps it is desirable to use it but be particular that it is very pure or it will impart an unpleasant flavour to the meat The brains and stuffing may be stirred into a tureen of melted butter instead of gravy when the latter is not liked Apple sauce and the old fashioned currant sauce are not yet quite obsolete as an accompaniment to roast pig Time one one two to two hours for a small pig Average cost fives to sixs Sufficient for nine or ten persons Seasonable from September to February HOW ROAST PIG WAS DISCOVERED Charles Lamb who in the early part of this century delighted the reading public by his quaint prose sketches written under the title of Essays of Elia has in his own quiet humorous way devoted one paper to the subject of Roast Pig and more especially to that luxurious and toothsome dainty known as CRACKLING and shows in a manner peculiarly his own how crackling first came into the world According to this erudite authority man in the golden age or at all events the primitive age eat his pork and bacon raw as indeed he did his beef and mutton unless as Hudibras tells us he was an epicure when he used to make a saddle of his saddle of mutton and after spreading it on his horse s back and riding on it for a few hours till thoroughly warmed he sat down to the luxury of a dish cooked to a turn At the epoch of the story however a citizen of some Scythian community had the misfortune to have his hut or that portion of it containing his live stock of pigs burnt down In going over the debris on the following day and picking out all the available salvage the proprietor touched something unusually or unexpectedly hot which caused him to shake his hand with great energy and clap the tips of his suffering fingers to his mouth The act was simple and natural but the result was wonderful He rolled his eyes in ecstatic pleasure his frame distended and conscious of a celestial odour his nostrils widened and while drawing in deep inspirations of the ravishing perfume he sucked his fingers with a gusto he had never in his most hungry moments conceived Clearing away the rubbish from beneath him he at last brought to view the carcase of one of his pigs roasted to death Stooping down to examine this curious object and touching its body a fragment of the burnt skin was detached which with a sort of superstitious dread he at length and in a spirit of philosophical inquiry put into his mouth Ye gods the felicity he then enjoyed no pen can chronicle Then it was that he the world first tasted crackling Like a miser with his gold the Scythian hid his treasure from the prying eyes of the world and feasted in secret more sumptuously than the gods When he had eaten up all his pig the poor man fell into a melancholy he refused the most tempting steak though cooked on the horse s back and turned every half hour after his own favourite recipe he fell in fact from his appetite and was reduced to a shadow till unable longer to endure the torments of memory he hourly suffered he rose one night and secretly set fire to his hut and once more was restored to flesh and manhood Finding it impossible to live in future without roast pig he set fire to his house every time his larder became empty till at last his neighbours scandalized by the frequency of these incendiary acts brought his conduct before the supreme council of the nation To avert the penalty that awaited him he brought his judges to the smouldering ruins and discovering the secret invited them to eat which having done with tears of gratitude the august synod embraced him and with an overflowing feeling of ecstasy dedicated a statue to the memory of the man who first instituted roast pork PORK CARVING SUCKING PIG Illustration SUCKING PIG eight hundred forty two A sucking pig seems at first sight rather an elaborate dish or rather animal to carve but by carefully mastering the details of the business every difficulty will vanish and if a partial failure be at first made yet all embarrassment will quickly disappear on a second trial A sucking pig is usually sent to table in the manner shown in the engraving and also in coloured plate S and the first point to be attended to is to separate the shoulder from the carcase by carrying the knife quickly and neatly round the circular line as shown by the figures one two three the shoulder will then easily come away The next step is to take off the leg and this is done in the same way by cutting round this joint in the direction shown by the figures one two three in the same way as the shoulder The ribs then stand fairly open to the knife which should be carried down in the direction of the line four to five and two or three helpings will dispose of these The other half of the pig is served of course in the same manner Different parts of the pig are variously esteemed some preferring the flesh of the neck others the ribs and others again the shoulders The truth is the whole of a sucking pig is delicious delicate eating but in carving it the host should consult the various tastes and fancies of his guests keeping the larger joints generally for the gentlemen of the party HAM Illustration HAM eight hundred forty three In cutting a ham the carver must be guided according as he desires to practise economy or have at once fine slices out of the prime part Under the first supposition he will commence at the knuckle end and cut off thin slices towards the thick part of the ham To reach the choicer portion the knife which must be very sharp and thin should be carried quite down to the bone in the direction of the line one to two The slices should be thin and even and always cut down to the bone There are some who like to carve a ham by cutting a hole at the top and then slicing pieces off inside the hole gradually enlarging the circle but we think this a plan not to be recommended A ham when hot is usually sent to table with a paper ruffle round the knuckle when cold it is served in the manner shown by coloured plate P LEG OF PORK Illustration LEG OF PORK eight hundred forty four This joint which is such a favourite one with many people is easy to carve The knife should be carried sharply down to the bone clean through the crackling in the direction of the line one to two Sago and onion and apple sauce are usually sent to table with this dish sometimes the leg of pork is stuffed and the guests should be asked if they will have either or both A frequent plan and we think a good one is now pursued of sending sage and onion to table separately from the joint as it is not everybody to whom the flavour of this stuffing is agreeable Note The other dishes of pork do not call for any special remarks as to their carving or helping CHAPTER XVIII GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE CALF eight hundred forty five ANY REMARKS MADE ON THE CALF OR THE LAMB must naturally be in a measure supplementary to the more copious observations made on the parent stock of either As the calf at least as far as it is identified with veal is destined to die young to be indeed cut off in its comparative infancy it may at first sight appear of little or no consequence to inquire to what particular variety or breed of the general stock his sire or dam may belong The great art however in the modern science of husbandry has been to obtain an animal that shall not only have the utmost beauty of form of which the species is capable but at the same time a constitution free from all taint a frame that shall rapidly attain bulk and stature and a disposition so kindly that every quantum of food it takes shall without drawback or procrastination be eliminated into fat and muscle The breed then is of very considerable consequence in determining not only the quality of the meat to the consumer but its commercial value to the breeder and butcher eight hundred forty six UNDER THE ARTIFICIAL SYSTEM adopted in the rearing of domestic cattle and stock in general to gratify the arbitrary mandates of luxury and fashion we can have veal like lamb at all seasons in the market though the usual time in the metropolis for veal to make its appearance is about the beginning of February eight hundred forty seven THE COW GOES WITH YOUNG FOR NINE MONTHS and the affection and solicitude she evinces for her offspring is more human in its tenderness mid intensity than is displayed by any other animal and her distress when she hears its bleating and is not allowed to reach it with her distended udders is often painful to witness and when the calf has died or been accidentally killed her grief frequently makes her refuse to give down her milk At such times the breeder has adopted the expedient of flaying the dead carcase and distending the skin with hay lays the effigy before her and then taking advantage of her solicitude milks her while she is caressing the skin with her tongue eight hundred forty eight IN A STATE OF NATURE the cow like the deer hides her young in the tall ferns and brakes and the most secret places and only at stated times twice or thrice a day quits the herd and hastening to the secret cover gives suck to her calf and with the same circumspection returns to the community eight hundred forty nine IN SOME COUNTRIES to please the epicurean taste of vitiated appetites it is the custom to kill the calf for food almost immediately after birth and any accident that forestalls that event is considered to enhance its value We are happy to say however that in this country as far as England and Scotland are concerned the taste for very young veal has entirely gone out and Staggering Bob as the poor little animal was called in the language of the shambles is no longer to be met with in such a place eight hundred fifty THE WEANING OF CALVES is a process that requires a great amount of care and judgment for though they are in reality not weaned till between the eighth and the twelfth week the process of rearing them by hand commences in fact from the birth the calf never being allowed to suck its dam As the rearing of calves for the market is a very important and lucrative business the breeder generally arranges his stock so that ten or a dozen of his cows shall calve about the same time and then by setting aside one or two to find food for the entire family gets the remaining eight or ten with their full fountains of milk to carry on the operations of his dairy Some people have an idea that skimmed milk if given in sufficient quantity is good enough for the weaning period of calf feeding but this is a very serious mistake for the cream of which it has been deprived contained nearly all the oleaginous principles and the azote or nitrogen on which the vivifying properties of that fluid depends Indeed so remarkably correct has this fact proved to be that a calf reared on one part of new milk mixed with five of water will thrive and look well while another treated with unlimited skimmed milk will be poor thin and miserable eight hundred fifty one IT IS SOMETIMES A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE to induce the blundering calf whose instinct only teaches him to suck and that he will do at anything and with anything acquire the knowledge of imbibition that for the first few days it is often necessary to fill a bottle with milk and opening his mouth pour the contents down his throat The manner however by which he is finally educated into the mystery of suction is by putting his allowance of milk into a large wooden bowl the nurse then puts her hand into the milk and by bending her fingers upwards makes a rude teat for the calf to grasp in his lips when the vacuum caused by his suction of the fingers causes the milk to rise along them into his mouth In this manner one by one the whole family are to be fed three times a day care being taken that new born calves are not at first fed on milk from a cow who has some days calved eight hundred fifty two AS THE CALF PROGRESSES TOWARDS HIS TENTH WEEK his diet requires to be increased in quantity and quality for these objects his milk can be thickened with flour or meal and small pieces of softened oil cake are to be slipped into his mouth after sucking that they may dissolve there till he grows familiar with and to like the taste when it may be softened and scraped down into his milk and water After a time sliced turnips softened by steam are to be given to him in tolerable quantities then succulent grasses and finally hay may be added to the others Some farmers desirous of rendering their calves fat for the butcher in as short a time as possible forget both the natural weakness of the digestive powers and the contracted volume of the stomach and allow the animals either to suck ad libitum or give them if brought up at the pail or by hand a larger quantity of milk than they can digest The idea of overloading the stomach never suggests itself to their minds They suppose that the more food the young creature consumes the sooner it will be fat and they allow it no exercise whatever for fear it should denude its very bones of their flesh Under such circumstances the stomach soon becomes deranged its functions are no longer capable of acting the milk subjected to the acid of the stomach coagulates and forms a hardened mass of curd when the muscles become affected with spasms and death frequently ensues eight hundred fifty three THERE WAS NO SPECIES OF SLAUGHTERING practised in this country so inhuman and disgraceful as that till very lately employed in killing this poor animal when under the plea of making the flesh white the calf was bled day by day till when the final hour came the animal was unable to stand This inhumanity is we believe now everywhere abolished and the calf is at once killed and with the least amount of pain a sharp pointed knife is run through the neck severing all the large veins and arteries up to the vertebrae The skin is then taken off to the knee which is disjointed and to the head which is removed it is then reflected backwards and the carcase having been opened and dressed is kept apart by stretchers and the thin membrane the caul extended over the organs left in the carcase as the kidneys and sweet bread some melted fat is then scattered suddenly over the whole interior giving that white and frosted appearance to the meat that is thought to add to its beauty the whole is then hung up to cool and harden eight hundred fifty four THE MANNER OF CUTTING UP VEAL for the English market is to divide the carcase into four quarters with eleven ribs to each fore quarter which are again subdivided into joints as exemplified on the cut Illustration SIDE OF A CALF SHOWING THE SEVERAL JOINTS Hind quarter one The loin two The chump consisting of the rump and hock bone three The fillet four The hock or hind knuckle Fore quarter five The shoulder six The neck seven The breast eight The fore knuckle eight hundred fifty five THE SEVERAL PARTS OF A MODERATELY SIZED WELL FED CALF about eight weeks old are nearly of the following weights loin and chump eighteen lbs fillet twelve one two lbs hind knuckle five one two lbs shoulder eleven lbs neck eleven lbs breast nine lbs and fore knuckle five lbs making a total of one hundred forty four lbs weight The London mode of cutting the carcase is considered better than that pursued in Edinburgh as giving three roasting joints and one boiling in each quarter besides the pieces being more equally divided as regards flesh and from the handsomer appearance they make on the table RECIPES CHAPTER XIX BAKED VEAL Cold Meat

considerable amount of intelligence in the selection of the best course to adopt for either end When meant to be reared as stock the breeding should be so arranged that the cow shall calve about the middle of May As our subject however has more immediate reference to the calf as meat than as stock we shall confine our remarks to the mode of procedure adopted in the former case and here the first process adopted is that of weaning which consists in separating the calf entirely from the cow but at the same time rearing it on the mother s milk As the business of the dairy would be suspended if every cow were allowed to rear its young and butter cheese and cream become desiderata things to be desired but not possessed a system of economical husbandry becomes necessary so as to retain our dairy produce and yet for some weeks at least nourish the calf on its mother s milk but without allowing the animal to draw that supply for itself this with the proper substituted food on which to

FEEDING A CALF The amount of milk necessary for a calf for some time will be about four quarts a day though after the first fortnight that quantity should be gradually increased according to its development of body when if fed exclusively on milk as much as three gallons a day will be requisite for the due health and requirements of the animal If the weather is fine and genial it should be

the long compressed spirits of the people there still remained a large section of society wedded to the former state of things The elders of this party retired from public sight where unoffended by the reigning saturnalia they might dream in seclusion over their departed Utopia The young bloods of this school however who were compelled to mingle in the world yet detesting the politics which had become the fashion adopted a novel expedient to keep alive their republican sentiments and mark their contempt of the reigning family They accordingly met in considerable numbers at some convenient inn on the thirtieth of January in each year the anniversary of Charles s death and dined together off a feast prepared from calves heads dressed in every possible variety of way and with an abundance of wine drank toasts of defiance and hatred to the house of Stuart and glory to the memory of old Holl Cromwell and having lighted a large bonfire in the yard the club of fast young Puritans with their white handkerchiefs stained red in wine and one of the party in a mask bearing an axe followed by the chairman carrying a calf s head pinned up in a napkin marched in mock procession to the

THE GOLDEN CALF We are told in the book of Genesis that Aaron in the lengthened absence of Moses was constrained by the impatient people to make them an image to worship and that Aaron instead of using his delegated power to curb this sinful expression of the tribes and appease the discontented Jews at once complied with their demand and telling them to bring to him their rings and trinkets fashioned out of their willing contributions a calf of gold before which the multitude fell down and worshipped Whether this image was a solid figure of gold or a wooden effigy merely coated with metal is uncertain To suppose the former knowing the size of the image made from such trifling articles as rings we must presuppose the Israelites to have spoiled the Egyptians most unmercifully the figure however is of more consequence than the weight or size of the idol That the Israelite brought away more from Goshen than the plunder of the Egyptians and that they were deeply imbued with Egyptian superstition the golden calf is only one out of many instances of proof for a gilded ox covered with a pall was in that country an emblem of Osiris one of the gods of the Egyptian trinity Besides having a sacred cow and many varieties of the holy bull this priest ridden people worshipped the ox as a symbol of the sun and offered to it divine honours as the emblem of frugality industry and husbandry It is therefore probable that in borrowing so familiar a type the Israelites in their calf worship meant under a well understood cherubic symbol to acknowledge the full force of those virtues under an emblem of divine power and goodness The prophet Hosea is full of denunciations against calf worship in Israel and alludes to the custom of kissing these idols Hosea viii four six

is required for a fricandeau with an uneven surface never looks well Trim it and with a sharp knife make two or three slits in the middle that it may taste more of the seasoning Now lard it thickly with fat bacon as lean gives a red colour to the fricandeau Slice the vegetables and put these with the herbs and spices in the middle of a stewpan with a few slices of bacon at the top these should

DIVINE POWER A singular symbolical ceremony existed among the Hebrews in which the calf performed a most important part The calf being a type or symbol of Divine power or what was called the Elohim the Almighty intelligence that brought them out of Egypt was looked upon much in the same light by the Jews as the cross subsequently was by the Christians a mystical emblem of the Divine passion and goodness Consequently an oath taken on either the calf or the cross was considered equally solemn and sacred by Jew or Nazarene and the breaking of it a soul staining perjury on themselves and an insult and profanation directly offered to the Almighty To render the oath more impressive and solemn it was customary to slaughter a dedicated calf in the temple when the priests having divided the carcase into a certain number of parts and with intervening spaces arranged the severed limbs on the marble pavement the one or all the party if there were many individuals to be bound by the oath repeating the words of the compact threaded their way in and out through the different spaces till they had taken the circuit of each portion of the divided calf when the ceremony was concluded To avert the anger of the Lord when Jerusalem was threatened by Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian host the Jews had made a solemn to God ratified by the ceremony of the calf if He released them from their dreaded foe to cancel the servitude of their Hebrew brethren After investing the city for some time and reducing the inhabitants to dreadful suffering and privation the Babylonians hearing that Pharaoh whom the Jews had solicited for aid was rapidly approaching with a powerful army hastily raised the siege and removing to a distance took up a position where they could intercept the Egyptians and still cover the city No sooner did the Jews behold the retreat of the enemy than they believed all danger was past and with their usual turpitude they repudiated their oath and refused to liberate their oppressed countrymen For this violation of their covenant with the Lord they were given over to all the horrors of the sword pestilence and famine Jeremiah xxxiv fifteen seventeen MINCED VEAL

Average cost sevend per lb Sufficient for eight or nine persons Seasonable from March to October THE FATTENING OF CALVES The fattening of calves for the market is an important business in Lanarkshire or Clydesdale and numbers of newly dropped calves are regularly carried there from the farmers of the adjacent districts in order to be prepared for the butcher The mode of feeding them is very simple milk is the chief article of their diet and of this the calves require a sufficient supply from first to last Added to this they must be kept in a well aired place neither too hot nor too cold and freely supplied with dry litter It is usual to exclude the light at all events to a great degree and to put within their reach a lump of chalk which they are very fond of licking Thus fed calves at the end of eight or nine weeks often attain a very large size viz eighteen to twenty stone exclusive of the offal Far heavier weights have occurred and without any deterioration in the delicacy and richness of the flesh This mode of feeding upon milk alone at first appears to be very expensive but it is not so when all things are taken into consideration for at the age of nine or ten weeks a calf originally purchased for eight shillings will realize nearly the same number of pounds For four or even six weeks the milk of one cow is sufficient indeed half that quantity is enough for the first fortnight but after the fifth or sixth week it will consume the greater portion of the milk of two moderate cows but then it requires neither oil cake nor linseed nor any other food Usually however the calves are not kept beyond the age of six weeks and will then sell for five or six pounds each the milk of the cow is then ready for a successor In this manner a relay of calves may be prepared for the markets from early spring to the end of summer a plan more advantageous than that of overfeeding one to a useless degree of corpulency VEAL SAUSAGES nine hundred four INGREDIENTS

tells us that veal as a meat is but little nourishing is relaxing and sufficiently difficult of digestion Lending itself as it does he says in all the flowery imagery of the French tongue and manner to so many metamorphoses it may be called without exaggeration the chameleon of the kitchen Who has not eaten calf s head au naturel simply boiled with the skin on its flavour heightened by sauce just a little sharp It is a dish as wholesome as it is agreeable and one that the most inexperienced cook may serve with success Calf s feet a la poulette au gratin fried c les cervelles served in the same manner and under the same names sweetbreads en fricandeau piques en fin all these offer most satisfactory entrees which the art of the cook more or less varies for the gratification of his glory and the well being of our appetites We have not spoken in the above catalogue either of the liver or of the fraise or of the ears which also share the honour of appearing at our tables Where is the man not acquainted with calf s liver a la bourgeoise the most frequent and convenient dish at unpretentious tables The fraise cooked in water and eaten with vinegar is a wholesome and agreeable dish and contains a mucilage well adapted for delicate persons Calf s ears have in common with the feet and cervelles the advantage of being able to be eaten either fried or a la poulette and besides can be made into a farce with the addition of peas onions cheese c Neither is it confined to the calf s tongue or even the eyes that these shall dispute alone the glory of awakening the taste of man thus the fressure which as is known comprises the heart the mou and the rate although not a very recherche dish lends itself to all the caprices of an expert artist and may under various marvellous disguises deceive and please and even awaken our appetite Verily we might say after this rhapsody of our neighbour that his country s weal will not suffer in him as an able and eloquent exponent and admirer VEAL CARVING BREAST OF VEAL Illustration BREAST OF VEAL nine hundred twelve The carving of a breast of veal is not dissimilar to that of a fore quarter of lamb when the shoulder has been taken off The breast of veal consists of two parts the rib bones and the gristly brisket These two parts should first be separated by sharply passing the knife in the direction of the lines one two when they are entirely divided the rib bones should be carved in the direction of the lines five to six and the brisket can be helped by cutting pieces in the direction three to four The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for the brisket or ribs and if there be a sweetbread served with the dish as it often is with roast breast of veal each person should receive a piece CALF S HEAD Illustration CALF S HEAD nine hundred thirteen This is not altogether the most easy looking dish to cut when it is put before a carver for the first time there is not much real difficulty in the operation however when the head has been attentively examined and after the manner of a phrenologist you get to know its bumps good and bad In the first place inserting the knife quite down to the bone cut slices in the direction of the line one to two with each of these should be helped a piece of what is called the throat sweetbread cut in the direction of from three to four The eye and the flesh round are favourite morsels with many and should be given to those at the table who are known to be the greatest connoisseurs The jawbone being removed there will then be found some nice lean and the palate which is reckoned by some a tit bit lies under the head On a separate dish there is always served the tongue and brains and each guest should be asked to take some of these FILLET OF VEAL Illustration FILLET OF VEAL nine hundred fourteen The carving of this joint is similar to that of a round of beef Slices not too thick in the direction of the line one to two are cut and the only point to be careful about is that the veal be evenly carved Between the flap and the meat the stuffing is inserted and a small portion of this should be served to every guest The persons whom the host wishes most to honour should be asked if they like the delicious brown outside slice as this by many is exceedingly relished KNUCKLE OF VEAL Illustration KNUCKLE OF VEAL nine hundred fifteen The engraving showing the dotted line from one to two sufficiently indicates the direction which should be given to the knife in carving this dish The best slices are those from the thickest part of the knuckle that is outside the line one to two LOIN OF VEAL Illustration LOIN OF VEAL nine hundred sixteen As is the case with a loin of mutton the careful jointing of a loin of veal is more than half the battle in carving it If the butcher be negligent in this matter he should be admonished for there is nothing more annoying or irritating to an inexperienced carver than to be obliged to turn his knife in all directions to find the exact place where it should be inserted in order to divide the bones When the jointing is properly performed there is little difficulty in carrying the knife down in the direction of the line one to two To each guest should be given a piece of the kidney and kidney fat which lie underneath and are considered great delicacies Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XX GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BIRDS Birds the free tenants of land air and ocean Their forms all symmetry their motions grace In plumage delicate and beautiful Thick without burthen close as fishes scales Or loose as full blown poppies to the breeze The Pelican Island nine hundred seventeen THE DIVISIONS OF BIRDS are founded principally on their habits of life and the natural resemblance which their external parts especially their bills bear to each other According to mister Vigors there are five orders each of which occupies its peculiar place on the surface of the globe so that the air the forest the land the marsh and the water has each its appropriate kind of inhabitants These are respectively designated as BIRDS OF PREY PERCHERS WALKERS WADERS and SWIMMERS and in contemplating their variety lightness beauty and wonderful adaptation to the regions they severally inhabit and the functions they are destined to perform in the grand scheme of creation our hearts are lifted with admiration at the exhaustless ingenuity power and wisdom of HIM who has in producing them so strikingly manifested His handiwork Not only these however but all classes of animals have their peculiar ends to fulfil and in order that this may be effectually performed they are constructed in such a manner as will enable them to carry out their conditions Thus the quadrupeds that are formed to tread the earth in common with man are muscular and vigorous and whether they have passed into the servitude of man or are permitted to range the forest or the field they still retain in a high degree the energies with which they were originally endowed Birds on the contrary are generally feeble and therefore timid Accordingly wings have been given them to enable them to fly through the air and thus elude the force which by nature they are unable to resist Notwithstanding the natural tendency of all bodies towards the centre of the earth birds when raised in the atmosphere glide through it with the greatest ease rapidity and vigour There they are in their natural element and can vary their course with the greatest promptitude can mount or descend with the utmost facility and can light on any spot with the most perfect exactness and without the slightest injury to themselves nine hundred eighteen THE MECHANISM WHICH ENABLES BIRDS to wing their course through the air is both singular and instructive Their bodies are covered with feathers which are much lighter than coverings of hair with which quadrupeds are usually clothed The feathers are so placed as to overlap each other like the slates or the tiles on the roof of a house They are also arranged from the fore part backwards by which the animals are enabled the more conveniently to cut their way through the air Their bones are tubular or hollow and extremely light compared with those of terrestrial animals This greatly facilitates their rising from the earth whilst their heads being comparatively small their bills shaped like a wedge their bodies slender sharp below and round above all these present a union of conditions favourable in the last degree to cutting their way through the aerial element to which they are considered as more peculiarly to belong With all these conditions however birds could not fly without wings These therefore are the instruments by which they have the power of rapid locomotion and are constructed in such a manner as to be capable of great expansion when struck in a downward direction If we except in this action the slight hollow which takes place on the under side they become almost two planes In order that the downward action may be accomplished to the necessary extent the muscles which move the wings have been made exceedingly large so large indeed that in some instances they have been estimated at not less than a sixth of the weight of the whole body Therefore when a bird is on the ground and intends to fly it takes a leap and immediately stretching its wings strikes them out with great force By this act these are brought into an oblique direction being turned partly upwards and partly horizontally forwards That part of the force which has the upward tendency is neutralized by the weight of the bird whilst the horizontal force serves to carry it forward The stroke being completed it moves upon its wings which being contracted and having their edges turned upwards obviate in a great measure the resistance of the air When it is sufficiently elevated it makes a second stroke downwards and the impulse of the air again moves it forward These successive strokes may be regarded as so many leaps taken in the air When the bird desires to direct its course to the right or the left it strikes strongly with the opposite wing which impels it to the proper side In the motions of the animal too the tail takes a prominent part and acts like the rudder of a ship except that instead of sideways it moves upwards and downwards If the bird wishes to rise it raises its tail and if to fall it depresses it and whilst in a horizontal position it keeps it steady There are few who have not observed a pigeon or a crow preserve for some time a horizontal flight without any apparent motion of the wings This is accomplished by the bird having already acquired sufficient velocity and its wings being parallel to the horizon meeting with but small resistance from the atmosphere If it begins to fall it can easily steer itself upward by means of its tail till the motion it had acquired is nearly spent when it must be renewed by a few more strokes of the wings On alighting a bird expands its wings and tail fully against the air as a ship in tacking round backs her sails in order that they may meet with all the resistance possible nine hundred nineteen IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EYES of birds there is a peculiarity necessary to their condition As they pass a great portion of their lives among thickets and hedges they are provided for the defence of their eyes from external injuries as well as from the effects of the light when flying in opposition to the rays of the sun with a nictating or winking membrane which can at pleasure be drawn over the whole eye like a curtain This covering is neither opaque nor wholly pellucid but is somewhat transparent and it is by its means that the eagle is said to be able to gaze at the sun In birds says a writer on this subject we find that the sight is much more piercing extensive and exact than in the other orders of animals The eye is much larger in proportion to the bulk of the head than in any of these This is a superiority conferred upon them not without a corresponding utility it seems even indispensable to their safety and subsistence Were this organ in birds dull or in the least degree opaque they would be in danger from the rapidity of their motion of striking against various objects in their flight In this case their celerity instead of being an advantage would become an evil and their flight be restrained by the danger resulting from it Indeed we may consider the velocity with which an animal moves as a sure indication of the perfection of its vision Among the quadrupeds the sloth has its sight greatly limited whilst the hawk as it hovers in the air can espy a lark sitting on a clod perhaps at twenty times the distance at which a man or a dog could perceive it nine hundred twenty AMONGST THE MANY PECULIARITIES IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF BIRDS not the least is the mode by which their respiration is accomplished This is effected by means of air vessels which extend throughout the body and adhere to the under surface of the bones These by their motion force the air through the true lungs which are very small and placed in the uppermost part of the chest and closely braced down to the back and ribs The lungs which are never expanded by air are destined to the sole purpose of oxidizing the blood In the experiments made by mister John Hunter to discover the use of this general diffusion of air through the bodies of birds he found that it prevents their respiration from being stopped or interrupted by the rapidity of their motion through a resisting medium It is well known that in proportion to celerity of motion the air becomes resistive and were it possible for a man to move with the swiftness of a swallow as he is not provided with an internal construction similar to that of birds the resistance of the air would soon suffocate him nine hundred twenty one BIRDS ARE DISTRIBUTED OVER EVERY PART OF THE GLOBE being found in the coldest as well as the hottest regions although some species are restricted to particular countries whilst others are widely dispersed At certain seasons of the year many of them change their abodes and migrate to climates better adapted to their temperaments or modes of life for a time than those which they leave Many of the birds of Britain directed by an unerring instinct take their departure from the island before the commencement of winter and proceed to the more congenial warmth of Africa to return with the next spring The causes assigned by naturalists for this peculiarity are either a deficiency of food or the want of a secure asylum for the incubation and nourishment of their young Their migrations are generally performed in large companies and in the day they follow a leader which is occasionally changed During the night many of the tribes send forth a continual cry to keep themselves together although one would think that the noise which must accompany their flight would be sufficient for that purpose The flight of birds across the Mediterranean was noticed three thousand years ago as we find it said in the book of Numbers in the Scriptures that There went forth a wind from the Lord and brought quails from the sea and let them fall upon the camp and a day s journey round about it to the height of two cubits above the earth nine hundred twenty two IF THE BEAUTY OF BIRDS were not a recommendation to their being universally admired their general liveliness gaiety and song would endear them to mankind It appears however from accurate observations founded upon experiment that the notes peculiar to different kinds of birds are altogether acquired and that they are not innate any more than language is to man The attempt of a nestling bird to sing has been compared to the endeavour of a child to talk The first attempts do not seem to possess the slightest rudiments of the future song but as the bird grows older and becomes stronger it is easily perceived to be aiming at acquiring the art of giving utterance to song Whilst the scholar is thus endeavouring to form his notes when he is once sure of a passage he usually raises his tone but drops it again when he finds himself unequal to the voluntary task he has undertaken Many well authenticated facts says an ingenious writer seem decisively to prove that birds have no innate notes but that like mankind the language of those to whose care they have been committed at their birth will be their language in after life It would appear however somewhat unaccountable why in a wild state they adhere so steadily to the song of their own species only when the notes of so many others are to be heard around them This is said to arise from the attention paid by the nestling bird to the instructions of its own parent only generally disregarding the notes of all the rest Persons however who have an accurate ear and who have given their attention to the songs of birds can frequently distinguish some which have their notes mixed with those of another species but this is in general so trifling that it can hardly be considered as more than the mere varieties of provincial dialects nine hundred twenty three IN REFERENCE TO THE FOOD OF BIRDS we find that it varies as it does in quadrupeds according to the species Some are altogether carnivorous others as so many of the web footed tribes subsist on fish others again on insects and worms and others on grain and fruit The extraordinary powers of the gizzard of the granivorous tribes in comminuting their food so as to prepare it for digestion would were they not supported by incontrovertible facts founded on experiment appear to exceed all credibility Tin tubes full of grain have been forced into the stomachs of turkeys and in twenty four hours have been found broken compressed and distorted into every shape Twelve small lancets very sharp both at the point and edges have been fixed in a ball of lead covered with a case of paper and given to a turkey cock and left in its stomach for eight hours After that time the stomach was opened when nothing appeared except the naked ball The twelve lancets were broken to pieces whilst the stomach remained perfectly sound and entire From these facts it is concluded that the stones so frequently found in the stomachs of the feathered tribes are highly useful in assisting the gastric juices to grind down the grain and other hard substances which constitute their food The stones themselves being also ground down and separated by the powerful action of the gizzard are mixed with the food and no doubt contribute very greatly to the health as well as to the nourishment of the animals nine hundred twenty four ALL BIRDS BEING OVIPAROUS the eggs which they produce after the process of incubation or sitting for a certain length of time are in the various species different both in figure and colour as well as in point of number They contain the elements of the future young for the perfecting of which in the incubation a bubble of air is always placed at the large end between the shell and the inside skin It is supposed that from the heat communicated by the sitting bird to this confined air its spring is increased beyond its natural tenor and at the same time its parts are put into motion by the gentle rarefaction By this means pressure and motion are communicated to the parts of the egg which in some inscrutable way gradually promote the formation and growth of the young till the time comes for its escaping from the shell To preserve an egg perfectly fresh and even fit for incubation for five or six months after it has been laid Reaumur the French naturalist has shown that it is only necessary to stop up its pores with a slight coating of varnish or mutton suet nine hundred twenty five BIRDS HOWEVER DO NOT LAY EGGS before they have some place to put them accordingly they construct nests for themselves with astonishing art As builders they exhibit a degree of architectural skill niceness and propriety that would seem even to mock the imitative talents of man however greatly these are marked by his own high intelligence and ingenuity Each circumstance Most artfully contrived to favour warmth Here read the reason of the vaulted roof How Providence compensates ever kind The enormous disproportion that subsists Between the mother and the numerous brood Which her small bulk must quicken into life In building their nests the male and female generally assist each other and they contrive to make the outside of their tenement bear as great a resemblance as possible to the surrounding foliage or branches so that it cannot very easily be discovered even by those who are in search of it This art of nidification is one of the most wonderful contrivances which the wide field of Nature can show and which of itself ought to be sufficient to compel mankind to the belief that they and every other part of the creation are constantly under the protecting power of a superintending Being whose benign dispensations seem as exhaustless as they are unlimited Illustration RECIPES CHAPTER XXI CHICKEN CUTLETS an Entree nine hundred twenty six INGREDIENTS two chickens

to fry the cutlets Average cost twos each Sufficient for an entree Seasonable from April to July FOWLS AS FOOD Brillat Savarin pre eminent in gastronomic taste says that he believes the whole gallinaceous family was made to enrich our larders and furnish our tables for from the quail to the turkey he avers their flesh is a light aliment full of flavour and fitted equally well for the invalid as for the man of robust health The fine flavour however which Nature has given to all birds coming under the definition of poultry man has not been satisfied with and has used many means such as keeping them in solitude and darkness and forcing them to eat to give them an unnatural state of fatness or fat This fat thus artificially produced is doubtless delicious and the taste and succulence of the boiled and roasted bird draw forth the praise of the guests around the table Well fattened and tender a fowl is to the cook what the canvas is to the painter for do we not see it served boiled roasted fried fricasseed hashed hot cold whole dismembered boned broiled stuffed on dishes and in pies always handy and ever acceptable THE COMMON OR DOMESTIC FOWL From time immemorial the common or domestic fowl has been domesticated in England and is supposed to be originally the offspring of some wild species which abound in the forests of India It is divided into a variety of breeds but the most esteemed are the Poland or Black the Dorking the Bantam the Game Fowl and the Malay or Chittagong The common or barn door fowl is one of the most delicate of the varieties and at Dorking in Surrey the breed is brought to great perfection Till they are four months old the term chicken is applied to the young female after that age they are called pullets till they begin to lay when they are called hens The English counties most productive in poultry are Surrey Sussex Norfolk Herts Devon and Somerset FRENCH CHICKEN CUTLETS Cold Meat Cookery nine hundred twenty seven

minutes or rather longer pour in one two pint of good gravy made of the chicken bones stew gently for twenty minutes strain it and serve Time five minutes to fry the cutlets thirty five minutes to make the gravy Average cost exclusive of the chicken nined Seasonable from April to July EGGS FOR HATCHING Eggs intended for hatching should be removed as soon as laid and placed in bran in a dry cool place Choose those that are near of a size and as a rule avoid those that are equally thick at both ends such probably contain a double yolk and will come to no good Eggs intended for hatching should never be stored longer than a month as much less the better Nine eggs may be placed under a Bantam hen and as many as fifteen under a Dorking The odd number is considered preferable as more easily packed It will be as well to mark the eggs you give the hen to sit on so that you may know if she lays any more if she does you must remove them for if hatched at all they would be too late for the brood If during incubation an egg should be broken remove it and take out the remainder and cleanse them in luke warm water or it is probable the sticky nature of the contents of the broken egg will make the others cling to the hen s feathers and they too may be fractured HENS SITTING Some hens are very capricious as regards sitting they will make a great fuss and keep pining for the nest and when they are permitted to take to it they will sit just long enough to addle the eggs and then they re off again The safest way to guard against such annoyance is to supply the hen with some hard boiled eggs if she sits on them a reasonable time and seems steadily inclined like a good matron you may then give her proper eggs and let her set about the business in earnest CHICKEN OR FOWL PATTIES nine hundred twenty eight INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast chicken or fowl to every one four lb of meat allow two oz of ham three tablespoonfuls of cream two tablespoonfuls of veal gravy one two teaspoonful of minced lemon peel cayenne salt and pepper to taste one tablespoonful of lemon juice one oz of butter rolled in flour puff paste Mode Mince very small the white meat from a cold roast fowl after removing all the skin weigh it and to every one four lb of meat allow the above proportion of minced ham Put these into a stewpan with the remaining ingredients stir over the fire for ten minutes or one four hour taking care that the mixture does not burn Roll out some puff paste about one four inch in thickness line the patty pans with this put upon each a small piece of bread and cover with another layer of paste brush over with the yolk of an egg and bake in a brisk oven for about one four hour When done cut a round piece out of the top and with a small spoon take out the bread be particular in not breaking the outside border of the crust and fill the patties with the mixture Time one four hour to prepare the meat not quite one four hour to bake the crust Seasonable at any time HATCHING Sometimes the chick within the shell is unable to break away from its prison for the white of the egg will occasionally harden in the air to the consistence of joiners clue when the poor chick is in a terrible fix An able writer says Assistance in hatching must not be rendered prematurely and thence unnecessarily but only in the case of the chick being plainly unable to release itself then indeed an addition may probably be made to the brood as great numbers are always lost in this way The chick makes a circular fracture at the big end of the egg and a section of about one third of the length of the shell being separated delivers the prisoner provided there is no obstruction from adhesion of the body to the membrane which lines the shell Between the body of the chick and the membrane of the shell there exists a viscous fluid the white of the egg thickened with the intense heat of incubation until it becomes a positive glue When this happens the feathers stick fast to the shell and the chicks remain confined and must perish if not released The method of assistance to be rendered to chicks which have a difficulty in releasing themselves from the shell is to take the egg in the hand and dipping the finger or a piece of linen rag in warm water to apply it to the fastened parts until they are loosened by the gluey substance becoming dissolved and separated from the feathers The chick then being returned to the nest will extricate itself a mode generally to be observed since if violence were used it would prove fatal Nevertheless breaking the shell may sometimes be necessary and separating with the fingers as gently as may be the membrane from the feathers which are still to be moistened as mentioned above to facilitate the operation The points of small scissors may be useful and when there is much resistance as also apparent pain to the bird the process must be conducted in the gentlest manner and the shell separated into a number of small pieces The signs of a need of assistance are the egg being partly pecked and chipped and the cluck discontinuing its efforts for five of six hours Weakness from cold may disable the chicken from commencing the operation of pecking the shell which must then be artificially performed with a circular fracture such as is made by the bird itself CHICKEN OR FOWL PIE nine hundred twenty nine INGREDIENTS two small fowls or one large one white pepper and salt to taste one two teaspoonful of grated nutmeg one two teaspoonful of pounded mace forcemeat No four hundred seventeen a few slices of ham three hard boiled eggs one two pint of water puff crust Mode Skin and cut up the fowls into joints and put the neck leg and backbones in a stewpan with a little water an onion a bunch of savoury herbs and a blade of mace let these stew for about an hour and when done strain off the liquor this is for gravy Put a layer of fowl at the bottom of a pie dish then a layer of ham then one of forcemeat and hard boiled eggs cut in rings between the layers put a seasoning of pounded mace nutmeg pepper and salt Proceed in this manner until the dish is full and pour in about one two pint of water border the edge of the dish with puff crust put on the cover ornament the top and glaze it by brushing over it the yolk of an egg Bake from one one four to one one two hour should the pie be very large and when done pour in at the top the gravy made from the bones If to be eaten cold and wished particularly nice the joints of the fowls should be boned and placed in the dish with alternate layers of forcemeat sausage meat may also be substituted for the forcemeat and is now very much used When the chickens are boned and mixed with sausage meat the pie will take about two hours to bake It should be covered with a piece of paper when about half done to prevent the paste from being dried up or scorched Time For a pie with unboned meat one one four to one one two hour with boned meat and sausage or forcemeat one one two to two hours Average cost with two fowls sixs sixd Sufficient for six or seven persons Seasonable at any time THE YOUNG CHICKS The chicks that are hatched first should be taken from underneath the hen lest she might think her task at an end and leave the remaining eggs to spoil As soon as the young birds are taken from the mother they must be placed in a basket lined with soft wool flannel or hay and stood in the sunlight if it be summer time or by the fire if the weather be cold It is a common practice to cram young chicks with food as soon as they are born This is quite unnecessary They will so long as they are kept warm come to no harm if they take no food for twenty four hours following their birth Should the whole of the brood not be hatched by that time those that are born may be fed with bread soaked in milk and the yolk of a hard boiled egg POTTED CHICKEN OR FOWL a Luncheon or Breakfast Dish nine hundred thirty INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast chicken to every lb of meat allow one four lb of fresh butter salt and cayenne to taste one teaspoonful of pounded mace one four small nutmeg Mode Strip the meat from the bones of cold roast fowl when it is freed from gristle and skin weigh it and to every lb of meat allow the above proportion of butter seasoning and spices Cut the meat into small pieces pound it well with the fresh butter sprinkle in the spices gradually and keep pounding until reduced to a perfectly smooth paste Put it into potting pots for use and cover it with clarified butter about one four inch in thickness and if to be kept for some time tie over a bladder two or three slices of ham minced and pounded with the above ingredients will be found an improvement It should be kept in a dry place Seasonable at any time FEEDING AND COOPING THE CHICKS When all the chicks are hatched they should be placed along with the mother under a coop in a warm dry spot If two hens happen to have their broods at the same time their respective chicks should be carefully kept separate as if they get mixed and so go under the wrong coop the hens will probably maim and destroy those who have mistaken their dwelling After being kept snug beneath the coop for a week the coop should be placed under cover at nightfall the chicks may be turned loose for an hour or so in the warmest part of the day They should be gradually weaned from the soaked bread and chopped egg instead of which grits or boiled barley should be given in eight or ten days their stomachs will be strong enough to receive bruised barley and at the end of three weeks if your chicks be healthy they will be able to take care of themselves It will be well however to keep your eye on them a week or so longer as the elder chickens may drive them from their food Great care should be taken that the very young chicks do not run about the wet ground or on damp grass as this is the most prominent and fatal cause of disease While under the coop with their mother a shallow pan or plate of water should be supplied to the chicks as in a deeper vessel they are liable to drench themselves and take cold or possibly to get drowned CHICKEN OR FOWL SALAD nine hundred thirty one INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast or boiled chicken two lettuces a little endive one cucumber a few slices of boiled beetroot salad dressing No five hundred six Mode Trim neatly the remains of the chicken wash dry and slice the lettuces and place in the middle of a dish put the pieces of fowl on the top and pour the salad dressing over them Garnish the edge of the salad with hard boiled eggs cut in rings sliced cucumber and boiled beetroot cut in slices Instead of cutting the eggs in rings the yolks may be rubbed through a hair sieve and the whites chopped very finely and arranged on the salad in small bunches yellow and white alternately This should not be made long before it is wanted for table Average cost exclusive of the cold chicken eightd Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable at any time AGE AND FLAVOUR OF CHICKENS It has been the opinion of the medical faculty of all ages and all countries that the flesh of the young chicken is the must delicate and easy to digest of all animal food It is less alkalescent than the flesh of any other animal and its entire freedom from any irritating quality renders it a fit dish for the ailing or those whose stomachs are naturally weak In no animal however does age work such a change in regard to the quality of its flesh as it does in domestic fowls In their infancy cocks and hens are equally tender and toothsome but as time overtakes them it is the cock whose flesh toughens first A year old cock indeed is fit for little else than to be converted into soup while a hen at the same age although sufficiently substantial is not callous to the insinuations of a carving knife As regards capons however the rule respecting age does not hold good There is scarcely to be found a more delicious animal than a well fed well dressed capon Age does not dry up his juices indeed like wine he seems but to mellow At three years old even he is as tender as a chick with the additional advantage of his proper chicken flavour being fully developed The above remarks however concerning the capon only apply to such as are naturally fed and not crammed The latter process may produce a handsome looking bird and it may weigh enough to satisfy the whim or avarice of its stuffer but when before the fire it will reveal the cruel treatment to which it has been subjected and will weep a drippingpan ful of fat tears You will never find heart enough to place such a grief worn guest at the head of your table It should be borne in mind as a rule that small boned and short legged poultry are likely to excel the contrary sort in delicacy of colour flavour and fineness of flesh HASHED DUCK Cold Meat Cookery nine hundred thirty two INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast duck rather more than one pint of weak stock or water one onion one oz of butter thickening of butter and flour salt and cayenne to taste one two teaspoonful of minced lemon peel one dessertspoonful of lemon juice one two glass of port wine Mode Cut the duck into nice joints and put the trimmings into a stewpan slice and fry the onion in a little butter add these to the trimmings pour in the above proportion of

pieces of duck and let them get thoroughly hot through by the side of the fire but do not allow them to boil they should soak in the gravy for about one two hour Garnish with sippets of toasted bread The hash may be made richer by using a stronger and more highly flavoured gravy a little spice or pounded mace may also be added when their flavour is liked Time one one two hour Average cost exclusive of the cold duck fourd Seasonable from November to February ducklings from May to August THE DUCK This bird belongs to the order of Natatores or Swimmers the most familiar tribes of which are ducks swans geese auks penguins petrels pelicans guillemots gulls and terns They mostly live in the water feeding on fish worms and aquatic plants They are generally polygamous and make their nests among reeds or in moist places The flesh of many of the species is eatable but that of some is extremely rank and oily The duck is a native of Britain but is found on the margins of most of the European lakes It is excessively greedy and by no means a nice feeder It requires a mixture of vegetable and animal food but aquatic insects corn and vegetables are its proper food Its flesh however is savoury being not so gross as that of the goose and of easier digestion In the green pea season it is usually found on an English table but according to Ude November is its proper season when it is plump and fat TO RAGOUT A DUCK WHOLE nine hundred thirty three INGREDIENTS one large duck pepper and salt to taste good beef gravy two onions sliced four sage leaves a few leaves of lemon thyme thickening of butter and flour Mode After having emptied and singed the duck season it inside with pepper and salt and truss it Roast it before a clear fire for about twenty minutes and let it acquire a nice brown colour Put it into a stewpan with sufficient well seasoned beef gravy to cover it slice and fry the onions and add these with the sage leaves and lemon thyme both of which should be finely minced to the stock Simmer gently until the duck is tender strain skim and thicken the gravy with a little butter and flour boil it up pour over the duck and serve When in season about one one two pint of young green peas boiled separately and put in the ragout very much improve this dish Time twenty minutes to roast the duck twenty minutes to stew it Average cost from twos threed to twos sixd each Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable from November to February ducklings from April to August Illustration BUENOS AYRES DUCKS THE BUENOS AYRES DUCK The Buenos Ayres duck is of East Indian birth and is chiefly valuable as an ornament for we suppose one would as soon think of picking a Chinese teal for luncheon or a gold fish for breakfast as to consign the handsome Buenos Ayres to the spit The prevailing colour of this bird is black with a metallic lustre and a gleaming of blue steel about its breast and wings VARIETIES OF DUCKS Naturalists count nearly a hundred different species of ducks and there is no doubt that the intending keeper of these harmless and profitable birds may easily take his choice from amongst twenty different sorts There is however so little difference in the various members of the family either as regards hardiness laying or hatching that the most incompetent fancier or breeder may indulge his taste without danger of making a bad bargain In connection with their value for table light coloured ducks are always of milder flavour than those that are dark coloured the white Aylesbury s being general favourites Ducks reared exclusively on vegetable diet will have a whiter and more delicate flesh than those allowed to feed on animal offal while the flesh of birds fattened on the latter food will be firmer than that of those which have only partaken of food of a vegetable nature ROAST DUCKS nine hundred thirty four INGREDIENTS A couple of ducks sage and onion stuffing No five hundred four a little flour Choosing and Trussing Choose ducks with plump bellies and with thick and yellowish feet They should be trussed with the feet on which should be scalded and the skin peeled off and then turned up close to the legs Run a skewer through the middle of each leg after having drawn them as close as possible to the body to plump up the breast passing the same quite through the body Cut off the heads and necks and the pinions at the first joint bring these close to the sides twist the feet round and truss them at the back of the bird After the duck is stuffed both ends should be secured with string so as to keep in the seasoning Illustration ROAST DUCK Mode To insure ducks being tender never dress them the same day they are killed and if the weather permits they should hang a day or two Make a stuffing of sage and onion sufficient for one duck and leave the other unseasoned as the flavour is not liked by everybody Put them down to a brisk clear fire and keep them well basted the whole of the time they are cooking A few minutes before serving dredge them lightly with flour to make them froth and look plump and when the steam draws towards the fire send them to table hot and quickly with a good brown gravy poured round but not over the ducks and a little of the same in a tureen When in season green peas should invariably accompany this dish Time Full grown ducks from three four to one hour ducklings from twenty five to thirty five minutes Average cost from twos threed to twos sixd each Sufficient A couple of ducks for six or seven persons Seasonable Ducklings from April to August ducks from November to February Note Ducklings are trussed and roasted in the same manner and served with the same sauces and accompaniments When in season serve apple sauce Illustration ROUEN DUCKS THE ROUEN DUCK The Rouen or Rhone duck is a large and handsome variety of French extraction The plumage of the Rouen duck is somewhat sombre its flesh is also much darker and though of higher flavour not near so delicate as that of our own Aylesbury It is with this latter breed that the Rouen duck is generally mated and the result is said to be increase of size and strength In Normandy and Brittany these ducks as well as other sorts greatly abound and the duck liver pates are there almost as popular as the pate de foie gras of Strasburg In order to bring the livers of the wretched duck to the fashionable and unnatural size the same diabolical cruelty is resorted to as in the case of the Strasburg goose The poor birds are nailed by the feet to a board placed close to a fire and in that position plentifully supplied with food and water In a few days the carcase is reduced to a mere shadow while the liver has grown monstrously We would rather abstain from the acquaintance of a man who ate pate de foie gras knowing its component parts DUCK S EGGS The ancient notion that ducks whose beaks have a tendency to curve upwards are better layers than those whose beaks do not thus point is we need hardly say simply absurd all ducks are good layers if they are carefully fed and tended Ducks generally lay at night or early in the morning While they are in perfect health they will do this and one of the surest signs of indisposition among birds of this class is irregularity in laying The eggs laid will approach nearly the colour of the layer light coloured ducks laying white eggs and brown ducks greenish blue eggs dark coloured birds laying the largest eggs One time of day the notion was prevalent that a duck would hatch no other eggs than her own and although this is not true it will be nevertheless as well to match the duck s own eggs as closely as possible for we have known instances wherein the duck has turned out of the nest and destroyed eggs differing from her own in size and colour DUCKS The Mallard or Wild Duck from which is derived the domestic species is prevalent throughout Europe Asia and America The mallard s most remarkable characteristic is one which sets at defiance the speculations of the most profound ornithologist The female bird is extremely plain but the male s plumage is a splendour of greens and browns and browns and blues In the spring however the plumage of the male begins to fade and in two months every vestige of his finery has departed and he is not to be distinguished from his soberly garbed wife Then the greens and the blues and the browns begin to bud out again and by October he is once more a gorgeous drake It is to be regretted that domestication has seriously deteriorated the moral character of the duck In a wild state he is a faithful husband desiring but one wife and devoting himself to her but no sooner is he domesticated than he becomes polygamous and makes nothing of owning ten or a dozen wives at a time As regards the females they are much more solicitous for the welfare of their progeny in a wild state than a tame Should a tame duck s duckling get into mortal trouble its mother will just signify her sorrow by an extra quack or so and a flapping of her wings but touch a wild duck s little one if you dare she will buffet you with her broad wings and dash boldly at your face with her stout beak If you search for her nest amongst the long grass she will try no end of manoeuvres to lure you from it her favourite ruse being to pretend lameness to delude you into the notion that you have only to pursue her vigorously and her capture is certain so you persevere for half a mile or so and then she is up and away leaving you to find your way back to the nest if you can Among the ancients opinion was at variance respecting the wholesomeness and digestibility of goose flesh but concerning the excellence of the duck all parties were agreed indeed they not only assigned to duck meat the palm for exquisite flavour and delicacy they even attributed to it medicinal powers of the highest order Not only the Roman medical writers of the time make mention of it but likewise the philosophers of the period Plutarch assures us that Cato preserved his whole household in health in a season when plague and disease were rife through dieting them on roast duck STEWED DUCK AND PEAS Cold Meat Cookery nine hundred thirty five INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast duck two oz of butter three or four slices of lean ham or bacon one tablespoonful of flour two pints of thin gravy one or a small bunch of green onions three sprigs of parsley three cloves one pint of young green peas cayenne and salt to taste one teaspoonful of pounded sugar Mode Put the butter into a stewpan cut up the duck into joints lay them in with the slices of lean ham or bacon make it brown then dredge in a tablespoonful of flour and stir this well in before adding the gravy Put in the onion parsley cloves and gravy and when it has simmered for one four hour add a pint of young green peas and stew gently for about one two hour Season with cayenne salt and sugar take out the duck place it round the dish and the peas in the middle Time three four hour Average cost exclusive of the cold duck ones Seasonable from June to August DUCKS HATCHING Concerning incubation by ducks a practised writer says The duck requires a secret and safe place rather than any attendance and will at nature s call cover her eggs and seek her food On hatching there is not often a necessity for taking away any of the brood and having hatched let the mother retain her young ones upon the nest her own time On her moving with her brood let a coop be prepared upon the short grass if the weather be fine and under shelter if otherwise COOPING AND FEEDING DUCKLINGS Brood ducks should be cooped at some distance from any other A wide and flat dish of water to be often renewed should stand just outside the coop and barley or any other meal be the first food of the ducklings It will be needful if it be wet weather to clip their tails lest these draggle and so weaken the bird The period of the duck s confinement to the coop will depend on the weather and on the strength of the ducklings A fortnight is usually the extent of time necessary and they may even be sometimes permitted to enjoy the luxury of a swim at the end of a week They should not however be allowed to stay too long in the water at first for they will then become ill their feathers get rough and looseness of the bowels ensue In the latter case let them be closely cooped for a few days and bean meal or oatmeal be mixed with their ordinary food Illustration AYLESBURY DUCKS THE AYLESBURY DUCK The white Aylesbury duck is and deservedly a universal favourite Its snowy plumage and comfortable comportment make it a credit to the poultry yard while its broad and deep breast and its ample back convey the assurance that your satisfaction will not cease at its death In parts of Buckinghamshire this member of the duck family is bred on an extensive scale not on plains and commons however as might be naturally imagined but in the abodes of the cottagers Round the walls of the living rooms and of the bedroom even are fixed rows of wooden boxes lined with hay and it is the business of the wife and children to nurse and comfort the feathered lodgers to feed the little ducklings and to take the old ones out for an airing Sometimes the stock ducks are the cottager s own property but it more frequently happens that they are intrusted to his care by a wholesale breeder who pays him so much per score for all ducklings properly raised To be perfect the Aylesbury duck should be plump pure white with yellow feet and a flesh coloured beak STEWED DUCK AND PEAS Cold Meat Cookery nine hundred thirty six INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast duck one two pint of good gravy cayenne and salt to taste one two teaspoonful of minced lemon peel one teaspoonful of pounded sugar two oz of butter rolled in flour one one two pint of green peas Mode Cut up the duck into joints lay it in the gravy and add a seasoning of cayenne salt and minced lemon peel let tins gradually warm through but not boil Throw the peas into boiling water slightly salted and boil them rapidly until tender Drain them stir in the pounded sugar and the butter rolled in flour shake them over the fire for two or three minutes and serve in the centre of the dish with the duck laid round Time fifteen minutes to boil the peas when they are full grown Average cost exclusive of the cold duck tend Seasonable from June to August FATTENING DUCKS Many duck keepers give their birds nothing in the shape of food letting them wander about and pick up a living for themselves and they will seem to get fat even upon this precarious feeding Unless however ducks are supplied with besides chance food a liberal feed of solid corn or grain morning and evening their flesh will become flabby and insipid The simple way to fatten ducks is to let them have as much substantial food as they will eat bruised oats and pea meal being the standard fattening food for them No cramming is required as with the turkey and some other poultry they will cram themselves to the very verge of suffocation At the same time plenty of exercise and clean water should be at their service AMERICAN MODE OF CAPTURING DUCKS On the American rivers the modes of capture are various Sometimes half a dozen artificial birds are fastened to a little raft and which is so weighted that the sham birds squat naturally on the water This is quite sufficient to attract the notice of a passing flock who descend to cultivate the acquaintance of the isolated few when the concealed hunter with his fowling piece scatters a deadly leaden shower amongst them In the winter when the water is covered with rubble ice the fowler of the Delaware paints his canoe entirely white lies flat in the bottom of it and floats with the broken ice from which the aquatic inhabitants fail to distinguish it So floats the canoe till he within it understands by the quacking and fluttering and whirring of wings that he is in the midst of a flock when he is up in a moment with the murderous piece and dying quacks and lamentations rend the still air Illustration BOW BILL DUCKS Bow BILL DUCKS c Every one knows how awkward are the Anatidae waddling along on their unelastic webbed toes and their short legs which being placed considerably backward make the fore part of the body preponderate Some however are formed more adapted to terrestrial habits than others and notably amongst these may be named Dendronessa sponsa the summer duck of America This beautiful bird rears her young in the holes of trees generally overhanging the water When strong enough the young scramble to the mouth of the hole launch into the air with their little wings and feet spread out and drop into their favourite element Whenever their birthplace is at some distance from the water the mother carries them to it one by one in her bill holding them so as not to injure their yet tender frame On several occasions however when the hole was thirty forty or more yards from a piece of water Audubon observed that the mother suffered the young to fall on the grass and dried leaves beneath the tree and afterwards led them directly to the nearest edge of the next pool or creek There are some curious varieties of the domestic duck which only appear interesting from their singularity for there does not seem to be anything of use or value in the unusual characteristics which distinguish them thus the bow bill duck as shown in the engraving called by some writers the hook bill is remarkable for the peculiarly strange distortion of its beak and the tuft on the top of its head The penguin duck again waddles in an upright position like the penguin on account of the unnatural situation of its legs These odd peculiarities add nothing of value to the various breeds and may be set down as only the result of accidental malformation transmitted from generation to generation STEWED DUCK AND TURNIPS Cold Meat Cookery nine hundred thirty seven INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast duck one two pint of good gravy four shalots a few slices of carrot a small bunch of savoury herbs one blade of pounded mace one lb of turnips weighed after being peeled two oz of butter pepper and salt to taste Mode Cut up the duck into joints fry the shalots carrots and herbs and put them with the duck into the gravy add the pounded mace and stew gently for twenty minutes or one two hour Cut about one lb of turnips weighed after being peeled into one two inch squares put the butter into a stewpan and stew them till quite tender which will be in about one two hour or rather more season with pepper and salt and serve in the centre of the dish with the duck c laid round Time Rather more than one two hour to stew the turnips Average cost exclusive of the cold duck ones Seasonable from November to February THE WILD DUCK In many parts of England the wild duck is to be found especially in those desolate fenny parts where water abounds In Lincolnshire they are plentiful and are annually taken in the decoys which consist of ponds situate in the marshes and surrounded with wood or reeds to prevent the birds which frequent them from being disturbed In these the birds sleep during the day and as soon as evening sets in the decoy rises and the wild fowl feed during the night Now is the time for the decoy ducks to entrap the others From the ponds diverge in different directions certain canals at the end of which funnel nets are placed along these the decoy ducks trained for the purpose lead the others in search of food After they have got a certain length a decoy man appears and drives them further on until they are finally taken in the nets It is from these decoys in Lincolnshire that the London market is mostly supplied The Chinese have a singular mode of catching these ducks A person wades in the water up to the chin and having his head covered with an empty calabash approaches the place where the ducks are As the birds have no suspicion of the nature of the object which is concealed under the calabash they suffer its approach and allow it to move at will among their flock The man accordingly walks about in the midst of his game and whenever he pleases pulls them by the legs under the water and fixes them to his belt until he has secured as many as he requires and then moves off as he went amongst them without exciting the slightest suspicion of the trick he has been playing them This singular mode of duck hunting is also practised on the Ganges the earthen vessels of the Hindoos being used instead of calabashes These vessels being those in which the inhabitants boil their rice are considered after once being used as defiled and are accordingly thrown into the river The duck takers finding them suitable for their purpose put them on their heads and as the ducks from seeing them constantly floating down the stream are familiar with their appearance they regard them as objects from which no danger is to be expected Illustration CALL DUCKS DUCK SNARES IN THE LINCOLNSHIRE FENS The following interesting account of how duck snaring used to be managed in the Lincolnshire fens was published some years ago in a work entitled the Feathered Tribes In the lakes to which they resorted their favourite haunts were observed and in the most sequestered part of a haunt a pipe or ditch was cut across the entrance decreasing gradually in width from the entrance to the further end which was not more than two feet wide The ditch was of a circular form but did not bend much for the first ten yards The banks of the lake on each side of the ditch were kept clear of weeds and close herbage in order that the ducks might get on them to sit and dress themselves Along the ditch poles were driven into the ground close to the edge on each side and the tops were bent over across the ditch and tied together The poles then bent forward at the entrance to the ditch and formed an arch the top of which was tea feet distant from the surface of the water the arch was made to decrease in height as the ditch decreased in width so that the remote end was not more than eighteen inches in height The poles were placed about six feet from each other and connected by poles laid lengthwise across the arch and tied together Over the whole was thrown a net which was made fast to a reed fence at the entrance and nine or ten yards up the ditch and afterwards strongly pegged to the ground At the end of the ditch furthest from the entrance was fixed what was called a tunnel net of about four yards in length of a round form and kept open by a number of hoops about eighteen inches in diameter placed at a small distance from each other to keep it distended Supposing the circular bend of the ditch to be to the right when one stands with his back to the lake then on the left hand side a number of reed fences were constructed called shootings for the purpose of screening the decoy man from observation and in such a manner that the fowl in the decoy would not be alarmed while he was driving those that were in the pipe These shootings which were ten in number were about four yards in length and about six feet high From the end of the last shooting a person could not see the lake owing to the bend of the ditch and there was then no further occasion for shelter Were it not for these shootings the fowl that remained about the mouth of the ditch would have been alarmed if the person driving the fowl already under the net should have been exposed and would have become so shy as entirely to forsake the place THE DECOY MAN DOG AND DUCKS The first thing the decoy man did on approaching the ditch was to take a piece of lighted peat or turf and to hold it near his mouth to prevent the birds from smelling him He was attended by a dog trained to render him assistance He walked very silently about halfway up the shootings where a small piece of wood was thrust through the reed fence which made an aperture just large enough to enable him to see if there were any fowl within if not he walked to see if any were about the entrance to the ditch If there were he stopped made a motion to his dog and gave him a piece of cheese to eat when the dog went directly to a hole through the reed fence and the birds immediately flew off the back into the water The dog returned along the bank between the reed fences and came out to his master at another hole The man then gave the dog something more to encourage him and the dog repeated his rounds till the birds were attracted by his motions and followed him into the mouth of the ditch an operation which was called working them The man now retreated further back working the dog at different holes until the ducks were sufficiently under the net He then commanded his dog to lie down under the fence and going himself forward to the end of the ditch next the lake he took off his hat and gave it a wave between the shootings All the birds that were under the net could then see him but none that were in the lake could The former flew forward and the man then ran to the next shooting and waved his hat and so on driving them along until they came into the tunnel net into which they crept When they were all in the man gave the net a twist so as to prevent them getting back He then took the net off from the end of the ditch and taking out one by one the ducks that were in it dislocated their necks BOILED FOWLS OR CHICKENS Illustration BOILED FOWL nine hundred thirty eight INGREDIENTS A pair of fowls water Choosing and Trussing In choosing fowls for boiling it should be borne in mind that those that are not black legged are generally much whiter when dressed Pick draw singe wash and truss them in the following manner without the livers in the wings and in drawing be careful not to break the gall bladder Cut off the neck leaving sufficient skin to skewer back Cut the feet off to the first joint tuck the stumps into a slit made on each side of the belly twist the wings over the back of the fowl and secure the top of the leg and the bottom of the wing together by running a skewer through them and the body The other side must be done in the same manner Should the fowl be very large and old draw the sinews of the legs before tucking them in Make a slit in the apron of the fowl large enough to admit the parson s nose and tie a string on the tops of the legs to keep them in their proper place Mode When they are firmly trussed put them into a stewpan with plenty of hot water bring it to boil and carefully remove all the scum as it rises Simmer very gently until the fowl is tender and bear in mind that the slower it boils the plumper and whiter will the fowl be Many cooks wrap them in a floured cloth to preserve the colour and to prevent the scum from clinging to them in this case a few slices of lemon should be placed on the breasts over these a sheet of buttered paper and then the cloth cooking them in this manner renders the flesh very white Boiled ham bacon boiled tongue or pickled pork are the usual accompaniments to boiled fowls and they may be served with Bechamel white sauce parsley and butter oyster lemon liver celery or mushroom sauce A little should be poured over the fowls after the skewers are removed and the remainder sent in a tureen to table Time Large fowl one hour moderate sized one three four hour chicken from twenty minutes to one two hour Average cost in full season fives the pair Sufficient for seven or eight persons Seasonable all the year but scarce in early spring Illustration GAME FOWLS THE GAME FOWL Respecting the period at which this well known member of the Gallus family became domesticated history is silent There is little doubt however that like the dog it has been attached to mankind ever since mankind were attached to civilization Although the social position of this bird is at the present time highly respectable it is nothing to what it was when Rome was mistress of the world Writing at that period Pliny says respecting the domestic cock The gait of the cock is proud and commanding he walks with head erect and elevated crest alone of all birds he habitually looks up to the sky raising at the same time his curved and scythe formed tail and inspiring terror in the lion himself that most intrepid of animals They regulate the conduct of our magistrates and open or close to them their own houses They prescribe rest or movement to the Roman fasces they command or prohibit battles In a word they lord it over the masters of the world As well among the ancient Greeks as the Romans was the cock regarded with respect and even awe The former people practised divinations by means of this bird Supposing there to be a doubt in the camp as to the fittest day to fight a battle the letter of every day in the week would be placed face downwards and a grain of corn placed on each then the sacred cock would be let loose and according to the letters he pecked his corn from so would the battle time be regulated On one momentous occasion however a person inimical to priestly interest officiously examined the grain and found that those lying on the letters not wanted were made of wax and the birds preferring the true grain left these untouched It is needless to add that after this divination through the medium of cocks and grain fell out of fashion Whether or no the learned fowl above alluded to were of the game breed is unknown but that the birds were bred for the inhuman sport of fighting many hundred years before the Christian era there can be no doubt Themistocles the Athenian king who flourished more than two thousand years ago took advantage of the sight of a pitched battle between two cocks to harangue his soldiers on courage Observe said he with what intrepid valour they fight inspired by no other motive than lore of victory whereas you have to contend for your religion and your liberty for your wives and children and for the tombs of your ancestors And to this day his courage has not degenerated He still preserves his bold and elegant gait his sparkling eye while his wedge shaped beak and cruel spurs are ever ready to support his defiant crow It is no wonder that the breed is not plentiful first on account of the few eggs laid by the hen and secondly from the incurable pugnacity of the chicks Half fledged broods may be found blind as bats from fighting and only waiting for the least glimmer of sight to be at it again Without doubt the flesh of game fowls is every way superior to that of every chicken of the family BROILED FOWL AND MUSHROOM SAUCE nine hundred thirty nine INGREDIENTS A large fowl seasoning to taste of pepper and salt two handfuls of button mushrooms one slice of lean ham three four pint of thickened gravy one teaspoonful of lemon juice one two teaspoonful of pounded sugar Mode Cut the fowl into quarters roast it until three parts done and keep it well basted whilst at the fire Take the fowl up broil it for a few minutes over a clear fire and season it with pepper and salt Have ready some mushroom sauce made in the following manner Put the mushrooms into a stewpan with a small piece of butter the ham a seasoning of pepper and salt and the gravy simmer these gently for one two hour add the lemon juice and sugar dish the fowl and pour the sauce round them Time To roast the fowl thirty five minutes to broil it ten to fifteen minutes Average cost in full season twos sixd Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable In full season from May to January Illustration BLACK BANTAMS THE BANTAM No one will dispute that for beauty animation plumage and courage the Bantam is entitled to rank next to the game fowl As its name undoubtedly implies the bird is of Asiatic origin The choicest sorts are the buff coloured and those that are entirely black A year old Bantam cock of pure breed will not weigh more than sixteen ounces Despite its small size however it is marvellously bold especially in defence of its progeny A friend of the writer s residing at Kensington possessed a pair of thorough bred Bantams that were allowed the range of a yard where a fierce bull terrier was kennelled The hen had chicks and when about three weeks old one of them strayed into the dog kennel The grim beast within took no notice of the tiny fledgling but when the anxious mother ventured in to fetch out the truant with a growl the dog woke and nearly snapped her asunder in his great jaws The cock bird saw the tragic fate of its partner but nothing daunted flew at the dog with a fierce cry and pecked savagely at its face The odds however were too great and when the terrier had sufficiently recovered from the astonishment caused by the sudden and unexpected attack he seized the audacious Bantam and shook him to death and in five minutes the devoted couple were entombed in Pincher s capacious maw BOILED FOWL AND RICE nine hundred forty INGREDIENTS one fowl mutton broth two onions two small blades of pounded mace pepper and salt to taste one four pint of rice parsley and butter Mode Truss the fowl as for boiling and put it into a stewpan with sufficient clear well skimmed mutton broth to cover it add the onion mace and a seasoning of pepper and salt stew very gently for about one hour should the fowl be large and about one two hour before it is ready put in the rice which should be well washed and soaked When the latter is tender strain it from the liquor and put it on a sieve reversed to dry before the fire and in the mean time keep the fowl hot Dish it put the rice round as a border pour a little parsley and butter over the fowl and the remainder send to table in a tureen Time A large fowl one hour Average cost in full season twos sixd Sufficient for three or four persons Seasonable all the year but scarce in early spring Illustration DORKINGS THE DORKING This bird takes its name from that of a town in Surrey where the breed is to be found in greater numbers and certainly in greater perfection than elsewhere It is generally believed that this particular branch of poultry was found in the town above mentioned as long ago as the Roman era The Dorking s chief characteristic is that he has five claws on each foot the extra claw however is never of sufficient length to encumber the foot or to cause it to drag its nest or scratch out the eggs The colour of the true Dorking is pure white long in the body short in the legs and a prolific layer Thirty years ago there was much controversy respecting the origin of the Dorking The men of Sussex declared that the bird belonged to them and brought birds indigenous to their weald and possessing all the Dorking fine points and peculiarities in proof of the declaration Others inclined to the belief that the Poland bird was the father of the Dorking and not without at least a show of reason as the former bird much resembles the latter in shape and despite its sombre hue it is well known that the Poland cock will occasionally beget thorough white stock from white English hens The commotion has however long ago subsided and Dorking still retains its fair reputation for fowl CURRIED FOWL nine hundred forty one INGREDIENTS one fowl two oz of butter three onions sliced one pint of white veal gravy one tablespoonful of curry powder one tablespoonful of flour one apple four tablespoonfuls of cream one tablespoonful of lemon juice Mode Put the butter into a stewpan with the onions sliced the fowl cut into small joints and the apple peeled cored and minced Fry of a pale brown add the stock and stew gently for twenty minutes rub down the curry powder and flour with a little of the gravy quite smoothly and stir this to the other ingredients simmer for rather more than one two hour and just before serving add the above proportion of hot cream and lemon juice Serve with boiled rice which may either be heaped lightly on a dish by itself or put round the curry as a border Time fifty minutes Average cost threes threed Sufficient for three or four persons Seasonable in the winter Note This curry may be made of cold chicken but undressed meat will be found far superior THE POLAND This bird a native of Holland is a great favourite with fowl keepers especially those who have on eye to profit rather than to amusement Those varieties known as the silver spangled and the gold spangled are handsome enough to please the most fastidious but the common black breed with the bushy crown of white feathers is but a plain bird The chief value of the common Poland lies in the great number of eggs they produce indeed in many parts they are as well known as everlasting layers as by their proper name However the experienced breeder would take good care to send the eggs of his everlasting layers to market and not use them for home consumption as although they may be as large as those laid by other hens the amount of nutriment contained in them is not nearly so great mister Mowbray once kept an account of the number of eggs produced by this prolific bird with the following result From the twenty fifth of October to the twenty fifth of the following September five hens laid five hundred three eggs the average weight of each egg was one ounce five drachms and the total weight of the whole exclusive of the shells fifty one four pounds Taking the weight of the birds at the fair average of five pounds each we thus see them producing within a year double their weight of egg alone and supposing every egg to contain a chick and allowing the chick to grow in less than eighteen months from the laying of the first egg two thousand five hundred pounds of chicken meat would be the result The Poland is

have known amateur fowl keepers worthy souls who would butter the very barley they gave their pets if they thought they would the more enjoy it coop up a male bird and three or four hens in an ordinary egg chest placed on its side and with the front closely barred with iron hooping This system will not do Every animal from man himself to the guinea pig must have what is vulgarly but truly known as elbow room and it must be self evident how emphatically this rule applies to winged animals It may be urged in the case of domestic fowls that from constant disuse and from clipping and plucking and other sorts of maltreatment their wings can hardly be regarded as instruments of flight we maintain however that you may pluck a fowl s wing joints as bare as a pumpkin but you will not erase from his memory that he is a fowl and that his proper sphere is the open air If he likewise reflects that he is an ill used fowl a prison bird he will then come to the conclusion that there is not the least use under such circumstances for his existence and you must admit that the decision is only logical and natural BOILED FOWL with Oysters Excellent nine hundred forty four INGREDIENTS one young fowl three dozen oysters the yolks of two eggs one four pint of cream Mode Truss a young fowl as for boiling fill the inside with oysters which have been bearded and washed in their own liquor secure the ends of the fowl put it into a jar and plunge the jar into a saucepan of boiling water Keep it boiling for one one two hour or rather longer then take the gravy that has flowed from the oysters and fowl of which there will be a good quantity stir in the cream and yolks of eggs add a few oysters scalded in their liquor let the sauce get quite hot but do not allow it to boil pour some of it over the fowl and the remainder send to table in a tureen A blade of pounded mace added to the sauce with the cream and eggs will be found an improvement Time one one two hour Average cost fours sixd Sufficient for three or four persons Seasonable from September to April THE FOWL HOUSE In building a fowl house take care that it be if possible built against a wall or fence that faces the south and thus insure its inmates against many cold winds driving rains and sleets they will otherwise suffer Let the floor of the house slope half an inch to the foot from back to front so as to insure drainage let it also be close hard and perfectly smooth so that it may be cleanly swept out A capital plan is to mix a few bushels of chalk and dry earth spread it over the floor and pay a paviour s labourer a trifle to hammer it level with his rammer The fowl house should be seven feet high and furnished with perches at least two feet apart The perches must be level and not one above the other or unpleasant consequences may ensue to the undermost row The perches should be ledged not fixed just dropped into sockets that they may be easily taken out and cleaned not lower than five feet from the ground convenient slips of wood being driven into the wall to render the ascent as easy as possible The front of the fowl house should be latticed taking care that the interstices be not wide enough even to tempt a chick to crawl through Nesting boxes containing soft hay and fitted against the walls so as to be easily reached by the perch ladder should be supplied It will be as well to keep by you a few portable doors so that you may hang one before the entrance to a nesting box when the hen goes in to sit This will prevent other hens from intruding a habit to which some are much addicted FRICASSEED FOWL OR CHICKEN an Entree nine hundred forty five INGREDIENTS two small fowls or one large one three oz of butter a bunch of parsley and green onions one clove two blades of mace

carve them into joints blanch these in boiling water for two or three minutes take them out and immerse them in cold water to render them white Put the trimmings with the necks and legs into a stewpan add the parsley onions clove mace shalot bay leaf and a seasoning of pepper and salt pour to these the water that the chickens were blanched in and simmer gently for rather more than one hour Have ready another stewpan put in the joints of fowl with the above proportion of butter dredge them with flour let them get hot but do not brown them much then moisten the fricassee with the gravy made from the trimmings c and stew very gently for one two hour Lift the fowl into another stewpan skim the sauce reduce it quickly over the fire by letting it boil fast and strain it over them Add the cream and a seasoning of pounded mace and cayenne let it boil up and when ready to serve stir to it the well beaten yolks of three eggs these should not be put in till the last moment and the sauce should be made hot but must not boil or it will instantly curdle A few button mushrooms stewed with the fowl are by many persons considered an improvement Time one hour to make the gravy one two hour to simmer the fowl Average cost fives the pair Sufficient one large fowl for one entree Seasonable at any time STOCKING THE FOWL HOUSE Take care that the birds with which you stock your house are young The surest indications of old age are fading of the comb and gills from brilliant red to a dingy brick colour general paleness of plumage brittleness of the feathers length and size of the claws and the scales of the legs and feet assuming a ragged and corny appearance Your cock and hens should be as near two years old as possible Hens will lay at a year old but the eggs are always insignificant in size and the layers giddy and unsteady sitters The hen bird is in her prime for breeding at three years old and will continue so under favourable circumstances for two years longer after which she will decline Crowing hens and those that have large combs are generally looked on with mistrust but this is mere silliness and superstition though it is possible that a spruce young cock would as much object to a spouse with such peculiar addictions as a young fellow of our own species would to a damsel who whistled and who wore whiskers Fowls with yellow legs should be avoided they are generally of a tender constitution loose fleshed and of indifferent flavour FRICASSEED FOWL Cold Meat Cookery nine hundred forty six INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast fowl one strip of

one hour to make the gravy one four hour to warm the fowl Average cost exclusive of the cold chicken eightd Seasonable at any time CHARACTERISTICS OF HEALTH AND POWER The chief characteristics of health in a fowl are brightness and dryness of eye and nostrils the comb and wattles firm and ruddy the feathers elastic and glossy The most useful cock is generally the greatest tyrant who struts among his hens despotically with his head erect and his eyes ever watchful There is likely to be handsomer and stronger chicks in a house where a bold active even savage bird reigns than where the lord of the hen house is a weak meek creature who bears the abuse and peckings of his wives without a remonstrance I much prefer dark coloured cock birds to those of light plumage A cock to be handsome should be of middling size his bill should be short comb bright red wattles large breast broad and wings strong His head should be rather small than otherwise his legs short and sturdy and his spurs well formed his feathers should be short and close and the more frequently and heartily he crows the better father he is likely to become The common error of choosing hens above the ordinary stature of their respective varieties should be avoided as the best breeding hens are those of medium size FRIED FOWLS Cold Meat Cookery I nine hundred forty seven INGREDIENTS The remains of cold

very common occurrence with him to conceive a sudden and violent dislike for one or more of his wives and not allow the obnoxious ones to approach within some distance of the others indeed I know many cases where the capricious tyrant has set upon the innocent cause of his resentment and killed her outright In all such cases the hen objected to should be removed and replaced by another If the cock should by any accident get killed considerable delicacy is required in introducing a new one The hens may mope and refuse to associate with their new husband clustering in corners and making odious comparisons between him and the departed or the cock may have his own peculiar notions as to what a wife should be and be by no means satisfied with those you have provided him The plan is to keep him by himself nearly the whole day supplying him plentifully with exhilarating food then to turn him loose among the hens and to continue this practice allowing him more of the society of his wives each day until you suffer him to abide with them altogether II nine hundred forty eight INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast fowl vinegar salt and cayenne to taste four minced shalots yolk of egg to every

be a difficult matter to find among the entire fraternity of fowl keepers a dozen whose mode of fattening stock is the same Some say that the grand f secret is to give them abundance of saccharine food others say nothing beats heavy corn steeped in milk while another breeder celebrated in his day and the recipient of a gold medal from a learned society says The best method is as follows The chickens are to be taken from the hen the night after they are hatched and fed with eggs hard boiled chopped and mixed with crumbs of bread as larks and other small birds are fed for the first fortnight after which give them oatmeal and treacle mixed so as to crumble of which the chickens are very fond and thrive so fast that at the end of two months they will be as large as full grown fowls Others there are who insist that nothing beats oleaginous diet and cram their birds with ground oats and suet But whatever the course of diet favoured on one point they seem agreed and that is that while fattening the fowls should be kept in the dark Supposing the reader to be a dealer a breeder of gross chicken meat for the market against which supposition the chances are ten thousand to one and beset with as few scruples as generally trouble the huckster the advice is valuable Laugh and grow fat is a good maxim enough but Sleep and grow fat is as is well known to folks of porcine attributes a better The poor birds immured in their dark dungeons ignorant that there is life and sunshine abroad tuck their heads under their wings and make a long night of it while their digestive organs having no harder work than to pile up fat have an easy time enough But unless we are mistaken he who breeds poultry for his own eating bargains for a more substantial reward than the questionable pleasure of burying his carving knife in chicken grease Tender delicate and nutritious flesh is the great aim and these qualities I can affirm without fear of contradiction were never attained by a dungeon fatted chicken perpetual gloom and darkness is as incompatible with chicken life as it is with human If you wish to be convinced of the absurdity of endeavouring to thwart nature s laws plant a tuft of grass or a cabbage plant in the darkest corner of your coal cellar The plant or the tuft may increase in length and breadth but its colour will be as wan and pale almost as would be your own face under the circumstances POULET A LA MARENGO nine hundred forty nine INGREDIENTS one large fowl four tablespoonfuls of salad oil one tablespoonful of flour one pint of stock No

two hour and skim off the fat as it rises to the top add the mushrooms season with salt pepper garlic and sugar take out the fowl which arrange pyramidically on the dish with the inferior joints at

Average cost threes sixd Sufficient for three or four persons Seasonable at any time A FOWL A LA MARENGO The following is the origin of the well known dish Poulet a la Marengo On the evening of the battle the first consul was very hungry after the agitation of the day and a fowl was ordered with all expedition The fowl was procured but there was no butter at hand and unluckily none could be found in the neighbourhood There was oil in abundance however and the cook having poured a certain quantity into his skillet put in the fowl with a clove of garlic and other seasoning with a little white wine the best the country afforded he then garnished it with mushrooms and served it up hot This dish proved the second conquest of the day as the first consul found it most agreeable to his palate and expressed his satisfaction Ever since a fowl a la Marengo is a favourite dish with all lovers of good cheer MINCED FOWL A LA BECHAMEL nine hundred fifty INGREDIENTS The remains of cold

dungeon policy of feeding practised by some This fowl which has the common run of the farm yard living on dairy scraps and offal from the stable begins to grow fat at threshing time He has his fill of the finest corn he has his fill of fresh air and natural exercise and at last he comes smoking to the table a dish for the gods In the matter of unnaturally stuffing and confining fowls Mowbray is exactly of our opinion He says The London chicken butchers as they are termed are said to be of all others the most expeditious and dexterous feeders putting up a coop of fowls and making them thoroughly fat within the space of a fortnight using much grease and that perhaps not of the most delicate kind in the food In this way I have no boasts to make having always found it necessary to allow a considerable number of weeks for the purpose of making fowls fat in coops In the common way this business is often badly managed fowls being huddled together in a small coop tearing each other to pieces instead of enjoying that repose which alone can insure the wished for object irregularly fed and cleaned until they become so stenched and poisoned in their own excrement that their flesh actually smells and tastes when smoking upon the table Sussex produces the fattest and largest poultry of any county in England and the fatting process there most common is to give them a gruel made of pot liquor and bruised oats with which are mixed hog s grease sugar and milk The fowls are kept very warm and crammed morning and night They are put into the coop and kept there two or three days before the cramming begins and then it is continued for a fortnight and the birds are sent to market RAGOUT OF FOWL nine hundred fifty one INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast fowls three shalots two

do not allow it to boil lay the fowl neatly on the dish and garnish with croutons Time Altogether one one two hour Average cost exclusive of the cold fowl nined Seasonable at any time THE BEST FOWLS TO FATTEN c The chicks most likely to fatten well are those first hatched in the brood and those with the shortest legs Long legged fowls as a rule are by far the most difficult to fatten The most delicate sort are those which are put up to fatten as soon as the hen forsakes them for as says an old writer then they will be in fine condition and full of flesh which flesh is afterwards expended in the exercise of foraging for food and in the increase of stature and it may be a work of some weeks to recover it especially with young cocks But whether you take them in hand as chicks or not till they are older the three prime rules to be observed are sound and various food warmth and cleanliness There is nothing that a fatting fowl grows so fastidious about as his water If water any way foul be offered him he will not drink it but sulk with his food and pine and you all the while wondering the reason why Keep them separate allowing to each bird as much space as you can spare Spread the ground with sharp sandy gravel take care that they are not disturbed In addition to their regular diet of good corn make them a cake of ground oats or beans brown sugar milk and mutton suet Let the cake lie till it is stale then crumble it and give each bird a gill measureful morning and evening No entire grain should be given to fowls during the time they are fattening indeed the secret of success lies in supplying them with the most nutritious food without stint and in such a form that their digestive mills shall find no difficulty in grinding it Illustration ROAST FOWL ROAST FOWLS

broil them over a moderate fire for one four hour or twenty minutes Serve very hot with either mushroom sauce or a good gravy Pigeons may also be plainly boiled and served with parsley and butter they should be trussed like boiled fowls and take from one four hour to twenty minutes to boil Time To broil a pigeon from one four hour to twenty minutes to boil one the same time Average cost from sixd to nined each Seasonable from April to September but in the greatest perfection from midsummer to Michaelmas THE POUTER PIGEON This is a very favourite pigeon and without doubt the most curious of his species He is a tail strong bird as he had need be to carry about his great inflated crop frequently as large and as round as a middling sized turnip A perfect pouter seen on a windy day is certainly a ludicrous sight his feathered legs have the appearance of white trousers his tapering tail looks like a swallow tailed coat his head is entirely concealed by his immense windy protuberance and altogether he reminds you of a little swell of a past century staggering under a bale of linen The most common pouters are the blues buffs and whites or an intermixture of all these various colours The pouter is not a prolific breeder is a bad nurse and more likely to degenerate if not repeatedly crossed and re crossed with Irish stock than any other pigeon nevertheless it is a useful bird to keep if you are founding a new colony as it is much attached to its home and little apt to stray consequently it is calculated to induce more restless birds to fettle down and make themselves comfortable If you wish to breed pouters you cannot do worse than intrust them with the care of their own eggs ROAST PIGEONS nine hundred seventy four INGREDIENTS Pigeons three oz of butter pepper and salt to taste Trussing Pigeons to be good should be eaten fresh if kept a little the flavour goes off and they should be drawn as soon as killed Cut off the heads and necks truss the wings over the backs and cut off the toes at the first joint previous to trussing they should be carefully cleaned as no bird requires so much washing Illustration ROAST PIGEON Mode Wipe the birds very dry season them inside with pepper and salt and put about three four oz of butter into the body of each this makes them moist Put them down to a bright fire and baste them well the whole of the time they are cooking they will be done enough in from twenty to thirty minutes garnish with fried parsley and serve with a tureen of parsley and butter Bread sauce and gravy the same as for roast fowl are exceedingly nice accompaniments to roast pigeons as also egg sauce Time From twenty minutes to one two hour Average cost sixd to nined each Seasonable from April to September but in the greatest perfection from Midsummer to Michaelmas THE PIGEON The pigeon tribe forms a connecting ling between the passerine birds and poultry They are widely distributed over the world some of the species being found even in the arctic regions Their chief food is grain and they drink much not at intervals like other birds but by a continuous draught like quadrupeds The wild pigeon or stockdove is the parent whence all the varieties of the domestic pigeon are derived In the wild state it is still found in many parts of this island making its nest in the holes of rocks in the hollows of trees or in old towers but never like the ringdove on branches The blue house pigeon is the variety principally reared for the table in this country and is produced from our farmyards in great numbers When young and still fed by their parents they are most preferable for the table and are called squabs under six months they are denominated squeakers and at six months they begin to breed Their flesh is accounted savoury delicate and stimulating and the dark coloured birds are considered to have the highest flavour whilst the light are esteemed to have the more delicate flesh THE PIGEON HOUSE OR DOVECOT The first thing to be done towards keeping pigeons is to provide a commodious place for their reception and the next is to provide the pigeons themselves The situation or size of the dovecot will necessarily depend on convenience but there is one point which must invariably be observed and that is that every pair of pigeons has two holes or rooms to nest in This is indispensable as without it there will be no security but the constant prospect of confusion breaking of eggs and the destruction of young The proper place for the pigeon house is the poultry yard but it does very well near dwellings stables brewhouses bakehouses or such offices Some persons keep pigeons in rooms and have them making their nests on the floor The object is to escape the danger of the young falling out but in such cases there is a great risk of rats or other vermin getting at the pigeons ASPECT OF THE PIGEON HOUSE The front of the pigeon house should have a southwest aspect and if a room be selected for the purpose it is usual to break a hole in the roof of the building for the passage of the pigeons but which can be closed at convenience A platform ought to be laid at the entrance for the pigeons to perch upon with some kind of defence against strange cats which will frequently depopulate a whole dovecot Yet although cats are dangerous neighbours for the birds they are necessary to defend them from the approach of rats and mice which will not only suck the eggs but destroy the birds The platform should be painted white and renewed as the paint wears off white being a favourite colour with pigeons and also most conspicuous as a mark to enable them to find their house The boxes ought also to be similarly painted and renewed when necessary for which purpose lime and water will do very well THE NECESSITY OF CLEANLINESS As cleanliness in human habitations is of the first importance so is it in the pigeon house There the want of it will soon render the place a nuisance not to be approached and the birds both young and old will be so covered with vermin and filth that they will neither enjoy health nor comforts whilst early mortality amongst them will be almost certain In some cases the pigeon house is cleaned daily but it should always be done at any rate once a week and the floor covered with sifted gravel frequently renewed Pigeons being exceedingly fond of water and having a prescience of the coming of rain they may be seen upon the house tops waiting upon it until late in the evening and then spreading their wings to receive the luxury of the refreshing shower When they are confined in a room therefore they should be allowed a wide pan of water to be often renewed This serves them for a bath which cools refreshes and assists them to keep their bodies clear of vermin BREEDING PIGEONS In breeding pigeons it is necessary to match a cock and hen and shut them up together or place them near to each other and in the course of a day or two there is little doubt of their mating Various rules have been laid down for the purpose of assisting to distinguish the cock from the hen pigeon but the masculine forwardness and action of the cock is generally so remarkable that he is easily ascertained The pigeon being monogamous the male attaches and confines himself to one female and the attachment is reciprocal and the fidelity of the dove to its mate is proverbial At the age of six months young pigeons are termed squeakers and then begin to breed when properly managed Their courtship and the well known tone of voice in the cock just then acquired and commencing are indications of their approaching union Nestlings while fed by cock and hen are termed squabs and are at that age sold and used for the table The dove house pigeon is said to breed monthly when well supplied with food At all events it may be depended on that pigeons of almost any healthy and well established variety will breed eight or nine times in the year whence it may readily be conceived how vast are the numbers that may be raised Illustration CARRIER PIGEONS THE CARRIER PIGEON Without doubt the carrier is entitled to rank first in the pigeon family with the exception perhaps of the blue rock pigeons No domestic fowl can be traced to so remote an antiquity When Greece was in its glory carrier pigeons were used to convey to distant parts the names of the victors at the Olympian games During the holy war when Acre was besieged by King Richard Saladin habitually corresponded with the besieged by means of carrier pigeons A shaft from an English crossbow however happened to bring one of those feathered messengers to the ground and the stratagem was discovered the design of the Saracens revealed and so turned against the designers that Acre was in the hands of the Christians before the wily Saladin dreamt of such a thing PIGEON PIE Epsom Grand Stand Recipe nine hundred seventy five INGREDIENTS one one two lb of rump steak two or three pigeons three slices of ham pepper and salt to taste two oz of butter four eggs puff crust Mode Cut the steak into pieces about three inches square and with it line the bottom of a pie dish seasoning it well with pepper and salt Clean the pigeons rub them with pepper and salt inside and out and put into the body of each rather more than one two oz of butter lay them on the steak and a piece of ham on each pigeon Add the yolks of four eggs and half fill the dish with stock place a border of puff paste round the edge of the dish put on the cover and ornament it in any way that may be preferred Clean three of the feet and place them in a hole made in the crust at the top this shows what kind of pie it is Glaze the crust that is to say brush it over with the yolk of an egg and bake it in a well heated oven for about one one four hour When liked a seasoning of pounded mace may be added Time one one four hour or rather less Average cost fives threed Sufficient for five or six persons Seasonable at any time Illustration TUMBLER PIGEONS TUMBLER PIGEONS The smaller the size of this variety the greater its value The head should be round and smooth the neck thin and the tail similar to that of the turbit Highly bred birds of this variety will attain an elevation in their flight beyond that of any other pigeons and it is in seeing these little birds wing themselves so far into the skies that the fanciers take such delight For four or five hours tumblers have been known to keep on the wing and it is when they are almost lost to the power of human vision that they exhibit those pantomimic feats which give them their name and which are marked by a tumbling over and over process which suggests the idea of their having suddenly become giddy been deprived of their self control or overtaken by some calamity This acrobatic propensity in these pigeons has been ascribed by some to the absence of a proper power in the tail but is nothing more than a natural habit for which no adequate reason can be assigned Of this variety the Almond Tumbler is the most beautiful and the greater the variation of the colour in the flight and tail the greater their value Illustration RUNT PIGEONS THE RUNT PIGEON This is generally esteemed among the largest of the pigeon varieties and being possessed of proportionate strength with a strong propensity to exercise it they keep the dovecot in a state of almost continual commotion by domineering over the weaker inmates They breed tolerably well however and are valuable for the table There is both the Leghorn and the Spanish Runt variously plumaged but when red white or black mottled are most highly esteemed One of the great advantages connected with the Runt is that he is not likely to fly away from home Being heavy birds they find it difficult when well fed to mount even to a low housetop Again they require no loft or special dwelling place but if properly tended will be perfectly satisfied and thrive as well in a rabbit hutch as any where Their flavour is very good and it is not an uncommon thing for a squeaker Runt to exceed a pound and a quarter in weight Illustration NUN PIGEONS THE NUN PIGEON The Tumbler bears a strong resemblance to this variety which is characterized by a tuft of feathers rising from the back of the head and which on the whole is an extremely pretty little bird According to the colour of the head it is called the red black or yellow headed Nun To be a perfect bird it should have a small head and beak and the larger the tuft at the back of his head the handsomer the bird is esteemed and proportionately valuable in the eyes of pigeon fanciers Illustration TRUMPETER PIGEONS THE TRUMPETER PIGEON From the circumstance of this bird imitating the sound of a trumpet instead of cooing like other pigeons it has received its designation It is of the middle size having its legs and feet covered with feathers and its plumage generally of a mottled black and white It has a tuft springing from the root of its beak and the larger this topknot is the higher the estimation in which the breed is held In their powers of trumpeting some are more expert than others and whether this has any effect in influencing their own estimate of themselves we cannot say but they are rather select in the choice of their company If two of them are put in a pigeon house with other doves it will be found that they confine their association almost entirely to each other As much as two guineas have been paid for a well trained docile bird of this kind Illustration WOOD PIGEON THE WOOD OR WILD PIGEON Buffon enumerates upwards of thirty varieties of the pigeon which he derives from one root viz the stockdove or common wild pigeon All the varieties of colour and form which we witness he attributes to human contrivance and fancy Nevertheless there exist essentially specific differences in these birds which would appear to be attributable rather to the nature of the region soil and climate to which they are indigenous than to the art and ingenuity of man The stockdove in its wild state is still found in some parts of Britain forming its nest in the holes of rocks old towers and in the hollows of trees it never however like the ringdove nestles in the branches Multitudes of wild pigeons still visit our shores in the winter coming from their more northerly retreats making their appearance about November and retiring again in the spring When forests of beechwood covered large tracts of the ground of this country these birds used to haunt them in myriads frequently covering a mile of ground in extent when they went out in the morning to feed STEWED PIGEONS nine hundred seventy six INGREDIENTS six pigeons a few slices of bacon three oz of butter two tablespoonfuls of minced parsley sufficient stock No one hundred four to cover the pigeons thickening of butter and flour one tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup one tablespoonful of port wine Mode Empty and clean the pigeons thoroughly mince the livers add to these the parsley and butter and put it into the insides of the birds Truss them with the legs inward and put them into a stewpan with a few slices of bacon placed under and over them add the stock and stew gently for rather more than one two hour Dish the pigeons strain the gravy thicken it with butter and flour add the ketchup and port wine give one boil pour over the pigeons and serve Time Rather more than one two hour Average cost sixd to nined each Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable from April to September Illustration FANTAIL PIGEONS THE FANTAIL PIGEON This curious variety is inferior in point of size to most of the other varieties and is characterized by having a short slender bill pendent wings and naked legs and feet It has the power of erecting its tail in the manner of a turkey cock during which action especially when paying court to it s mate it trembles or shakes like the peacock when moving about with his train expanded and in full display This power of erecting and spreading the tail is not confined to the male bird alone the female possesses the same power to an equal extent and otherwise resembles the male in every respect It is not very prolific and seldom succeeds so well in the aviary or pigeon house as most of the other kinds Illustration JACOBIN PIGEONS THE JACOBIN PIGEON This variety having the power to transmit to posterity a form precisely similar with all its peculiar characters undiminished is among pigeon fanciers designated as of a pure or permanent race It is distinguished by a remarkable ruff or frill of raised feathers which commencing behind the head and proceeding down the neck and breast forms a kind of hood not unlike that worn by a monk From this circumstance it has obtained its Gallic name of nonnain capuchin In size it is one of the smallest of the domestic pigeons and its form is light and elegant It is a very productive species and having its flight considerably impeded by the size and form of its hooded frill keeps much at home and is well adapted for the aviary or other buildings where pigeons are confined Illustration TURBIT PIGEONS THE TURBIT PIGEON This variety bears a strong resemblance to the Jacobin having a kind of frill in the fore part of its neck occasioned by the breast feathers lying contrariwise and standing straight out The species is classed in accordance with the colour of the shoulders similarly as the Nuns are by the colour of their heads Their characteristics of excellence are a full frill short bill and small round head In Germany it is called the ruffle pigeon in allusion to the feathers on its breast and it has rarely any feathers on its feet There is a peculiarity connected with this bird which somewhat lowers it in the estimation of fanciers it seldom rears more than one at a time which therefore marks it as a bird rather for amusement than profit Illustration BARB PIGEONS THE BARB PIGEON The name of this variety is a contraction of Barbary from which country it originally comes It is both prolific and has excellent qualities as a nurse The kind most esteemed is that of one uniform colour that of blue black being preferable to any other Speckled or mottled Barbs are esteemed the most common of all pigeons It is not unlike the Carrier pigeon and at a small distance might easily be mistaken for the latter It has a short beak and a small wattle A spongy pinky skin round the eyes is its chief characteristic however and this increases in size till the bird is three or four years old This peculiarity is hardly distinguishable in very young birds Illustration BLUE ROCK PIGEON THE ROCK PIGEON This variety in its wild state is found upon the rocky parts of the west of Scotland and the bold shores of the Western Isles more abundant than in any other parts of the British islands As the shores of the mainland are exposed to the muds of the Atlantic and the comparatively small islands are surrounded by that ocean the low grounds exposed to the west are seldom covered with snow for any length of time and thus the birds easily find a supply of food The numbers which there congregate are often very great and the din of their united cry is sometimes very loud and even alarming The love of home and the certainty of returning to it is very conspicuous in the rock pigeon or biset as it is called by the French Flocks from different parts of the coasts often meet on the feeding grounds but when the time of returning to rest comes round each one keeps to its own party Illustration OWL PIGEONS THE OWL PIGEON This pigeon does not seem to be so well known as it formerly was if we may judge from the fact that few modern writers mention it Like the Turbit pigeon the Owl has a remarkable tuft of feathers on the breast it having been compared by some to the frill of a shirt and by others to a full blown white rose In size it is not quite so large a pigeon as the Jacobin It is said to be preferred in France above other varieties as a bird to rear and kill for the table In England it is very far from being common indeed we have applied to several keepers of pigeons who have fancied themselves acquainted with all the varieties of this bird and they have been able to tell us nothing of it mister Harrison Weir our artist however has made his portrait from the life BOILED RABBIT Illustration BOILED RABBIT nine hundred seventy seven INGREDIENTS Rabbit water Mode For boiling choose rabbits with smooth and sharp claws as that denotes they are young should these be blunt and rugged the ears dry and tough the animal is old After emptying and skinning it wash it well in cold water and let it soak for about one four hour in warm water to draw out the blood Bring the head round to the side and fasten it there by means of a skewer run through that and the body Put the rabbit into sufficient hot water to cover it let it boil very gently until tender which will be in from one two to three four hour according to its size and age Dish it and smother it either with onion mushroom or liver sauce or parsley and butter the former is however generally preferred to any of the last named sauces When liver sauce is preferred the liver should be boiled for a few minutes and minced very finely or rubbed through a sieve before it is added to the sauce Time A very young rabbit one two hour a large one three four hour an old one one hour or longer Average cost from ones to ones sixd each Sufficient for four persons Seasonable from September to February THE RABBIT Though this animal is an inhabitant of most temperate climates it does not reach so far north as the hare The wild rabbit is a native of Great Britain and is found in large numbers in the sandy districts of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire Its flesh is by some considered to have a higher flavour than that of the tame rabbit although it is neither so white nor so delicate The animal however becomes larger and fatter in the tame than in the wild state but it is not desirable to have it so fat as it can be made CURRIED RABBIT nine hundred seventy eight INGREDIENTS one rabbit two oz of butter three onions one pint of stock No one hundred four one tablespoonful of curry powder one tablespoonful of flour one teaspoonful of mushroom powder the juice of one two lemon one two lb of rice Mode Empty skin and wash the rabbit thoroughly and cut it neatly into joints Put it into a stewpan with the butter and sliced onions and let them acquire a nice brown colour but do not allow them to blacken Pour in the stock which should be boiling mix the curry powder and flour smoothly with a little water add it to the stock with the mushroom powder and simmer gently for rather more than one two hour squeeze in the lemon juice and serve in the centre of a dish with an edging of boiled rice all round Where economy is studied water may be substituted for the stock in this case the meat and onions must be very nicely browned A little sour apple and rasped cocoa nut stewed with the curry will be found a great improvement Time Altogether three four hour Average cost from ones to ones sixd each Sufficient for four persons Seasonable in winter Illustration WILD RABBITS THE COMMON OR WILD RABBIT Warrens or inclosures are frequently made in favourable localities and some of them are so large as to comprise two thousand acres The common wild rabbit is of a grey colour and is esteemed the best for the purposes of food Its skin is valuable as an article of commerce being used for the making of hats Another variety of the rabbit however called the silver grey has been lately introduced to this country and is still more valuable Its colour is a black ground thickly interspersed with grey hairs and its powers as a destroyer and consumer of vegetable food are well known to be enormous especially by those who have gardens in the vicinity of a rabbit warren FRIED RABBIT nine hundred seventy nine INGREDIENTS one rabbit flour dripping one oz of butter one teaspoonful of minced shalot two tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup Mode Cut the rabbit into neat joints and flour them well make the dripping boiling in a fryingpan put in the rabbit and fry it a nice brown Have ready a very hot dish put in the butter shalot and ketchup arrange the rabbit pyramidically on this and serve as quickly as possible Time ten minutes Average cost from ones to ones sixd each Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable from September to February Note The rabbit may be brushed over with egg and sprinkled with bread crumbs and fried as above When cooked in this manner make a gravy in the pan by recipe No eight hundred sixty six and pour it round but not over the pieces of rabbit VARIETIES IN RABBITS Almost everybody knows that a rabbit is a furry animal that lives on plants and burrows in the ground that it has its varieties as well as other animals and that it is frequently an especial favourite with boys Among its varieties the short legged with width and substance of loin is the most hardy and fattens the most expeditiously It has besides the soundest liver rabbits generally being subject to defects of that part It is also the smallest variety There is a very large species of the hare colour having much bone length and depth of carcase large and long ears with full eyes resembling those of the hare it might readily be taken for a hybrid or mule but for the objection to its breeding Its flesh is high coloured substantial and more savoury than that of the common rabbit and cooked like the hare it makes a good dish The large white and yellow and white species have whiter and more delicate flesh and cooked in the same way will rival the turkey Rabbits are divided into four kinds distinguished as warreners parkers hedgehogs and sweethearts The warrener as his name implies is a member of a subterranean community and is less effeminate than his kindred who dwell upon the earth and have the world at their will and his fur is the most esteemed After him comes the parker whose favourite resort is a gentleman s pleasure ground where he usually breeds in great numbers and from which he frequently drives away the hares The hedgehog is a sort of vagabond rabbit that tinker like roams about the country and would have a much better coat on his back if he was more settled in his habits and remained more at home The sweetheart is a tame rabbit with its fur so sleek soft and silky that it is also used to some extent in the important branch of hat making RABBIT A LA MINUTE nine hundred eighty INGREDIENTS one rabbit one four lb of butter salt and pepper to taste two blades of pounded mace three dried mushrooms two tablespoonfuls of

acquire too much colour place a piece of paper over it to prevent its burning When done pour in at the top by means of the hole in the middle of the crust a little good gravy which may be made of the breast and leg bones of the rabbit and two or three shank bones flavoured with onion herbs and spices Time one one two hour Average cost from ones to ones sixd each Sufficient for five or six persons Seasonable from September to February Note The liver of the rabbit may be boiled minced and mixed with the forcemeat balls when the flavour is liked FECUNDITY OF THE RABBIT The fruitfulness of this animal has been the subject of wonder to all naturalists It breeds seven times in the year and generally begets seven or eight young ones at a time If we suppose this to happen regularly for a period of four years the progeny that would spring from a single pair would amount to more than a million As the rabbit however has many enemies it can never be permitted to increase in numbers to such an extent as to prove injurious to mankind for it not only furnishes man with an article of food but is by carnivorous animals of every description mercilessly sacrificed Notwithstanding this however in the time of the Roman power they once infested the Balearic islands to such an extent that the inhabitants were obliged to implore the assistance of a military force from Augustus to exterminate them

and by a few in almost every part of the country Forty years ago there were in the metropolis one or two considerable feeders who according to report kept from sixteen hundred to two thousand breeding does These large establishments however have ceased to exist and London receives the supply of tame as well as wild rabbits chiefly from the country Where they are kept however the rabbit house should be placed upon a dry foundation and be well ventilated Exposure to rain whether externally or internally is fatal to rabbits which like sheep are liable to the rot springing from the same causes Thorough ventilation and good air are indispensable where many rabbits are kept or they will neither prosper nor remain healthy for any length of time A thorough draught or passage for the air is therefore absolutely necessary and should be so contrived as to be checked in cold or wet weather by the closing or shutting of opposite doors or windows ROAST OR BAKED RABBIT nine hundred eighty

proceed in the same manner as above in a good oven it will take about the same time as roasting Time A young rabbit thirty five minutes a large one about three four hour Average cost from ones to ones sixd each Sufficient for four persons Seasonable from September to February THE HUTCH Hutches are generally placed one above another to the height required by the number of rabbits and the extent of the room Where a large stock is kept to make the most of room the hutches may be placed in rows with a sufficient interval between for feeding and cleaning instead of being in the usual way joined to the wall It is preferable to rest the hutches upon stands about a foot above the ground for the convenience of cleaning under them Each of the hutches intended for breeding should have two rooms a feeding and a bed room Those are single for the use of the weaned rabbits or for the bucks which are always kept separate The floors should be planed smooth that wet may run off and a common hoe with a short handle and a short broom are most convenient implements for cleaning these houses STEWED RABBIT nine hundred eighty four INGREDIENTS one rabbit two large onions six cloves one small teaspoonful of chopped lemon peel a few forcemeat balls thickening of butter and flour one large tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup Mode Cut the rabbit into small joints put them into a stewpan add the onions sliced the cloves and minced lemon peel Pour in sufficient water to cover the meat and when the rabbit is nearly done drop in a few forcemeat balls to which has been added the liver finely chopped Thicken the gravy with flour and butter put in the ketchup give one boil and serve Time Rather more than one two hour Average cost ones to ones sixd each Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable from September to February Illustration LOP EARED RABBIT FANCY RABBITS The graceful fall of the ears is the first thing that is looked to by the fancier next the dewlap if the animal is in its prime then the colours and marked points and lastly the shape and general appearance The ears of a fine rabbit should extend not less than seven inches measured from tip to tip in a line across the skull but even should they exceed this length they are admitted with reluctance into a fancy stock unless they have a uniform and graceful droop The dewlap which is a fold of skin under the neck and throat is only seen in fancy rabbits after they have attained their full growth it commences immediately under the jaw and adds greatly to the beauty of their appearance It goes down the throat and between the fore legs and is so broad that it projects beyond the chin The difference between the fancy and common rabbit in the back independent of the ears is sufficient to strike the common observer Fancy rabbits fetch a very high price so much as five and ten guineas and even more is sometimes given for a first rate doe If young ones are first procured from a good family the foundation of an excellent stock can be procured for a much smaller sum Sometimes the ears instead of drooping down slope backwards a rabbit with this characteristic is scarcely admitted into a fancy lot and is not considered worth more than the common variety The next position is when one ear lops outwards and the other stands erect rabbits of this kind possess but little value however fine the shape and beautiful the colour although they sometimes breed as good specimens as finer ones The forward or horn lop is one degree nearer perfection than the half lop the ears in this case slope forward and down over the forehead Rabbits with this peculiarity are often perfect in other respects with the exception of the droop of the ears and often become the parents of perfect young ones does of this kind often have the power of lifting an ear erect In the ear lop the ears spread out in an horizontal position like the wings of a bird in flight or the arms of a man swimming A great many excellent does have this characteristic and some of the best bred bucks in the fancy are entirely so Sometimes a rabbit drops one ear completely but raises the other so neatly horizontally as to constitute an ear lop this is superior to all others except the perfect fall which is so rarely to be met with that those which are merely ear lopped are considered as valuable rabbits if well bred and with other good qualities The real lop has ears that hang down by the side of the cheek slanting somewhat outward in their descent with the open part of the ear inward and sometimes either backwards or forwards instead of perpendicular when the animals stand in an easy position the tips of the ears touch the ground The hollows of the ears in a fancy rabbit of a first rate kind should be turned so completely backwards that only the outer part of them should remain in front they should match exactly in their descent and should slant outwards as little as possible The same authority asserts that perfect lops are so rare that a breeder possessing twenty of the handsomest and most perfect does would consider himself lucky if in the course of a year he managed to raise twelve full lopped rabbits out of them all As regards variety and purity of colour an experienced breeder says The fur of fancy rabbits may be blue or rather lead colour and white or black and white or tawny and white that is tortoiseshell coloured But it is not of so much importance what colours the coat of a rabbit displays as it is that those colours shall be arranged in a particular manner forming imaginary figures or fancied resemblances to certain objects Hence the peculiarities of their markings have been denoted by distinctive designations What is termed the blue butterfly smut was for some time considered the most valuable of fancy rabbits It is thus named on account of having bluish or lead coloured spots on either side of the nose having some resemblance to the spread wings of a butterfly what may be termed the groundwork of the rabbit s face being white A black and white rabbit may also have the face marked in a similar manner constituting a black butterfly smut But A good fancy rabbit must likewise have other marks without which it cannot be considered a perfect model of its kind There should be a black or blue patch on its back called the saddle the tail must be of the same colour with the back and snout while the legs should be all white and there ought to be dark stripes on both sides of the body in front passing backwards to meet the saddle and uniting on the top of the shoulders at the part called the withers in a horse These stripes form what is termed the chain having somewhat the appearance of a chain or collar hanging round the neck Among thorough bred fancy rabbits perhaps not one in a hundred will have all these markings clearly and exactly displayed on the coat but the more nearly the figures on the coat of a rabbit approach to the pattern described the greater will be its value so far at least as relates to colour The beauty and consequent worth of a fancy rabbit however depends a good deal on its shape or what is styled its carriage A rabbit is said to have a good carriage when its back is finely arched rising full two inches above the top of its head which must be held so low as for the muzzle and the points of the ears to reach almost to the ground STEWED RABBIT Larded nine hundred eighty five INGREDIENTS one rabbit a few strips of bacon rather more than one pint of good broth or stock a bunch of savoury herbs salt and pepper to taste thickening of butter and flour one glass of sherry Mode Well wash the rabbit cut it into quarters lard them with Blips of bacon and fry them then put them into a stewpan with the broth herbs and a seasoning of pepper and salt simmer gently until the rabbit is tender then strain the gravy thicken it with butter and flour add the sherry give one boil pour it over the rabbit and serve Garnish with slices of cut lemon Time Rather more than one two hour Average cost ones to ones sixd each Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable from September to February Illustration THE HARE RABBIT THE HARE RABBIT There has been lately introduced to French tables an animal called the Hare rabbit partaking of the nature characteristics and qualifications of both the hare and the rabbit It is highly spoken of both as regards flesh and flavour and it is said to be the only hybrid which is able to perpetuate its race We hope that some enterprising individual will soon secure for English tables what would seem to be a really valuable addition to our other game and poultry dishes although it will be rather difficult to exactly assign its proper position as within or without the meaning of game as by law established Only a few specimens have been seen in England at present but there is no reason to doubt that our rabbit fanciers will prove equal to the occasion and cope successfully with our neighbours across the Channel in introducing a new animal serviceable in the kitchen Illustration ANGORA RABBIT THE ANGORA RABBIT This is one of the handsomest of all rabbits It takes its name from being an inhabitant of Angora a city and district of Asia Minor Like the well known Angora goat and cat both of which are valuable on account of the fineness of their wool and fur this rabbit is prized for its long waved silky fur which as an article of commerce is highly esteemed We are not aware whether it is eaten by the inhabitants and but few specimens have been introduced into England where doubtless the beauty of its coat would materially suffer from the more humid and less genial character of the climate To the rabbits of the ancient and mountainous district of Angora the words of the wise man would seem most to apply The conies are but feeble folk yet make they their houses in the rocks Illustration HIMALAYA RABBITS THE HIMALAYA RABBIT Amidst the mighty Himalaya mountains whose peaks are the highest on the globe the pretty rabbit here portrayed is found and his colour seems to be like the snow which above the altitude of from thirteen thousand to sixteen thousand feet perpetually crowns the summits of these monarchs of the world It is at present a very rare animal in England but will doubtless be more extensively known in the course of a few years From the earth tunnelling powers of this little animal Martial declares that mankind learned the art of fortification mining and covered roads BOILED TURKEY nine hundred eighty six INGREDIENTS Turkey forcemeat No four hundred seventeen Choosing and Trussing Hen turkeys are preferable for boiling on account of their whiteness and tenderness and one of moderate size should be selected as a large one is not suitable for this mode of cooking They should not be dressed until they have been killed three or four days as they will neither look white nor will they be tender Pluck the bird carefully draw and singe it with a piece of white paper wash it inside and out and wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth Cut off the head and neck draw the strings or sinews of the thighs and cut off the legs at the first joint draw the legs into the body fill the breast with forcemeat made by recipe No four hundred seventeen run a skewer through the wing and the middle joint of the leg quite into the leg and wing on the opposite side break the breastbone and make the bird look as round and as compact as possible Illustration BOILED TURKEY Mode Put the turkey into sufficient hot water to cover it let it come to a boil then carefully remove all the scum if this is attended to there is no occasion to boil the bird in a floured cloth but it should be well covered with the water Let it simmer very gently for about one one two hour to one three four hour according to the size and serve with either white celery oyster or mushroom sauce or parsley and butter a little of which should be poured over the turkey Boiled ham bacon tongue or pickled pork should always accompany this dish and when oyster sauce is served the turkey should be stuffed with oyster forcemeat Time A small turkey one one two hour a large one one three four hour Average cost fives sixd to sevens sixd each but more expensive at Christmas on account of the great demand Sufficient for seven or eight persons Seasonable from December to February THE TURKEY The turkey for which fine bird we are indebted to America is certainly one of the most glorious presents made by the New World to the Old Some indeed assert that this bird was known to the ancients and that it was served at the wedding feast of Charlemagne This opinion however has been controverted by first rate authorities who declare that the French name of the bird dindon proves its origin that the form of the bird is altogether foreign and that it is found in America alone in a wild state There is but little doubt from the information which has been gained at considerable trouble that it appeared generally in Europe about the end of the seventeenth century that it was first imported into France by Jesuits who had been sent out missionaries to the West and that from France it spread over Europe To this day in many localities in France a turkey is called a Jesuit On the farms of N America where turkeys are very common they are raised either from eggs which have been found or from young ones caught in the woods they thus preserve almost entirely their original plumage The turkey only became gradually acclimated both on the continent and in England in the middle of the eighteenth century scarcely ten out of twenty young turkeys lived now generally speaking fifteen out of the same number arrive at maturity CROQUETTES OF TURKEY Cold Meat Cookery nine hundred eighty seven INGREDIENTS The remains of cold turkey to every one two lb of meat allow two oz of ham or bacon two shalots one oz of butter one tablespoonful of flour the yolks of two eggs egg and bread crumbs Mode The smaller pieces that will not do for a fricassee or hash answer very well for this dish Mince the meat finely with ham or bacon in the above proportion make a gravy of the bones and trimmings well seasoning it mince the shalots put them into a stewpan with the butter add the flour mix well then put in the mince and about one two pint of the gravy made from the bones The proportion of the butter must be increased or diminished according to the quantity of mince When just boiled add the yolks of two eggs put the mixture out to cool and then shape it in a wineglass Cover the croquettes with egg and bread crumbs and fry them a delicate brown Put small pieces of parsley stems for stalks and serve with rolled bacon cut very thin Time eight minutes to fry the croquettes Seasonable from December to February THE WILD TURKEY In its wild state the turkey is gregarious going together in extensive flocks numbering as many as five hundred These frequent the great swamps of America where they roost but at sunrise leave these situations to repair to the dry woods in search of berries and acorns They perch on the boughs of trees and by rising from branch to branch attain the height they desire They usually mount to the highest tops apparently from an instinctive conception that the loftier they are the further they are out of danger They fly awkwardly but run with great swiftness and about the month of March become so fat as not to be able to take a flight beyond three or four hundred yards and are then also easily run down by a horseman Now however it rarely happens that wild turkeys are seen in the inhabited parts of America It is only in the distant and more unfrequented parts that they are found in great numbers FRICASSEED TURKEY Cold Meat Cookery nine hundred eighty eight INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast or boiled turkey a strip of lemon peel a bunch of savoury herbs one onion pepper and salt to taste one pint of water four

Time one hour to make the gravy Average cost exclusive of the cold turkey fourd Seasonable from December to February THE TURKEY This is one of the gallinaceous birds the principal genera of which are Pheasants Turkeys Peacocks Bustards Pintatoes and Grouse They live mostly on the ground scraping the earth with their feet and feeding on seeds and grains which previous to digestion are macerated in their crops They usually associate in families consisting of one male and several females Turkeys are particularly fond of the seeds of nettles whilst the seeds of the foxglove will poison them The common turkey is a native of North America and in the reign of Henry VIII was introduced into England According to Tusser s Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry it began about the year fifteen eighty five to form a dish at our rural Christmas feasts Beefe mutton and pork shred pies of the best Pig veal goose and capon and turkey well drest Cheese apples and nuts jolly carols to hear As then in the country is counted good cheer The turkey is one of the most difficult birds to rear and its flesh is much esteemed THE DISPOSITION OF THE TURKEY Among themselves turkeys are extremely furious whilst amongst other animals they are usually both weak and cowardly The domestic cock frequently makes them keep at a distance whilst they will rarely attack him but in a united body when the cock is rather crushed by their weight than defeated by their prowess The disposition of the female is in general much more gentle than that of the male When leading forth her young to collect their food though so large and apparently so powerful a bird she gives them very slight protection from the attacks of any rapacious animal which may appear against them She rather warns them of their danger than offers to defend them yet she is extremely affectionate to her young HASHED TURKEY nine hundred eighty nine INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast turkey one onion pepper and salt to taste rather more than one pint of water one carrot one turnip one blade of mace a bunch of savoury herbs one tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup one tablespoonful of port wine thickening of butter and flour Mode Cut the turkey into neat joints the best pieces reserve for the hash the inferior joints and trimmings put into a stewpan with an onion cut in slices pepper and salt a carrot turnip mace herbs and water in the above proportion simmer these for an hour then strain the gravy thicken it with butter and flour flavour with ketchup and port wine and lay in the pieces of turkey to warm through if there is any stuffing left put that in also as it so much improves the flavour of the gravy When it boils serve and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread Time one hour to make the gravy Seasonable from December to February HUNTING TURKEYS Formerly in Canada hunting turkeys was one of the principal diversions of the natives of that country When they discovered the retreat of the birds which was generally near a field of nettles or where grain of any kind was plentiful they would send a well trained dog into the midst of the flock The turkeys no sooner perceived their enemy than they would run off at full speed and with such swiftness that they would leave the dog far behind He however would follow in their wake and as they could not for a great length of time continue at their speed they were at last forced to seek shelter in the trees There they would sit spent with fatigue till the hunters would approach and with long poles knock them down one after the other ROAST TURKEY nine hundred ninety INGREDIENTS Turkey forcemeat No four hundred seventeen Choosing and Trussing Choose cock turkeys by their short spurs and black legs in which case they are young if the spurs are long and the legs pale and rough they are old If the bird has been long killed the eyes will appear sunk and the feet very dry but if fresh the contrary will be the case Middling sized fleshy turkeys are by many persons considered superior to those of an immense growth as they are generally speaking much more tender They should never be dressed the same day they are killed but in cold weather should hang at least eight days if the weather is mild four or five days will be found sufficient Carefully pluck the bird singe it with white paper and wipe it thoroughly with a cloth draw it preserve the liver and gizzard and be particular not to break the gall bag as no washing will remove the bitter taste it imparts where it once touches Wash it inside well and wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth the outside merely requires nicely wiping as we have just stated Cut off the neck close to the back but leave enough of the crop skin to turn over break the leg bone close below the knee draw out the strings from the thighs and flatten the breastbone to make it look plump Have ready a forcemeat made by recipe No four hundred seventeen fill the breast with this and if a trussing needle is used sew the neck over to the back if a needle is not at hand a skewer will answer the purpose Run a skewer through the pinion and thigh into the body to the pinion and thigh on the other side and press the legs as much as possible between the breast and the side bones and put the liver under one pinion and the gizzard under the other Pass a string across the back of the bird catch it over the points of the skewer tie it in the centre of the back and be particular that the turkey is very firmly trussed This may be more easily accomplished with a needle and twine than with skewers Illustration ROAST TURKEY Mode Fasten a sheet of buttered paper on to the breast of the bird put it down to a bright fire at some little distance at first afterwards draw it nearer and keep it well basted the whole of the time it is cooking About one four hour before serving remove the paper dredge the turkey lightly with flour and put a piece of butter into the basting ladle as the butter melts baste the bird with it When of a nice brown and well frothed serve with a tureen of good brown gravy and one of bread sauce Fried sausages are a favourite addition to roast turkey they make a pretty garnish besides adding very much to the flavour When these are not at hand a few forcemeat balls should be placed round the dish as a garnish Turkey may also be stuffed with sausage meat and a chestnut forcemeat with the same sauce is by many persons much esteemed as an accompaniment to this favourite dish See coloured plate Aone Time Small turkey one one two hour moderate sized one about ten lbs two hours large turkey two one two hours or longer Average cost from tens to twelves but expensive at Christmas on account of the great demand Sufficient A moderate sized turkey for seven or eight persons Seasonable from December to February ENGLISH TURKEYS These are reared in great numbers in Suffolk Norfolk and several other counties whence they were wont to be driven to the London market in flocks of several hundreds the improvements in our modes of travelling now however enable them to be brought by railway Their drivers used to manage them with great facility by means of a bit of red rag tied to the end of a long stick which from the antipathy these birds have to that colour effectually answered the purpose of a scourge There are three varieties of the turkey in this country the black the white and the speckled or copper coloured The black approaches nearest to the original stock and is esteemed the best Its flesh is white and tender delicate nourishing and of excellent flavour it greatly deteriorates with age however and is then good for little but stewing ROAST TURKEY POULTS nine hundred ninety one INGREDIENTS Turkey poult butter Choosing and Trussing Choose a plump bird and truss it in the following manner After it has been carefully plucked drawn and singed skin the neck and fasten the head under the wing turn the legs at the first joint and bring the feet close to the thighs as a woodcock should be trussed and do not stuff it Mode Put it down to a bright fire keep it well basted and at first place a piece of paper on the breast to prevent its taking too much colour About ten minutes before serving dredge it lightly with flour and baste well when nicely frothed send it to table immediately with a little gravy in the dish and some in a tureen If at hand a few water cresses may be placed round the turkey as a garnish or it may be larded Time About one hour Average cost sevens to eights each Sufficient for six or seven persons Seasonable In full season from June to October THE FUTURE OF THE TURKEY Human ingenuity subjects almost every material to the purposes of ornament or use and the feathers of turkeys have been found adapted for more ends than one The American Indians convert then into an elegant clothing and by twisting the inner ribs into a strong double string with hemp or the inner bark of the mulberry tree work it like matting This fabric has a very rich and glossy appearance and is as fine as silk shag The natives of Louisiana used to make fans of the tail and four of that appendage joined together was formerly constructed into a parasol by the French TO BONE A TURKEY OR FOWL WITHOUT OPENING IT Miss Acton s Recipe nine hundred ninety two After the fowl has been drawn and singed wipe it inside and out with a clean cloth but do not wash it Take off the head cut through the skin all round the first joint of the legs and pull them from the fowl to draw out the large tendons Raise the flesh first from the lower part of the backbone and a little also from the end of the breastbone if necessary work the knife gradually to the socket of the thigh with the point of the knife detach the joint from it take the end of the bone firmly in the fingers and cut the flesh clean from it down to the next joint round which pass the point of the knife carefully and when the skin is loosened from it in every part cut round the next bone keeping the edge of the knife close to it until the whole of the leg is done Remove the bones of the other leg in the same manner then detach the flesh from the back and breast bone sufficiently to enable you to reach the upper joints of the wings proceed with these as with the legs but be especially careful not to pierce the skin of the second joint it is usual to leave the pinions unboned in order to give more easily its natural form to the fowl when it is dressed The merrythought and neck bones may now easily be cut away the back and side bones taken out without being divided and the breastbone separated carefully from the flesh which as the work progresses must be turned back from the bones upon the fowl until it is completely inside out After the one remaining bone is removed draw the wings and legs back to their proper form and turn the fowl right side outwards nine hundred ninety three A turkey is boned exactly in the same manner but as it requires a very large proportion of forcemeat to fill it entirely the logs and wings are sometimes drawn into the body to diminish the expense of this If very securely trussed and sewn the bird may be either boiled or stewed in rich gravy as well as roasted after being boned and forced but it must be most gently cooled or it may burst ANOTHER MODE OF BONING A TURKEY OR FOWL Miss Acton s Recipe nine hundred ninety four Cut through the skin down the centre of the back and raise the flesh carefully on either side with the point of a sharp knife until the sockets of the wings and thighs are reached Till a little practice has been gained it will perhaps be bettor to bone these joints before proceeding further but after they are once detached from it the whole of the body may easily be separated from the flesh and taken out entire only the neck bones and merrythought will then remain to be removed The bird thus prepared may either be restored to its original form by filling the legs and wings with forcemeat and the body with the livers of two or three fowls mixed with alternate layers of parboiled tongue freed from the rind fine sausage meat or veal forcemeat or thin slices of the nicest bacon or aught else of good flavour which will give a marbled appearance to the fowl when it is carved and then be sewn up and trussed as usual or the legs and wings may be drawn inside the body and the bird being first flattened on a table may be covered with sausage meat and the various other ingredients we have named so placed that it shall be of equal thickness in every part then tightly rolled bound firmly together with a fillet of broad tape wrapped in a thin pudding cloth closely tied at both ends and dressed as follows Put it into a braising pan stewpan or thick iron saucepan bright in the inside and fitted as nearly as may be to its size add all the chicken bones a bunch of sweet herbs two carrots two bay leaves a large blade of mace twenty four white peppercorns and any trimmings or bones of undressed veal which may be at hand cover the whole with good veal broth add salt if needed and stew it very softly from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half let it cool in the liquor in which it was stewed and after it is lifted out boil down the gravy to a jelly and strain it let it become cold clear off the fat and serve it cut into large dice or roughed and laid round the fowl which is to be served cold If restored to its form instead of being rolled it must be stewed gently for an hour and may then be sent to table hot covered with mushroom or any other good sauce that may be preferred or it may be left until the following day and served garnished with the jelly which should be firm and very clear and well flavoured the liquor in which a calf s foot has been boiled down added to the broth will give it the necessary degree of consistence TO BONE FOWLS FOR FRICASSEES CURRIES PIES nine hundred ninety five First carve them entirely into joints then remove the bones beginning with the legs and wings at the head of the largest bone hold this with the fingers and work the knife as directed in the recipe above The remainder of the birds is too easily done to require any instructions TO DRESS WHEATEARS nine hundred ninety six INGREDIENTS Wheatears fresh butter Mode After the birds are picked gutted and cleaned truss them like larks put them down to a quick fire and baste them well with fresh butter When done which will be in about twenty minutes dish them on fried bread crumbs and garnish the dish with slices of lemon Time twenty minutes Seasonable from July to October THE WHEATEAR The wheatear is an annual visitor of England it arrives about the middle of March and leaves in September The females come about a fortnight before the males and continue to arrive till the middle of May They are in season from July to October and are taken in large numbers on the South Downs in the neighbourhood of Eastbourne Brighton and other parts of Sussex They are taken by means of snares and nets and numbers of them are eaten on the spot by the inhabitants The larger ones are sent to London and potted where they are by many as much esteemed as the ortolans of the continent mister Pennant assigns as the reason of their abounding on the downs about Eastbourne the existence of a species of fly which forms their favourite food and which feeds on the wild thyme on the adjacent hills Illustration THE GUINEA PIG nine hundred ninety seven THE GUINEA PIG This common hutch companion of the rabbit although originally a native of Brazil propagates freely in England and other European countries Were it not that they suffer cruelly from cats and numerous other enemies and that it is the habit of the males to devour their own offspring their numbers would soon become overwhelming Rats however it is said carefully avoid them and for this reason they are frequently bred by rabbit fanciers by way of protection for their young stock against those troublesome vermin The lower tier of a rabbit hutch is esteemed excellent quarters by the guinea pig here as he runs loose he will devour the waste food of his more admired companion Home naturalists assert that the guinea pig will breed at two months old the litter varying from four to twelve at a time It is varied in colour white fawn and black and a mixture of the three colours forming a tortoiseshell which is the more generally admired hue Occasionally the white ones have red eyes like those of the ferret and the white rabbit Their flesh although eatable is decidedly unfit for food they have been tasted however we presume by some enthusiast eager to advance the cause of science or by some eccentric epicure in search of a new pleasure for his palate Unless it has been that they deter rats from intruding within the rabbit hutch they are as useless as they are harmless The usual ornament of an animal s hind quarters is denied them and were it not for this fact and also for their difference in colour the Shaksperean locution a rat without a tail would designate them very properly Illustration THE CYGNET nine hundred ninety eight THE CYGNET The Cygnet or the young Swan was formerly much esteemed but it has fallen from its high estate and is now rarely seen upon the table We are not sure that it is not still fattened in Norwich for the corporation of that place Persons who have property on the river there take the young birds and send them to some one who is employed by the corporation to be fed and for this trouble he is paid or was wont to be paid about half a guinea a bird It is as the future bird of elegance and grace that the young swan is mostly admired when it has become old enough to grace the waters then it is that all admire her when she with Arched neck Between her white wings mantling proudly rows Her state with oary feet POULTRY CARVING ROAST DUCK Illustration ROAST DUCK nine hundred ninety nine No dishes require so much knowledge and skill in their carving as do game and poultry for it is necessary to be well acquainted with the anatomy of the bird and animal in order to place the knife at exactly the proper point A tough fowl and an old goose are sad triers of a carver s powers and temper and indeed sometimes of the good humour of those in the neighbourhood of the carver for a sudden tilt of the dish may eventuate in the placing a quantity of the gravy in the lap of the right or left hand supporter of the host We will endeavour to assist those who are unacquainted with the gentle art of carving and also those who are but slightly acquainted with it by simply describing the rules to follow and referring to the distinctly marked Illustrations of each dish which will further help to bring light to the minds of the uninitiated If the bird be a young duckling it may be carved like a fowl viz by first taking off the leg and the wing on either side as described at No one thousand but in cases where the duckling is very small it will be as well not to separate the leg from the wing as they will not then form too large a portion for a single serving After the legs and wings are disposed of the remainder of the duck will be also carved in the same manner as a fowl and not much difficulty will be experienced as ducklings are tender and the joints are easily broken by a little gentle forcing or penetrated by the knife In cases where the duck is a large bird the better plan to pursue is then to carve it like a goose that is by cutting pieces from the breast in the direction indicated by the lines marked from one to two commencing to carve the slices close to the wing and then proceeding upwards from that to the breastbone If more should be wanted than can be obtained from both sides of the breast then the legs and wings must be attacked in the same way as is described in connection with carving a fowl It may be here remarked that as the legs of a duck are placed far more backward than those of a fowl their position causing the waddling motion of the bird the thigh bones will be found considerably nearer towards the backbone than in a chicken this is the only difference worth mentioning The carver should ask each guest if a portion of stuffing would be agreeable and in order to get at this a cut should be made below the breast as shown by the line from three to four at the part called the apron and the spoon inserted As described in the recipe it is an excellent plan when a couple of ducks are served to have one with and the other without stuffing As to the prime parts of a duck it has been said that the wing of a flier and the leg of a swimmer are severally the best portions Some persons are fond of the feet of the duck and in trussing these should never be taken off The leg wing and neckbone are here shown so that it will be easy to see the shape they should be when cut off Illustration LEG WING AND NECKBONE OF DUCK BOILED FOWL Illustration BOILED FOWL Illustration LEG WING AND NECKBONE OF FOWL one thousand This will not be found a very difficult member of the poultry family to carve unless as may happen a very old farmyard occupant useless for egg laying purposes has by some unlucky mischance been introduced info the kitchen as a fine young chicken Skill however and the application of a small amount of strength combined with a fine keeping of the temper will even get over that difficulty Fixing the fork firmly in the breast let the knife be sharply passed along the line shown from one to two then cut downwards from that line to fig three and the wing it will be found can be easily withdrawn The shape of the wing should be like the accompanying engraving Let the fork be placed inside the leg which should be gently forced away from the body of the fowl and the joint being thus discovered the carver can readily cut through it and the leg can be served When the leg is displaced it should be of the same shape as that shown in the annexed woodcut The legs and wings on either side having been taken off the carver should draw his knife through the flesh in the direction of the line four to five by this means the knife can be slipped underneath the merrythought which being lifted up and pressed backward will immediately come off The collar or neck bones are the next to consider these lie on each side of the merrythought close under the upper part of the wings and in order to free these from the fowl they must also be raised by the knife at their broad end and turned from the body towards the breastbone until the shorter piece of the bone as shown in the cut breaks off There will now be left only the breast with the ribs The breast can be without difficulty disengaged from the ribs by cutting through the latter which will offer little impediment The side bones are now to be taken off and to do this the lower end of the back should be turned from the carver who should press the point of the knife through the top of the backbone near the centre bringing it down towards the end of the back completely through the bone If the knife is now turned in the opposite direction the joint will be easily separated from the vertebra The backbone being now uppermost the fork should be pressed firmly down on it whilst at the same time the knife should be employed in raising up the lower small end of the fowl towards the fork and thus the back will be dislocated about its middle The wings breast and merrythought are esteemed the prime parts of a fowl and are usually served to the ladies of the company to whom legs except as a matter of paramount necessity should not be given Byron gave it as one reason why he did not like dining with ladies that they always had the wings of the fowls which he himself preferred We heard a gentleman who when he might have had a wing declare his partiality for a leg saying that he had been obliged to eat legs for so long a time that he had at last come to like them better than the other more prized parts If the fowl is capon like very large slices maybe carved from its breast in the same manner as from a turkey s ROAST FOWL Illustration ROAST FOWL ten oh one Generally speaking it is not necessary so completely to cut up a fowl as we have described in the preceding paragraphs unless indeed a large family party is assembled and there are a number of little mouths to be filled or some other such circumstances prevail A roast fowl is carved in the same manner as a boiled fowl No one thousand viz by cutting along the line from one to two and then round the leg between it and the wing The markings and detached pieces as shown in the engravings under the heading of Boiled Fowl supersede the necessity of our lengthily again describing the operation It may be added that the liver being considered a delicacy should be divided and one half served with each wing In the case of a fowl being shifted it will be proper to give each guest a portion unless it be not agreeable to some one of the party ROAST GOOSE Illustration ROAST GOOSE Illustration LEG WING AND NECK BONE OF GOOSE ten oh two It would not be fair to say that this dish bodes a great deal of happiness to an inexperienced carver especially if there is a large party to serve and the slices off the breast should not suffice to satisfy the desires and cravings of many wholesome appetites produced may be by the various sports in vogue at Michaelmas and Christmas The beginning of the task however is not in any way difficult Evenly cut slices not too thick or too thin should be carved from the breast in the direction of the line from two to three after the first slice has been cut a hole should be made with the knife in the part called the apron passing it round the line as indicated by the figures one one one here the stuffing is located and some of this should be served on each plate unless it is discovered that it is not agreeable to the taste of some one guest If the carver manages cleverly he will be able to cut a very large number of fine slices off the breast and the more so if he commences close down by the wing and carves upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone As many slices as can be taken from the breast being carved the wings should be cut off and the same process as described in carving boiled fowl is made use of in this instance only more dexterity and greater force will most probably be required the shape of the leg when disengaged from the body of the goose should be like that shown in the accompanying engraving It will be necessary perhaps in taking off the leg to turn the goose on its side and then pressing down the small end of the leg the knife should be passed under it from the top quite down to the joint the leg being now turned back by the fork the knife must cut through the joint loosening the thigh bone from its socket The merrythought which in a goose is not so large as might be expected is disengaged in the same way as that of a fowl by passing the knife under it and pressing it backwards towards the neck The neck bones of which we give a cut are freed by the same process as are those of a fowl and the same may be said of all the other parts of this bird The breast of a goose is the part most esteemed all parts however are good and full of juicy flavour PIGEON Illustration PIGEON ten oh three A very straightforward plan is adopted in carving a pigeon the knife is carried sharply in the direction of the line as shown from one to two entirely through the bird cutting it into two precisely equal and similar parts If it is necessary to make three pieces of it a small wing should be cut off with the leg on either side thus serving two guests and by this means there will be sufficient meat left on the breast to send to the third guest RABBITS Illustration BOILED RABBIT ten oh four In carving a boiled rabbit let the knife be drawn on each side of the backbone the whole length of the rabbit as shown by the dotted line three to four thus the rabbit will be in three parts Now let the back be divided into two equal parts in the direction of the line from one to two then let the leg be taken off as shown by the line five to six and the shoulder as shown by the line seven to eight This in our opinion is the best plan to carve a rabbit although there are other modes which are preferred by some Illustration ROAST RABBIT A roast rabbit is rather differently trussed from one that is meant to be boiled but the carving is nearly similar as will be seen by the cut The back should be divided into as many pieces as it will give and the legs and shoulders can then be disengaged in the same manner as those of the boiled animal ROAST TURKEY Illustration ROAST TURKEY ten oh five A noble dish is a turkey roast or boiled A Christmas dinner with the middle classes of this empire would scarcely be a Christmas dinner without its turkey and we can hardly imagine an object of greater envy than is presented by a respected portly pater familias carving at the season devoted to good cheer and genial charity his own fat turkey and carving it well The only art consists as in the carving of a goose in getting from the breast as many fine slices as possible and all must have remarked the very great difference in the large number of people whom a good carver will find slices for and the comparatively few that a bad carver will succeed in serving As we have stated in both the carving of a duck and goose the carver should commence cutting slices close to the wing from two to three and then proceed upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone this is not the usual plan but in practice will be found the best The breast is the only part which is looked on as fine in a turkey the legs being very seldom cut off and eaten at table they are usually removed to the kitchen where they are taken off as here marked to appear only in a form which seems to have a special attraction at a bachelor s supper table we mean devilled served in this way they are especially liked and relished A boiled turkey is carved in the same manner as when roasted Illustration CHAPTER XXII GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON GAME ten oh six THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND has a maxim that goods in which no person can claim any property belong by his or her prerogative to the king or queen Accordingly those animals those ferae naturae which come under the denomination of game are in our laws styled his or her majesty s and may therefore as a matter of course be granted by the sovereign to another in consequence of which another may prescribe to possess the same within a certain precinct or lordship From this circumstance arose the right of lords of manors or others to the game within their respective liberties and to protect these species of animals the game laws were originated and still remain in force There are innumerable acts of parliament inflicting penalties on persons who may illegally kill game and some of them are very severe but they cannot be said to answer their end nor can it be expected that they ever will whilst there are so many persons of great wealth who have not otherwise the means of procuring game except by purchase and who will have it These must necessarily encourage poaching which to a very large extent must continue to render all game laws nugatory as to their intended effects upon the rustic population ten oh seven THE OBJECT OF THESE LAWS however is not wholly confined to the restraining of the illegal sportsman Even qualified or privileged persons must not kill game at all seasons During the day the hours allowed for sporting are from one hour before sunrise till one hour after sunset whilst the time of killing certain species is also restricted to certain seasons For example the season for bustard shooting is from December one to March one for grouse or red grouse from August twelve to December ten heath fowl or black game from August twenty to December twenty partridges from September one to February twelve pheasants from October one to February one widgeons wild ducks wild geese wild fowls at any time but in June July August and September Hares may be killed at any time of the year under certain restrictions defined by an act of parliament of the tenth of George III ten oh eight THE EXERCISE OR DIVERSION OF PURSUING FOUR FOOTED BEASTS OF GAME is called hunting which to this day is followed in the field and the forest with gun and greyhound Birds on the contrary are not hunted but shot in the air or taken with nets and other devices which is called fowling or they are pursued and taken by birds of prey which is called hawking a species of sport now fallen almost entirely into desuetude in England although in some parts showing signs of being revived ten oh nine IN PURSUING FOUR FOOTED BEASTS such as deer boars and hares properly termed hunting mankind were from the earliest ages engaged It was the rudest and the most obvious manner of acquiring human support before the agricultural arts had in any degree advanced It is an employment however requiring both art and contrivance as well as a certain fearlessness of character combined with the power of considerable physical endurance Without these success could not be very great but at best the occupation is usually accompanied with rude and turbulent habits and when combined with these it constitutes what is termed the savage state of man As culture advances and as the soil proportionably becomes devoted to the plough or to the sustenance of the tamer or more domesticated animals the range of the huntsman is proportionably limited so that when a country has attained to a high state of cultivation hunting becomes little else than an amusement of the opulent In the case of fur bearing animals however it is somewhat different for these continue to supply the wants of civilization with one of its most valuable materials of commerce ten ten THE THEMES WHICH FORM THE MINSTRELSY OF THE EARLIEST AGES either relate to the spoils of the chase or the dangers of the battle field Even the sacred writings introduce us to Nimrod the first mighty hunter before the Lord and tell us that Ishmael in the solitudes of Arabia became a skilful bow man and that David when yet young was not afraid to join in combat with the lion or the bear The Greek mythology teems with hunting exploits Hercules overthrows the Nemaean lion the Erymanthean boar and the hydra of Lerna Diana descends to the earth and pursues the stag whilst Aesculapius Nestor Theseus Ulysses and Achilles are all followers of the chase Aristotle sage as he was advises young men to apply themselves early to it and Plato finds in it something divine Horace exalts it as a preparative exercise for the path of glory and several of the heroes of Homer are its ardent votaries The Romans followed the hunting customs of the Greeks and the ancient Britons were hunters before Julius Caesar invaded their shores ten eleven ALTHOUGH THE ANCIENT BRITONS FOLLOWED HUNTING however they did not confine themselves solely to its pursuit They bred cattle and tilled the ground and to some extent indicated the rudimentary state of a pastoral and agricultural life but in every social change the sports of the field maintained their place After the expulsion of the Danes and during the brief restoration of the Saxon monarchy these were still followed even Edward the Confessor who would join in no other secular amusements took the greatest delight says William of Malmesbury to follow a pack of swift hounds in pursuit of game and to cheer them with his voice ten twelve NOR WAS EDWARD the only English sovereign who delighted in the pleasures of the chase William the Norman and his two sons who succeeded him were passionately fond of the sport and greatly circumscribed the liberties of their subjects in reference to the killing of game The privilege of hunting in the royal forests was confined to the king and his favourites and in order that these umbrageous retreats might be made more extensive whole villages were depopulated places of worship levelled with the ground and every means adopted that might give a sufficient amplitude of space in accordance with the royal pleasure for the beasts of the chase King John was likewise especially attached to the sports of the field whilst Edward III was so enamoured of the exercise that even during his absence at the wars in France he took with him sixty couples of stag hounds and as many hare hounds and every day amused himself either with hunting or hawking Great in wisdom as the Scotch Solomon James I conceited himself to be he was much addicted to the amusements of hunting hawking and shooting Yea it is oven asserted that his precious time was divided between hunting the bottle and his standish to the first he gave his fair weather to the second his dull and to the third his cloudy From his days down to the present the sports of the field have continued to hold their high reputation not only for the promotion of health but for helping to form that manliness of character which enters so largely into the composition of the sons of the British soil That it largely helps to do this there can be no doubt The late duke of Grafton when hunting was on one occasion thrown into a ditch A young curate engaged in the same chase cried out Lie still my lord leapt over him and pursued his sport Such an apparent want of feeling might be expected to have been resented by the duke but not so On his being helped up by his attendant he said That man shall have the first good living that falls to my disposal had he stopped to have given me his sympathy I never would have given him anything Such was the manly sentiment of the duke who delighted in the exemplification of a spirit similarly ardent as his own in the sport and above the baseness of an assumed sorrow ten thirteen THAT HUNTING HAS IN MANY INSTANCES BEEN CARRIED TO AN EXCESS is well known and the match given by the Prince Esterhazy regent of Hungary on the signing of the treaty of peace with France is not the least extraordinary upon record On that occasion there were killed one hundred sixty deer one hundred wild boars three hundred hares and eighty foxes this was the achievement of one day Enormous however as this slaughter may appear it is greatly inferior to that made by the contemporary king of Naples on a hunting expedition That sovereign had a larger extent of ground at his command and a longer period for the exercise of his talents consequently his sport if it can so be called was proportionably greater It was pursued during his journey to Vienna in Austria Bohemia and Moravia when he killed five bears eighteen twenty boars nineteen fifty deer eleven forty five does sixteen twenty five roebucks eleven thousand one hundred twenty one rabbits thirteen wolves seventeen badgers sixteen thousand three hundred fifty four hares and three hundred fifty four foxes In birds during the same expedition he killed fifteen thousand three hundred fifty pheasants and twelve thousand three hundred thirty five partridges Such an amount of destruction can hardly be called sport it resembles more the indiscriminate slaughter of a battle field where the scientific engines of civilized warfare are brought to bear upon defenceless savages ten fourteen DEER AND HARES may be esteemed as the only four footed animals now hunted in Britain for the table and even those are not followed with the same ardour as they were wont to be Still there is no country in the world where the sport of hunting on horseback is carried to such an extent as in Great Britain and where the pleasures of the chase are so well understood and conducted on such purely scientific principles The Fox of all the beasts of the field is now considered to afford the best sport For this it is infinitely superior to the stag for the real sportsman can only enjoy that chase when the deer is sought for and found like other game which are pursued with hounds In the case of finding an outlying fallow deer which is unharboured in this manner great sport is frequently obtained but this is now rarely to be met with in Britain In reference to hare hunting it is much followed in many parts of this and the sister island but by the true foxhunter it is considered as a sport only fit to be pursued by women and old men Although it is less dangerous and exciting than the fox chase however it has great charms for those who do not care for the hard riding which the other requires ten fifteen THE ART OF TAKING OR KILLING BIRDS is called fowling and is either practised as an amusement by persons of rank or property or for a livelihood by persons who use nets and other apparatus When practised as an amusement it principally consists of killing them with a light firearm called a fowling piece and the sport is secured to those who pursue it by the game laws The other means by which birds are taken consist in imitating their voices or leading them by other artifices into situations where they become entrapped by nets birdlime or otherwise For taking large numbers of birds the pipe or call is the most common means employed and this is done during the months of September and October We will here briefly give a description of the modus operandi pursued in this sport A thin wood is usually the spot chosen and under a tree at a little distance from the others a cabin is erected and there are only such branches left on the tree as are necessary for the placing of the birdlime and which are covered with it Around the cabin are placed avenues with twisted perches also covered with birdlime Having thus prepared all that is necessary the birdcatcher places himself in the cabin and at sunrise and sunset imitates the cry of a small bird calling the others to its assistance Supposing that the cry of the owl is imitated immediately different kinds of birds will flock together at the cry of their common enemy when at every instant they will be seen falling to the ground their wings being of no use to them from their having come in contact with the birdlime The cries of those which are thus situated now attract others and thus are large numbers taken in a short space of time If owls were themselves desired to be taken it is only during the night that this can be done by counterfeiting the squeak of the mouse Larks other birds and water fowl are sometimes taken by nets but to describe fully the manner in which this is done would here occupy too much space ten sixteen FEATHERED GAME HAVE FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL given gratification to the palate of man With the exception of birds of prey and some other species Moses permitted his people to eat them and the Egyptians made offerings to their priests of their most delicate birds The ancient Greeks commenced their repasts with little roasted birds and feathered game amongst the Romans was served as the second course Indeed several of the ancient gourmands of the imperial city were so fond of game that they brought themselves to ruin by eating flamingoes and pheasants Some modern nations the French among others says Monsieur Soyer formerly ate the heron crane crow stork swan cormorant and bittern The first three especially were highly esteemed and Laillevant cook of Charles VII teaches us how to prepare these meagre tough birds Belon says that in spite of its revolting taste when unaccustomed to it the bittern is however among the delicious treats of the French This writer also asserts that a falcon or a vulture either roasted or boiled is excellent eating and that if one of these birds happened to kill itself in flying after game the falconer instantly cooked it Lebaut calls the heron a royal viand ten seventeen THE HERON WAS HUNTED BY THE HAWK and the sport of hawking is usually placed at the head of those amusements that can only be practised in the country This precedency it probably obtained from its being a pastime to generally followed by the nobility not in Great Britain only but likewise on the continent In former times persons of high rank rarely appeared in public without their dogs and their hawks the latter they carried with them when they journeyed from one country to another and sometimes even took them to battle with them and would not part with them when taken prisoners even to obtain their own liberty Such birds were esteemed as the ensigns of nobility and no action was reckoned more dishonourable in a man of rank than that of giving up his hawk We have already alluded to the hunting propensities of our own Edward III and we may also allude to his being equally addicted to hawking According to Froissart when this sovereign invaded France he took with him thirty falconers on horseback who had charge of his hawks and every day as his royal fancy inclined him he either hunted or went to the river for the purpose of hawking In the great and powerful the pursuit of game as a sport is allowable but in those who have to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow it is to be condemned In Burton s Anatomy of Melancholy we find a humorous story told by Poggius the Florentine who reprobates this folly in such persons It is this A physician of Milan that cured madmen had a pit of water in his house in which he kept his patients some up to the knees some to the girdle some to the chin pro modo insaniae as they were more or less affected One of them by chance that was well recovered stood in the door and seeing a gallant pass by with a hawk on his fist well mounted with his spaniels after him would needs know to what use all this preparation served He made answer To kill certain fowl The patient demanded again what his fowl might be worth which he killed in a year He replied Five or ten crowns and when he urged him further what his dogs horse and hawks stood him in he told him four hundred crowns With that the patient bade him begone as he loved his life and welfare for if our master come and find thee here he will put thee in the pit amongst the madmen up to the chin Thus reproving the madness of such men as will spend themselves in those vain sports to the neglect of their business and necessary affairs ten eighteen AS THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF SOCIAL PROGRESS is at least to limit if not entirely to suppress such sports as we have here been treating of much of the romance of country life has passed away This is more especially the case with falconry which had its origin about the middle of the fourth century although lately some attempts have been rather successfully made to institute a revival of the gentle art of hawking Julius Firmicus who lived about that time is so far as we can find the first Latin author who speaks of falconers and the art of teaching one species of birds to fly after and catch others The occupation of these functionaries has now however all but ceased New and nobler efforts characterize the aims of mankind in the development of their civilization and the sports of the field have to a large extent been superseded by other exercises it may be less healthful and invigorating but certainly more elegant intellectual and humanizing Illustration RECIPES CHAPTER XXIII ROAST BLACK COCK ten nineteen INGREDIENTS Black cock butter toast Illustration ROAST BLACK COCK Mode Let these birds hang for a few days or they will be tough and tasteless if not well kept Pluck and draw them and wipe the insides and outsides with a damp cloth as washing spoils the flavour Cut off the heads and truss them the same as a roast fowl cutting off the toes and scalding and peeling the feet Trussing them with the head on as shown in the engraving is still practised by many cooks but the former method is now considered the best Put them down to a brisk fire well baste them with butter and serve with a piece of toast under and a good gravy and bread sauce After trussing some cooks cover the breast with vine leaves and slices of bacon and then roast them They should be served in the same manner and with the same accompaniments as with the plainly roasted birds Time forty five to fifty minutes Average cost from fives to sixs the brace but seldom bought Sufficient two or three for a dish Seasonable from the middle of August to the end of December Illustration THE BLACK COCK THE BLACK COCK HEATH COCK MOOR FOWL OR HEATH POULT This bird sometimes weighs as much as four pounds and the hen about two It is at present confined to the more northern parts of Britain culture and extending population having united in driving it into more desolate regions except perhaps in a few of the more wild and less frequented portions of England It may still be found in the New Forest in Hampshire Dartmoor and Sedgmoor in Devonshire and among the hills of Somersetshire contiguous to the latter It may also be found in Staffordshire in North Wales and again in the north of England but nowhere so plentiful as in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland The males are hardly distinguishable from the females until they are about half grown when the black feathers begin to appear first about the sides and breast Their food consists of the tops of birch and heath except when the mountain berries are ripe at which period they eagerly and even voraciously pick the bilberries and cranberries from the bushes Large numbers of these birds are found in Norway almost rivalling the turkey in point of size Some of them have begun to be imported into London where they are vended in the shops but the flavour of their flesh is not equal to that of the Scotch bird HASHED WILD DUCK ten twenty INGREDIENTS The remains of cold roast wild duck one pint of good brown gravy two tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs one glass of claret salt cayenne and mixed spices to taste one tablespoonful of lemon or Seville orange juice Mode Cut the remains of the duck into neat joints put them into a stewpan with all the above ingredients let them get gradually hot by the side of the fire and occasionally stir the contents when on the point of boiling serve and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread Time About one four hour Seasonable from November to February RAGOUT OF WILD DUCK ten twenty one INGREDIENTS two wild ducks four shalots one pint of stock No one hundred five one glass of port wine one oz of butter a little flour the juice of one two lemon cayenne and salt to taste Mode Ducks that have been dressed and left from the preceding day will answer for this dish Cut them into joints reserve the legs wings and breasts until wanted put the trimmings into a stewpan with the shalots and stock and let them simmer for about one two hour and strain the gravy Put the butter into a stewpan when melted dredge in a little flour and pour in the gravy made from the bones give it one boil and strain it again add the wine lemon juice and cayenne lay in the pieces of duck and let the whole gradually warm through but do not allow it to boil or the duck will be hard The gravy should not be too thick and should be very highly seasoned The squeeze of a Seville orange is a great improvement to this dish Time About one two hour to make the gravy one four hour for the duck gradually to warm through Seasonable from November to February ROAST WILD DUCK ten twenty two INGREDIENTS Wild duck flour butter Illustration ROAST WILD DUCK Mode Carefully pluck and draw them Cut off the heads close to the necks leaving sufficient skin to turn over and do not cut off the feet some twist each leg at the knuckle and rest the claws on each side of the breast others truss them as shown in our Illustration Roast the birds before a quick fire and when they are first put down let them remain for five minutes without basting this will keep the gravy in afterwards baste plentifully with butter and a few minutes before serving dredge them lightly with flour baste well and send them to table nicely frothed and full of gravy If overdone the birds will lose their flavour Serve with a good gravy in the dish or orange gravy No four hundred eighty eight and send to table with them a cut lemon To take off the fishy taste which wild fowl sometimes have baste them for a few minutes with hot water to which have been added an onion and a little salt then take away the pan and baste with butter See coloured plate Gone Time When liked underdressed twenty to twenty five minutes well done twenty five to thirty five minutes Average cost fours to fives the couple Sufficient two for a dish Seasonable from November to February Illustration THE WILD DUCK THE WILD DUCK The male of the wild dock is called a mallard and the young ones are called flappers The time to try to find a brood of these is about the month of July among the rushes of the deepest and most retired parts of some brook or stream where if the old bird is sprung it may be taken as a certainty that its brood is not far off When once found flappers are easily killed as they attain their full growth before their wings are fledged Consequently the sport is more like hunting water rats than shooting birds When the flappers take wing they assume the name of wild ducks and about the month of August repair to the corn fields where they remain until they are disturbed by the harvest people They then frequent the rivers pretty early in the evening and give excellent sport to those who have patience to wait for them In order to know a wild duck it is necessary only to look at the claws which should be black HASHED GAME Cold Meat Cookery ten twenty three INGREDIENTS The remains of cold game one onion stuck with three cloves a few whole peppers a strip of lemon peel salt to taste thickening of butter and flour one glass of port wine one tablespoonful of lemon juice one tablespoonful of ketchup one pint of water or weak stock Mode Cut the remains of cold game into joints reserve the best pieces and the inferior ones and trimmings put into a stewpan with the onion pepper lemon peel salt and water or weak stock stew these for about an hour and strain the gravy thicken it with butter and flour add the wine lemon juice and ketchup lay in the pieces of game and let them gradually warm through by the side of the fire do not allow it to boil or the game will be hard When on the point of simmering serve and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread Time Altogether one one four hour Seasonable from August to March Note Any kind of game may be hashed by the above recipe and the flavour may be varied by adding flavoured vinegars curvy powder c but we cannot recommend these latter ingredients as a dish of game should really have a gamy taste and if too many sauces essences c are added to the gravy they quite overpower and destroy the flavour the dish should possess GROUSE PIE ten twenty four INGREDIENTS Grouse cayenne salt and pepper to taste one lb of rump steak one two pint of well seasoned broth puff paste Mode Line the bottom of a pie dish with the rump steak cut into neat pieces and should the grouse be large cut them into joints but if small they may be laid in the pie whole season highly with salt cayenne and black pepper pour in the broth and cover with a puff paste brush the crust over with the yolk of an egg and bake from three four to one hour If the grouse is cut into joints the backbones and trimmings will make the gravy by stewing them with an onion a little sherry a bunch of herbs and a blade of mace this should be poured in after the pie is baked Time three four to one hour Average cost exclusive of the grouse which are seldom bought ones nined Seasonable from the twelfth of August to the beginning of December ROAST GROUSE Illustration ROAST GROUSE ten twenty five INGREDIENTS Grouse butter a thick slice of toasted bread Mode Let the birds hang as long as possible pluck and draw them wipe but do not wash them inside and out and truss them without the head the same as for a roast fowl Many persons still continue to truss them with the head under the wing but the former is now considered the most approved method Put them down to a sharp clear fire keep them well basted the whole of the time they are cooking and serve them on a buttered toast soaked in the dripping pan with a little melted butter poured over them or with bread sauce and gravy See coloured plate Lone Time one two hour if liked very thoroughly done thirty five minutes Average cost twos to twos sixd the brace but seldom bought Sufficient two for a dish Seasonable from the twelfth of August to the beginning of December Illustration RED GROUSE GROUSE These birds are divided into wood grouse black grouse red grouse and white grouse The wood grouse is further distinguished as the cock of the wood or capercalzie and is as large as the turkey being about two feet nine inches in length and weighing from twelve to fifteen pounds The female is considerably less than the male and in the colour of her feathers differs widely from the other This beautiful species is found principally in lofty mountainous regions and is very rare in Great Britain but in the pine forests of Russia Sweden and other northern countries it is very common In these it has its habitat feeding on the cones of the trees and the fruits of various kinds of plants especially the berry of the jumper Black grouse is also distinguished as black game or the black cock It is not larger than the common hen and weighs only about four pounds The female is about one third less than the male and also differs considerably from him in point of colour Like the former they are found chiefly in high situations and are common in Russia Siberia and other northern countries They are also found in the northern parts of Great Britain feeding in winter on the various berries and fruits belonging to mountainous countries and in summer frequently descending to the lower lands to feed upon corn The red grouse gorcock or moor cock weighs about nineteen ounces and the female somewhat less In the wild heathy tracts of the northern counties of England it is plentiful also in Wales and the Highlands of Scotland mister Pennant considered it peculiar to Britain those found in the mountainous parts of Spain France and Italy being only varieties of the same bird White grouse white game or ptarmigan is nearly the same size as the red grouse and is found in lofty situations where it supports itself in the severest weather It is to be met with in most of the northern countries of Europe and appears even in Greenland In the Hebrides Orkneys and the Highlands of Scotland it is also found and sometimes though rarely among the fells of Northumberland and Cumberland In winter they fly in flocks and are so little familiar with the sight of man that they are easily shot and even snared They feed on the wild produce of the hills which sometimes imparts to their flesh a bitter but not unpalatable taste According to Buffon it is dark coloured and somewhat flavoured like the hare GROUSE SALAD Soyer s Recipe ten twenty six INGREDIENTS eight eggs butter fresh salad one or two grouse for the sauce one teaspoonful of minced shalot one teaspoonful of pounded sugar the yolk of one egg one teaspoonful of minced parsley one four oz of salt four tablespoonfuls of oil two tablespoonfuls of Chili vinegar one gill of cream Mode Boil the eggs hard shell them throw them into cold water cut a thin slice off the bottom to facilitate the proper placing of them in the dish cut each one into four lengthwise and make a very thin flat border of butter about one inch from the edge of the dish the salad is to be served on fix the pieces of egg upright close to each other the yolk outside or the yolk and white alternately lay in the centre a fresh salad of whatever is in season and having previously roasted the grouse rather underdone cut it into eight or ten pieces and prepare the sauce as follows Put the shalots into a basin with the sugar the yolk of an egg the parsley and salt and mix in by degrees the oil and vinegar when these ingredients are well mixed put the sauce on ice or in a cool place When ready to serve whip the cream rather thick which lightly mix with it then lay the inferior parts of the grouse on the salad sauce over so as to cover each piece then lay over the salad and the remainder of the grouse pour the rest of the sauce over and serve The eggs may be ornamented with a little dot of radishes or beetroot on the point Anchovy and gherkin cut into small diamonds may be placed between or cut gherkins in slices and a border of them laid round Tarragon or chervil leaves are also a pretty addition The remains of cold black game pheasant or partridge may be used in the above manner and will make a very delicate dish Average cost twos sixd Seasonable from the twelfth of August to the beginning of December Illustration THE CAPERCALZIE THE CAPERCALZIE This bird was to be met with formerly both in Ireland and Scotland but is now extinct The male lives separate from the females except in the breeding season Its manners and habits are very like those of black grouse except that it seems to be wholly confined to forests of pine on the tender shoots of which it feeds It is by no means uncommon in the woods of Norway whence we received it It is also found abundant in Russia Siberia Italy and in some portions of the Alps It was in seventeen sixty last seen in Scotland in the woods of Strathglass Recent attempts have been made to re introduce it into that country but without success principally owing as we should imagine to the want of sufficient food suitable for its sustenance GROUSE Under this general term are included several species of game birds called black red woodland and white grouse The black is larger than the red see No ten twenty five and is not so common and therefore held in higher estimation The red however is a bird of exquisite flavour and is a native of the mountainous districts of Scotland and the north of England It feeds on the tops of the heath and the berries that grow amongst them its colour is a rich chestnut striped with black The woodland or cock of the wood is the largest among the bird tribes which pass under the denomination of game It is smaller than the turkey and was originally common in our mountains but it is now to be found only in the mountains of Scotland though it still abounds in the north of Europe Germany and in the Alps It is esteemed as delicious eating and its plumage is extremely beautiful The white grouse or ptarmigan is not a plentiful bird in Britain but it is still found in the islands

little different from common grouse ROAST HARE ten twenty seven INGREDIENTS Hare forcemeat No four hundred seventeen a little milk butter Choosing and Trussing Choose a young hare which may be known by its smooth and sharp claws and by the cleft in the lip not being much spread To be eaten in perfection it must hang for some time and if properly taken care of it may be kept for several days It is better to hang without being paunched but should it be previously emptied wipe the inside every day and sprinkle over it a little pepper and ginger to prevent the musty taste which long keeping in the damp occasions and which also affects the stuffing After it is skinned wash it well and soak for an hour in warm water to draw out the blood if old let it lie in vinegar for a short time but wash it well afterwards in several waters Make a forcemeat by recipe No four hundred seventeen wipe the hare dry fill the belly with it and sew it up Bring the hind and fore legs close to the body towards the head run a skewer through each fix the head between the shoulders by means of another skewer and be careful to leave the ears on Pat a string round the body from skewer to skewer and tie it above the back Illustration ROAST HARE Mode The hare should be kept at a distance from the fire when it is first laid down or the outside will become dry and hard before the inside is done Baste it well with milk for a short time and afterwards with butter and particular attention must be paid to the basting so as to preserve the meat on the back juicy and nutritive When it is almost roasted enough flour the hare and baste well with butter When nicely frothed dish it remove the skewers and send it to table with a little gravy in the dish and a tureen of the same Red currant jelly must also not be forgotten as this is an indispensable accompaniment to roast hare For economy good beef dripping may be substituted for the milk and butter to baste with but the basting as we have before stated must be continued without intermission If the liver is good it maybe parboiled minced and mixed with the stuffing but it should not be used unless quite fresh See coloured plate Eone Time A middling sized hare one one four hour a large hare one one two to two hours Average cost from fours to sixs Sufficient for five or six persons Seasonable from September to the end of February THE HARE This little animal is found generally distributed over Europe and indeed in most parts of the northern world Its extreme timidity is the endowment which Providence has bestowed upon it as a means of defence it is therefore attentive to every sound and is supplied with ears both long and tubular with which it can hear with great acuteness Its eyes also are so constructed and placed so prominent in its head that it can see both before and behind it It lives entirely upon vegetables but its flesh is considered dry notwithstanding that it is deemed in many respects superior to that of the rabbit being more savoury and of a much higher flavour Its general time of feeding is the evening but during the day if not disturbed it adheres closely to its form Illustration THE HARE POTTED HARE a Luncheon or

with them Time twelve to twenty minutes Average cost Seldom bought Sufficient Allow one for a dish Seasonable from August twelfth to the middle of September Illustration THE LANDRAIL THE LANDRAIL OR CORN CRAKE This bird is migratory in its habits yet from its formation it seems ill adapted for long aerial passages its wings being short and placed so forward out of the centre of gravity that it flies in an extremely heavy and embarrassed manner and with its legs hanging down When it alights it can hardly be sprung a second time as it runs very fast and seems to depend for its safety more on the swiftness of its feet than the celerity of its wings It makes its appearance in England about the same time as the quail that is in the months of April and May and frequents the same places Its singular cry is first heard when the grass becomes long enough to shelter it and it continues to be heard until the grass is cut The bird however is seldom seen for it constantly skulks among the thickest portions of the herbage and runs so nimbly through it doubling and winding in every direction that it is difficult to get near it It leaves this island before the winter and repairs to other countries in search of its food which principally consists of slugs large numbers of which it destroys It is very common in Ireland and whilst migrating to this country is seen in great numbers in the island of Anglesea On its first arrival in England it is so lean as scarcely to weigh above five or six ounces before its departure however it has been known to exceed eight ounces and is then most delicious eating TO DRESS A LEVERET ten thirty four INGREDIENTS two leverets butter flour Mode Leverets should be trussed in the same manner as a hare but they do not require stuffing Roast them

for an entree Seasonable from the first of September to the beginning of February ROAST PARTRIDGE ten thirty nine INGREDIENTS Partridge butter Choosing and Trussing Choose young birds with dark coloured bills and yellowish legs and let them hang a few days or there will be no flavour to the flesh nor will it be tender The time they should be kept entirely depends on the taste of those for whom they are intended as what some persons would consider delicious would be to others disgusting and offensive They may be trussed with or without the head the latter mode being now considered the most fashionable Pluck draw and wipe the partridge carefully inside and out cut off the head leaving sufficient skin on the neck to skewer back bring the legs close to the breast between it and the side bones and pass a skewer through the pinions and the thick part of the thighs When the head is left on it should be brought round and fixed on to the point of the skewer Illustration ROAST PARTRIDGE Mode When the bird is firmly and plumply trussed roast it before a nice bright fire keep it well basted and a few minutes before serving flour and froth it well Dish it and serve with gravy and bread sauce and send to table hot and quickly A little of the gravy should be poured over the bird See coloured plate Done Time twenty five to thirty five minutes Average cost is ones sixd to twos a brace Sufficient two for a dish Seasonable from the first of September to the beginning of February Illustration PARTRIDGES THE PARTRIDGE This bird is to be found in nearly all the temperate countries of Europe but is most abundant in the Ukraine although it is unable to bear the extremes of climate whether hot or cold It was formerly very common in France and is considered a table luxury in England The instinct of this bird is frequently exemplified in a remarkable manner for the preservation of its young I have seen it often says a very celebrated writer and an accurate observer of nature and once in particular I saw an extraordinary instance of an old bird s solicitude to save its brood As I was hunting with a young pointer the dog ran on a brood of very small partridges the old bird cried fluttered and ran tumbling along just before the dog s nose till she had drawn him to a considerable distance when she took wing and flew still further off but not out of the field on this the dog returned to me near the place where the young ones lay concealed in the grass which the old bird no sooner perceived than she flew back to us settled just before the dog s nose again and by rolling and tumbling about drew off his attention from her young and thus preserved her brood a second time I have also seen when a kite has been hovering over a covey of young partridges the old birds fly up at the bird of prey screaming and fighting with all their might to preserve their brood Partridges should be chosen young if old they are valueless The young ones are generally known by their yellow legs and dark coloured bills PHEASANT CUTLETS ten forty INGREDIENTS two or three pheasants egg and bread crumbs cayenne and salt to taste brown gravy Mode Procure three young pheasants that have been hung a few days pluck draw and wipe them inside cut them into joints remove the bones from the best of these and the backbones trimmings c put into a stewpan with a little stock herbs

Sufficient for two entrees Seasonable from the first of October to the beginning of February ROAST PHEASANT ten forty one INGREDIENTS Pheasant flour butter Choosing and Trussing Old pheasants may be known by the length and sharpness of their spurs in young ones they are short and blunt The cock bird is generally reckoned the best except when the hen is with egg They should hang some time before they are dressed as if they are cooked fresh the flesh will be exceedingly dry and tasteless After the bird is plucked and drawn wipe the inside with a damp cloth and truss it in the same manner as partridge No ten thirty nine If the head is left on as shown in the engraving bring it round under the wing and fix it on to the point of the skewer Illustration ROAST PHEASANT Mode Roast it before a brisk fire keep it well basted and flour and froth it nicely Serve with brown gravy a little of which should be poured round the bird and a tureen of bread sauce two or three of the pheasant s best tail feathers are sometimes stuck in the tail as an ornament but the fashion is not much to be commended See coloured plate Fone Time one two to one hour according to the size Average cost twos sixd to threes each Sufficient one for a dish Seasonable from the first of October to the beginning of February Illustration THE PHEASANT THE PHEASANT This beautiful bird is said to have been discovered by the Argonauts on the banks of the Phasis near Mount Ararat in their expedition to Colchis It is common however in almost all the southern parts of the European continent and has been long naturalized in the warmest and most woody counties of England It is very common in France indeed so common as to be esteemed a nuisance by the farmers Although it has been domesticated this is not easily accomplished nor is its flesh so palatable then as it is in the wild state mister Ude says It is not often that pheasants are met with possessing that exquisite taste which is acquired only by long keeping as the damp of this climate prevents their being kept as long as they are in other countries The hens in general are the most delicate The cocks show their age by their spurs They are only fit to be eaten when the blood begins to run from the bill which is commonly six days or a week after they have been killed The flesh is white tender and has a good flavour if you keep it long enough if not it is not much different from that of a common fowl or hen BRILLAT SAVARIN S RECIPE FOR ROAST PHEASANT a la Sainte Alliance ten forty two When the pheasant is in good condition to be cooked see No ten forty one it should be plucked and not before The bird should then be stuffed in the following manner Take two snipes and draw them putting the bodies on one plate and the livers c on another Take off the flesh and mince it finely with a little beef lard a few truffles pepper and salt to taste and stuff the pheasant carefully with this Cut a slice of bread larger considerably than the bird and cover it with the liver c and a few truffles an anchovy and a little fresh butter added to these will do no harm Put the bread c into the dripping pan and when the bird is roasted place it on the preparation and surround it with Florida oranges Do not be uneasy Savarin adds about your dinner for a pheasant served in this way is fit for beings better than men The pheasant itself is a very good bird and imbibing the dressing and the flavour of the truffle and snipe it becomes thrice better BROILED PHEASANT a Breakfast or Luncheon Dish ten forty three INGREDIENTS one pheasant a little lard egg and bread crumbs salt and cayenne to taste Mode Cut the legs off at the first joint and the remainder of the bird into neat pieces put them into a fryingpan with a little lard and when browned on both sides and about half done take them out and drain them brush the pieces over with egg and sprinkle with bread crumbs with which has been mixed a good seasoning of cayenne and salt Broil them over a moderate fire for about ten minutes or rather longer and serve with mushroom sauce sauce piquante or brown gravy in which a few game bones and trimmings have been stewed Time Altogether one two hour Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable from the first of October to the beginning of February THE HEIGHT OF EXCELLENCE IN A PHEASANT Things edible have their degrees of excellence under various circumstances thus asparagus capers peas and partridges are best when young Perfection in others is only reached when they attain maturity let us say for example melons and nearly all fruits we must except perhaps the medlar with the majority of those animals whose flesh we eat But others again are not good until decomposition is about to set in and here we may mention particularly the snipe and the pheasant If the latter bird be eaten so soon as three days after it has been killed it then has no peculiarity of flavour a pullet would be more relished and a quail would surpass it in aroma Kept however a proper length of time and this can be ascertained by a slight smell and change of colour then it becomes a highly flavoured dish occupying so to speak the middle distance between chicken and venison It is difficult to define any exact time to hang a pheasant but any one possessed of the instincts of gastronomical science can at once detect the right moment when a pheasant should be taken down in the same way as a good cook knows whether a bird should be removed from the spit or have a turn or two more TO DRESS PLOVERS ten forty four INGREDIENTS three plovers butter flour toasted bread Choosing and Trussing Choose those that feel hard at the vent as that shows their fatness There are three sorts the grey green and bastard plover or lapwing They will keep good for some time but if very stale the feet will be very dry Plovers are scarcely fit for anything but roasting they are however sometimes stewed or made into a ragout but this mode of cooking is not to be recommended Mode Pluck off the feathers wipe the outside of the birds with a damp cloth and do not draw them truss with the head under the wing put them down to a clear fire and lay slices of moistened toast in the dripping pan to catch the trail Keep them well basted dredge them lightly with flour a few minutes before they are done and let them be nicely frothed Dish them on the toasts over which the trail should be equally spread Pour round the toast a little good gravy and send some to table in a tureen Time ten minutes to one four hour Average cost ones sixd the brace if plentiful Sufficient for two persons Seasonable In perfection from the beginning of September to the end of January THE PLOVER There are two species of this bird the grey and the green the former being larger than the other and somewhat less than the woodcock It has generally been classed with those birds which chiefly live in the water but it would seem only to seek its food there for many of the species breed upon the loftiest mountains Immense flights of these birds are to be seen in the Hebrides and other parts of Scotland and in the winter large numbers are sent to the London market which is sometimes so much glutted with them that they are sold very cheap Previous to dressing they are kept till they have a game flavour and although their flesh is a favourite with many it is not universally relished The green is preferred to the grey but both are inferior to the woodcock Their eggs are esteemed as a great delicacy Birds of this kind are migratory They arrive in England in April live with us all the spring and summer and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by getting together in flocks It is supposed that they then retire to Spain and frequent the sheep walks with which that country abounds Illustration THE PLOVER TO DRESS THE PTARMIGAN ten forty five INGREDIENTS two or three birds butter flour fried bread crumbs Mode The ptarmigan or white grouse when young and tender are exceedingly fine eating and should be kept as long as possible to be good Pluck draw and truss them in the same manner as grouse No ten twenty five and roast them before a brisk fire Flour and froth them nicely and serve on buttered toast with a tureen of brown gravy Bread sauce when liked may be sent to table with them and fried bread crumbs substituted for the toasted bread Time About one two hour Sufficient two for a dish Seasonable from the beginning of February to the end of April THE PTARMIGAN OR WHITE GROUSE This bird is nearly the same size as red grouse and is fond of lofty situations where it braves the severest weather and is found in most parts of Europe as well as in Greenland At Hudson s Bay they appear in such multitudes that so many as sixty or seventy are frequently taken at once in a net As they are as tame as chickens this is done without difficulty Buffon says that the Ptarmigan avoids the solar heat and prefers the frosts of the summits of the mountains for as the snow melts on the sides of the mountains it ascends till it gains the top where it makes a hole and burrows in the snow In winter it flies in flocks and feeds on the wild vegetation of the hills which imparts to its flesh a bitter but not altogether an unpalatable taste It is dark coloured and has something of the flavour of the hare and is greatly relished and much sought after by some sportsmen Illustration THE PTARMIGAN TO DRESS QUAILS ten forty six INGREDIENTS Quails butter toast Mode These birds keep good several days and should be roasted without drawing Truss them in the same manner as woodcocks No ten sixty two roast them before a clear fire keep them well basted and serve on toast Time About twenty minutes Average cost Seldom bought Sufficient two for a dish Seasonable from October to December Illustration THE QUAIL THE QUAIL Quails are almost universally diffused over Europe Asia and Africa Being birds of passage they are seen in immense flocks traversing the Mediterranean Sea from Europe to Africa in the autumn and returning again in the spring frequently alighting in their passage on many of the islands of the Archipelago which with their vast numbers they almost completely cover On the western coasts of the kingdom of Naples they have appeared in such prodigious numbers that within the compass of four or five miles as many as a hundred thousand have been taken in a day From these circumstances says a writer on natural history it appears highly probable that the quails which supplied the Israelites with food during their journey through the wilderness were sent thither on their passage to the north by a wind from the south west sweeping over Egypt and Ethiopia towards the shores of the Red Sea In England they are not very numerous although they breed in it and many of them are said to remain throughout the year changing their quarters from the interior parts of the country for the seacoast TO DRESS SNIPES ten forty seven INGREDIENTS Snipes butter flour toast Mode These like woodcocks should be dressed without being drawn Pluck and wipe them outside and truss them with the head under the wing having previously skinned that and the neck Twist the legs at the first joint press the feet upon the thighs and pass a skewer through these and the body Place four on a skewer tie them on to the jack or spit and roast before a clear fire for about one four hour Put some pieces of buttered toast into the dripping pan to catch the trails flour and froth the birds nicely dish the pieces of toast with the snipes on them and pour round but not over them a little good brown gravy They should be sent to table very hot and expeditiously or they will not be worth eating See coloured plate Mone Illustration ROAST SNIPE Time About one four hour Average cost ones sixd to twos the brace Sufficient four for a dish Seasonable from November to February Note Ortolans are trussed and dressed in the same manner Illustration THE SNIPE THE SNIPE This is a migratory bird and is generally distributed over Europe It is found in most parts of England in the high as well as the low lands depending much on the weather In very wet seasons it resorts to the hills but at other times frequents marshes where it can penetrate the earth with its bill hunting for worms which form its principal food In the Hebrides and the Orkneys snipes are plentiful and they are fattest in frosty weather In the breeding season the snipe changes its note entirely from that which it has in the winter The male will keep on wing for an hour together mounting like a lark and uttering a shrill piping noise then with a bleating sound not unlike that made by an old goat it will descend with great velocity especially if the female be sitting in her nest from which it will not wander far ROAST TEAL ten forty eight INGREDIENTS Teal butter a little flour Mode Choose fat plump birds after the frost has set in as they are generally better flavoured truss them in the same manner as wild duck No ten twenty two roast them before a brisk fire and keep them well basted Serve with brown or orange gravy water cresses and a cut lemon The remains of teal make excellent hash Time From nine to fifteen minutes Average cost ones each but seldom bought Sufficient two for a dish Seasonable from October to February ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON ten forty nine INGREDIENTS Venison coarse flour and water paste a little flour Mode Choose a haunch with clear bright and thick fat and the cleft of the hoof smooth and close the greater quantity of fat there is the better quality will the meat be As many people object to venison when it has too much haut gout ascertain how long it has been kept by running a sharp skewer into the meat close to the bone when this is withdrawn its sweetness can be judged of With care and attention it will keep good a fortnight unless the weather is very mild Keep it perfectly dry by wiping it with clean cloths till not the least damp remains and sprinkle over powdered ginger or pepper as a preventative against the fly When required for use wash it in warm water and dry it well with a cloth butter a sheet of white paper put it over the fat lay a coarse paste about one two inch in thickness over this and then a sheet or two of strong paper Tie the whole firmly on to the haunch with twine and put the joint down to a strong close fire baste the venison immediately to prevent the paper and string from burning and continue this operation without intermission the whole of the time it is cooking About twenty minutes before it is done carefully remove the paste and paper dredge the joint with flour and baste well with butter until it is nicely frothed and of a nice pale brown colour garnish the knuckle bone with a frill of white paper and serve with a good strong but unflavoured gravy in a tureen and currant jelly or melt the jelly with a little port wine and serve that also in a tureen As the principal object in roasting venison is to preserve the fat the above is the best mode of doing so where expense is not objected to but in ordinary cases the paste may be dispensed with and a double paper placed over the roast instead it will not require so long cooking without the paste Do not omit to send very hot plates to table as the venison fat so soon freezes to be thoroughly enjoyed by epicures it should be eaten on hot water plates The neck and shoulder may be roasted in the same manner Illustration ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON Time A large haunch of buck venison with the paste four to five hours haunch of doe venison three one four to three three four hours Allow less time without the paste Average cost ones fourd to ones sixd per lb Sufficient for eighteen persons Seasonable Buck venison in greatest perfection from June to Michaelmas doe venison from November to the end of January THE DEER This active tribe of animals principally inhabit wild and woody regions In their contentions both with each other and the rest of the brute creation these animals not only use their horns but strike very furiously with their fore feet Some of the species are employed as beasts of draught whilst the flesh of the whole is wholesome and that of some of the kinds under the name of venison is considered very delicious Persons fond of hunting have invented peculiar terms by which the objects of their pursuit are characterized thus the stag is called the first year a calf or hind calf the second a knobber the third a brock the fourth a staggard the fifth a stag and the sixth a hart The female is the first year called a calf the second a hearse and the third a hind In Britain the stag has become scarcer than it formerly was but in the Highlands of Scotland herds of four or five hundred may still be seen ranging over the vast mountains of the north and some of the stags of a great size In former times the great feudal chieftains used to hunt with all the pomp of eastern sovereigns assembling some thousands of their clans who drove the deer into the toils or to such stations as were occupied by their chiefs As this sport however was occasionally used as a means for collecting their vassals together for the purpose of concocting rebellion an act was passed prohibitory of such assemblages In the Waverley of Sir Walter Scott a deer hunting scene of this kind is admirably described VENISON This is the name given to the flesh of some kinds of deer and is esteemed as very delicious Different species of deer are found in warm as well as cold climates and are in several instances invaluable to man This is especially the case with the Laplander whose reindeer constitutes a large proportion of his wealth There The reindeer unharness d in freedom can play And safely o er Odin s steep precipice stray Whilst the wolf to the forest recesses may fly And howl to the moon as she glides through the sky In that country it is the substitute for the horse the cow the goat and the sheep From its milk is produced cheese from its skin clothing from its tendons bowstrings and thread from its horns glue from its bones spoons and its flesh furnishes food In England we have the stag an animal of great beauty and much admired He is a native of many parts of Europe and is supposed to have been originally introduced into this country from France About a century back he was to be found wild in some of the rough and mountainous parts of Wales as well as in the forests of Exmoor in Devonshire and the woods on the banks of the Tamar In the middle ages the deer formed food for the not over abstemious monks as represented by Friar Tuck s larder in the admirable fiction of Ivanhoe and at a later period it was a deer stealing adventure that drove the ingenious William Shakspeare to London to become a common player and the greatest dramatist that ever lived HASHED VENISON ten fifty INGREDIENTS The remains of roast venison its own or mutton gravy thickening of butter and flour Mode Cut the meat from the bones in neat slices and if there is sufficient of its own gravy left put the meat into this as it is preferable to any other Should there not be enough put the bones and trimmings into a stewpan with about a pint of mutton gravy let them stew gently for an hour and strain the gravy Put a little flour and butter into the stewpan keep stirring until brown then add the strained gravy and give it a boil up skim and strain again and when a little cool put in the slices of venison Place the stewpan by the side of the fire and when on the point of simmering serve do not allow it to boil or the meat will be hard Send red currant jelly to table with it Time Altogether one one two hour Seasonable Buck venison from June to Michaelmas doe venison from November to the end of January Note A small quantity of Harvey s sauce ketchup or port wine may be added to enrich the gravy these ingredients must however be used very sparingly or they will overpower the flavour of the venison Illustration FALLOW DEER BUCK FALLOW DEER DOE THE FALLOW DEER This is the domestic or park deer and no two animals can make a nearer approach to each other than the stag and it and yet no two animals keep more distinct or avoid each other with a more inveterate animosity They never herd or intermix together and consequently never give rise to an intermediate race it is even rare unless they have been transported thither to find fellow deer in a country where stags are numerous He is very easily tamed and feeds upon many things which the stag refuses he also browzes closer than the stag and preserves his venison better The doe produces one fawn sometimes two but rarely three In short they resemble the stag in all his natural habits and the greatest difference between them is the duration of their lives the stag it is said lives to the age of thirty five or forty years and the fallow deer does not live more than twenty As they are smaller than the stag it is probable that their growth is sooner completed STEWED VENISON ten fifty one INGREDIENTS A shoulder of venison a few slices of mutton fat two glasses of port wine pepper and allspice to taste one one two pint of weak stock or gravy one two teaspoonful of whole pepper one two teaspoonful of whole allspice Mode Hang the venison till tender take out the bone flatten the meat with a rolling pin and place over it a few slices of mutton fat which have been previously soaked for two or three hours in port wine sprinkle these with a little fine allspice and pepper roll the meat up and bind and tie it securely Put it into a stewpan with the bone and the above proportion of weak stock or gravy whole allspice black pepper and port wine cover the lid down closely and simmer

above is the best mode of cooking it Time three one two to four hours Average cost ones fourd to ones sixd per lb Sufficient for ten or twelve persons Seasonable Buck venison from June to Michaelmas doe venison from November to the end of January Illustration THE ROEBUCK THE ROEBUCK This is the Certuscapreolus or common roe and is of a reddish brown colour It is an inhabitant of Asia as well as of Europe It has great grace in its movements and stands about two feet seven inches high and has a length of about three feet nine The extent of its horns is from six to eight inches Illustration THE STAG THE HIND THE STAG The stag or hart is the male of the red deer and the hind is the female He is much larger than the fallow deer and his age is indicated by his horns which are round instead of being palmated like those of the fallow deer During the first year he has no horns but a horny excrescence which is short and rough and covered with a thin hairy skin The next year the horns are single and straight and in the third they have two antlers three the fourth four the fifth and five the sixth year although this number is not always certain for sometimes they are more and often less After the sixth year the antlers do not always increase and although in number they may amount to six or seven on each side yet the animal s age is then estimated rather by the size of the antlers and the thickness of the branch which sustains them than by their variety Large as these horns seem however they are shed every year and their place supplied by new ones This usually takes place in the spring When the old horns have fallen off the new ones do not make their appearance immediately but the bones of the skull ore seen covered with a transparent periosteum or skin which enwraps the bones of all animals After a short time however the skin begins to swell and to form a sort of tumour From this by and by rising from the head shoot forth the antlers from each side and in a short time in proportion as the animal is in condition the entire horns are completed The solidity of the extremities however is not perfect until the horns have arrived at their full growth Old stags usually shed their horns first which generally happens towards the latter end of February or the beginning of March Such as are between five and six years old shed them about the middle or latter end of March those still younger in the month of April and the youngest of all not till the middle or latter end of May These rules though generally true are subject to variations for a severe winter will retard the shedding of the horns The HIND has no horns and is less fitted for being hunted than the male She takes the greatest care of her young and secretes them in the most obscure thickets lest they become a prey to their numerous enemies All the rapacious family of the cat kind with the wolf the dog the eagle and the falcon are continually endeavouring to find her retreat whilst the stag himself is the foe of his own offspring When she has young therefore it would seem that the courage of the male is transferred to the female for she defends them with the most resolute bravery If pursued by the hunter she will fly before the hounds for half the day and then return to her young whose life she has thus preserved at the hazard of her own Illustration ELAND BULL ELAND COW THE NEW VENISON The deer population of our splendid English parks was until a few years since limited to two species the fallow and the red But as the fallow deer itself was an acclimated animal of comparatively recent introduction it came to be a question why might not the proprietor of any deer park in England have the luxury of at least half a dozen species of deer and antelopes to adorn the hills dales ferny brakes and rich pastures of his domain The temperate regions of the whole world might be made to yield specimens of the noble ruminant valuable either for their individual beauty or for their availability to gastronomic purposes During the last four or live years a few spirited English noblemen have made the experiment of breeding foreign deer in their parks and have obtained such a decided success that it may be hoped their example will induce others to follow in a course which will eventually give to England s rural scenery a new element of beauty and to English tables a fresh viand of the choicest character A practical solution of this interesting question was made by Viscount Hill at Hawkestone Park Salop in January eighteen oh nine On that occasion a magnificent eland an acclimated scion of the species whose native home is the South African wilderness was killed for the table The noble beast was thus described He weighed eleven seventy six lbs as he dropped huge as a short horn but with bone not half the size active as a deer stately in all his paces perfect in form bright in colour with a vast dewlap and strong sculptured horn This eland in his lifetime strode majestic on the hill side where he dwelt with his mates and their progeny all English born like himself Three pairs of the same species of deer were left to roam at large on the picturesque elopes throughout the day and to return to their home at pleasure Here during winter they are assisted with roots and hay but in summer they have nothing but the pasture of the park so that in point of expense they cost no more than cattle of the best description Travellers and sportsmen say that the male eland is unapproached in the quality of his flesh by any ruminant in South Africa that it grows to an enormous size and lays on fat with as great facility as a true short horn while in texture and flavour it is infinitely superior The lean is remarkably fine the fat firm and delicate It was tried in every fashion braised brisket roasted ribs broiled steaks filet saute boiled aitchbone c and in all gave evidence of the fact that a new meat of surpassing value had been added to the products of the English park When we hear such a gratifying account of the eland it is pleasing to record that Lord Hastings has a herd of the Canadian wapiti a herd of Indian nylghaus and another of the small Indian hog deer that the Earl of Ducie has been successful in breeding the magnificent Persian deer The eland was first acclimated in England by the late Earl of Derby between the years eighteen thirty five eighteen fifty one at his menagerie at Knowsley On his death in eighteen fifty one he bequeathed to the Zoological Society his breed of elands consisting of two males and three females Here the animals have been treated with the greatest success and from the year eighteen fifty three to the present time the females have regularly reproduced without the loss of a single calf

it cannot be considered as the property of any one and is therefore not game by law It breeds in high northern latitudes and the time of its appearance and disappearance in Sweden coincides exactly with that of its arrival in and return from Great Britain On the coast of Suffolk its vernal and autumnal visits have been accurately observed In the first week of October it makes its appearance in small numbers but in November and December it appears in larger numbers and always after sunset and most gregariously In the same manner as woodcocks take their leave of us they quit France Germany and Italy making the northern and colder climates their summer rendezvous They visit Burgundy in the latter part of October but continue there only a few weeks the country being hard and unable to supply them with such sustenance as they require In the winter they are found as far south as Smyrna and Aleppo and during the same season in Barbary where the Africans name them the ass of the partridge It has been asserted that they have been seen as far south as Egypt which is the most remote region to which they can be traced on that side of the eastern world on the other side they are common in Japan Those which resort to the countries of the Levant are supposed to come from the mountains of Armenia or the deserts of Tartary or Siberia The flesh of the woodcock is held in high estimation hence the bird is eagerly sought after by the sportsman GAME CARVING BLACKCOCK Illustration BLACKCOCK ten fifty four Skilful carving of game undoubtedly adds to the pleasure of the guests at a dinner table for game seems pre eminently to be composed of such delicate limbs and tender flesh that an inapt practitioner appears to more disadvantage when mauling these pretty and favourite dishes than larger and more robust pieces de resistance As described at recipe No ten nineteen this bird is variously served with or without the head on and although we do not personally object to the appearance of the head as shown in the woodcut yet it seems to be more in vogue to serve it without The carving is not difficult but should be elegantly and deftly done Slices from the breast cut in the direction of the dotted line from two to one should be taken off the merrythought displaced and the leg and wing removed by running the knife along from three to four and following the directions given under the head of boiled fowl No one thousand reserving the thigh which is considered a great delicacy for the most honoured guests some of whom may also esteem the brains of this bird WILD DUCK Illustration WILD DUCK ten fifty five As game is almost universally served as a dainty and not as a dish to stand the assaults of an altogether fresh appetite these dishes are not usually cut up entirely but only those parts are served of each which are considered the best flavoured and the primest Of wild fowl the breast alone is considered by epicures worth eating and slices are cut from this in the direction indicated by the lines from one to two if necessary the leg and wing can be taken off by passing the knife from three to four and by generally following the directions described for carving boiled fowl No one thousand ROAST HARE Illustration ROAST HARE ten fifty six The Grand Carver of olden times a functionary of no ordinary dignity was pleased when he had a hare to manipulate for his skill and grace had an opportunity of display Diners a la Russe may possibly erewhile save modern gentlemen the necessity of learning the art which was in auld lang syne one of the necessary accomplishments of the youthful squire but until side tables become universal or till we see the office of grand carver once more instituted it will be well for all to learn how to assist at the carving of this dish which if not the most elegant in appearance is a very general favourite The hare having its head to the left as shown in the woodcut should be first served by cutting slices from each side of the backbone in the direction of the lines from three to four After these prime parts are disposed of the leg should next be disengaged by cutting round the line indicated by the figures five to six The shoulders will then be taken off by passing the knife round from seven to eight The back of the hare should now be divided by cutting quite through its spine as shown by the line one to two taking care to feel with the point of the knife for a joint where the back may be readily penetrated It is the usual plan not to serve any bone in helping hare and thus the flesh should be sliced from the legs and placed alone on the plate In large establishments and where men cooks are kept it is often the case that the backbone of the hare especially in old animals is taken out and then the process of carving is of course considerably facilitated A great point to be remembered in connection with carving hare is that plenty of gravy should accompany each helping otherwise this dish which is naturally dry will lose half its flavour and so become a failure Stuffing is also served with it and the ears which should be nicely crisp and the brains of the hare are esteemed as delicacies by many connoisseurs PARTRIDGES Illustration ROAST PARTRIDGES ten fifty seven There are several ways of carving this most familiar game bird The more usual and summary mode is to carry the knife sharply along the top of the breastbone of the bird and cut it quite through thus dividing it into two precisely equal and similar parts in the same manner as carving a pigeon No ten oh three Another plan is to cut it into three pieces viz by severing a small wing and leg on either side from the body by following the line one to two in the upper woodcut thus making two helpings when the breast will remain for a third plate The most elegant manner is that of thrusting back the body from the legs and then cutting through the breast in the direction shown by the line one to two this plan will give four or more small helpings A little bread sauce should be served to each guest GROUSE Illustration ten fifty eight GROUSE may be carved in the way first described in carving partridge The backbone of the grouse is highly esteemed by many and this part of many game birds is considered the finest flavoured PHEASANT Illustration ROAST PHEASANT ten fifty nine Fixing the fork in the breast let the carver cut slices from it in the direction of the lines from two to one these are the prime pieces If there be more guests to satisfy than these slices will serve then let the legs and wings be disengaged in the same manner as described in carving boiled fowl No one thousand the point where the wing joins the neckbone being carefully found The merrythought will come off in the same way as that of a fowl The most valued parts are the same as those which are most considered in a fowl SNIPE Illustration SNIPE ten sixty One of these small but delicious birds may be given whole to a gentleman but in helping a lady it will be better to cut them quite through the centre from one to two completely dividing them into equal and like portions and put only one half on the plate HAUNCH OF VENISON Illustration HAUNCH OF VENISON ten sixty one Here is a grand dish for a knight of the carving knife to exercise his skill upon and what will be pleasant for many to know there is but little difficulty in the performance An incision being made completely down to the bone in the direction of the line one to two the gravy will then be able easily to flow when slices not too thick should be cut along the haunch as indicated by the line four to three that end of the joint marked three having been turned towards the carver so that he may have a more complete command over the joint Although some epicures affect to believe that some parts of the haunch are superior to others yet we doubt if there is any difference between the slices cut above and below the line It should be borne in mind to serve each guest with a portion of fat and the most expeditious carver will be the best carver as like mutton venison soon begins to chill when it loses much of its charm WOODCOCK Illustration WOODCOCK ten sixty two This bird like a partridge may be carved by cutting it exactly into two like portions or made into three helpings as described in carving partridge No ten fifty seven The backbone is considered the tit bit of a woodcock and by many the thigh is also thought a great delicacy This bird is served in the manner advised by Brillat Savarin in connection with the pheasant viz on toast which has received its drippings whilst roasting and a piece of this toast should invariably accompany each plate LANDRAIL ten sixty three LANDRAIL being trussed like Snipe with the exception of its being drawn may be carved in the same manner See No ten sixty PTARMIGAN ten sixty four PTARMIGAN being of much the same size and trussed in the same manner as the red bird may be carved in the

unscented fictions of the loom Who satisfied with only pencilled scenes Prefer to the performance of a God Th inferior wonders of an artist s hand Lovely indeed the mimic works of art But Nature s works far lovelier COWPER ten sixty nine THE ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE KINGDOMS says Hogg in his Natural History of the Vegetable Kingdom may be aptly compared to the primary colours of the prismatic spectrum which are so gradually and intimately blended that we fail to discover where the one terminates and where the other begins If we had to deal with yellow and blue only the eye would easily distinguish the one from the other but when the two are blended and form green we cannot tell where the blue ends and the yellow begins And so it is in the animal and vegetable kingdoms If our powers of observation were limited to the highest orders of animals and plants if there were only mammals birds reptiles fishes and insects in the one and trees shrubs and herbs in the other we should then be able with facility to define the bounds of the two kingdoms but as we descend the scale of each and arrive at the lowest forms of animals and plants we there meet with bodies of the simplest structure sometimes a mere cell whose organization modes of development and reproduction are so anomalous and partake so much of the character of both that we cannot distinguish whether they are plants or whether they are animals ten seventy WHILST IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE where the animal begins and the vegetable ends it is as difficult to account for many of the singularities by which numbers of plants are characterized This however can hardly be regarded as a matter of surprise when we recollect that so far as it is at present known the vegetable kingdom is composed of upwards of ninety two thousand species of plants Of this amazing number the lichens and the mosses are of the simplest and hardiest kinds These indeed may be considered as the very creators of the soil they thrive in the coldest and most sterile regions many of them commencing the operations of nature in the growth of vegetables on the barest rocks and receiving no other nourishment than such as may be supplied to them by the simple elements of air and rain When they have exhausted their period in such situations as have been assigned them they pass into a state of decay and become changed into a very fine mould which in the active spontaneity of nature immediately begins to produce other species which in their turn become food for various mosses and also rot This process of growth and decay being from time to time continued by and by forms a soil sufficient for the maintenance of larger plants which also die and decay and so increase the soil until it becomes deep enough to sustain an oak or even the weight of a tropical forest To create soil amongst rocks however must not be considered as the only end of the lichen different kinds of it minister to the elegant arts in the form of beautiful dyes thus the lichen rocella is used to communicate to silk and wool various shades of purple and crimson which greatly enhance the value of these materials This species is chiefly imported from the Canary Islands and when scarce as an article of commerce has brought as much as Lone thousand per ton ten seventy one IN THE VICINITY OF LICHENS THE MUSCI OR MOSSES are generally to be found Indeed wherever vegetation can be sustained there they are affording protection to the roots and seeds of more delicate vegetables and by their spongy texture retaining a moisture which preserves other plants from the withering drought of summer But even in winter we find them enlivening by their verdure the cold bosom of Nature We see them abounding in our pastures and our woods attaching themselves to the living and still more abundantly to the dead trunks and branches of trees In marshy places they also abound and become the medium of their conversion into fruitful fields This is exemplified by the manner in which peat mosses are formed on the surface of these we find them in a state of great life and vigour immediately below we discover them more or less in a state of decomposition and still deeper we find their stems and branches consolidated into a light brown peat Thus are extensive tracts formed ultimately to be brought into a state of cultivation and rendered subservient to the wants of man ten seventy two WHEN NATURE HAS FOUND A SOIL her next care is to perfect the growth of her seeds and then to disperse them Whilst the seed remains confined in its capsule it cannot answer its purpose hence when it is sufficiently ripe the pericardium opens and lets it out What must strike every observer with surprise is how nuts and shells which we can hardly crack with our teeth or even with a hammer will divide of themselves and make way for the little tender sprout which proceeds from the kernel There are instances it is said such as in the Touch me not impatiens and the Cuckoo flower cardamine in which the seed vessels by an elastic jerk at the moment of their explosion cast the seeds to a distance We are all aware however that many seeds those of the most composite flowers as of the thistle and dandelion are endowed with what have not been inappropriately called wings These consist of a beautiful silk looking down by which they are enabled to float in the air and to be transported sometimes to considerable distances from the parent plant that produced them The swelling of this downy tuft within the seed vessel is the means by which the seed is enabled to overcome the resistance of its coats and to force for itself a passage by which it escapes from its little prison house Illustration BEETON S Book of HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT EDITED BY missus ISABELLA BEETON Illustration THE FREE FAIR HOMES OF ENGLAND ten seventy three BIRDS AS WELL AS QUADRUPEDS are likewise the means of dispersing the seeds of plants and placing them in situations where they ultimately grow Amongst the latter is the squirrel which is an extensive planter of oaks nay it may be regarded as having in some measure been one of the creators of the British navy We have read of a gentleman who was walking one day in some woods belonging to the Duke of Beaufort near Troy House in Monmouthshire when his attention was arrested by a squirrel sitting very composedly upon the ground He stopped to observe its motions when in a short time the little animal suddenly quitted its position and darted to the top of the tree beneath which it had been sitting In an instant it returned with an acorn in its mouth and with its paws began to burrow in the earth After digging a small hole it therein deposited an acorn which it hastily covered and then darted up the tree again In a moment it was down with another which it buried in the same manner and so continued its labour gathering and burying as long as the gentleman had patience to watch it This industry in the squirrel is an instinct which directs it to lay up a store of provision for the winter and as it is probable that its memory is not sufficiently retentive to enable it to recollect all the spots in which it deposits its acorns it no doubt makes some slips in the course of the season and loses some of them These few spring up and are in time destined to supply the place of the parent tree Thus may the sons of Britain in some degree consider themselves to be indebted to the industry and defective memory of this little animal for the production of some of those wooden walls which have for centuries been the national pride and which have so long braved the battle and the breeze on the broad bosom of the great deep in every quarter of the civilized globe As with the squirrel so with jays and pies which plant among the grass and moss horse beans and probably forget where they have secreted them mister White the naturalist says that both horse beans and peas sprang up in his field walks in the autumn and he attributes the sowing of them to birds Bees he also observes are much the best setters of cucumbers If they do not happen to take kindly to the frames the best way is to tempt them by a little honey put on the male and female bloom When they are once induced to haunt the frames they set all the fruit and will hover with impatience round the lights in a morning till the glasses are opened ten seventy four Some of the acorns planted by the squirrel of Monmouthshire may be now in a fair way to become at the end of some centuries venerable trees for not the least remarkable quality of oaks is the strong principle of life with which they are endued In Major Rooke s Sketch of the forest of Sherwood we find it stated that on some timber cut down in Berkland and Bilhaugh letters were found stamped in the bodies of the trees denoting the king s reign in which they were marked The bark appears to have been cut off and then the letters to have been cut in and the next year s wood to have grown over them without adhering to where the bark had been cut out The ciphers were found to be of James I William and Mary and one of King John One of the ciphers of James was about one foot within the tree and one foot from the centre It was cut down in seventeen eighty six The tree must have been two feet in diameter or two yards in circumference when the mark was cut A tree of this size is generally estimated at one hundred twenty years growth which number being subtracted from the middle year of the reign of James would carry the year back to fourteen ninety two which would be about the period of its being planted The tree with the cipher of William and Mary displayed its mark about nine inches within the tree and three feet three inches from the centre This tree was felled in seventeen eighty six The cipher of John was eighteen inches within the tree and rather more than a foot from the centre The middle year of the reign of that monarch was twelve oh seven By subtracting from this one hundred twenty the number of years requisite for a tree s growth to arrive at the diameter of two feet the date of its being planted would seem to have been ten eighty five or about twenty years after the Conquest Illustration CELLULAR DEVELOPMENT ten seventy five Considering the great endurance of these trees we are necessarily led to inquire into the means by which they are enabled to arrive at such strength and maturity and whether it may be considered as a humiliation we will not determine but with all the ingenious mechanical contrivances of man we are still unable to define the limits of the animal and vegetable kingdoms Plants have been described by naturalists who would determine the limits of the two kingdoms as organized living bodies without volition or locomotion destitute of a mouth or intestinal cavity which when detached from their place of growth die and in decay ferment but do not putrefy and which on being subjected to analysis furnish an excess of carbon and no nitrogen The powers of chemistry and of the microscope however instead of confirming these views tend more and more to show that a still closer affinity exists between plants and animals for it is now ascertained that nitrogen which was believed to be present only in animals enters largely into the composition of plants also When the microscope is brought to aid our powers of observation we find that there are organized bodies belonging to the vegetable kingdom which possess very evident powers of locomotion and which change about in so very remarkable a manner that no other cause than that of volition can be assigned to it Thus it would seem that in this particular at least some vegetables bear a very close resemblance to animal life and when we consider the manner in which they are supplied with nourishment and perform the functions of their existence the resemblance would seem still closer If for example we take a thin transverse slice of the stem of any plant or a slice cut across its stem and immerse it in a little pure water and place it under a microscope we will find that it consists principally of cells more or less regular and resembling those of a honeycomb or a network of cobweb The size of these varies in different plants as it does in different parts of the same plant and they are sometimes so minute as to require a million to cover a square inch of surface This singular structure besides containing water and air is the repository or storehouse of various secretions Through it the sap when produced is diffused sideways through the plant and by it numerous changes are effected in the juices which fill its cells The forms of the cells are various they are also subject to various transformations Sometimes a number of cylindrical cells are laid end to end and by the absorption of the transverse partitions form a continuous tube as in the sap vessels of plants or in muscular and nervous fibre and when cells are thus woven together they are called cellular tissue which in the human body forms a fine net like membrane enveloping or connecting most of its structures In pulpy fruits the cells may be easily separated one from the other and within the cells are smaller cells commonly known as pulp Among the cell contents of some plants are beautiful crystals called raphides The term is derived from Greek rhaphis a needle on account of the resemblance of the crystal to a needle They are composed of the phosphate and oxalate of lime but there is great difference of opinion as to their use in the economy of the plant and one of the French philosophers endeavoured to prove that crystals are the possible transition of the inorganic to organic matter The differences however between the highest form of crystal and the lowest form of organic life known viz a simple reproductive cell are so manifold and striking that the attempt to make crystals the bridge over which inorganic matter passes into organic is almost totally regarded as futile In a layer of an onion a fig a section of garden rhubarb in some species of aloe in the bark of many trees and in portions of the cuticle of the medicinal squill bundles of these needle shaped crystals are to be found Some of them are as large as one fortieth of an inch others are as small as the one one thousandth They are found in all parts of the plant in the stem bark leaves stipules petals fruit roots and even in the pollen with some few exceptions and they are always situated in the interior of cells Some plants as many of the cactus tribe are made up almost entirely of these needle crystals in some instances every cell of the cuticle contains a stellate mass of crystals in others the whole interior is full of them rendering the plant so exceedingly brittle that the least touch will occasion a fracture so much so that some specimens of Cactus senilis said to be a thousand years old which were sent a few years since to Kew from South America were obliged to be packed in cotton with all the care of the most delicate jewellery to preserve them during transport Illustration SILICEOUS CUTICLE FROM UNDER SIDE OF LEAF OF DEUTZIA SCABRA Illustration SILICEOUS CUTICLE OF GRASS ten seventy six Besides the cellular tissue there is what is called a vascular system which consists of another set of small vessels If for example we early in the spring cut a branch transversely we will perceive the sap oozing out from numerous points over the whole of the divided surface except on that part occupied by the pith and the bark and if a twig on which the leaves are already unfolded be cut from the tree and placed with its cut end in a watery solution of Brazil wood the colouring matter will be found to ascend into the leaves and to the top of the twig In both these cases a close examination with a powerful microscope will discover the sap perspiring from the divided portion of the stem and the colouring matter rising through real tubes to the top of the twig these are the sap or conducting vessels of the plant If however we examine a transverse section of the vine or of any other tree at a later period of the season we find that the wood is apparently dry whilst the bark particularly that part next the wood is swelled with fluid This is contained in vessels of a different kind from those in which the sap rises They are found in the bark only in trees and may be called returning vessels from their carrying the sap downwards after its preparation in the leaf It is believed that the passage of the sap in plants is conducted in a manner precisely similar to that of the blood in man from the regular contraction and expansion of the vessels but on account of their extreme minuteness it is almost an impossibility to be certain upon this point Numerous observations made with the microscope show that their diameter seldom exceeds a two hundred and ninetieth part of a line or a three thousandth part of an inch Leuwenhoeck reckoned twenty thousand vessels in a morsel of oak about one nineteenth of an inch square ten seventy seven In the vascular system of a plant we at once see the great analogy which it bears to the veins and arteries in the human system but neither it nor the cellular tissue combined is all that is required to perfect the production of a vegetable There is besides a tracheal system which is composed of very minute elastic spiral tubes designed for the purpose of conveying air both to and from the plant There are also fibres which consist of collections of these cells and vessels closely united together These form the root and the stem If we attempt to cut them transversely we meet with difficulty because we have to force our way across the tubes and break them but if we slit the wood lengthwise the vessels are separated without breaking The layers of wood which appear in the stem or branch of a tree cut transversely consist of different zones of fibres each the produce of one year s growth and separated by a coat of cellular tissue without which they could not be well distinguished Besides all these there is the cuticle which extends over every part of the plant and covers the bark with three distinct coats The liber or inner bark is said to be formed of hollow tubes which convey the sap downwards to increase the solid diameter of the tree ten seventy eight THE ROOT AND THE STEM NOW DEMAND A SLIGHT NOTICE The former is designed not only to support the plant by fixing it in the soil but also to fulfil the functions of a channel for the conveyance of nourishment it is therefore furnished with pores or spongioles as they are called from their resemblance to a sponge to suck up whatever comes within its reach It is found in a variety of forms and hence its adaptation to a great diversity of soils and circumstances We have heard of a willow tree being dug up and its head planted where its roots were and these suffered to spread out in the air like naked branches In course of time the roots became branches and the branches roots or rather roots rose from the branches beneath the ground and branches shot from the roots above Some roots last one year others two and others like the shrubs and trees which they produce have an indefinite period of existence but they all consist of a collection of fibres composed of vascular and cellular tissue without tracheae or breathing vessels The stem is the grand distributor of the nourishment taken up by the roots to the several parts of the plant The seat of its vitality is said to be in the point or spot called the neck which separates the stem from the root If the root of a young plant be cut off it will shoot out afresh if even the stem be taken away it will be renewed but if this part be injured the plant will assuredly die ten seventy nine IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN OF THIS WORK special notices of culinary vegetables will accompany the various recipes in which they are spoken of but here we cannot resist the opportunity of declaring it as our conviction that he or she who introduces a useful or an ornamental plant into our island ought justly to be considered to a large extent a benefactor to the country No one can calculate the benefits which may spring from this very vegetable after its qualities have become thoroughly known If viewed in no other light it is

mucilage sugar starch and alkaline salts which are found in them Many of them are used as potherbs and some are emetic and vermifuge in their medicinal properties The root of garden or red beet is exceedingly wholesome and nutritious and doctor Lyon Playfair has recommended that a good brown bread may be made by rasping down this root with an equal quantity of flour He says that the average quality of flour contains about twelve per cent of azotized principles adapted for the formation of flesh and the average quality of beet contains about two per cent of the same materials BOILED

economy On the cliffs of Dover and in many places on the coasts of Dorsetshire Cornwall and Yorkshire there grows a wild plant with variously indented much waved and loose spreading leaves of a sea green colour and large yellow flowers In spring the leaves of this plant are collected by the inhabitants who after boiling them in two waters to remove the saltness use them as a vegetable along with their meat This is the Brassica oleracea of science the Wild Cabbage or Colewort from which have originated all the varieties of Cabbage Cauliflower Greens and Brocoli STEWED RED CABBAGE ten ninety

to be found a very common plant known by the name of Smallage This is the wild form of celery but by being subjected to cultivation it loses its acrid nature and becomes mild and sweet In its natural state it has a peculiar rank coarse taste and smell and its root was reckoned by the ancients as one of the five greater aperient roots There is a variety of this in which the root becomes turnip shaped and large It is called Celeriae and is extensively used by the Germans and preferred by them to celery In a raw state this plant does not suit weak stomachs cooked it is less difficult of digestion although a large quantity should not he taken Illustration CELERY II eleven ten INGREDIENTS six heads of celery one two pint of white stock or weak broth four tablespoonfuls of cream

temperate but in the tropical and warmer regions throughout the world they are abundant They are most plentiful in the continent of Hindostan but in America are not near so plentiful Many of the kinds supply useful articles of consumption for food and others are actively medicinal in their virtues Generally speaking delicate stomachs should avoid this plant for it is cold and indigestible CUCUMBERS

USES OF THE CUCURBITS The common cucumber is the C sativus of science and although the whole of the family have a similar action in the animal economy yet there are some which present us with great anomalies The roots of those which are perennial contain besides fecula which is their base a resinous acrid and bitter principle The fruits of this family however have in general a sugary taste and are more or less dissolving and perfumed as we find in the melons gourds cucumbers vegetable marrows and squashes But these are slightly laxative if partaken of largely In tropical countries this order furnishes the inhabitants with a large portion of their food which even in the most arid deserts and most barren islands is of the finest quality In China Cashmere and Persia they are cultivated on the lakes on the floating collections of weeds common in these localities In India they are everywhere abundant either in a cultivated or wild state and the seeds of all the family are sweet and mucilaginous STEWED CUCUMBERS eleven fourteen INGREDIENTS three large cucumbers flour butter rather more than one two pint of good brown gravy Mode Cut the cucumbers lengthwise the size of the dish

sixteen This vegetable so beautiful in appearance makes an excellent addition to winter salad when lettuces and other salad herbs are not obtainable It is usually placed in the centre of the dish and looks remarkably pretty with slices of beetroot hard boiled eggs and curled celery placed round it so that the colours contrast nicely In preparing it carefully wash and cleanse it free from insects which are generally found near the heart remove any decayed or dead leaves and dry it thoroughly by shaking in a cloth This vegetable may also be served hot stewed in cream brown gravy or butter but when dressed thus the sauce it is stewed in should not be very highly seasoned as that would destroy and overpower the flavour of the vegetable Average cost oned per head Sufficient one head for a salad for four persons Seasonable from November to March ENDIVE This is the C endivium of science and is much used as a salad It belongs to the family of the Compositae with Chicory common Goats beard and others of the same genus Withering states that before the stems of the common Goats beard shoot up the roots boiled like asparagus have the same flavour and are nearly as nutritious We are also informed by Villars that the children in Dauphine universally eat the stems and leaves of the young plant before the flowers appear with great avidity The fresh juice of these tender herbs is said to be the best solvent of bile STEWED ENDIVE eleven seventeen INGREDIENTS six heads of endive salt and water one pint of broth thickening of butter and flour one tablespoonful of lemon juice a small lump

persons Seasonable in winter when other vegetables are scarce Note Haricots blancs when new and fresh should be put into boiling water and do not require any soaking previous to dressing HARICOTS AND LENTILS Although these vegetables are not much used in this country yet in France and other Catholic countries from their peculiar constituent properties they form an excellent substitute for animal food during Lent and maigre days At the time of the prevalence of the Roman religion in this country they were probably much more generally used than at present As reformations are often carried beyond necessity possibly lentils may have fallen into disuse as an article of diet amongst Protestants for fear the use of them might be considered a sign of popery HARICOTS BLANCS A LA MAITRE D

two to two one two hours to boil the beans Average cost fourd per quart Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable in winter HARICOT BEANS This is the haricot blanc of the French and is a native of India It ripens readily in dry summers in most parts of Britain but its culture has hitherto been confined to gardens in England but in Germany and Switzerland it is grown in fields It is usually harvested by pulling up the plants which being dried are stacked and thrashed The haulm is both of little bulk and little use but the seed is used in making the esteemed French dish called haricot with which it were well if the working classes of this country were acquainted There is perhaps no other vegetable dish so cheap and easily cooked and at the same time so agreeable and nourishing The beans are boiled and then mixed with a little fat or salt butter and a little milk or water and flour From three thousand eight hundred forty parts of kidney bean Einholff obtained eighteen oh five

THE HORSERADISH This belongs to the tribe Alyssidae and is highly stimulant and exciting to the stomach It has been recommended in chronic rheumatism palsy dropsical complaints and in cases of enfeebled digestion Its principal use however is as a condiment to promote appetite and excite the digestive organs The horseradish contains sulphur to the extent of thirty per cent in the number of its elements and it is to the presence of this quality that the metal vessels in which the radish is sometimes distilled are turned into a black colour It is one of the most powerful excitants and antiscorbutics we have and forms the basis of several medical preparations in the form of wines tinctures and syrups LETTUCES eleven twenty three These form one of the principal ingredients to summer salads should be nicely blanched and be eaten young They are seldom served in any other way but may be stewed and sent to table in a good brown gravy flavoured with lemon juice In preparing them for a salad carefully wash them free from dirt pick off all the decayed and outer leaves and dry them thoroughly by shaking them in a cloth Cut off the stalks and either halve or cut the lettuces into small pieces The manner of cutting them up entirely depends on the salad for which they are intended In France the lettuces are sometimes merely wiped with a cloth and not washed the cooks there declaring that the act of washing them injuriously affects the pleasant crispness of the plant in this case scrupulous attention must be paid to each leaf and the grit thoroughly wiped away Average cost when cheapest oned each Sufficient Allow two lettuces for four or five persons Seasonable from March to the end of August but may be had all the year Illustration LETTUCE THE LETTUCE All the varieties of the garden lettuce have originated from the Lactuca sativa of science which has never yet been found in a wild state Hence it may be concluded that it is merely another form of some species changed through the effects of cultivation In its young state the lettuce forms a well known and wholesome salad containing a bland pellucid juice with little taste or smell and having a cooling and soothing influence on the system This arises from the large quantities of water and mucilage it contains and not from any narcotic principle which it is supposed to possess During the period of flowering it abounds in a peculiar milky juice which flows from the stem when wounded and which has been found to be possessed of decided medicinal properties BAKED MUSHROOMS A Breakfast Luncheon or Supper Dish eleven twenty four INGREDIENTS sixteen to twenty mushroom flaps butter pepper to taste Mode For this mode of cooking the mushroom flaps are better than the buttons and should not be too large Cut off

Seasonable Meadow mushrooms in September and October cultivated mushrooms may be had at any time FUNGI These are common parasitical plants originating in the production of copious filamentous threads called the mycelium or spawn Rounded tubers appear on the mycelium some of these enlarge rapidly burst an outer covering which is left at the base and protrude a thick stalk bearing at its summit a rounded body which in a short time expands into the pileus or cap The gills which occupy its lower surface consist of parallel plates bearing naked sporules over their whole surface Some of the cells which are visible by the microscope produce four small cells at their free summit apparently by germination and constriction These are the sporules and this is the development of the Agarics BROILED MUSHROOMS A Breakfast Luncheon or Supper Dish eleven twenty five INGREDIENTS Mushroom flaps pepper and salt to taste butter lemon juice Illustration BROILED MUSHROOMS Mode Cleanse the mushrooms by wiping them with a piece of flannel and a little salt cut off a portion of the stalk and peel the tops broil them over a clear fire turning them once and arrange them on a very hot dish Put a small

MUSHROOM The common mushroom found in our pastures is the Agaricus campestris of science and another edible British species is A Georgii but A primulus is affirmed to be the most delicious mushroom The morel is Morchella esculenta and Tuber cibarium is the common truffle There is in New Zealand a long fungus which grows from the head of a caterpillar and which forms a horn as it were and is called Sphaeria Robertsii TO PRESERVE MUSHROOMS eleven twenty six INGREDIENTS To each quart of mushrooms allow three oz of butter pepper and salt to taste the juice of one lemon clarified butter Mode Peel the mushrooms put them into cold water with a little lemon juice take them out and dry them very carefully in a cloth Put the butter into a stewpan capable of holding the mushrooms when it is melted add the mushrooms lemon juice and a seasoning of pepper and salt draw them down over a slow fire and let them remain until their liquor is boiled away and they have become quite dry but be careful in not allowing them to stick to the bottom of the stewpan When done put them into pots and pour over the top clarified butter If wanted for immediate use they will keep good a few days without being covered over To re warm them put the mushrooms into a stewpan strain the butter from them and they will be ready for use Average cost oned each Seasonable Meadow mushrooms in September and October cultivated mushrooms may be had at any time LOCALITIES OF THE MUSHROOM Mushrooms are to be met with in pastures woods and marshes but are very capricious and uncertain in their places of growth multitudes being obtained in one season where few or none were to be found in the preceding They sometimes grow solitary but more frequently they are gregarious and rise in a regular circular form Many species are employed by man as food but generally speaking they are difficult of digestion and by no means very nourishing Many of them are also of suspicious qualities Little reliance can be placed either on their taste smell or colour as much depends on the situation in which they vegetate and even the same plant it is affirmed may be innocent when young but become noxious when advanced in age STEWED MUSHROOMS eleven twenty seven INGREDIENTS one pint mushroom buttons three oz of fresh butter white pepper and salt to taste lemon juice one teaspoonful of flour cream or milk one teaspoonful of grated nutmeg Mode Cut off the ends of the stalks and pare neatly a pint of mushroom buttons put them into a basin of water with a little lemon juice as they are done When all are

two hour Average cost from nined to twos per pint Sufficient for five or six persons Seasonable Meadow mushrooms in September and October TO PROCURE MUSHROOMS In order to obtain mushrooms at all seasons several methods of propagation have been had recourse to It is said that in some parts of Italy a species of stone is used for this purpose which is described as being of two different kinds the one is found in the chalk hills near Naples and has a white porous stalactical appearance the other is a hardened turf from some volcanic mountains near Florence These stones are kept in cellars and occasionally moistened with water which has been used in the washing of mushrooms and are thus supplied with their minute seeds In this country gardeners provide themselves with what is called spawn either from the old manure of cucumber beds or purchase it from those whose business it is to propagate it When thus procured it is usually made up for sale in quadrils consisting of numerous white fibrous roots having a strong smell of mushrooms This is planted in rows in a dry situation and carefully attended to for five or six weeks when the bed begins to produce and continues to do so for several months STEWED MUSHROOMS IN GRAVY eleven twenty eight INGREDIENTS one pint of mushroom buttons one pint of brown gravy No four hundred thirty six one four teaspoonful of grated nutmeg cayenne and salt to taste Mode Make a pint of brown gravy by recipe four hundred thirty six cut nearly all the stalks away from the mushrooms and peel the tops put them into a stewpan with the gravy

Sufficient for five or six persons Seasonable Meadow mushrooms in September and October ANALYSIS OF FUNGI The fungi have been examined chemically with much care both by MM Bracannot and Vauquelin who designate the insoluble spongy matter by the name of fungin and the soluble portion is found to contain the bolotic and the fungic acids BAKED SPANISH ONIONS eleven twenty nine INGREDIENTS four or five Spanish onions salt and water Mode Put the onions with their skins on into a saucepan of boiling water slightly salted and let them boil quickly for an hour Then take them out wipe them thoroughly wrap each one in a piece of paper separately and bake them in a moderate oven for two hours or longer should the onions be very large They may be served in their skins and eaten with a piece of cold butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt or they may be peeled and a good brown gravy poured over them Time one hour to boil two hours to bake Average cost medium sized twod each Sufficient for five or six persons Seasonable from September to January Illustration ONION THE GENUS ALLIUM The Onion like the Leek Garlic and Shalot belongs to the genus Allium which is a numerous species of vegetable and every one of them possesses more or less a volatile and acrid penetrating principle pricking the thin transparent membrane of the eyelids and all are very similar in their properties In the whole of them the bulb is the most active part and any one of them may supply the place of the other for they are all irritant excitant and vesicant With many the onion is a very great favourite and is considered an extremely nutritive vegetable The Spanish kind is frequently taken for supper it being simply boiled and then seasoned with salt pepper and butter Some dredge on a little flour but many prefer it without this BURNT ONIONS FOR GRAVIES eleven thirty INGREDIENTS one two lb of onions one three pint of water one two lb of moist sugar one three pint of vinegar Mode Peel and chop the onions fine and put them into a stewpan not tinned with the water let them boil for five minutes then add the sugar and simmer gently until the mixture becomes nearly black and throws out bubbles of smoke Have ready the above proportion of boiling vinegar strain the liquor gradually to it and keep stirring with a wooden spoon until it is well incorporated When cold bottle for use Time Altogether one hour PROPERTIES OF THE ONION The onion is possessed of a white acrid volatile oil holding sulphur in solution albumen a good deal of uncrystallizable sugar and mucilage phosphoric acid both free and combined with lime acetic acid citrate of lime and lignine Of all the species of allium the onion has the volatile principle in the greatest degree and hence it is impossible to separate the scales of the root without the eyes being affected The juice is sensibly acid and is capable of being by fermentation converted into vinegar and mixed with water or the dregs of beer yields by distillation an alcoholic liquor Although used as a common esculent onions are not suited to all stomachs there are some who cannot eat them either fried or roasted whilst others prefer them boiled which is the best way of using them as by the process they then undergo they are deprived of their essential oil The pulp of roasted onions with oil forms an excellent anodyne and emollient poultice to suppurating tumours STEWED SPANISH ONIONS eleven thirty one INGREDIENTS five or six Spanish onions one pint of good broth or gravy Mode Peel the onions taking care not to cut away too much of the tops or tails or they would then fall to pieces put them into a stewpan capable of holding them at the bottom without piling them one on the top of another add the broth or gravy and simmer very gently until the onions are perfectly tender Dish them pour the gravy round and serve Instead of using broth Spanish onions may be stewed with a large piece of butter they must be done very gradually over a slow fire or hot plate and will produce plenty of gravy Time To stew in gravy two hours or longer if very large Average cost medium sized twod each Sufficient for six or seven persons Seasonable from September to January Note Stewed Spanish onions are a favourite accompaniment to roast shoulder of mutton ORIGIN OF THE ONION This vegetable is thought to have originally come from India through Egypt where it became an object of worship Thence it was transmitted to Greece thence to Italy and ultimately it was distributed throughout Europe in almost every part of which it has from time immemorial been cultivated In warm climates it is found to be less acrid and much sweeter than in colder latitudes and in Spain it is not at all unusual to see a peasant munching an onion as an Englishman would an apple Spanish onions which are imported to this country during the winter months are when properly roasted perfectly sweet and equal to many preserves BOILED PARSNIPS eleven thirty two INGREDIENTS Parsnips to each gallon of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt Mode Wash the parsnips scrape them thoroughly and with the point of the knife remove any black specks about them and should they be very large cut the thick part into quarters Put them into a saucepan of boiling water salted in the above proportion boil them rapidly until tender which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork in them take them up drain them and serve in a vegetable dish This vegetable is usually served with salt fish boiled pork or boiled beef when sent to table with the latter a few should be placed alternately with carrots round the dish as a garnish Time Large parsnips one to one one two hour small ones one two to one hour Average cost oned each Sufficient Allow one for each person Seasonable from October to May Illustration THE PARSNIP THE PARSNIP This vegetable is found wild in meadows all over Europe and in England is met with very frequently on dry banks in a chalky soil In its wild state the root is white mucilaginous aromatic and sweet with some degree of acrimony when old it has been known to cause vertigo Willis relates that a whole family fell into delirium from having eaten of its roots and cattle never touch it in its wild state In domestic economy the parsnip is much used and is found to be a highly nutritious vegetable In times of scarcity an excellent bread has been made from the roots and they also furnish an excellent wine resembling the malmsey of Madeira and the Canaries a spirit is also obtained from them in as great quantities as from carrots The composition of the parsnip root has been found to be seventy nine point four of water zero point nine starch and fibre six point one gum five point five sugar and two point one of albumen BOILED GREEN PEAS eleven thirty three INGREDIENTS Green peas to each one two gallon of water allow one small teaspoonful of moist sugar one heaped tablespoonful of

uncovered and be careful that the smoke does not draw in When tender pour them into a colander put them into a hot vegetable dish and quite in the centre of the peas place a piece of butter the size of a walnut Many cooks boil a small bunch of mint with the peas or garnish them with it by boiling a few sprigs in a saucepan by themselves Should the peas be very old and difficult to boil a good colour a very tiny piece of soda may be thrown in the water previous to putting them in but this must be very sparingly used as it causes the peas when boiled to have a smashed and broken appearance

cost when cheapest sixd per peck when first in season ones to ones sixd per peck Sufficient Allow one peck of unshelled peas for four or five persons Seasonable from June to the end of August ORIGIN OF THE PEA All the varieties of garden peas which are cultivated have originated from the Pisum sativum a native of the south of Europe and field peas are varieties of Pisum arvense The Everlasting Pea is Lathyrus latifolius an old favourite in flower gardens It is said to yield an abundance of honey to bees which are remarkably fond of it In this country the pea has been grown from time immemorial but its culture seems to have diminished since the more general introduction of herbage plants and roots GREEN PEAS A LA FRANCAISE eleven thirty four INGREDIENTS two quarts of green peas three oz of fresh butter a bunch of parsley six green onions flour a small lump of sugar one two teaspoonful of salt a teaspoonful of flour Mode Shell sufficient fresh gathered peas to fill two quarts

four hour Average cost sixd per peck Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable from June to the end of August VARIETIES OF THE PEA The varieties of the Pea are numerous but they may be divided into two classes those grown for the ripened seed and those grown for gathering in a green state The culture of the latter is chiefly confined to the neighbourhoods of large towns and may be considered as in part rather to belong to the operations of the gardener than to those of the agriculturist The grey varieties are the early grey the late grey and the purple grey to which some add the Marlborough grey and the horn grey The white varieties grown in fields are the pearl early Charlton golden hotspur the common white or Suffolk and other Suffolk varieties STEWED GREEN PEAS eleven

four hour Average cost sixd per peck Sufficient for three or four persons Seasonable from June to the end of August Illustration GREEN PEA THE SWEET PEA AND THE HEATH OR WOOD PEA The well known sweet pea forms a fine covering to a trellis or lattice work in a flower garden Its gay and fragrant flowers with its rambling habit render it peculiarly adapted for such a purpose The wood pea or heath pea is found in the heaths of Scotland and the Highlanders of that country are extremely partial to them and dry and chew them to give a greater relish to their whiskey They also regard them as good against chest complaints and say that by the use of them they are enabled to withstand hunger and thirst for a long time The peas have a sweet taste somewhat like the root of liquorice and when boiled have an agreeable flavour and are nutritive In times of scarcity they have served as an article of food When well boiled a fork will pass through them and slightly dried they are roasted and in Holland and Flanders served up like chestnuts BAKED POTATOES eleven thirty six INGREDIENTS Potatoes Illustration BAKED POTATOES SERVED IN NAPKIN Mode Choose large potatoes as much of a size as possible wash them in lukewarm water and scrub them well for the browned skin of a baked potato is by many persons considered the better part of it Put them into a moderate oven and bake them for about two hours turning them three or four times whilst they are cooking Serve them in a napkin immediately they are done as if kept a long time in the oven they have a shrivelled appearance Potatoes may also be roasted before the fire in an American oven but when thus cooked they must be done very slowly Do not forget to send to table with them a piece of cold butter Time Large potatoes in a hot oven one one two hour to two hours in a cool oven two to two one two hours Average cost fours per bushel Sufficient Allow two to each person Seasonable all the year but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season POTATO SUGAR This sugary substance found in the tubers of potatoes is obtained in the form of syrup or treacle and has not yet been crystallized It resembles the sugar of grapes has a very sweet taste and may be used for making sweetmeats and as a substitute for honey Sixty pounds of potatoes yielding eight pounds of dry starch will produce seven and a half pounds of sugar In Russia it is extensively made as good though of less consistency than the treacle obtained from cane sugar A spirit is also distilled from the tubers which resembles brandy but is milder and has a flavour as if it were charged with the odour of violets or raspberries In France this manufacture is carried on pretty extensively and five hundred pounds of the tubers will produce twelve quarts of spirit the pulp being given to cattle TO BOIL POTATOES eleven thirty seven INGREDIENTS ten or twelve potatoes to each one two gallon of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt Mode Choose potatoes of an equal size pare them take out all the eyes and specks and as they are peeled throw them into cold water Put them into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover them with salt in the above proportion and let them boil gently until tender Ascertain when they are done by thrusting a fork in them and take them up the moment they feel soft through for if they are left in the water afterwards they become waxy or watery Drain away the water put the saucepan by the side of the fire with the lid partially uncovered to allow the steam to escape and let the potatoes get thoroughly dry and do not allow them to get burnt Their superfluous moisture will evaporate and the potatoes if a good sort should be perfectly mealy and dry Potatoes vary so much in quality and size that it is difficult to give the exact time for boiling they should be attentively watched and probed with a fork to ascertain when they are cooked Send them to table quickly and very hot and with an opening in the cover of the dish that a portion of the steam may evaporate and not fall back on the potatoes Time Moderate sized old potatoes fifteen to twenty minutes after the water boils large ones one two hour to thirty five minutes Average cost fours per bushel Sufficient for six persons Seasonable all the year but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season Note To keep potatoes hot after draining the water from them put a folded cloth or flannel kept for the purpose on the top of them keeping the saucepan lid partially uncovered This will absorb the moisture and keep them hot some time without spoiling THE POTATO The potato belongs to the family of the Solanaceae the greater number of which inhabit the tropics and the remainder are distributed over the temperate regions of both hemispheres but do not extend to the arctic and antarctic zones The whole of the family are suspicious a great number are narcotic and many are deleterious The roots partake of the properties of the plants and are sometimes even more active The tubercles of such as produce them are amylaceous and nutritive as in those of the potato The leaves are generally narcotic but they lose this principle in boiling as is the case with the Solanum nigrum which are used as a vegetable when cooked TO BOIL POTATOES IN THEIR JACKETS eleven thirty eight INGREDIENTS ten or twelve potatoes to each one two gallon of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt Mode To obtain this wholesome and delicious vegetable cooked in perfection it should be boiled and sent to table with the skin on In Ireland where perhaps the cooking of potatoes is better understood than in any country they are always served so Wash the potatoes well and if necessary use a clean scrubbing brush to remove the dirt from them and if possible choose the potatoes so that they may all be as nearly the same size as possible When thoroughly cleansed fill the saucepan half full with them and just cover the potatoes with cold water salted in the above proportion they are more quickly boiled with a small quantity of water and besides are more savoury than when drowned in it Bring them to boil then draw the pan to the side of the fire and let them simmer gently until tender Ascertain when they are done by probing them with a fork then pour off the water uncover the saucepan and let the potatoes dry by the side of the fire taking care not to let them burn Peel them quickly put them in a very hot vegetable dish either with or without a napkin and serve very quickly After potatoes are cooked they should never be entirely covered up as the steam instead of escaping falls down on them and makes them watery and insipid In Ireland they are usually served up with the skins on and a small plate is placed by the side of each guest Time Moderate sized potatoes with their skins on twenty to twenty five minutes after the water boils large potatoes twenty five minutes to three four hour or longer five minutes to dry them Average cost fours per bushel Sufficient for six persons Seasonable all the year but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season ANALYSIS OF THE POTATO Next to the cereals the potato is the most valuable plant for the production of human food Its tubers according to analysis conducted by mister Fromberg in the laboratory of the Agricultural Chemical Association in Scotland contain the following ingredients seventy five point fifty two per cent of water fifteen point seventy two starch O fifty five dextrine three point three of impure saccharine matter and three point twenty five of fibre with coagulated albumen In a dried state the tuber contains sixty four point two per cent of starch two point twenty five of dextrine thirteen point forty seven of impure saccharine matter five point seventy seven of caseine gluten and albumen one of fatty matter and thirteen point thirty one of fibre with coagulated albumen TO BOIL NEW POTATOES eleven thirty nine INGREDIENTS Potatoes to each one two gallon of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt Mode Do not have the potatoes dug long before they are dressed as they are never good when they have been out of the ground some time Well wash them rub off the skins with a coarse cloth and put them into boiling water salted in the above proportion Let them boil until tender try them with a fork and when done pour the water away from them let them stand by the side of the fire with the lid of the saucepan partially uncovered and when the potatoes are thoroughly dry put them into a hot vegetable dish with a piece of butter the size of a walnut pile the potatoes over this and serve If the potatoes are too old to have the skins rubbed off boil them in their jackets drain peel and serve them as above with a piece of butter placed in the midst of them Time one four to one two hour according to the size Average cost in full season oned per lb Sufficient Allow three lbs for five or six persons Seasonable in May and June but may be had forced in March POTATO STARCH This fecula has a beautiful white crystalline appearance and is inodorous soft to the touch insoluble in cold but readily soluble in boiling water It is on this starch that the nutritive properties of the tubers depend As an aliment it is well adapted for invalids and persons of delicate constitution It may be used in the form of arrow root and eaten with milk or sugar For pastry of all kinds it is more light and easier of digestion than that made with flour of wheat In confectionery it serves to form creams and jellies and in cookery may be used to thicken soups and sauces It accommodates itself to the chest and stomach of children for whom it is well adapted and it is an aliment that cannot be too generally used as much on account of its wholesomeness as its cheapness and the ease with which it is kept which are equal if not superior to all the much vaunted exotic feculae as salep tapioca sago and arrow root TO STEAM POTATOES eleven forty INGREDIENTS Potatoes boiling water Mode This mode of cooking potatoes is now much in vogue particularly where they are wanted on a large scale it being so very convenient Pare the potatoes throw them into cold water as they are peeled then put them into a steamer Place the steamer over a saucepan of boiling water and steam the potatoes from twenty to forty minutes according to the size and sort When a fork goes easily through them they are done then take them up dish and serve very quickly Time twenty to forty minutes Average cost fours per bushel Sufficient Allow two large potatoes to each person Seasonable all the year but not so good whilst new potatoes are in season USES OF THE POTATO Potatoes boiled and beaten along with sour milk form a sort of cheese which is made in Saxony and when kept in close vessels may be preserved for several years It is generally supposed that the water in which potatoes are boiled is injurious and as instances are recorded where cattle having drunk it were seriously affected it may be well to err on the safe side and avoid its use for any alimentary purpose Potatoes which have been exposed to the air and become green are very unwholesome Cadet de Vaux asserts that potatoes will clean linen as well as soap and it is well known that the berries of the S saponaceum are used in Peru for the same purpose HOW TO USE COLD POTATOES eleven forty one INGREDIENTS The remains of cold potatoes to every lb allow two tablespoonfuls of flour two ditto of minced onions one oz of butter milk Mode Mash

nicely brown which will be in from twenty minutes to one two hour Turn them out of the mould and serve Time twenty minutes to one two hour Seasonable at any time POTATO BREAD The manner in which this is made is very simple The adhesive tendency of the flour of the potato acts against its being baked or kneaded without being mixed with wheaten flour or meal it may however be made into cakes in the following manner A small wooden frame nearly square is laid on a pan like a frying pan and is grooved and so constructed that by means of a presser or lid introduced into the groove the cake is at once fashioned according to the dimensions of the mould The frame containing the farina may be almost immediately withdrawn after the mould is formed upon the pan because from the consistency imparted to the incipient cake by the heat it will speedily admit of being safely handled it must not however be fried too hastily It will then eat very palatably and might from time to time be soaked for puddings like tapioca or might be used like the cassada cake for when well buttered and toasted it will be found an excellent accompaniment to breakfast In Scotland cold boiled potatoes are frequently squeezed up and mixed with flour or oatmeal and an excellent cake or scon obtained FRIED POTATOES French Fashion eleven forty two INGREDIENTS Potatoes hot butter or clarified dripping salt Mode Peel and cut the potatoes into thin slices as nearly the same size as possible make some butter or dripping quite hot in a frying pan put in the potatoes and fry them on both sides of a nice brown When

which will be in from ten to fifteen minutes and serve very hot A laurel leaf simmered with the potatoes is an improvement Time ten to fifteen minutes Seasonable at any time PRESERVING POTATOES In general potatoes are stored or preserved in pits cellars pies or camps but whatever mode is adopted it is essential that the tubers be perfectly dry otherwise they will surely rot and a few rotten potatoes will contaminate a whole mass The pie as it is called consists of a trench lined and covered with straw the potatoes in it being piled in the shape of a house roof to the height of about three feet The camps are shallow pits filled and ridged up in a similar manner covered up with the excavated mould of the pit In Russia and Canada the potato is preserved in boxes in houses or cellars heated when necessary to a temperature one or two degrees above the freezing point by stoves To keep potatoes for a considerable time the best way is to place them in thin layers on a platform suspended in an ice cellar there the temperature being always below that of active vegetation they will not sprout while not being above one or two degrees below the freezing point the tubers will not be frostbitten Another mode is to scoop out the eyes with a very small scoop and keep the roots buried in earth a third mode is to destroy the vital principle by kiln drying steaming or scalding a fourth is to bury them so deep in dry soil that no change of temperature will reach them and thus being without air they will remain upwards of a year without vegetating POTATOES A LA MAITRE D HOTEL

and the remaining ingredients simmer these gently for an hour and let the whole cool in the stewpan When to be served rewarm them and drain them on a clean cloth then arrange them on a delicately white napkin that it may contrast as strongly as possible with the truffles and serve The trimmings of truffles are used to flavour gravies stock sauces c and are an excellent addition to ragouts made dishes of fowl c Time one hour Average cost Not often bought in this country Seasonable from November to March THE TRUFFLE The Truffle belongs to the family of the Mushroom It is certain that the truffle must possess equally with other plants organs of reproduction yet notwithstanding all the efforts of art and science it has been impossible to subject it to a regular culture Truffles grow at a considerable depth under the earth never appearing on the surface They are found in many parts of France those of Perigord Magny are the most esteemed for their odour There are three varieties of the species the black the red and the white the latter are of little value The red are very rare and their use is restricted The black has the highest repute and its consumption is enormous When the peasantry go to gather truffles they take a pig with them to scent out the spot where they grow When that is found the pig turns up the surface with his snout and the men then dig until they find the truffles Good truffles are easily distinguished by their agreeable perfume they should be light in proportion to their size and elastic when pressed by the finger To have them in perfection they should be quite fresh as their aroma is considerably diminished by any conserving process Truffles are stimulating and beating Weak stomachs digest them with difficulty Some of the culinary uses to which they are subjected render them more digestible but they should always be eaten sparingly Their chief use is in seasoning and garnitures In short a professor has said Meats with truffles are the most distinguished dishes that opulence can offer to the epicure The Truffle grows in clusters some inches below the surface of the soil and is of an irregular globular form Those which grow wild in England are about the size of a hen s egg and have no roots As there is nothing to indicate the places where they are dogs have been trained to discriminate their scent by which they are discovered Hogs are very fond of them and frequently lead to their being found from their rutting up the ground in search of them ITALIAN MODE OF DRESSING TRUFFLES eleven sixty three INGREDIENTS ten truffles one four pint of salad oil pepper and salt to taste one tablespoonful of minced parsley a very little finely minced garlic two blades of pounded mace one tablespoonful of lemon juice Mode After cleansing and brushing the truffles cut them into thin slices and put them in a baking dish on a seasoning of oil pepper salt parsley garlic and mace in the above proportion Bake them for nearly an hour and just before serving add the lemon juice and send them to table very hot Time Nearly one hour Average cost Not often bought in this country Seasonable from November to March WHERE TRUFFLES ARE FOUND In this country the common truffle is found on the downs of Hampshire Wiltshire and Kent and they abound in dry light soils and more especially in oak and chestnut forests In France they are plentiful and many are imported from the south of that country and Italy where they are much larger and in greater perfection they lose however much of their flavour by drying Truffles have in England been tried to be propagated artificially but without success TRUFFLES A L ITALIENNE eleven sixty four INGREDIENTS ten truffles one tablespoonful of minced parsley one minced shalot salt and pepper to taste two oz of butter two tablespoonfuls of good brown gravy the juice of one two lemon cayenne to taste Mode Wash the truffles and cut them into slices about the size of a penny piece put them into a saute pan with the parsley shalot salt pepper and one oz of butter stir them over the fire that they may all be equally done which will be in about ten minutes and drain off some of the butter then add a little more fresh butter two tablespoonfuls of good gravy the juice of one two lemon and a little cayenne stir over the fire until the whole is on the point of boiling when serve Time Altogether twenty minutes Average cost Not often bought in this country Seasonable from November to March USES OF THE TRUFFLE Like the Morel truffles are seldom eaten alone but are much used in gravies soups and ragouts They are likewise dried for the winter months and when reduced to powder form a useful culinary ingredient they however have many virtues attributed to them which they do not possess Their wholesomeness is perhaps questionable and they should be eaten with moderation BOILED TURNIPS eleven sixty five INGREDIENTS Turnips to each one two gallon of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt Mode Pare the turnips and should they be very large divide them into quarters but unless this is the case let them be cooked whole Put them into a saucepan of boiling water salted in the above proportion and let them boil gently until tender Try them with a fork and when done take them up in a colander let them thoroughly drain and serve Boiled turnips are usually sent to table with boiled mutton but are infinitely nicer when mashed than served whole unless nice and young they are scarcely worth the trouble of dressing plainly as above Time Old turnips three four to one one four hour young ones about eighteen to twenty minutes Average cost fourd per bunch Sufficient Allow a bunch of twelve turnips for five or six persons Seasonable May be had all the year but in spring only useful for flavouring gravies c Illustration TURNIPS THE TURNIP This vegetable is the Brassica Rapa of science and grows wild in England but cannot be brought exactly to resemble what it becomes in a cultivated state It is said to have been originally introduced from Hanover and forms an excellent culinary vegetable much used all over Europe where it is either eaten alone or mashed and cooked in soups and stews They do not thrive in a hot climate for in India they and many more of our garden vegetables lose their flavour and become comparatively tasteless The Swede is the largest variety but it is too coarse for the table MASHED TURNIPS eleven sixty six INGREDIENTS ten or twelve large turnips to each one two gallon of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt two oz of butter cayenne or white pepper to taste Mode Pare the turnips quarter them and put them into boiling water salted in the above proportion boil them until tender then drain them in a colander and squeeze them as dry as possible by pressing them with the back of a large plate When quite free from water rub the turnips with a wooden spoon through the colander and put them into a very clean saucepan add the butter white pepper or cayenne and if necessary a little salt Keep stirring them over the fire until the butter is well mixed with them and the turnips are thoroughly hot dish and serve A little cream or milk added after the turnips are pressed through the colander is an improvement to both the colour and flavour of this vegetable Time From one two to three four hour to boil the turnips ten minutes to warm them through Average cost fourd per bunch Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable May be had all the year but in spring only good for flavouring gravies VEGETABLES REDUCED TO PUREE Persons in the flower of youth having healthy stomachs and leading active lives may eat all sorts of vegetables without inconvenience save of course in excess The digestive functions possess great energy during the period of youth the body to develop itself needs nourishment Physical exercise gives an appetite which it is necessary to satisfy and vegetables cannot resist the vigorous action of the gastric organs As old proverb says At twenty one can digest iron But for aged persons the sedentary or the delicate it is quite otherwise Then the gastric power has considerably diminished the digestive organs have lost their energy the process of digestion is consequently slower and the least excess at table is followed by derangement of the stomach for several days Those who generally digest vegetables with difficulty should eat them reduced to a pulp or puree that is to say with their skins and tough fibres removed Subjected to this process vegetables which when entire would create flatulence and wind are then comparatively harmless Experience has established the rule that nourishment is not complete without the alliance of meat with vegetables We would also add that the regime most favourable to health is found in variety variety pleases the senses monotony is disagreeable The eye is fatigued by looking always on one object the ear by listening to one sound and the palate by tasting one flavour It is the same with the stomach consequently variety of food is one of the essentials for securing good digestion GERMAN MODE OF COOKING TURNIPS eleven sixty seven INGREDIENTS eight large turnips three oz of butter pepper and salt to taste rather more than one two pint of weak stock or broth one tablespoonful of flour Mode Make the butter hot in a stewpan lay in the turnips after having pared and cut them into dice and season them with pepper and salt Toss them over the fire for a few minutes then add the broth and simmer the whole gently till the turnips are tender Brown the above proportion of flour with a little butter add this to the turnips let them simmer another five minutes and serve Boiled mutton is usually sent to table with this vegetable and may be cooked with the turnips by placing it in the midst of them the meat would then be very delicious as there being so little liquid with the turnips it would almost be steamed and consequently very tender Time twenty minutes Average cost fourd per bunch Sufficient for four persons Seasonable May be had all the year TURNIPS Good turnips are delicate in texture firm and sweet The best sorts contain a sweet juicy mucilage uniting with the aroma a slightly acid quality which is completely neutralized in cooking The turnip is prepared in a variety of ways Ducks stuffed with turnips have been highly appreciated It is useful in the regimen of persons afflicted with chronic visceral irritations The turnip only creates flatulency when it is soft porous and stringy It is then consequently bad TURNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE An Entremets or to be served with the Second Course as a Side dish eleven sixty eight INGREDIENTS seven or eight turnips one oz of butter one two pint of white sauce No five hundred thirty eight or five hundred thirty nine Mode Peel and cut the turnips in the shape of pears or marbles boil them in salt and water to which has been added a little butter until tender then take them out drain arrange them on a dish and pour over the white sauce made by recipe No five hundred thirty eight or five hundred thirty nine and to which has been added a small lump of sugar In winter when other vegetables are scarce this will be found a very good and pretty looking dish when approved a little mustard may be added to the sauce Time About three four hour to boil the turnips Average cost fourd per bunch Sufficient for one side dish Seasonable in winter THE FRENCH NAVET This is a variety of the turnip but instead of being globular has more the shape of the carrot Its flavour being excellent it is much esteemed on the Continent for soups and made dishes Two or three of them will impart as much flavour as a dozen of the common turnips will Accordingly when stewed in gravy they are greatly relished This flavour resides in the rind which is not cut off but scraped This variety was once grown in England but now it is rarely found in our gardens though highly deserving of a place there It is of a yellowish white colour and is sometimes imported to the London market BOILED TURNIP GREENS eleven sixty nine INGREDIENTS To each one two gallon of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt turnip greens Mode Wash the greens well in two or three waters and pick off all the decayed and dead leaves tie them in small bunches and put them into plenty of boiling water salted in the above proportion Keep them boiling quickly with the lid of the saucepan uncovered and when tender pour them into a colander let them drain arrange them in a vegetable dish remove the string that the greens were tied with and serve Time fifteen to twenty minutes Average cost fourd for a dish for three persons Seasonable in March April and May CABBAGE TURNIP TOPS AND GREENS All the cabbage tribe which comprises coleworts brocoli cauliflower sprouts and turnip tops in order to be delicate should be dressed young when they have a rapid growth but if they have stood the summer in order to be tender they should be allowed to have a touch of frost The cabbage contains much vegetable albumen and several parts sulphur and nitrate of potass Cabbage is heavy and a long time digesting which has led to a belief that it is very nourishing It is only fit food for robust and active persons the sedentary or delicate should carefully avoid it Cabbage may be prepared in a variety of ways it serves as a garniture to several recherche dishes partridge and cabbage for example Bacon and cabbage is a very favourite dish but only a good stomach can digest it BOILED VEGETABLE MARROW eleven seventy INGREDIENTS To each one two gallon of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt vegetable marrows Illustration VEGETABLE MARROW ON TOAST Mode Have ready a saucepan of boiling water salted in the above proportion put in the marrows after peeling them and boil them until quite tender Take them up with a slice halve and should they be very large quarter them Dish them on toast and send to table with them a tureen of melted butter or in lieu of this a small pat of salt butter Large vegetable marrows may be preserved throughout the winter by storing them in a dry place when wanted for use a few slices should be cut and boiled in the same manner as above but when once begun the marrow must be eaten quickly as it keeps but a short time after it is cut Vegetable marrows are also very delicious mashed they should be boiled then drained and mashed smoothly with a wooden spoon Heat them in a saucepan add a seasoning of salt and pepper and a small piece of butter and dish with a few sippets of toasted bread placed round as a garnish Time Young vegetable marrows ten to twenty minutes old ones one two to three four hour Average cost in full season ones per dozen Sufficient Allow one moderate sized marrow for each person Seasonable in July August and September but may be preserved all the winter FRIED VEGETABLE MARROW eleven seventy one INGREDIENTS three medium sized vegetable marrows egg and bread crumbs hot lard Mode Peel and boil the marrows until tender in salt and water then drain them and cut them in quarters and take out the seeds When thoroughly drained brush the marrows over with egg and sprinkle with bread crumbs have ready some hot lard fry the marrow in this and when of a nice brown dish sprinkle over a little salt and pepper and serve Time About one two hour to boil the marrow seven minutes to fry it Average cost in full season ones per dozen Sufficient for four persons Seasonable in July August and September Illustration VEGETABLE MARROW THE VEGETABLE MARROW This vegetable is now extensively used and belongs to the Cucurbits It is the C ovifera of science and like the melon gourd cucumber and squash is widely diffused in the tropical or warmer regions of the globe Of the nature of this family we have already spoken when treating of the cucumber CUT VEGETABLES FOR SOUPS c Illustration VEGETABLE CUTTER eleven seventy two The annexed engraving represents a cutter for shaping vegetables for soups ragouts stews c carrots and turnips being the usual vegetables for which this utensil is used Cut the vegetables into slices about one four inch in thickness stamp them out with the cutter and boil them for a few minutes in salt and water until tender Turnips should be cut in rather thicker slices than carrots on account of the former boiling more quickly to a pulp than the latter CARROTS Several species of carrots are cultivated the red the yellow and the which Those known as the Crecy carrots are considered the best and are very sweet The carrot has been classed by hygienists among flatulent vegetables and as difficult of digestion When the root becomes old it is almost as hard as wood but the young carrot which has not reached its full growth is tender relishing nutritious and digests well when properly cooked VEGETABLE MARROWS IN WHITE SAUCE eleven seventy three INGREDIENTS four or five moderate sized marrows one two pint of white sauce No five hundred thirty nine Illustration VEGETABLE MARROW IN WHITE SAUCE Mode Pare the marrows cut them in halves and shape each half at the top in a point leaving the bottom end flat for it to stand upright in the dish Boil the marrows in salt and water until tender take them up very carefully and arrange them on a hot dish Have ready one two pint of white sauce made by recipe No five hundred thirty nine pour this over the marrows and serve Time From fifteen to twenty minutes to boil the marrows Average cost in full season ones per dozen Sufficient for five or six persons Seasonable in July August and September BOILED INDIAN WHEAT or MAIZE eleven seventy four INGREDIENTS The ears of young and green Indian wheat to every one two gallon of water allow one heaped tablespoonful of salt Mode This vegetable which makes one of the most delicious dishes brought to table is unfortunately very rarely seen in Britain and we wonder that in the gardens of the wealthy it is not invariably cultivated Our sun it is true possesses hardly power sufficient to ripen maize but with well prepared ground and in a favourable position it might be sufficiently advanced by the beginning of autumn to serve as a vegetable The outside sheath being taken off and the waving fibres removed let the ears be placed in boiling water where they should remain for about twenty five minutes a longer time may be necessary for larger ears than ordinary and when sufficiently boiled and well drained they may be sent to table whole and with a piece of toast underneath them Melted butter should be served with them Time twenty five to thirty five minutes Average cost Seldom bought Sufficient one ear for each person Seasonable in autumn Note William Cobbett the English radical writer and politician was a great cultivator and admirer of maize and constantly ate it as a vegetable boiled We believe he printed a special recipe for it but we have been unable to lay our hands on it mister Buchanan the present president of the United States was in the habit when ambassador here of receiving a supply of Indian corn from America in hermetically sealed cases and the publisher of this work remembers with considerable satisfaction his introduction to a dish of this vegetable when in America He found it to combine the excellences of the young green pea and the finest asparagus but he felt at first slightly awkward in holding the large ear with one hand whilst the other had to be employed in cutting off with a knife the delicate green grains Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XXVI GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PUDDINGS AND PASTRY eleven seventy five PUDDINGS AND PASTRY familiar as they may be and unimportant as they may be held in the estimation of some are yet intimately connected with the development of agricultural resources in reference to the cereal grasses When they began to be made is uncertain but we may safely presume that a simple form of pudding was amongst the first dishes made after discovering a mode of grinding wheat into flour Traditional history enables us to trace man back to the time of the Deluge After that event he seems to have recovered himself in the central parts of Asia and to have first risen to eminence in the arts of civilization on the banks of the Nile From this region Greece Carthage and some other parts along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea were colonized In process of time Greece gave to the Romans the arts which she had thus received from Egypt and these subsequently diffused them over Europe How these were carried to or developed in India and China is not so well ascertained and in America their ancient existence rests only on very indistinct traditions As to who was the real discoverer of the use of corn we have no authentic knowledge The traditions of different countries ascribe it to various fabulous personages whose names it is here unnecessary to introduce In Egypt however corn must have grown abundantly for Abraham and after him Jacob had recourse to that country for supplies during times of famine eleven seventy six THE HABITS OF A PEOPLE to a great extent are formed by the climate in which they live and by the native or cultivated productions in which their country abounds Thus we find that the agricultural produce of the ancient Egyptians is pretty much the same as that of the present day and the habits of the people are not materially altered In Greece the products cultivated in antiquity were the same kinds of grains and legumes as are cultivated at present with the vine the fig the olive the apple and other fruits So with the Romans and so with other nations As to the different modes of artificially preparing those to please the taste it is only necessary to say that they arise from the universal desire of novelty characteristic of man in the development of his social conditions Thus has arisen the whole science of cookery and thus arose the art of making puddings The porridge of the Scotch is nothing more than a species of hasty pudding composed of oatmeal salt and water and the red pottage for which Esau sold his birthright must have been something similar The barley gruel of the Lacedaemonians of the Athenian gladiators and common people was the same with the exception of the slight seasoning it had beyond the simplicity of Scottish fare Here is the ancient recipe for the Athenian national dish Dry near the fire in the oven twenty pounds of barley flour then parch it add three pounds of linseed meal half a pound of coriander seed two ounces of salt and the quantity of water necessary To this sometimes a little millet was added in order to give the paste greater cohesion and delicacy eleven seventy seven OATMEAL AMONGST THE GREEKS AND ROMANS was highly esteemed as was also rice which they considered as beneficial to the chest They also held in high repute the Irion or Indian wheat of the moderns The flour of this cereal was made into a kind of hasty pudding and parched or roasted as eaten with a little salt The Spelt or Red wheat was likewise esteemed and its flour formed the basis of the Carthaginian pudding for which we here give the scientific recipe Put a pound of red wheat flour into water and when it has steeped some time transfer it to a wooden bowl Add three pounds of cream cheese half a pound of honey and one egg Beat the whole together and cook it on a slow fire in a stewpan Should this be considered unpalatable another form has been recommended Sift the flour and with some water put it into a wooden vessel and for ten days renew the water twice each day At the end of that period press out the water and place the paste in another vessel It is now to be reduced to the consistence of thick lees and passed through a piece of new linen Repeat this last operation then dry the mass in the sun and boil it in milk Season according to taste These are specimens of the puddings of antiquity and this last recipe was held in especial favour by the Romans eleven seventy eight HOWEVER GREAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE QUALIFICATIONS of the ancients however in the art of pudding making we apprehend that such preparations as gave gratification to their palates would have generally found little favour amongst the insulated inhabitants of Great Britain Here from the simple suet dumpling up to the most complicated Christmas production the grand feature of substantiality is primarily attended to Variety in the ingredients we think is held only of secondary consideration with the great body of the people provided that the whole is agreeable and of sufficient abundance eleven seventy nine ALTHOUGH FROM PUDDINGS TO PASTRY is but a step it requires a higher degree of art to make the one than to make the other Indeed pastry is one of the most important branches of the culinary science It unceasingly occupies itself with ministering pleasure to the sight as well as to the taste with erecting graceful monuments miniature fortresses and all kinds of architectural imitations composed of the sweetest and most agreeable products of all climates and countries At a very early period the Orientals were acquainted with the art of manipulating in pastry but they by no means attained to the taste variety and splendour of design by which it is characterized amongst the moderns At first it generally consisted of certain mixtures of flour oil and honey to which it was confined for centuries even among the southern nations of the European continent At the commencement of the middle ages a change began to take place in the art of mixing it Eggs butter and salt came into repute in the making of paste which was forthwith used as an inclosure for meat seasoned with spices This advance attained the next step was to inclose cream fruit and marmalades and the next to build pyramids and castles when the summit of the art of the pastry cook may be supposed to have been achieved DIRECTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MAKING OF PUDDINGS AND PASTRY eleven eighty A few general remarks respecting the various ingredients of which puddings and pastry are composed may be acceptable as preliminary to the recipes in this department of Household Management eleven eighty one Flour should be of the best quality and perfectly dry and sifted before being used if in the least damp the paste made from it will certainly be heavy eleven eighty two Butter unless fresh is used should be washed from the salt and well squeezed and wrung in a cloth to get out all the water and buttermilk which if left in assists to make the paste heavy eleven eighty three Lard should be perfectly sweet which may be ascertained by cutting the bladder through and if the knife smells sweet the lard is good eleven eighty four Suet should be finely chopped perfectly free from skin and quite sweet during the process of chopping it should be lightly dredged with flour which prevents the pieces from sticking together Beef suet is considered the best but veal suet or the outside fat of a loin or neck of mutton makes good crusts as also the skimmings in which a joint of mutton has been boiled but without vegetables eleven eighty five Clarified Beef Dripping directions for which will be found in recipes Nos six hundred twenty one and six hundred twenty two answers very well for kitchen pies puddings cakes or for family use A very good short crust may be made by mixing with it a small quantity of moist sugar but care must be taken to use the dripping sparingly or a very disagreeable flavour will be imparted to the paste eleven eighty six Strict cleanliness must be observed in pastry making all the utensils used should be perfectly free from dust and dirt and the things required for pastry kept entirely for that purpose Illustration PASTE BOARD AND ROLLING PIN eleven eighty seven In mixing paste add the water very gradually work the whole together with the knife blade and knead it until perfectly smooth Those who are inexperienced in pastry making should work the butter in by breaking it in small pieces and covering the paste rolled out It should then be dredged with flour and the ends folded over and rolled out very thin again this process must be repeated until all the butter is used Illustration PASTE PINCERS AND JAGGER FOR ORNAMENTING THE EDGES OF PIE CRUSTS eleven eighty eight The art of making paste requires much practice dexterity and skill it should be touched as lightly as possible made with cool hands and in a cool place a marble slab is better than a board for the purpose and the coolest part of the house should be selected for the process during warm weather eleven eighty nine To insure rich paste being light great expedition must be used in the making and baking for if it stand long before it is put in the oven it becomes flat and heavy Illustration PASTE CUTTER AND CORNER CUTTER Illustration ORNAMENTAL PASTE CUTTER eleven ninety Puff paste requires a brisk oven but not too hot or it would blacken the crust on the other hand if the oven be too slack the paste will be soddened and will not rise nor will it have any colour Tart tins cake moulds dishes for baked puddings pattypans c should all be buttered before the article intended to be baked is put in them things to be baked on sheets should be placed on buttered paper Raised pie paste should have a soaking heat and paste glazed must have rather a slack oven that the icing be not scorched It is better to ice tarts c when they are three parts baked Illustration PATTY PANS PLAIN AND FLUTED Illustration PIE DISH Illustration RAISED PIE MOULD Illustration RAISED PIE MOULD OPEN eleven ninety one To ascertain when the oven is heated to the proper degree for puff paste put a small piece of the paste in previous to baking the whole and then the heat can thus be judged of eleven ninety two The freshness of all pudding ingredients is of much importance as one bad article will taint the whole mixture eleven ninety three When the freshness of eggs is doubtful break each one separately in a cup before mixing them altogether Should there be a bad one amongst them it can be thrown away whereas if mixed with the good ones the entire quantity would be spoiled The yolks and whites beaten separately make the articles they are put into much lighter eleven ninety four Raisins and dried fruits for puddings should be carefully picked and in many cases stoned Currants should be well washed pressed in a cloth and placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly dry they should then be picked carefully over and every piece of grit or stone removed from amongst them To plump them some cooks pour boiling water over them and then dry them before the fire eleven ninety five Batter pudding should be smoothly mixed and free from lumps To insure this first mix the flour with a very small proportion of milk and add the remainder by degrees Should the pudding be very lumpy it may be strained through a hair sieve eleven ninety six All boiled puddings should be put on in boiling water which must not be allowed to stop simmering and the pudding must always be covered with the water if requisite the saucepan should be kept filled up Illustration BOILED PUDDING MOULD eleven ninety seven To prevent a pudding boiled in a cloth from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan place a small plate or saucer underneath it and set the pan on a trivet over the fire If a mould is used this precaution is not necessary but care must be taken to keep the pudding well covered with water eleven ninety eight For dishing a boiled pudding as soon as it comes out of the pot dip it into a basin of cold water and the cloth will then not adhere to it Great expedition is necessary in sending puddings to table as by standing they quickly become heavy batter puddings particularly Illustration BOILED PUDDING MOULD eleven ninety nine For baked or boiled puddings the moulds cups or basins should be always buttered before the mixture is put in them and they should be put into the saucepan directly they are filled twelve hundred Scrupulous attention should be paid to the cleanliness of pudding cloths as from neglect in this particular the outsides of boiled puddings frequently taste very disagreeably As soon as possible after it is taken off the pudding it should be soaked in water and then well washed without soap unless it be very greasy It should be dried out of doors then folded up and kept in a dry place When wanted for use dip it in boiling water and dredge it slightly with flour Illustration PUDDING BASIN twelve oh one The dry ingredients for puddings are better for being mixed some time before they are wanted the liquid portion should only be added just before the pudding is put into the saucepan twelve oh two A pinch of salt is an improvement to the generality of puddings but this ingredient should be added very sparingly as the flavour should not be detected twelve oh three When baked puddings are sufficiently solid turn them out of the dish they were baked in bottom uppermost and strew over them fine sifted sugar twelve oh four When pastry or baked puddings are not done through and yet the outside is sufficiently brown cover them over with a piece of white paper until thoroughly cooked this prevents them from getting burnt Illustration RECIPES CHAPTER XXVII VERY GOOD PUFF PASTE twelve oh five INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow one lb of butter and not quite one two pint of water Mode Carefully weigh the flour and butter and have the exact proportion squeeze the butter well to extract the water from it and afterwards wring it in a clean cloth that no moisture may remain Sift the flour see that it is perfectly dry and proceed in the following manner to make the paste using a very clean paste board and rolling pin Supposing the quantity to be one lb of flour work the whole into a smooth paste with not quite one two pint of water using a knife to mix it with the proportion of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the discretion of the cook if too much be added the paste when baked will be tough Roll it out until it is of an equal thickness of about an inch break four oz of the butter into small pieces place these on the paste sift over it a little flour fold it over roll out again and put another four oz of butter Repeat the rolling and buttering until the paste has been rolled out four times or equal quantities of flour and butter have been used Do not omit every time the paste is rolled out to dredge a little flour over that and the rolling pin to prevent both from sticking Handle the paste as lightly as possible and do not press heavily upon it with the rolling pin The next thing to be considered is the oven as the baking of pastry requires particular attention Do not put it into the oven until it is sufficiently hot to raise the paste for the best prepared paste if not properly baked will be good for nothing Brushing the paste as often as rolled out and the pieces of butter placed thereon with the white of an egg assists it to rise in leaves or flakes As this is the great beauty of puff paste it is as well to try this method Average cost ones fourd per lb BUTTER About the second century of the Christian era butter was placed by Galen amongst the useful medical agents and about a century before him Dioscorides mentioned that he had noticed that fresh butter made of ewes and goats milk was served at meals instead of oil and that it took the place of fat in making pastry Thus we have undoubted authority that eighteen hundred years ago there existed a knowledge of the useful qualities of butter The Romans seem to have set about making it much as we do for Pliny tells us Butter is made from milk and the use of this element so much sought after by barbarous nations distinguished the rich from the common people It is obtained principally from cows milk that from ewes is the fattest goats also supply some It is produced by agitating the milk in long vessels with narrow openings a little water is added MEDIUM PUFF PASTE twelve oh six INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow eight oz of butter four oz of lard not quite one two pint of water Mode This paste may be made by the directions in the preceding recipe only using less butter and substituting lard for a portion of it Mix the flour to a smooth paste with not quite one two pint of water then roll it out three times the first time covering the paste with butter the second with lard and the third with butter Keep the rolling pin and paste slightly dredged with flour to prevent them from sticking and it will be ready for use Average cost ones per lb BUTTER IN HASTE In his History of Food Soyer says that to obtain butter instantly it is only necessary in summer to put new milk into a bottle some hours after it has been taken from the cow and shake it briskly The clots which are thus formed should be thrown into a sieve washed and pressed together and they constitute the finest and most delicate butter that can possibly be made COMMON PASTE for Family Pies twelve oh seven INGREDIENTS one one four lb of flour one two lb of butter rather more than one two pint of water Mode Rub the butter lightly into the flour and mix it to a smooth paste with the water roll it out two or three times and it will be ready for use This paste may be converted into an excellent short crust for sweet tart by adding to the flour after the butter is rubbed in two tablespoonfuls of fine sifted sugar Average cost eightd per lb TO KEEP BUTTER FRESH One of the best means to preserve butter fresh is first to completely press out all the buttermilk then to keep it under water renewing the water frequently and to remove it from the influence of heat and air by wrapping it in a wet cloth FRENCH PUFF PASTE or FEUILLETAGE Founded on M Ude s Recipe twelve oh eight INGREDIENTS Equal quantities of flour and butter say one lb of each one two saltspoonful of salt the yolks of two eggs rather more than one four pint of water Mode Weigh the flour ascertain that it is perfectly dry and sift it squeeze all the water from the butter and wring it in a clean cloth till there is no moisture remaining Put the flour on the paste board work lightly into it two oz of the butter and then make a hole in the centre into this well put the yolks of two eggs the salt and about one four pint of water the quantity of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the cook as it is impossible to give the exact proportion of it knead up the paste quickly and lightly and when quite smooth roll it out square to the thickness of about one two inch Presuming that the butter is perfectly free from moisture and as cool as possible roll it into a ball and place this ball of butter on the paste fold the paste over the butter all round and secure it by wrapping it well all over Flatten the paste by rolling it lightly with the rolling pin until it is quite thin but not thin enough to allow the butter to break through and keep the board and paste dredged lightly with flour during the process of making it This rolling gives it the first turn Now fold the paste in three and roll out again and should the weather be very warm put it in a cold place on the ground to cool between the several turns for unless this is particularly attended to the paste will be spoiled Roll out the paste again twice put it by to cool then roll it out twice more which will make six turnings in all Now fold the paste in two and it will be ready for use If properly baked and well made this crust will be delicious and should rise in the oven about five or six inches The paste should be made rather firm in the first instance as the ball of butter is liable to break through Great attention must also be paid to keeping the butter very cool as if this is in a liquid and soft state the paste will not answer at all Should the cook be dexterous enough to succeed in making this the paste will have a much better appearance than that made by the process of dividing the butter into four parts and placing it over the rolled out paste but until experience has been acquired we recommend puff paste made by recipe No twelve oh five The above paste is used for vols au vent small articles of pastry and in fact everything that requires very light crust Average cost ones sixd per lb WHAT TO DO WITH RANCID BUTTER When butter has become very rancid it should be melted several times by a moderate heat with or without the addition of water and as soon as it has been well kneaded after the cooling in order to extract any water it may have retained it should be put into brown freestone pots sheltered from the contact of the air The French often add to it after it has been melted a piece of toasted bread which helps to destroy the tendency of the batter to rancidity SOYER S RECIPE FOR PUFF PASTE twelve oh nine INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow the yolk of one egg the juice of one lemon one two saltspoonful of salt cold water one lb of fresh butter Mode Put the flour on to the paste board make a hole in the centre into which put the yolk of the egg the lemon juice and salt mix the whole with cold water this should be iced in summer if convenient into a soft flexible paste with the right hand and handle it as little as possible then squeeze all the buttermilk from the butter wring it in a cloth and roll out the paste place the butter on this and fold the edges of the paste over so as to hide it roll it out again to the thickness of one four inch fold over one third over which again pass the rolling pin then fold over the other third thus forming a square place it with the ends top and bottom before you shaking a little flour both under and over and repeat the rolls and turns twice again as before Flour a baking sheet put the paste on this and let it remain on ice or in some cool place for one two hour then roll twice more turning it as before place it again upon the ice for one four hour give it two more rolls making seven in all and it is ready for use when required Average cost ones sixd per lb VERY GOOD SHORT CRUST FOR FRUIT TARTS twelve ten INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow three four lb of butter one tablespoonful of sifted sugar one three pint of water Mode Rub the butter into the flour after having ascertained that the latter is perfectly dry add the sugar and mix the whole into a stiff paste with about one three pint of water Roll it out two or three times folding the paste over each time and it will be ready for use Average cost ones oned per lb ANOTHER GOOD SHORT CRUST twelve eleven INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow eight oz of butter the yolks of two eggs two oz of sifted sugar about one four pint of milk Mode Rub the butter into the flour add the sugar and mix the whole as lightly as possible to a smooth paste with the yolks of eggs well beaten and the milk The proportion of the latter ingredient must be judged of by the size of the eggs if these are large so much will not be required and more if the eggs are smaller Average cost ones per lb SUGAR AND BEETROOT There are two sorts of Beet white and red occasionally in the south a yellow variety is met with Beetroot contains twenty parts sugar Everybody knows that the beet has competed with the sugar cane and a great part of the French sugar is manufactured from beet Beetroot has a refreshing composing and slightly purgative quality The young leaves when cooked are a substitute for spinach they are also useful for mixing with sorrel to lessen its acidity The large ribs of the leaves are serviceable in various culinary preparations the root also may be prepared in several ways but its most general use is in salad Some writers upon the subject have expressed their opinion that beetroot is easily digested but those who have taken pains to carefully analyze its qualities make quite a contrary statement Youth of course can digest it but to persons of a certain age beet is very indigestible or rather it does not digest at all It is not the sugary pulp which is indigestible but its fibrous network that resists the action of the gastric organs Thus when the root is reduced to a puree almost any person may eat it FRENCH SUGAR It had long been thought that tropical heat was not necessary to form sugar and about seventeen forty it was discovered that many plants of the temperate zone and amongst others the beet contained it Towards the beginning of the nineteenth century circumstances having in France made sugar scarce and consequently dear the government caused inquiries to be instituted as to the possibility of finding a substitute for it Accordingly it was ascertained that sugar exists in the whole vegetable kingdom that it is to be found in the grape chestnut potato but that far above all the beet contains it in a large proportion Thus the beet became an object of the most careful culture and many experiments went to prove that in this respect the old world was independent of the new Many manufactories came into existence in all parts of France and the making of sugar became naturalized in that country COMMON SHORT CRUST twelve twelve INGREDIENTS To every pound of flour allow two oz of sifted sugar three oz of butter about one two pint of boiling milk Mode Crumble the butter into the flour as finely as possible add the sugar and work the whole up to a smooth paste with the boiling milk Roll it out thin and bake in a moderate oven Average cost sixd per lb QUALITIES OF SUGAR Sugars obtained from various plants are in fact of the same nature and have no intrinsic difference when they have become equally purified by the same processes Taste crystallization colour weight are absolutely identical and the most accurate observer cannot distinguish the one from the other BUTTER CRUST for Boiled Puddings twelve thirteen INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow six oz of butter one two pint of water Mode With a knife work the flour to a smooth paste with one two pint of water roll the crust out rather thin place the butter over it in small pieces dredge lightly over it some flour and fold the paste over repeat the rolling once more and the crust will be ready for use It may be enriched by adding another two oz of butter but for ordinary purposes the above quantity will be found quite sufficient Average cost sixd per lb DRIPPING CRUST for Kitchen Puddings Pies c twelve fourteen INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow six oz of clarified beef dripping one two pint of water Mode After having clarified the dripping by either of the recipes No six hundred twenty one or six hundred twenty two weigh it and to every lb of flour allow the above proportion of dripping With a knife work the flour into a smooth paste with the water rolling it out three times each time placing on the crust two oz of the dripping broken into small pieces If this paste is lightly made if good dripping is used and not too much of it it will be found good and by the addition of two tablespoonfuls of fine moist sugar it may be converted into a common short crust for fruit pies Average cost fourd per pound WATER WHAT THE ANCIENTS THOUGHT OF IT All the nations of antiquity possessed great veneration for water thus the Egyptians offered prayers and homage to water and the Nile was an especial object of their adoration the Persians would not wash their hands the Scythians honoured the Danube the Greeks and Romans erected altars to the fountains and rivers and some of the architectural embellishments executed for fountains in Greece were remarkable for their beauty and delicacy The purity of the water was a great object of the care of the ancients and we learn that the Athenians appointed four officers to keep watch and ward over the water in their city These men had to keep the fountains in order and clean the reservoirs so that the water might be preserved pure and limpid Like officers were appointed in other Greek cities SUET CRUST for Pies or Puddings twelve fifteen INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow five or six oz of beef suet one two pint of water Mode Free the suet from skin and shreds chop it extremely fine and rub it well into the flour work the whole to a smooth paste with the above proportion of water roll it out and it is ready for use This crust is quite rich enough for ordinary purposes but when a better one is desired use from one two to three four lb of suet to every lb of flour Some cooks for rich crusts pound the suet in a mortar with a small quantity of butter It should then be laid on the paste in small pieces the same as for puff crust and will be found exceedingly nice for hot tarts five oz of suet to every lb of flour will make a very good crust and even one four lb will answer very well for children or where the crust is wanted very plain Average cost fived per lb PATE BRISEE or FRENCH CRUST for Raised Pies twelve sixteen INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow one two saltspoonful of salt two eggs one three pint of water six oz of butter Mode Spread the flour which should be sifted and thoroughly dry on the paste board make a hole in the centre into which put the butter work it lightly into the flour and when quite fine add the salt work the whole into a smooth paste with the eggs yolks and whites and water and make it very firm Knead the paste well and let it be rather stiff that the sides of the pie may be easily raised and that they do not afterwards tumble or shrink Average cost ones per lb Note This paste may be very much enriched by making it with equal quantities of flour and butter but then it is not so easily raised as when made plainer WATER SUPPLY IN ROME Nothing in Italy is more extraordinary than the remains of the ancient aqueducts At first the Romans were contented with the water from the Tiber Ancus Martius was the first to commence the building of aqueducts destined to convey the water of the fountain of Piconia from Tibur to Rome a distance of some thirty three thousand paces Appius Claudius continued the good work and to him is due the completion of the celebrated Appian Way In time the gigantic waterways greatly multiplied and by the reign of Nero there were constructed nine principal aqueducts the pipes of which were of bricks baked tiles stone lead or wood According to the calculation of Vigenerus half a million hogsheads of water were conveyed into Rome every day by upwards of ten thousand small pipes not one third of an inch in diameter The water was received in large closed basins above which rose splendid monuments these basins supplied other subterranean conduits connected with various quarters of the city and these conveyed water to small reservoirs furnished with taps for the exclusive use of certain streets The water which was not drinkable ran out by means of large pipes into extensive inclosures where it served to water cattle At these places the people wished their linen and here too was a supply of the necessary element in case of fire COMMON CRUST FOR RAISED PIES twelve seventeen INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow one two pint of water one one two oz of butter one one two oz of lard one two saltspoonful of salt Mode Put into a saucepan the water when it boils add the butter and lard and when these are melted make a hole in the middle of the flour pour in the water gradually beat it well with a wooden spoon and be particular in not making the paste too soft When it is well mixed knead it with the hands until quite stiff dredging a little flour over the paste and board to prevent them from sticking When it is well kneaded place it before the fire with a cloth covered over it for a few minutes it will then be more easily worked into shape This paste does not taste so nicely as the preceding one but is worked with greater facility and answers just as well for raised pies for the crust is seldom eaten Average cost fived per lb LARD OR FLEAD CRUST twelve eighteen INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow one two lb of lard or flead one two pint

proportion of water fold the paste over two or three times beat it well with the rolling pin roll it out and it will be ready for use The crust made from this will be found extremely light and may be made into cakes or tarts it may also be very much enriched by adding more flead to the same proportion of flour Average cost eightd per lb NUTRITIOUS QUALITIES OF FLOUR The gluten of grain and the albumen of vegetable juices are identical in composition with the albumen of blood Vegetable caseine has also the composition of animal caseine The finest wheat flour contains more starch than the coarser the bran of wheat is proportionably richer in gluten Rye and rye bread contain a substance resembling starch gum or dextrine as it is called in its properties which is very easily converted into sugar The starch of barley approaches in many properties to cellulose and is therefore less digestible Oats are particularly rich in plastic substances Scotch oats are richer than those grown in England or in Germany This kind of grain contains in its ashes after deduction of the silica of the husks very nearly the same ingredients as are found in the ashes of the juice of flesh Fine American flour is one of the varieties which is richest in gluten and is consequently one of the most nutritious ALMOND CHEESECAKES twelve nineteen INGREDIENTS one four lb of sweet almonds four bitter ones

distinguished in commerce by the names of Jordan and Valentia almonds The former are imported from Malaga and are longer narrower more pointed and more highly esteemed than the latter which are imported from Valentia Bitter almonds are principally obtained from Morocco and are exported from Mogador ALMOND PASTE for Second Course Dishes twelve twenty INGREDIENTS one lb of sweet almonds six

Seasonable at any time BITTER ALMONDS The Bitter Almond is a variety of the common almond and is injurious to animal life on account of the great quantity of hydrocyanic acid it contains and is consequently seldom used in domestic economy unless it be to give flavour to confectionery and even then it should he used with great caution A single drop of the essential oil of bitter almonds is sufficient to destroy a bird and four drops have caused the death of a middle sized dog BAKED ALMOND PUDDING Very rich twelve twenty one INGREDIENTS one four lb of almonds four bitter ditto one glass

or ripe state and as an article in the dessert Into cookery confectionery perfumery and medicine they largely enter and in domestic economy should always be used in preference to bitter almonds The reason for advising this is because the kernels do not contain any hydrocyanic or prussic acid although it is found in the leaves flowers and bark of the tree When young and green they are preserved in sugar like green apricots They furnish the almond oil and the farinaceous matter which is left after the oil is expressed forms the pate d amandes of perfumers In the arts the oil is employed for the same purposes as the olive oil and forms the basis of kalydor macassar oil Gowland s lotion and many other articles of that kind vended by perfumers In medicine it is considered a nutritive

extensively cultivated and in England both as regards variety and quantity it is excellent and abundant Immense supplies are also imported from the United States and from France The apples grown in

valuable remedy in obstructions of the bowels and in febrile complaints it is useful on account of its readily quenching thirst and for its cooling effect on the stomach White and flesh coloured currants have with the exception of the fullness of flavour in every respect the same qualities as the red species Both white and red currants are pleasant additions to the dessert but the black

fruit So great is the increase in the demand for the orange and so ample the supply that it promises to rival the apple in its popularity The orange tree is considered young at the age of a hundred years The pulp of the orange consists of a collection of oblong vesicles filled with a sugary and refreshing juice The orange blossom is proverbially chosen for the bridal wreath and from the same

Illustration RAISIN GRAPE RAISIN GRAPE All the kinds of raisins have much the same virtues they are nutritive and balsamic but they are very subject to fermentation with juices of any kind and hence when eaten immoderately they often bring on colics There are many varieties of grape used for raisins the fruit of Valencia is that mostly dried for culinary purposes whilst most of the table kinds are grown in Malaga and called Muscatels The finest of all table raisins come from Provence or Italy the most esteemed of all are those of Roquevaire they are very large and very sweet This sort is rarely eaten by any but the most wealthy The dried Malaga or Muscatel raisins which come to this country packed in small boxes and nicely preserved in bunches are variable in their quality but mostly

white or yellow grape grown in the same places is somewhat larger than the black variety and is that which produces the Sultana raisin It has been called Sultana from its delicate qualities and unique growth the finest are those of Smyrna They have not sufficient flavour and sugary properties to serve alone for puddings and cakes but they are peculiarly valuable for mixing that is to say for introducing in company with the richer sorts of Valencias or Muscatels In white puddings or cakes too where the whiteness must be preserved the Sultana raisin should be used But the greatest value of this fruit in the cuisine is that of its saving labour for it has no stones Half Muscatels and half Sultanas are an admirable mixture for general purposes A PLAIN CHRISTMAS PUDDING FOR CHILDREN

heat of an oven The sun dried grapes are sweet the oven dried of an acid flavour The common way of drying grapes for raisins is to tie two or three bunches of them together whilst yet on the vine and dip them into a hot lixivium of wood ashes mixed with a little of the oil of olives this disposes them to shrink and wrinkle after which they are left on the vine three or four days separated on sticks in a horizontal situation and then dried in the sun at leisure after being cut from the tree CHRISTMAS PLUM PUDDING Very Good thirteen twenty eight INGREDIENTS one one two lb of raisins one two

Messrs R J Slack three hundred thirty six Strand BRANDY is the alcoholic or spirituous portion of wine separated from the aqueous part the colouring matter c by distillation The word is of German origin and in its German form brantuein signifies burnt wine or wine that has undergone the action of fire brandies so called however have been made from potatoes carrots beetroot pears and other vegetable substances but they are all inferior to true brandy Brandy is prepared in most wine countries but that of France is the most esteemed It is procured not only by distilling the wine itself but also by fermenting and distilling the marc or residue of the pressings of the grape It is procured indifferently from red or white wine and different wines yield very different proportions of it the strongest of course giving the largest quantity Brandy obtained from marc has a more acrid taste than that from wine The celebrated brandy of Cognac a town in the department of Charente and that brought from Andraye seem to owe their excellence from being made from white wine Like other spirit brandy is colourless when recently distilled by mere keeping however owing probably to some change in the soluble matter contained in it it acquires a slight colour which is much increased by keeping in casks and is made of the required intensity by the addition of burnt sugar or other colouring matter What is called British brandy is not in fact brandy which is the name as we have said of a spirit distilled from wine but is a spirit made chiefly from malt spirit with the addition of mineral acids and various flavouring ingredients the exact composition being kept secret It is distilled somewhat extensively in this country real brandy scarcely at all The brandies imported into England are

manner as orange or lemon peel that is to say the peel is boiled in water until quite soft and then suspended in concentrated syrup in the cold after which it is either dried in a current of warm air or in a stove at a heat not exceeding one hundred twenty deg Fahrenheit The syrup must be kept fully saturated with sugar by reboiling it once or twice during the process It may be dusted with

originally a native of the East Indies The Chinese have cultivated it for two thousand years The Egyptians Phoenicians and Jews knew nothing about it The Greek physicians are the first who speak of it It was not till the year fourteen seventy one that a Venetian discovered the method of purifying brown sugar and making loaf sugar He gained an immense fortune by this discovery Our supplies are now obtained from Barbadoes Jamaica Mauritius Ceylon the East and West Indies generally and the United States but the largest supplies come from Cuba Sugar is divided into the following classes Refined sugar white clayed brown clayed brown raw and molasses The sugarcane grows to the height of six twelve or even sometimes twenty feet It is propagated from cuttings requires much hoeing and weeding giving employment to thousands upon thousands of slaves in the slave countries and attains maturity in twelve or thirteen months When ripe it is cut down close to the stole the stems are divided into lengths of about three feet which are made up into bundles and carried to the mill to be crushed between rollers In the process of crushing the juice runs down into a reservoir from which after a while it is drawn through a siphon that is to say the clear fluid is taken from the scum This fluid undergoes several processes of drying and refining the methods varying in different manufactories There are some large establishments engaged in sugar refining in the neighbourhoods of Blackwall and Bethnal Green London The process is mostly in the hands of German workmen Sugar is adulterated with fine sand and sawdust Pure sugar is highly nutritious adding to the fatty tissue of the body but it is not easy of digestion BAKED RAISIN PUDDING Plain and Economical thirteen thirty six INGREDIENTS

many of its sensible properties to gluten and when new or fresh it is inflated and rendered frothy by a large quantity of carbonic acid When mixed with wort this substance acts upon the saccharine matter the temperature rises carbonic acid is disengaged and the result is ale which always contains a considerable proportion of alcohol or spirit The quantity of yeast employed in brewing ale being small the saccharine matter is but imperfectly decomposed hence a considerable portion of it remains in the liquor and gives it that viscid quality and body for which it is remarkable The fermenting property of yeast is weakened by boiling for ten minutes and is entirely destroyed by continuing the boiling Alcohol poured upon it likewise renders it inert on which account its power lessens as the alcohol is formed during fermentation YORKSHIRE PUDDING to serve with hot Roast Beef thirteen eighty four INGREDIENTS one one two pint of milk six large tablespoonfuls of flour three eggs one

thirteen eighty five CREAMS The yellowish white opaque fluid smooth and unctuous to the touch which separates itself from new milk and forms a layer on its surface when removed by skimming is employed in a variety of culinary preparations The analyses of the contents of cream have been decided to be in one hundred parts butter three point five curd or matter of cheese three point five whey ninety two point zero That cream contains an oil is evinced by its staining clothes in the manner of oil and when boiled for some time a little oil floats upon the surface The thick animal oil which it contains the well known butter is separated only by agitation as in the common process of churning and the cheesy matter remains blended with the whey in the state of buttermilk Of the several kinds of cream the principal are the Devonshire and Dutch clotted creams the Costorphin cream and the Scotch sour cream The Devonshire cream is produced by nearly boiling the milk in shallow tin vessels over a charcoal fire and kept in that state until the whole of the cream is thrown up It is used for eating with fruits and tarts The cream from Costorphin a village of that name near Edinburgh is accelerated in its separation from three or four days old milk by a certain degree of heat and the Dutch clotted cream a coagulated mass in which a spoon will stand upright is manufactured from fresh drawn milk which is put into a pan and stirred with a spoon two or three times a day to prevent the cream from separating from the milk The Scotch sour cream is a misnomer for it is a material produced without cream A small tub filled with skimmed milk is put into a larger one containing hot water and after remaining there all night the thin milk called wigg is drawn off and the remainder of the contents of the smaller vessel is sour cream thirteen eighty six JELLIES are not the nourishing food they were at one time considered to be and many eminent physicians are of opinion that they are less digestible than the flesh or muscular part of animals still when acidulated with lemon juice and flavoured with wine they are very suitable for some convalescents Vegetable jelly is a distinct principle existing in fruits which possesses the property of gelatinizing when boiled and cooled but it is a principle entirely different from the gelatine of animal bodies although the name of jelly common to both sometimes leads to an erroneous idea on that subject Animal jelly or gelatine is glue whereas vegetable jelly is rather analogous to gum Liebig places gelatine very low indeed in the scale of usefulness He says Gelatine which by itself is tasteless and when eaten excites nausea possesses no nutritive value that even when accompanied by the savoury constituents of flesh it is not capable of supporting the vital process and when added to the usual diet as a substitute for plastic matter does not increase but on the contrary diminishes the nutritive value of the food which it renders insufficient in quantity and inferior in quality It is this substance which is most frequently employed in the manufacture of the jellies supplied by the confectioner but those prepared at home from calves feet do possess some nutrition and are the only sort that should be given to invalids Isinglass is the purest variety of gelatine and is prepared from the sounds or swimming bladders of certain fish chiefly the sturgeon From its whiteness it is mostly used for making blanc mange and similar dishes thirteen eighty seven THE WHITE OF EGGS is perhaps the best substance that can be employed in clarifying jelly as well as some other fluids for the reason that when albumen and the white of eggs is nearly pure albumen is put into a liquid that is muddy from substances suspended in it on boiling the liquid the albumen coagulates in a flocculent manner and entangling with it the impurities rises with them to the surface as a scum or sinks to the bottom according to their weight thirteen eighty eight SOUFFLES OMELETS AND SWEET DISHES in which eggs form the principal ingredient demand for their successful manufacture an experienced cook They are the

with a few slices of candied citron thirteen ninety two A MORE SIMPLE FLANC may be made by rolling out the paste cutting the bottom of a round or oval shape and then a narrow strip for the sides these should be stuck on with the white of an egg to the bottom piece and the flanc then filled with raw fruit with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely It will not require so long baking as in a mould but the crust must be made everywhere of an equal thickness and so perfectly joined that the juice does not escape This dish may also be served hot and should be garnished in the same manner or a little

mixture occasionally until nearly cold Let it stand for a few minutes then pour it into the mould which should be previously oiled with the purest salad oil or dipped in cold water There will be a sediment at the bottom of the jug which must not be poured into the mould as when turned out it would very much disfigure the appearance of the blanc mange This blanc mange may be made very much richer by using one one two pint of cream and melting the isinglass in one two pint of boiling water The flavour may also be very much varied by adding bay leaves laurel leaves or essence of vanilla instead of the lemon rind and almonds Noyeau Maraschino Curacoa or any favourite liqueur added in small proportions very much enhances the flavour of this always favourite dish In turning it out just

TO MAKE THE STOCK FOR JELLY AND TO CLARIFY IT fourteen eleven INGREDIENTS two calf s feet six pints of water Illustration JELLY MOULD Illustration JELLY BAG Mode The stock for jellies should always be made the day before it is required for use as the liquor has time to cool and the fat can be so much more easily and effectually removed when thoroughly set Procure from the butcher s two nice calf s feet scald them to take off the hair slit them in two remove the fat from between the claws and wash the feet well in warm water put them into a stewpan with the above proportion of cold water bring it gradually to boil and remove every particle of scum as it rises When it is well skimmed boil it very gently for six or seven hours or until the liquor is reduced rather more than half then strain it through a sieve into a basin and put it in a cool place to set As the liquor is strained measure it to ascertain the proportion for the jelly allowing something for the sediment and fat at the top To clarify it carefully remove all the fat from the top pour over a little warm water to wash away any that may remain and wipe the jelly with a clean cloth remove the jelly from the sediment put it into a saucepan and supposing the quantity to be a quart add to it six oz of loaf sugar the shells and well whisked whites of five eggs and stir these ingredients together cold set the saucepan on the fire but do not stir the jelly after it begins to warm Let it boil about ten minutes after it rises to a head then throw in a teacupful of cold water let it boil five minutes longer then take the saucepan off cover it closely and let it remain one two hour near the fire Dip the jelly bag into hot water wring it out quite dry and fasten it on to a stand or the back of a chair which must be placed near the fire to prevent the jelly from setting before it has run through the bag Place a basin underneath to receive the jelly then pour it into the bag and should it not be clear the first time run it through the bag again This stock is the foundation of all really good jellies which may be varied in innumerable ways by colouring and flavouring with liqueurs and by moulding it with fresh and preserved fruits To insure the jelly being firm when turned out one two oz of isinglass clarified might be added to the above proportion of stock Substitutes for calf s feet are now frequently used in making jellies which lessen the expense and trouble in preparing this favourite dish isinglass and gelatine being two of the principal materials employed but although they may look as nicely as jellies made from good stock they are never so delicate having very often an unpleasant flavour somewhat resembling glue particularly when made with gelatine Time About six hours to boil the feet for the stock to clarify it one four hour to boil one two hour to stand in the saucepan covered Average cost Calf s feet may be purchased for sixd each when veal is in full season but more expensive when it is scarce Sufficient two calf s feet should make one quart of stock Seasonable from March to October but may be had all the year HOW TO MAKE A JELLY BAG The very stout flannel called double mill used for ironing blankets is the best material for a jelly bag those of home manufacture are the only ones to be relied on for thoroughly clearing the jelly Care should be taken that the seam of the bag be stitched twice to secure it against unequal filtration The most convenient mode of using the big is to tie it upon a hoop the exact size of the outside of its mouth and to do this strings should be sewn round it at equal distances The jelly bag may of coarse be made any size but one of twelve or fourteen inches deep and seven or eight across the mouth will be sufficient for ordinary use The form of a jelly bag is the fool s cap COW HEEL STOCK FOR JELLIES More Economical than Calf s Feet fourteen twelve INGREDIENTS two cow heels three quarts of water Mode Procure two heels that have only been scalded and not boiled split them in two and remove the fat between the claws wash them well in warm water and put them into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water bring it gradually to boil remove all the scum as it rises and simmer the heels gently from seven to eight hours or until the liquor is reduced one half then strain it into a basin measuring the quantity and put it in a cool place Clarify it in the same manner as calf s feet stock No fourteen eleven using with the other ingredients about one two oz of isinglass to each quart This stock should be made the day before it is required for use Two dozen shank bones of mutton boiled for six or seven hours yield a quart of strong firm stock They should be put on in two quarts of water which should be reduced one half Make this also the day before it is required Time seven to eight hours to boil the cow heels six to seven hours to boil the shank bones Average cost from fourd to sixd each Sufficient two cow heels should make three pints of stock Seasonable at any time ISINGLASS OR GELATINE JELLY Substitutes for Calf s Feet fourteen thirteen INGREDIENTS three oz of isinglass or gelatine two quarts of water Mode Put the isinglass or gelatine into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water bring it quickly to boil and let it boil very fast until the liquor is reduced one half Carefully remove the scum as it rises then strain it through a jelly bag and it will be ready for use If not required very clear it may be merely strained through a fine sieve instead of being run through a bag Rather more than one two oz of isinglass is about the proper quantity to use for a quart of strong calf s feet stock and rather more than two oz for the same quantity of fruit juice As isinglass varies so much in quality and strength it is difficult to give the exact proportions The larger the mould the stiffer should be the jelly and where there is no ice more isinglass must be used than if the mixture were frozen This forms a stock for all kinds of jellies which may be flavoured in many ways Time one one two hour Sufficient with wine syrup fruit c to fill two moderate sized moulds Seasonable at any time Note The above when boiled should be perfectly clear and may be mixed warm with wine flavourings fruits c and then run through the bag ISINGLASS The best isinglass is brought from Russia some of an inferior kind is brought from North and South America and the East Indies the several varieties may be had from the wholesale dealers in isinglass in London In choosing isinglass for domestic use select that which is whitest has no unpleasant odour and which dissolves most readily in water The inferior kinds are used for fining beer and similar purposes Isinglass is much adulterated to test its purity take a few threads of the substance drop some into boiling water some into cold water and some into vinegar In the boiling water the isinglass will dissolve in cold water it will become white and cloudy and in vinegar it will swell and become jelly like If the isinglass is adulterated with gelatine that is to say the commoner sorts of gelatine for isinglass is classed amongst gelatines of all which varieties it is the very purest and best in boiling water the gelatine will not so completely dissolve as the isinglass in cold water it becomes clear and jelly like and in vinegar it will harden HOW TO MOULD BOTTLED JELLIES fourteen fourteen Uncork the bottle place it in a saucepan of hot water until the jelly is reduced to a liquid state taste it to ascertain whether it is sufficiently flavoured and if not add a little wine Pour the jelly into moulds which have been soaked in water let it set and turn it out by placing the mould in hot water for a minute then wipe the outside put a dish on the top and turn it over quickly The jelly should then slip easily away from the mould and be quite firm It may be garnished as taste dictates TO CLARIFY SYRUP FOR JELLIES fourteen fifteen INGREDIENTS To every quart of water allow two lbs of loaf sugar the white of one egg Mode Put the sugar and water into a stewpan set it on the fire and when the sugar is dissolved add the white of the egg whipped up with a little water Whisk the whole well together and simmer very gently until it has thrown up all the scum Take this off as it rises strain the syrup through a fine sieve or cloth into a basin and keep it for use CALF S FEET JELLY fourteen sixteen INGREDIENTS one quart of calf s feet stock No fourteen eleven one two lb of sugar one two pint of sherry one glass of brandy the shells and whites of five eggs the rind and juice of two lemons one two oz of isinglass Mode Prepare the stock as directed in recipe No fourteen eleven taking care to leave the sediment and to remove all the fat from the surface Put it into a saucepan cold without clarifying it add the remaining ingredients and stir them well together before the saucepan is placed on the fire Then simmer the mixture gently for one four hour but do not stir it after it begins to warm Throw in a teacupful of cold water boil for another five minutes and keep the saucepan covered by the side of the fire for about one two hour but do not let it boil again In simmering the head or scum may be carefully removed as it rises but particular attention must be given to the jelly that it be not stirred in the slightest degree after it is heated The isinglass should be added when the jelly begins to boil this assists to clear it and makes it firmer for turning out Wring out a jelly bag in hot water fasten it on to a stand or the back of a chair place it near the fire with a basin underneath it and run the jelly through it Should it not be perfectly clear the first time repeat the process until the desired brilliancy is obtained Soak the moulds in water drain them for half a second pour in the jelly and put it in a cool place to set If ice is at hand surround the moulds with it and the jelly will set sooner and be firmer when turned out In summer it is necessary to have ice in which to put the moulds or the cook will be very likely disappointed by her jellies being in too liquid a state to turn out properly unless a great deal of isinglass is used When wanted for table dip the moulds in hot water for a minute wipe the outside with a cloth lay a dish on the top of the mould turn it quickly over and the jelly should slip out easily It is sometimes served broken into square lumps and piled high in glasses Earthenware moulds are preferable to those of pewter or tin for red jellies the colour and transparency of the composition being often spoiled by using the latter Illustration JELLY MOULD To make this jelly more economically raisin wine may be substituted for the sherry and brandy and the stock made from cow heels instead of calf s feet Time twenty minutes to simmer the jelly one two hour to stand covered Average cost reckoning the feet at sixd each threes sixd Sufficient to fill two one one two pint moulds Seasonable at any time Note As lemon juice unless carefully strained is liable to make the jelly muddy see that it is clear before it is added to the other ingredients Omit the brandy when the flavour is objected to SHERRY There are several kinds of sherry as pale and brown and there are various degrees of each Sherry is in general of an amber colour and when good has a fine aromatic odour with something of the agreeable bitterness of the peach kernel When new it is harsh and fiery and requires to be mellowed in the wood for four or five years Sherry has of late got much into fashion in England from the idea that it is more free from acid than other wines but some careful experiments on wines do not fully confirm this opinion CANNELONS or FRIED PUFFS Sweet Entremets fourteen seventeen INGREDIENTS one two lb of puff paste No twelve oh five apricot or any kind of preserve that may be preferred hot lard Mode Cannelons which

allowing one tablespoonful of the former and half the quantity of the latter to the above proportion of eggs Shrimps or oysters may also be added the latter should be scalded in their liquor and then bearded and cut into small pieces In making an omelet be particularly careful that it is not too thin and to avoid this do not make it in too large a frying pan as the mixture would then spread too much and taste of the outside It should also not be greasy burnt or too much done and should be cooked over a gentle fire that the whole of the substance may be heated without drying up the outside Omelets are sometimes served with gravy but this should never be poured over them but served in a tureen as the liquid causes the omelet to become heavy and flat instead of eating light and soft In

of our fruits and are considered as varieties of the same species produced by cultivation The former is characterized by a very delicate down while the latter is smooth but as a proof of their identity as to species trees have borne peaches in one part and nectarines in another and even a single fruit has had down on one side and the other smooth The trees are almost exactly alike as well as the blossoms Pliny states that the peach was originally brought from Persia where it grows naturally from which the name of Persica was bestowed upon it by the Romans and some modern botanists apply this as the generic name separating them from Amygdalus or Almond to which Linnaeus had united them Although they are not tropical they require a great deal of warmth to bring them to perfection hence they seldom ripen in this country in ordinary seasons without the use of walls or glass consequently they bear a high price In a good peach the flesh is firm the skin thin of a deep bright colour next the sun and of a yellowish green next to the wall the pulp is yellowish full of highly flavoured juice the fleshy part thick and the stone small Too much down is a sign of inferior quality

beautiful woman in Paris It is also well known that she was exceedingly charitable and took a great interest in every benevolent work Wishing to consult the Cure of respecting the working of an institution she went to his house at five o clock in the afternoon and was much astonished at finding him already at his dinner table Madame Recamier wished to retire but the Cure would not hear of it A neat white cloth covered the table some good old wine sparkled in a crystal decanter the porcelain was of the best the plates had heaters of boiling water beneath them a neatly costumed maid servant was in attendance The repast was a compromise between frugality and luxury The crawfish soup had just been removed and there was on the table a salmon trout an omelet and a salad My dinner will tell you said the worthy Cure with a smile that it is fast day according to our Church s regulations Madame Recamier and her host attacked the trout the sauce served with which betrayed a skilful hand the countenance of the Cure the while showing satisfaction And now they fell upon the omelet which was round sufficiently thick and cooked so to speak to a hair s breadth As the spoon entered the omelet a thick rich juice issued from it pleasant to the eye as well as to the smell the dish became full of it and our fair friend owns that between the perfume and the sight it made her mouth water It is an omelette au thon that is to say a tunny omelet said the Cure noticing with the greatest delight the emotion of Madame Recamier and few people taste it without lavishing praises on it It surprises me not at all returned the beauty never has so enticing an omelet met my gaze at any of our lay tables My cook understands them well I think Yes added Madame I never ate anything so delightful Then came the salad which Savarin recommends to all who place confidence in him It refreshes without exciting and he has a theory that it makes people younger Amidst pleasant converse the dessert arrived It consisted of three apples cheese and a plate of preserves and then upon a little round table was served the Mocha coffee for which France has been and is so justly famous I never said the Cure take spirits I always offer liqueurs to my guests but reserve the use of them myself to my old age if it should please Providence to grant me that Finally the charming Madame Recamier took her leave and told all her friends of the delicious omelet which she had seen and partaken of And Brillat Savarin in his capacity as the Layard of the concealed treasures of Gastronomia has succeeded in withdrawing from obscurity the details of the preparation of which so much had been said and which he imagines to be as wholesome as it was agreeable Here follows the recipe OMELETTE AU THON fourteen ninety four Take for six persons the roes of two carp Footnote An American writer says he has followed this recipe substituting pike shad c in the place of carp and can recommend all these also with a quiet conscience Any fish indeed may be used with success bleach them by putting them for five minutes in boiling water slightly salted Take a piece of fresh tunny about the size of a hen s egg to which add a small shalot already chopped hash up together the roe and the tunny so as to mix them well and throw the whole into a saucepan with a sufficient quantity of very good butter whip it up until the butter is melted This constitutes the specialty of the omelet Take a second piece of butter a discretion mix it with parsley and herbs place it in a long shaped dish destined to receive the omelet squeeze the juice of a lemon over it and place it on hot embers Beat up twelve eggs the fresher the better throw up the saute of roe and tunny stirring it so as to mix all well together then make your omelet in the usual manner endeavouring to turn it out long thick and soft Spread it carefully on the dish prepared for it and serve at once This dish ought to be reserved for recherche dejeuners or for assemblies where amateurs meet who know how to eat well washed down with a good old wine it will work wonders Note The roe and the tunny must be beaten up saute without allowing them to boil to prevent their hardening which would prevent them mixing well with the eggs Your dish should be hollowed towards the centre to allow the gravy to concentrate that it may be helped with a spoon The dish ought to be slightly heated otherwise the cold china will extract all the heat from the omelet Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XXX GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONARY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES PRESERVES fourteen ninety five From the nature of vegetable substances and chiefly from their not passing so rapidly into the putrescent state as animal bodies the mode of preserving them is somewhat different although the general principles are the same All the means of preservation are put in practice occasionally for fruits and the various parts of vegetables according to the nature of the species the climate the uses to which they are applied c Some are dried as nuts raisins sweet herbs c others are preserved by means of sugar such as many fruits whose delicate juices would be lost by drying some are preserved by means of vinegar and chiefly used as condiments or pickles a few also by salting as French beans while others are preserved in spirits We have however in this place to treat of the best methods of preserving fruits Fruit is a most important item in the economy of health the epicurean can scarcely be said to have any luxuries without it therefore as it is so invaluable when we cannot have it fresh we must have it preserved It has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by some cheap method yet by such as would keep them fit for the various culinary purposes as making tarts and other similar dishes The expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except the sugar is used in considerable quantities the success is very uncertain Sugar also overpowers and destroys the sub acid taste so desirable in many fruits these which are preserved in this manner are chiefly intended for the dessert Fruits intended for preservation should be gathered in the morning in dry weather with the morning sun upon them if possible they will then have their fullest flavour and keep in good condition longer than when gathered at any other time Until fruit can be used it should be placed in the dairy an ice house or a refrigerator In an icehouse it will remain fresh and plump for several days Fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed and be of no service for preserves fourteen ninety six Having secured the first and most important contribution to the manufacture of preserves the fruit the next consideration is the preparation of the syrup in which the fruit is to be suspended and this requires much care In the confectioner s art there is a great nicety in proportioning the degree of concentration of the syrup very exactly to each particular case and they know this by signs and express it by certain technical terms But to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience The principal thing to be acquainted with is the fact that in proportion as the syrup is longer boiled its water will become evaporated and its consistency will be thicker Great care must be taken in the management of the fire that the syrup does not boil over and that the boiling is not carried to such an extent as to burn the sugar fourteen ninety seven The first degree of consistency is called the thread which is subdivided into the little and great thread If you dip the finger into the syrup and apply it to the thumb the tenacity of the syrup will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread If the thread from the greater tenacity and consequently greater strength of the syrup admits of a greater extension of the finger and thumb it is called the great thread There are half a dozen other terms and experiments for testing the various thickness of the boiling sugar towards the consistency called caramel but that degree of sugar boiling belongs to the confectioner A solution of sugar prepared by dissolving two parts of double refined sugar the best sugar is the most economical for preserves in one of water and boiling this a little affords a syrup of the right degree of strength and which neither ferments nor crystallizes This appears to be the degree called smooth by the confectioners and is proper to be used for the purposes of preserves The syrup employed should sometimes be clarified which is done in the following manner Dissolve two lbs of loaf sugar in a pint of water add to this solution the white of an egg and beat it well Put the preserving pan upon the fire with the solution stir it with a wooden spatula and when it begins to swell and boil up throw in some cold water or a little oil to damp the boiling for as it rises suddenly if it should boil over it would take fire being of a very inflammable nature Let it boil up again then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen Boil the solution again throw in a little more cold water remove the scum and so on for three or four times successively then strain it It is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil fourteen ninety eight Although sugar passes so easily into the state of fermentation and is in fact the only substance capable of undergoing the vinous stage of that process yet it will not ferment at all if the quantity be sufficient to constitute a very strong syrup hence syrups are used to preserve fruits and other vegetable substances from the changes they would undergo if left to themselves Before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar cane fourteen ninety nine The fruits that are the most fit for preservation in syrup are apricots peaches nectarines apples greengages plums of all kinds and pears As an example take some apricots not too ripe make a small slit at the stem end and push out the stone simmer them in water till they are softened and about half done and afterwards throw them into cold water When they have cooled take them out and drain them Put the apricots into the pie serving pan with sufficient syrup to cover them let them boil up three or four times and then skim them remove them from the fire pour them into an earthen pan and let them cool till next day Boil them up three days successively skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use After each bailing it is proper to examine into the state of the syrup when cold if too thin it will bear additional boiling if too thick it may be lowered with more syrup of the usual standard The reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made From this example the process of preserving fruits by syrup will be easily comprehended The first object is to soften the fruit by blanching or boiling it in water in order that the syrup by which it is preserved may penetrate through its substance fifteen hundred Many fruits when preserved by boiling lose much of their peculiar and delicate flavour as for instance pine apples and this inconvenience may in some instances be remedied by preserving them without heat Cut the fruit in slices about one fifth of an inch thick strew powdered loaf sugar an eighth of an inch thick on the bottom of a jar and put the slices on it Put more sugar on this and then another layer of the slices and so on till the jar is full Place the jar with the fruit up to the neck in boiling water and keep it there till the sugar is completely dissolved which may take half an hour removing the scum as it rises Lastly tie a wet bladder over the mouth of the jar or cork and wax it fifteen oh one Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into dry preserves by first draining them from the syrup and then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar which will gradually penetrate the fruit while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate They should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned Afterwards they are to be kept in a dry situation in drawers or boxes Currants and cherries preserved whole in this manner in bunches are extremely elegant and have a fine flavour In this way it is also that orange and lemon chips are preserved fifteen oh two Marmalades jams and fruit pastes are of the same nature and are now in very general request They are prepared without difficulty by attending to a very few directions they are somewhat expensive but may be kept without spoiling for a considerable time Marmalades and jams differ little from each other they are preserves of a half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rinds with sugar The appellation of marmalade is applied to those confitures which are composed of the firmer fruits as pineapples or the rinds of oranges whereas jams are made of the more juicy berries such as strawberries raspberries currants mulberries c Fruit pastes are a kind of marmalades consisting of the pulp of fruits first evaporated to a proper consistency and afterwards boiled with sugar The mixture is then poured into a mould or spread on sheets of tin and subsequently dried in the oven or stove till it has acquired the state of a paste From a sheet of this paste strips may be cut and formed into any shape that may be desired as knots rings c Jams require the same care and attention in the boiling as marmalade the slightest degree of burning communicates a disagreeable empyreumatic taste and if they are not boiled sufficiently they will not keep That they may keep it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen oh three In all the operations for preserve making when the preserving pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a trivet unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not necessary If the pan is placed close on to the fire the preserve is very liable to burn and the colour and flavour be consequently spoiled fifteen oh four Fruit jellies are compounds of the juices of fruits combined with sugar concentrated by boiling to such a consistency that the liquid upon cooling assumes the form of a tremulous jelly fifteen oh five Before fruits are candied they must first be boiled in syrup after which they are taken out and dried on a stove or before the fire the syrup is then to be concentrated or boiled to a candy height and the fruit dipped in it and again laid on the stove to dry and candy they are then to be put into boxes and kept dry fifteen oh six Conserves consist of fresh vegetable matters beat into a uniform mass with refined sugar and they are intended to preserve the virtues and properties of recent flowers leaves roots peels or fruits unaltered and as near as possible to what they were when fresh gathered and to give them an agreeable taste fifteen oh seven The last mentioned but not the least important preparation of fruit is the compote a confiture made at the moment of need and with much less sugar than would be ordinarily put to preserves They are most wholesome things suitable to most stomachs which cannot accommodate themselves to raw fruit or a large portion of sugar they are the happy medium and far better than ordinary stewed fruit CONFECTIONARY fifteen oh eight In speaking of confectionary it should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under that head for the various fruits flowers herbs roots and juices which when boiled with sugar were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats were called confections from the Latin word conficere to make up but the term confectionary embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine The thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner they cannot profitably be made at home Apart from these cakes biscuits and tarts c the class of sweetmeats called confections may be thus classified one Liquid confects or fruits either whole or in pieces preserved by being immersed in a fluid transparent syrup as the liquid confects of apricots green citrons and many foreign fruits two Dry confects are those which after having been boiled in the syrup are taken out and put to dry in an oven as citron and orange peel c three Marmalade jams and pastes a kind of soft compounds made of the pulp of fruits or other vegetable substances beat up with sugar or honey such as oranges apricots pears c four Jellies are the juices of fruits boiled with sugar to a pretty thick consistency so as upon cooling to form a trembling jelly as currant gooseberry apple jelly c five Conserves are a kind of dry confects made by beating up flowers fruits c with sugar not dissolved six Candies are fruits candied over with sugar after having been boiled in the syrup DESSERT DISHES fifteen oh nine With moderns the dessert is not so profuse nor does it hold the same relationship to the dinner that it held with the ancients the Romans more especially On ivory tables they would spread hundreds of different kinds of raw cooked and preserved fruits tarts and cakes as substitutes for the more substantial comestibles with which the guests were satiated However as late as the reigns of our two last Georges fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts The dessert certainly repays in its general effect the expenditure upon it of much pains and it may be said that if there be any poetry at all in meals or the process of feeding there is poetry in the dessert the materials for which should be selected with taste and of course must depend in a great measure upon the season Pines melons grapes peaches nectarines plums strawberries apples pears oranges almonds raisins figs walnuts filberts medlars cherries c c all kinds of dried fruits and choice and delicately flavoured cakes and biscuits make up the dessert together with the most costly and recherche wines The shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems The patterns and colours are also subject to changes of fashion some persons selecting china chaste in pattern and colour others elegantly shaped glass dishes on stems with gilt edges The beauty of the dessert services at the tables of the wealthy tends to enhance the splendour of the plate The general mode of putting a dessert on table now the elegant tazzas are fashionable is to place them down the middle of the table a tall and short dish alternately the fresh fruits being arranged on the tall dishes and dried fruits bon bons c on small round or oval glass plates The garnishing needs especial attention as the contrast of the brilliant coloured fruits with nicely arranged foliage is very charming The garnish par excellence for dessert is the ice plant its crystallized dewdrops producing a marvellous effect in the height of summer giving a most inviting sense of coolness to the fruit it encircles The double edged mallow strawberry and vine leaves have a pleasing effect and for winter desserts the bay cuba and laurel are sometimes used In town the expense and difficulty of obtaining natural foliage is great but paper and composite leaves are to be purchased at an almost nominal price Mixed fruits of the larger sort are now frequently served on one dish This mode admits of the display of much taste in the arrangement of the fruit for instance a pine in the centre of the dish surrounded with large plums of various sorts and colours mixed with pears rosy cheeked apples all arranged with a due regard to colour have a very good effect Again apples and pears look well mingled with plums and grapes hanging from the border of the dish in a neglige sort of manner with a large bunch of the same fruit lying on the top of the apples A dessert would not now be considered complete without candied and preserved fruits and confections The candied fruits may be purchased at a less cost than they can be manufactured at home They are preserved abroad in most ornamental and elegant forms And since from the facilities of travel we have become so familiar with the tables of the French chocolate in different forms is indispensable to our desserts ICES five hundred ten Ices are composed it is scarcely necessary to say of congealed cream or water combined sometimes with liqueurs or other flavouring ingredients or more generally with the juices of fruits At desserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely to be dispensed with The principal utensils required for making ice creams are ice tubs freezing pots spaddles and a cellaret The tub must be large enough to contain about a bushel of ice pounded small when brought out of the ice house and mixed very carefully with either salt nitre or soda The freezing pot is best made of pewter If it be of tin as is sometimes the case the congelation goes on too rapidly in it for the thorough intermingling of its contents on which the excellence of the ice greatly depends The spaddle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean The cellaret is a tin vessel in which ices are kept for a short time from dissolving The method to be pursued in the freezing process must be attended to When the ice tub is prepared with fresh pounded ice and salt the freezing pot is put into it up to its cover The articles to be congealed are then poured into it and covered over but to prevent the ingredients from separating and the heaviest of them from falling to the bottom of the mould it is requisite to turn the freezing pot round and round by the handle so as to keep its contents moving until the congelation commences As soon as this is perceived the cover of the pot being occasionally taken off for the purpose of noticing when freezing takes place the cover is immediately closed over it ice is put upon it and it is left in this state till it is served The use of the spaddle is to stir up and remove from the sides of the freezing pot the cream which in the shaking may have washed against it and by stirring it in with the rest to prevent waste of it occurring Any negligence in stirring the contents of the freezing pot before congelation takes place will destroy the whole either the sugar sinks to the bottom and leaves the ice insufficiently sweetened or lumps are formed which disfigure and discolour it fifteen eleven The aged the delicate and children should abstain from ices or iced beverages even the strong and healthy should partake of them in moderation They should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition It is necessary then that this function should have scarcely commenced or that it should be completely finished before partaking of ices It is also necessary to abstain from them when persons are very warm or immediately after taking violent exercise as in some cases they have produced illnesses which have ended fatally Do ladies know to whom they are indebted for the introduction of ices which all the fair sex are passionately fond of To Catherine de Medici Will not this fact cover a multitude of sins committed by the instigator of saint Bartholomew RECIPES CHAPTER XXXI TO MAKE SYRUP FOR COMPOTES c fifteen twelve INGREDIENTS To every lb of sugar allow one one two pint of water Mode Boil the sugar and water together for one four hour carefully removing the scum as it rises the syrup is then ready for the fruit The articles boiled in this syrup will not keep for any length of time it being suitable only for dishes intended to be eaten immediately A larger proportion of sugar must be added for a syrup intended to keep Time one four hour TO CLARIFY SUGAR OR SYRUP fifteen thirteen INGREDIENTS To every lb of sugar allow one two pint of water and one two the white of an egg Mode Put the sugar water and the white of the egg which should be well beaten into a preserving pan or lined saucepan and do not put it on the fire till the sugar is dissolved Then place it on the fire and when it boils throw in a teacupful of cold water and do not stir the sugar after this is added Bring it to the boiling point again and then place the pan by the side of the fire for the preparation to settle Remove all the scum and the sugar will be ready for use The scum should be placed on a sieve so that what syrup runs from it may be boiled up again this must also be well skimmed Time twenty minutes for the sugar to dissolve five minutes to boil Note The above two recipes are those used in the preparation of dishes usually made at home There are many degrees of boiling sugar which process requires great care attention and experience Caramel sugar which makes an elegant cover for sweetmeats is difficult to prepare and is best left to an experienced confectioner We give the recipe for those of our readers who care to attempt the operation TO BOIL SUGAR TO CARAMEL fifteen fourteen INGREDIENTS To every lb of lump sugar allow one gill of spring water Mode Boil the sugar and water together very quickly over a clear fire skimming it very carefully as soon as it boils Keep it boiling until the sugar snaps when a little of it is dropped in a pan of cold water If it remains hard the sugar has attained the right degree then squeeze in a little lemon juice and let it remain an instant on the fire Set the pan into another of cold water and the caramel is then ready for use The insides of well oiled moulds are often ornamented with this sugar which with a fork should be spread over them in fine threads or network A dish of light pastry tastefully arranged looks very prettily with this sugar spun lightly over it The sugar must be carefully watched and taken up the instant it is done Unless the cook is very experienced and thoroughly understands her business it is scarcely worth while to attempt to make this elaborate ornament as it may be purchased quite as economically at a confectioner s if the failures in the preparation are taken into consideration COMPOTE OF APPLES Soyer s

reckoning from the time the jam begins to simmer properly remove the scum as it rises and when the jam is done put it into pots for use Place a piece of oiled paper over the jam and to exclude the air cover the pots with tissue paper dipped in the white of an egg and stretched over the top This jam will keep good for a long time Time About two hours to stew in the jar one two hour to boil after the jam begins to simmer Average cost for this quantity sixs Sufficient seven or eight lbs of apples for six pots of jam Seasonable Make this in September October or November APPLE JELLY I fifteen eighteen INGREDIENTS To six lbs of apples allow three pints of water to every quart of juice allow two lbs of loaf sugar the juice of one two lemon Mode Pare core and cut the apples into slices and

jelly bag To every quart of juice allow two lbs of loaf sugar which should be crushed to small lumps and put into a preserving pan with the juice Boil these together for rather more than one two hour remove the scum as it rises add the lemon juice just before it is done and put the jelly into pots for use This preparation is useful for garnishing sweet dishes and may be turned out for dessert Time The apples to be put in the oven over night and left till morning rather more than one two hour to boil the jelly Average cost for this quantity threes Sufficient for six small pots of jelly

burn A little lemon rind may be boiled with the apples and a small quantity of strained lemon juice may be put in the jelly just before it is done when the flavour is liked This jelly may be ornamented with preserved greengages or any other preserved fruit and will turn out very prettily for dessert It should be stored away in small pots Time one hour to boil the fruit and water three four hour to boil the juice with the sugar Average cost for six lbs of apples with the other ingredients in proportion threes Sufficient for six small pots of jelly Seasonable Make this in September

the apples c into a preserving pan with the water strained from the ginger and boil till the apples look clear and the syrup is rich which will be in about an hour The rind of a lemon may be added just before the apples have finished boiling and great care must be taken not to break the pieces of apple in putting them into the jars Serve on glass dishes for dessert Time two days for the apples to remain in the jar with sugar c one day to infuse the ginger about one hour to boil the apples Average cost for three lbs of apples with the other ingredients in proportion twos threed Sufficient three lbs should fill three moderate sized jars Seasonable This should be made in September October or November COMPOTE OF APRICOTS An elegant Dish fifteen twenty one INGREDIENTS one two pint of syrup

the kernels and put them with the sugar and fruit into a preserving pan Let these simmer very gently until clear take out the pieces of apricot singly as they become so and as fast as the scum rises carefully remove it Put the apricots into small jars pour over them the syrup and kernels cover the jam with pieces of paper dipped in the purest salad oil and stretch over the top of the jars tissue paper cut about two inches larger and brushed over with the white of an egg when dry it will be perfectly hard and air tight Time twelve hours sprinkled with sugar about three four hour to boil the

tie the fruit on to these in nice bunches Have ready some clear syrup made by recipe No fifteen thirteen put in the barberries and simmer them in it for two successive days boiling them for nearly one two hour each day and covering them each time with the syrup when cold When the fruit looks perfectly clear it is sufficiently done and should be stored away in pots with the syrup poured over or the fruit may be candied Time one two hour to simmer each day Seasonable in autumn Note The berries in their natural state make a very pretty garnishing for dishes and may even be used for the same purpose preserved as above and look exceedingly nice on sweet dishes TO MAKE BARLEY SUGAR fifteen twenty four INGREDIENTS To every lb of sugar allow one two pint of water one two the white of an egg Mode Put the sugar into a well tinned saucepan with the water and when the former is dissolved set it over a moderate fire adding the well beaten egg before the mixture gets warm and stir it well together When it boils remove the scum as it rises and keep it boiling until no more appears and the syrup looks perfectly clear then strain it through a fine sieve or muslin bag and put it back into the saucepan Boil it again like caramel until it is brittle when a little is dropped in a basin of cold water it is then sufficiently boiled Add a little lemon juice and a few drops of essence of lemon and let it stand for a minute or two Have ready a marble slab or large dish rubbed over with salad oil pour on it the sugar and cut it into strips with a pair of scissors these strips should

fruit strew this in between the cherries and when the bottles are nearly full pour in sufficient brandy to reach just below the cork A few peach or apricot kernels will add much to their flavour or a few blanched bitter almonds Put corks or bungs into the bottles tie over them a piece of bladder and store away in a dry place The cherries will be fit to eat in two or three months and will remain good for years They are liable to shrivel and become tough if too much sugar be added to them Average cost ones to ones sixd per lb Sufficient one lb of cherries and about one four pint of brandy for a quart bottle Seasonable in August and September DRIED CHERRIES fifteen twenty seven CHERRIES may be put in a slow oven and thoroughly dried before they begin to change colour They should then be taken out of the oven tied in bunches and stored away in a dry place In the winter they may be cooked with sugar for dessert the same as Normandy pippins Particular care must be taken that the oven be not too hot Another method of drying cherries is to stone them and to put them into a preserving pan with plenty of loaf sugar strewed amongst them They should be simmered till the fruit shrivels when they should be strained from the juice The cherries should then be placed in an oven cool enough to dry without baking them About five oz of sugar would be required for one lb of cherries and the same syrup may be used again to do another quantity of fruit CHERRY JAM fifteen twenty eight INGREDIENTS To every lb of fruit weighed before stoning allow one two lb of sugar to every six lbs of fruit allow one pint of red currant juice and to every pint of juice one lb of sugar Mode Weigh the fruit before stoning and allow half the weight of sugar stone the cherries and boil them in a preserving pan until nearly all the juice is dried up then add the sugar which should be crushed to powder and the currant juice allowing one pint to every six lbs of cherries original weight and one lb of sugar to every pint of juice Boil all together until it jellies which will be in from twenty minutes to one two hour skim the jam well keep it well stirred and a few minutes before it is done crack some of the stones and add the kernels these impart a very delicious flavour to the jam Time According to the quality of the cherries from three four to one hour to boil them twenty minutes to one two hour

fifteen minutes carefully skimming them turn them gently into a pan and let them remain till the next day then drain the cherries on a sieve and put the syrup and white currant juice into the preserving pan again Boil these together until the syrup is somewhat reduced and rather thick then put in the cherries and let them boil for about five minutes take them off the fire skim the syrup put the cherries into small pots or wide mouthed bottles pour the syrup over and when quite cold tie them down carefully so that the air is quite excluded Time fifteen minutes to boil the cherries in the syrup ten minutes to boil the syrup and currant juice six minutes to boil the cherries the second time Average cost for this quantity threes sixd Seasonable Make this in July or August BLACK

characterized by a very delicate down while the latter is smooth but as a proof of their identity as to species trees have borne peaches on one part and nectarines on another and even a single fruit has had down on one side and on the other none the trees are almost exactly alike as well as the blossoms Pliny states that the peach was originally brought from Persia where it grows naturally At Montreuil a village near Paris almost the whole population is employed in the cultivation of peaches and this occupation has maintained the inhabitants for ages and in consequence they raise better peaches than anywhere else in France In Maryland and Virginia peaches grow nearly wild in orchards resembling forests but the fruit is of little value for the table being employed only in fattening hogs and for the distillation of peach brandy On the east side of the Andes peaches grow wild among the cornfields and in the mountains and are dried as an article of food The young leaves of the peach are sometimes used in cookery from their agreeable flavour and a liqueur resembling the fine noyeau of Martinique may be made by steeping them in brandy sweetened with sugar and fined with milk gin may also be flavoured in the same manner The kernels of the fruit have the same flavour The nectarine is said to have received its name from nectar the particular drink of the gods Though it is considered as the same species as the peach it is not known which of the varieties come from the other the nectarine is by some considered as the superior fruit PEACHES PRESERVED IN BRANDY fifteen

the pear and most of the late varieties introduced are from France and Flanders The pear is a hardy tree and a longer liver than the apple it has been known to exist for centuries There are now about

DESSERT DISHES Illustration DISH OF NUTS Illustration BOX OF FRENCH PLUMS Illustration DISH OF MIXED FRUIT fifteen ninety eight The tazza or dish with stem the same as that shown in our illustrations is now the favourite shape for dessert dishes The fruit can be arranged and shown to better advantage on these tall high dishes than on the short flat ones All the dishes are now usually placed down the centre of the table dried and fresh fruit alternately the former being arranged on small round or oval glass plates and the latter on the dishes with stems The fruit should always be gathered on the same day that it is required for table and should be tastefully arranged on the dishes with leaves between and round it By purchasing fruits that are in season a dessert can be supplied at a very moderate cost These with a few fancy biscuits crystallized fruit bon bons c are sufficient for an ordinary dessert When fresh fruit cannot be obtained dried and foreign fruits compotes baked pears stewed Normandy pippins c c must supply its place with the addition of preserves bon bons cakes biscuits c At fashionable tables forced fruit is served growing in pots these pots being hidden in more ornamental ones and arranged with the other dishes See coloured plate Wone A few vases of fresh flowers tastefully arranged add very much to the appearance of the dessert and when these are not obtainable a few paper ones mixed with green leaves answer very well as a substitute In decorating a table whether for luncheon dessert or supper a vase or two of flowers should never be forgotten as they add so much to the elegance of the tout ensemble In summer and autumn ladies residing in the country can always manage to have a few freshly gathered flowers on their tables and should never be without this inexpensive luxury On the continent vases or epergnes filled with flowers are invariably placed down the centre of the dinner table at regular distances Ices for dessert are usually moulded when this is not the case they are handed round in glasses with wafers to accompany them Preserved ginger is frequently handed round after ices to prepare the palate for the delicious dessert wines A basin or glass of finely pounded lump sugar must never be omitted at a dessert as also a glass jug of fresh cold water iced if possible and two goblets by its side Grape scissors a melon knife and fork and nutcrackers should always be put on table if there are dishes of fruit requiring them Zests are sometimes served at the close of the dessert such as anchovy toasts or biscuits The French often serve plain or grated cheese with a dessert of fresh or dried fruit At some tables finger glasses are placed at the right of each person nearly half filled with cold spring water and in winter with tepid water These precede the dessert At other tables a glass or vase is simply handed round filled with perfumed water into which each guest dips the corner of his napkin and when needful refreshes his lips and the tips of his fingers Illustration BOX OF CHOCOLATE Illustration DISH OF APPLES Illustration ALMONDS AND RAISINS Illustration DISH OF STRAWBERRIES After the dishes are placed and every one is provided with plates glasses spoons c the wine should be put at each end of the table cooled or otherwise according to the season If the party be small the wine may be placed only at the top of the table near the host DISH OF NUTS fifteen ninety nine These are merely arranged piled high in the centre of the dish as shown in the engraving with or without leaves round the edge Filberts should always be served with the outer skin or husk on them and walnuts should be well wiped with a damp cloth and then with a dry one to remove the unpleasant sticky feeling the shells frequently have Seasonable Filberts from September to March good may be had after that time but are generally shrivelled and dry Walnuts from September to January HAZEL NUT AND FILBERT The common Hazel is the wild and the Filbert the cultivated state of the same tree The hazel is found wild not only in forests and hedges in dingles and ravines but occurs in extensive tracts in the more northern and mountainous parts of the country It was formerly one of the most abundant of those trees which are indigenous in this island It is seldom cultivated as a fruit tree though perhaps its nuts are superior in flavour to the others The Spanish nuts imported are a superior kind but they are somewhat oily and rather indigestible Filberts both the red and the white and the cob nut are supposed to be merely varieties of the common hazel which have been produced partly by the superiority of soil and climate and partly by culture They were originally brought out of Greece to Italy whence they have found their way to Holland and from that country to England It is supposed that within a few miles of Maidstone in Kent there are more filberts grown than in all England besides and it is from that place that the London market is supplied The filbert is longer than the common nut though of the same thickness and has a larger kernel The cob nut is a still larger variety and is roundish Filberts are more esteemed at the dessert than common nuts and are generally eaten with salt They are very free from oil and disagree with few persons WALNUTS The Walnut is a native of Persia the Caucasus and China but was introduced to this kingdom from France The ripe kernel is brought to the dessert on account of its agreeable flavour and the fruit is also much used in the green state but before the stone hardens as a pickle In Spain grated walnuts are employed in tarts and other dishes The Walnut abounds in oil which is expressed and which being of a highly drying nature and very limpid is much employed for delicate painting This on the continent is sometimes used as a substitute for olive oil in cooking but is very apt to turn rancid It is also manufactured into a kind of soap The mare or refuse matter after the oil is extracted proves very nutritious for poultry or other domestic animals In Switzerland this is eaten by poor people under the name of pain amer BOX OF FRENCH PLUMS sixteen hundred If the box which contains them is exceedingly ornamental it may be placed on the table if small on a glass dish if large without one French plums may also be arranged on a glass plate and garnished with bright coloured sweetmeats which make a very good effect All fancy boxes of preserved and crystallized fruit may be put on the table or not at pleasure These little matters of detail must of course be left to individual taste Seasonable May be purchased all the year but are in greater perfection in the winter and are more suitable for that season as fresh fruit cannot be obtained DISH OF MIXED FRUIT sixteen oh one For a centre dish a mixture of various fresh fruits has a remarkably good effect particularly if a pine be added to the list A high raised appearance should be given to the fruit which is done in the following manner Place a tumbler in the centre of the dish and in this tumbler the pine crown uppermost round the tumbler put a thick layer of moss and over this apples pears plums peaches and such fruit as is simultaneously in season By putting a layer of moss underneath so much fruit is not required besides giving a better shape to the dish Grapes should be placed on the top of the fruit a portion of some of the bunches hanging over the sides of the dish in a neglige kind of manner which takes off the formal look of the dish In arranging the plums apples c let the colours contrast well Seasonable Suitable for a dessert in September or October GRAPES France produces about a thousand varieties of the grape which is cultivated more extensively in that country than in any other Hygienists agree in pronouncing grapes as among the best of fruits The grape possesses several rare qualities it is nourishing and fattening and its prolonged use has often overcome the most obstinate cases of constipation The skins and pips of grapes should not be eaten BOX OF CHOCOLATE sixteen oh two This is served in an ornamental box placed on a glass plate or dish Seasonable May be purchased at any time DISH OF APPLES sixteen oh three The apples should be nicely wiped with a dry cloth and arranged on a dish piled high in the centre with evergreen leaves between each layer The inferior apples should form the bottom layer with the bright coloured large ones at the top The leaves of the laurel bay holly or any shrub green in winter are suitable for garnishing dessert dishes Oranges may be arranged in the same manner they should also be wiped with a dry cloth before being sent to table DISH OF MIXED SUMMER FRUIT sixteen oh four This dish consists of cherries raspberries currants and strawberries piled in different layers with plenty of leaves between each layer so that each fruit is well separated The fruit should be arranged with a due regard to colour so that they contrast nicely one with the other Our engraving shows a layer of white cherries at the bottom then one of red raspberries over that a layer of white currants and at the top some fine scarlet strawberries Seasonable in June July and August ALMONDS AND RAISINS sixteen oh five These are usually served on glass dishes the fruit piled high in the centre and the almonds blanched and strewn over To blanch the almonds put them into a small mug or teacup pour over them boiling water let them remain for two or three minutes and the skins may then be easily removed Figs dates French plums c are all served on small glass plates or oval dishes but without the almonds Seasonable at any time but more suitable in winter when fresh fruit is not obtainable DATES Dates are imported into Britain in a dried state from Barbary and Egypt and when in good condition they are much esteemed An inferior kind has lately become common which are dried hard and have little or no flavour They should be chosen large softish not much wrinkled of a reddish yellow colour on the outside with a whitish membrane between the fruit and the stone DISH OF STRAWBERRIES sixteen oh six Fine strawberries arranged in the manner shown in the engraving look exceedingly well The inferior ones should be placed at the bottom of the dish and the others put in rows pyramidically with the stalks downwards so that when the whole is completed nothing but the red part of the fruit is visible The fruit should be gathered with rather long stalks as there is then something to support it and it can be placed more upright in each layer A few of the finest should be reserved to crown the top TO HAVE WALNUTS FRESH THROUGHOUT THE SEASON sixteen oh seven INGREDIENTS To every pint of water allow one teaspoonful of salt Mode Place the walnuts in the salt and water for twenty four hours at least then take them out and rub them dry Old nuts may be freshened in this manner or walnuts when first picked may be put into an earthen pan with salt sprinkled amongst them and with damped hay placed on the top of them and then covered down with a lid They must be well wiped before they are put on table Seasonable Should be stored away in September or October Illustration Illustration CHAPTER XXXII GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON MILK BUTTER CHEESE AND EGGS MILK sixteen oh eight Milk is obtained only from the class of animals called Mammalia and is intended by Nature for the nourishment of their young The milk of each animal is distinguished by some peculiarities but as that of the cow is by far the most useful to us in this part of the world our observations will be confined to that variety sixteen oh nine Milk when drawn from the cow is of a yellowish white colour and is the most yellow at the beginning of the period of lactation Its taste is agreeable and rather saccharine The viscidity and specific gravity of milk are somewhat greater than that of water but these properties vary somewhat in the milk procured from different individuals On an average the specific gravity of milk is one point thirty five water being one The small cows of the Alderney breed afford the richest milk sixteen ten Milk which is carried to a considerable distance so as to be much agitated and cooled before it is put into pans to settle for cream never throws up so much nor such rich cream as if the same milk had been put into pans directly after it was milked sixteen eleven Milk considered as an aliment is of such importance in domestic economy as to render all the improvements in its production extremely valuable To enlarge upon the antiquity of its use is unnecessary it has always been a favourite food in Britain Lacte et carno vivunt says Caesar in his Commentaries the English of which is the inhabitants subsist upon flesh and milk The breed of the cow has received great improvement in modern times as regards the quantity and quality of the milk which she affords the form of milch cows their mode of nourishment and progress are also manifest in the management of the dairy sixteen twelve Although milk in its natural state be a fluid yet considered as an aliment it is both solid and fluid for no sooner does it enter the stomach than it is coagulated by the gastric juice and separated into curd and whey the first of these being extremely nutritive sixteen thirteen Milk of the human subject is much thinner than cow s milk Ass s milk comes the nearest to human milk of any other Goat s milk is something thicker and richer than cow s milk Ewe s milk has the appearance of cow s milk and affords a larger quantity of cream Mare s milk contains more sugar than that of the ewe Camel s milk is used only in Africa Buffalo s milk is employed in India sixteen fourteen From no other substance solid or fluid can so great a number of distinct kinds of aliment be prepared as from milk some forming food others drink some of them delicious and deserving the name of luxuries all of them wholesome and some medicinal indeed the variety of aliments that seems capable of being produced from milk appears to be quite endless In every age this must have been a subject for experiment and every nation has added to the number by the invention of some peculiarity of its own BUTTER sixteen fifteen BECKMAN in his History of Inventions states that butter was not used either by the Greeks or Romans in cooking nor was it brought upon their tables at certain meals as is the custom at present In England it has been made from time immemorial though the art of making cheese is said not to have been known to the ancient Britons and to have been learned from their conquerors sixteen sixteen The taste of butter is peculiar and very unlike any other fatty substance It is extremely agreeable when of the best quality but its flavour depends much upon the food given to the cows to be good it should not adhere to the knife sixteen seventeen Butter with regard to its dietetic properties may be regarded nearly in the light of vegetable oils and animal fats but it becomes sooner rancid than most other fat oils When fresh it cannot but be considered as very wholesome but it should be quite free from rancidity If slightly salted when it is fresh its wholesomeness is probably not at all impaired but should it begin to turn rancid salting will not correct its unwholesomeness When salt butter is put into casks the upper part next the air is very apt to become rancid and this rancidity is also liable to affect the whole cask sixteen eighteen Epping butter is the kind most esteemed in London Fresh butter comes to London from Buckinghamshire Suffolk Oxfordshire Yorkshire Devonshire c Cambridge butter is esteemed next to fresh Devonshire butter is nearly similar in quality to the latter Irish butter sold in London is all salted but is generally good The number of firkins exported annually from Ireland amounts to four hundred twenty thousand equal to a million of money Dutch butter is in good repute all over Europe America and even India and no country in the world is so successful in the manufacture of this article Holland supplying more butter to the rest of the world than any country whatever sixteen nineteen There are two methods pursued in the manufacture of butter In one the cream is separated from the milk and in that state it is converted into butter by churning as is the practice about Epping in the other milk is subjected to the same process which is the method usually followed in Cheshire The first method is generally said to give the richest butter and the latter the largest quantity though some are of opinion that there is little difference either in quality or quantity CHEESE sixteen twenty CHEESE is the curd formed from milk by artificial coagulation pressed and dried for use Curd called also casein and caseous matter or the basis of cheese exists in the milk and not in the cream and requires only to be separated by coagulation The coagulation however supposes some alteration of the curd By means of the substance employed to coagulate it it is rendered insoluble in water When the curd is freed from the whey kneaded and pressed to expel it entirely it becomes cheese This assumes a degree of transparency and possesses many of the properties of coagulated albumen If it be well dried it does not change by exposure to the air but if it contain moisture it soon putrefies It therefore requires some salt to preserve it and this acts likewise as a kind of seasoning All our cheese is coloured more or less except that made from skim milk The colouring substances employed are arnatto turmeric or marigold all perfectly harmless unless they are adulterated and it is said that arnatto sometimes contains red lead sixteen twenty one Cheese varies in quality and richness according to the materials of which it is composed It is made one Of entire milk as in Cheshire two of milk and cream as at Stilton three of new milk mixed with skimmed milk as in Gloucestershire four of skimmed milk only as in Suffolk Holland and Italy sixteen twenty two The principal varieties of cheese used in England are the following Cheshire cheese famed all over Europe for its rich quality and fine piquant flavour It is made of entire new milk the cream not being taken off Gloucester cheese is much milder in its taste than the Cheshire There are two kinds of Gloucester cheese single and double Single Gloucester is made of skimmed milk or of the milk deprived of half the cream Double Gloucester is a cheese that pleases almost every palate it is made of the whole milk and cream Stilton cheese is made by adding the cream of one day to the entire milk of the next it was first made at Stilton in Leicestershire Sage cheese is so called from the practice of colouring some curd with bruised sage marigold leaves and parsley and mixing this with some uncoloured curd With the Romans and during the middle ages this practice was extensively adopted Cheddar cheese much resembles Parmesan It has a very agreeable taste and flavour and has a spongy appearance Brickbat cheese has nothing remarkable except its form It is made by turning with rennet a mixture of cream and new milk The curd is put into a wooden vessel the shape of a brick and is then pressed and dried in the usual way Dunlop cheese has a peculiarly mild and rich taste the best is made entirely from new milk New cheese as it is called in London is made chiefly in Lincolnshire and is either made of all cream or like Stilton by adding the cream of one day s milking to the milk that comes immediately from the cow they are extremely thin and are compressed gently two or three times turned for a few days and then eaten new with radishes salad c Skimmed Milk cheese is made for sea voyages principally Parmesan cheese is made in Parma and Piacenza It is the most celebrated of all cheese it is made entirely of skimmed cow s milk The high flavour which it has is supposed to be owing to the rich herbage of the meadows of the Po where the cows are pastured The best Parmesan is kept for three or four years and none is carried to market till it is at least six months old Dutch cheese derives its peculiar pungent taste from the practice adopted in Holland of coagulating the milk with muriatic acid instead of rennet Swiss cheeses in their several varieties are all remarkable for their fine flavour That from Gruyere a bailiwick in the canton of Fribourg is best known in England It is flavoured by the dried herb of Melilotos officinalis in powder Cheese from milk and potatoes is manufactured in Thuringia and Saxony Cream cheese although so called is not properly cheese but is nothing more than cream dried sufficiently to be cut with a knife EGGS sixteen twenty three There is only one opinion as to the nutritive properties of eggs although the qualities of those belonging to different birds vary somewhat Those of the common hen are most esteemed as delicate food particularly when new laid The quality of eggs depends much upon the food given to the hen Eggs in general are considered most easily digestible when little subjected to the art of cookery The lightest way of dressing them is by poaching which is effected by putting them for a minute or two into brisk boiling water this coagulates the external white without doing the inner part too much Eggs are much better when new laid than a day or two afterwards The usual time allotted for boiling eggs in the shell is three to three three four minutes less time than that in boiling water will not be sufficient to solidify the white and more will make the yolk hard and less digestible it is very difficult to guess accurately as to the time Great care should be employed in putting them into the water to prevent cracking the shell which inevitably causes a portion of the white to exude and lets water into the egg Eggs are often beaten up raw in nutritive beverages sixteen twenty four Eggs are employed in a very great many articles of cookery entrees and entremets and they form an essential ingredient in pastry creams flip c It is particularly necessary that they should be quite fresh as nothing is worse than stale eggs Cobbett justly says stale or even preserved eggs are things to be run from not after sixteen twenty five The Metropolis is supplied with eggs from all parts of the kingdom and they are likewise largely imported from various places on the continent as France Holland Belgium Guernsey and Jersey It appears from official statements mentioned in McCulloch s Commercial Dictionary that the number imported from France alone amounts to about sixty million a year and supposing them on an average to cost fourpence a dozen it follows that we pay our continental neighbours above Leighty three thousand a year for eggs sixteen twenty six The eggs of different birds vary much in size and colour Those of the ostrich are the largest one laid in the menagerie in Paris weighed two lbs fourteen oz held a pint and was six inches deep this is about the usual size of those brought from Africa Travellers describe ostrich eggs as of an agreeable taste they keep longer than hen s eggs Drinking cups are often made of the shell which is very strong The eggs of the turkey are almost as mild as those of the hen the egg of the goose is large but well tasted Duck s eggs have a rich flavour the albumen is slightly transparent or bluish when set or coagulated by boiling which requires less time than hen s eggs Guinea fowl eggs are smaller and more delicate than those of the hen Eggs of wild fowl are generally coloured often spotted and the taste generally partakes somewhat of the flavour of the bird they belong to Those of land birds that are eaten as the plover lapwing ruff c are in general much esteemed but those of sea fowl have more or less a strong fishy taste The eggs of the turtle are very numerous they consist of yolk only without shell and are delicious RECIPES CHAPTER XXXIII SEPARATION OF MILK AND CREAM sixteen twenty seven If it be desired that the milk should be freed entirely from cream it should be poured into a very shallow broad pan or dish not more than one one two inch deep as cream cannot rise through a great depth of milk In cold and wet weather milk is not so rich as it is in summer and warm weather and the morning s milk is always richer than the evening s The last drawn milk of each milking at all times and seasons is richer than the first drawn and on that account should be set apart for cream Milk should be shaken as little as possible when carried from the cow to the dairy and should be poured into the pans very gently Persons not keeping cows may always have a little cream provided the milk they purchase be pure and unadulterated As soon as it comes in it should be poured into very shallow open pie dishes and set by in a very cool place and in seven or eight hours a nice cream should have risen to the surface MILK is one of the most complete of all articles of food that is to say it contains a very large number of the elements which enter into the composition of the human body It disagrees with fat heavy languid people of slow circulation and at first with many people of sedentary habits and stomachs weakened by stimulants of different kinds But if exercise can be taken and a little patience shown while the system accommodates itself to a new regimen this bland and soothing article of diet is excellent for the majority of thin nervous people especially for those who have suffered much from emotional disturbances or have relaxed their stomachs by too much tea or coffee taken too hot Milk is in fact a nutrient and a sedative at once Stomachs however have their idiosyncrasies and it sometimes proves an unwelcome and ill digested article of food As milk when good contains a good deal of respiratory material fat material which must either be burnt off or derange the liver and be rejected in other ways it may disagree because the lungs are not sufficiently used in the open air But it is very probable that there are really constitutions which cannot take to it and they should not be forced TO KEEP MILK AND CREAM IN HOT WEATHER sixteen twenty eight When the weather is very warm and it is very difficult to prevent milk from turning sour and spoiling the cream it should be scalded and it will then remain good for a few hours It must on no account be allowed to boil or there will be a skin instead of a cream upon the milk and the slower the process the safer will it be A very good plan to scald milk is to put the pan that contains it into a saucepan or wide kettle of boiling water When the surface looks thick the milk is sufficiently scalded and it should then be put away in a cool place in the same vessel that it was scalded in Cream may be kept for twenty four hours if scalded without sugar and by the addition of the latter ingredient it will remain good double the time if kept in a cool place All pans jugs and vessels intended for milk should be kept beautifully clean and well scalded before the milk is put in as any negligence in this respect may cause large quantities of it to be spoiled and milk should never be kept in vessels of zinc or copper Milk may be preserved good in hot weather for a few hours by placing the jug which contains it in ice or very cold water or a pinch of bicarbonate of soda may be introduced into the liquid MILK when of good quality is of an opaque white colour the cream always comes to the top the well known milky odour is strong it will boil without altering its appearance in these respects the little bladders which arise on the surface will renew themselves if broken by the spoon To boil milk is in fact the simplest way of testing its quality The commonest adulterations of milk are not of a hurtful character It is a good deal thinned with water and sometimes thickened with a little starch or colored with yolk of egg or even saffron but these processes have nothing murderous in them CURDS AND WHEY sixteen twenty nine INGREDIENTS A very small piece of rennet one two gallon of milk Mode Procure from the butcher s a small piece of rennet which is the stomach of the calf taken as soon as it is killed scoured and well rubbed with salt and stretched on sticks to dry Pour some boiling water on the rennet and let it remain for six hours then use the liquor to turn the milk The milk should be warm and fresh from the cow if allowed to cool it must be heated till it is of a degree quite equal to new milk but do not let it be too hot About a tablespoonful or rather more would be sufficient to turn the above proportion of milk into curds and whey and whilst the milk is turning let it be kept in rather a warm place Time From two to three hours to turn the milk Seasonable at any time DEVONSHIRE CREAM sixteen thirty The milk should stand twenty four hours in the winter half that time when the weather is very warm The milkpan is then set on a stove and should there remain until the milk is quite hot but it must not boil or there will be a thick skin on the surface When it is sufficiently done the undulations on the surface look thick and small rings appear The time required for scalding cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat of the fire but the slower it is done the better The pan should be placed in the dairy when the cream is sufficiently scalded and skimmed the following day This cream is so much esteemed that it is sent to the London markets in small square tins and is exceedingly delicious eaten with fresh fruit In Devonshire butter is made from this cream and is usually very firm DEVONSHIRE JUNKET sixteen thirty one INGREDIENTS To every pint of new milk allow two dessertspoonfuls of brandy one dessertspoonful of sugar and one one two dessertspoonful of prepared rennet thick cream pounded cinnamon or grated nutmeg Mode Make the milk blood warm put it into a deep dish with the brandy sugar and rennet stir it altogether and cover it over until it is set Then spread some thick or clotted cream over the top grate some nutmeg and strew some sugar over and the dish will be ready to serve Time About two hours to set the milk Seasonable at any time TO KEEP AND CHOOSE FRESH BUTTER sixteen thirty two Fresh butter should be kept in a dark cool place and in as large a mass as possible Mould as much only as is required as the more surface is exposed the more liability there will be to spoil and the outside very soon becomes rancid Fresh butter should be kept covered with white paper For small larders butter coolers of red brick are now very much used for keeping fresh butter in warm weather These coolers are made with a large bell shaped cover into the top of which a little cold water should be poured and in summer time very frequently changed and the butter must be kept covered These coolers keep butter remarkably firm in hot weather and are extremely convenient for those whose larder accommodation is limited Illustration BUTTER DISH In choosing fresh butter remember it should smell deliciously and be of an equal colour all through if it smells sour it has not been sufficiently washed from the buttermilk and if veiny and open it has probably been worked with a staler or an inferior sort TO PRESERVE AND TO CHOOSE SALT BUTTER sixteen thirty three In large families where salt butter is purchased a tub at a time the first thing to be done is to turn the whole of the butter out and with a clean knife to scrape the outside the tub should then be wiped with a clean cloth and sprinkled all round with salt the butter replaced and the lid kept on to exclude the air It is necessary to take these precautions as sometimes a want of proper cleanliness in the dairymaid causes the outside of the butter to become rancid and if the scraping be neglected the whole mass would soon become spoiled To choose salt butter plunge a knife into it and if when drawn out the blade smells rancid or unpleasant the butter is bad The layers in tubs will vary greatly the butter being made at different times so to try if the whole tub be good the cask should be unhooped and the butter tried between the staves It is not necessary to state that butter is extracted from cream or from unskimmed milk by the churn Of course it partakes of the qualities of the milk and winter butter is said not to be so good as spring butter A word of caution is necessary about rancid butter Nobody eats it on bread but it is sometimes used in cooking in forms in which the acidity can be more or less disguised So much the worse it is almost poisonous disguise it as you may Never under any exigency whatever be tempted into allowing butter with even a soupcon of turning to enter into the composition of any dish that appears on your table And in general the more you can do without the employment of butter that has been subjected to the influence of heat the better The woman of modern times is not a leech but she might often keep the leech from the door if she would give herself the trouble to invent innocent sauces BUTTER MOULDS for Moulding Fresh Butter Illustration DISH OF ROLLED BUTTER sixteen thirty four Butter moulds or wooden stamps for moulding fresh butter are much used and are made in a variety of forms and shapes In using them let them be kept scrupulously clean and before the butter is pressed in the interior should be well wetted with cold water the butter must then be pressed in the mould opened and the perfect shape taken out The butter may be then dished and garnished with a wreath of parsley if for a cheese course if for breakfast put it into an ornamental butter dish with a little water at the bottom should the weather be very warm CURLED BUTTER sixteen thirty five Tie a strong cloth by two of the corners to an iron hook in the wall make a knot with the other two ends so that a stick might pass through Put the butter into the cloth twist it tightly over a dish into which the butter will fall through the knot so forming small and pretty little strings The butter may then be garnished with parsley if to serve with a cheese course or it may be sent to table plain for breakfast in an ornamental dish Squirted butter for garnishing hams salads eggs c is made by forming a piece of stiff paper in the shape of a cornet and squeezing the butter in fine strings from the hole at the bottom Scooped butter is made by dipping a teaspoon or scooper in warm water and then scooping the butter quickly and thin In warm weather it would not be necessary to heat the spoon BUTTER may be kept fresh for ten or twelve days by a very simple process Knead it well in cold water till the buttermilk is extracted then put it in a glazed jar which invert in another putting into the latter a sufficient quantity of water to exclude the air Renew the water every day FAIRY BUTTER sixteen thirty six INGREDIENTS The yolks of two hard boiled eggs one tablespoonful of orange flower water two tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar one four lb of good fresh butter Mode Beat the yolks of the eggs smoothly in a mortar with the orange flower water and the sugar until the whole is reduced to a fine paste add the butter and force all through an old but clean cloth by wringing the cloth and squeezing the butter very hard The butter will then drop on the plate in large and small pieces according to the holes in the cloth Plain butter may be done in the same manner and is very quickly prepared besides having a very good effect BUTTER White coloured butter is said not to be so good as the yellow but the yellow colour is often artificially produced by the introduction of colouring matter into the churn ANCHOVY BUTTER sixteen thirty seven INGREDIENTS To every lb of butter allow six anchovies one small bunch of parsley Mode Wash bone and pound the anchovies well in a mortar scald the parsley chop it and rub through a sieve then pound all the ingredients together mix well and make the butter into pats immediately This makes a pretty dish if fancifully moulded for breakfast or supper and should be garnished with parsley Average cost ones eightd Sufficient to make two dishes with four pats each Seasonable at any time CHEESE sixteen thirty eight In families where much cheese is consumed and it is bought in large quantities a piece from the whole cheese should be cut the larger quantity spread with a thickly buttered sheet of white paper and the outside occasionally wiped To keep cheeses moist that are in daily use when they come from table a damp cloth should be wrapped round them and the cheese put into a pan with a cover to it in a cool but not very dry place To ripen cheeses and bring them forward put them into a damp cellar and to check too large a production of mites spirits may be poured into the parts affected Pieces of cheese which are too near the rind or too dry to put on table may be made into Welsh rare bits or grated down and mixed with macaroni Cheeses may be preserved in a perfect state for years by covering them with parchment made pliable by soaking in water or by rubbing them over with a coating of melted fat The cheeses selected should be free from cracks or bruises of any kind CHEESE It is well known that some persons like cheese in a state of decay and even alive There is no accounting for tastes and it maybe hard to show why mould which is vegetation should not be eaten as well as salad or maggots as well as eels But generally speaking decomposing bodies are not wholesome eating and the line must be drawn somewhere STILTON CHEESE Illustration STILTON CHEESE sixteen thirty nine Stilton cheese or British Parmesan as it is sometimes called is generally preferred to all other cheeses by those whose authority few will dispute Those made in May or June are usually served at Christmas or to be in prime order should be kept from ten to twelve months or even longer An artificial ripeness in Stilton cheese is sometimes produced by inserting a small piece of decayed Cheshire into an aperture at the top From three weeks to a month is sufficient time to ripen the cheese An additional flavour may also be obtained by scooping out a piece from the top and pouring therein port sherry Madeira or old ale and letting the cheese absorb these for two or three weeks But that cheese is the finest which is ripened without any artificial aid is the opinion of those who are judges in these matters In serving a Stilton cheese the top of it should be cut off to form a lid and a napkin or piece of white paper with a frill at the top pinned round When the cheese goes from table the lid should be replaced MODE OF SERVING CHEESE Illustration CHEESE GLASS sixteen forty The usual mode of serving cheese at good tables is to cut a small quantity of it into neat square pieces and to put them into a glass cheese dish this dish being handed round Should the cheese crumble much of course this method is rather wasteful and it may then be put on the table in the piece and the host may cut from it When served thus the cheese must always be carefully scraped and laid on a white d oyley or napkin neatly folded Cream cheese is often served in a cheese course and sometimes grated Parmesan the latter should he put into a covered glass dish Rusks cheese biscuits pats or slices of butter and salad cucumber or water cresses should always form part of a cheese course SMOKING CHEESES The Romans smoked their cheeses to give them a sharp taste They possessed public places expressly for this use and subject to police regulations which no one could evade A celebrated gourmand remarked that a dinner without cheese is like a woman with one eye CHEESE SANDWICHES sixteen forty one INGREDIENTS Slices of brown bread and butter thin slices of cheese Mode Cut from a nice fat Cheshire or any good rich cheese some slices about one two inch thick and place them between some slices of brown bread and butter like sandwiches Place them on a plate in the oven and when the bread is toasted serve on a napkin very hot and very quickly Time ten minutes in a brisk oven Average cost one one twod each sandwich Sufficient Allow a sandwich for each person Seasonable at any time CHEESE One of the most important products of coagulated milk is cheese Unfermented or cream cheese when quite fresh is good for subjects with whom milk does not disagree but cheese in its commonest shape is only fit for sedentary people as an after dinner stimulant and in very small quantity Bread and cheese as a meal is only fit for soldiers on march or labourers in the open air who like it because it holds the stomach a long time CAYENNE CHEESES sixteen forty two INGREDIENTS one two lb of butter one two lb of flour one two lb of grated cheese one three teaspoonful of cayenne one three teaspoonful of salt water Mode Rub the butter in the flour add the grated cheese cayenne and salt and mix these ingredients well together Moisten with sufficient water to make the whole into a paste roll out and cut into fingers about four inches in length Bake them in a moderate oven a very light colour and serve very hot Time fifteen to twenty minutes Average cost ones fourd Sufficient for six or seven persons Seasonable at any time TO MAKE A FONDUE sixteen forty three INGREDIENTS four eggs the weight of two in Parmesan or good Cheshire cheese the weight of two in butter pepper and salt to taste Mode Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs beat the former in a basin and grate the cheese or cut it into very thin flakes Parmesan or Cheshire cheese may be used whichever is the most convenient although the former is considered more suitable for this dish or an equal quantity of each may be used Break the butter into small pieces add it to the other ingredients with sufficient pepper and salt to season nicely and beat the mixture thoroughly Well whisk the whites of the eggs stir them lightly in and either bake the fondue in a souffle dish or small round cake tin Fill the dish only half full as the fondue should rise very much Pin a napkin round the tin or dish and serve very hot and very quickly If allowed to stand after it is withdrawn from the oven the beauty and lightness of this preparation will be entirely spoiled Time From fifteen to twenty minutes Average cost tend Sufficient for four or five persons Seasonable at any time BRILLAT SAVARIN S FONDUE An excellent Recipe sixteen forty four INGREDIENTS Eggs cheese butter pepper and salt Mode Take the same number of eggs as there are guests weigh the eggs in the shell allow a third of their weight in Gruyere cheese and a piece of butter one sixth of the weight of the cheese Break the eggs into a basin beat them well add the cheese which should be grated and the butter which should be broken into small pieces Stir these ingredients together with a wooden spoon put the mixture into a lined saucepan place it over the fire and stir until the substance is thick and soft Put in a little salt according to the age of the cheese and a good sprinkling of pepper and serve the fondue on a very hot silver or metal plate Do not allow the fondue to remain on the fire after the mixture is set as if it boils it will be entirely spoiled Brillat Savarin recommends that some choice Burgundy should he handed round with this dish We have given this recipe exactly as he recommends it to be made but we have tried it with good Cheshire cheese and found it answer remarkably well Time About four minutes to set the mixture Average cost for four persons tend Sufficient Allow one egg with the other ingredients in proportion for one person Seasonable at any time MACARONI as usually served with the CHEESE COURSE I sixteen forty five INGREDIENTS one two lb of pipe macaroni one four lb of butter six oz of Parmesan or Cheshire cheese pepper and salt to taste one pint of milk two pints of water bread crumbs Mode Put the milk and water into a saucepan with sufficient salt to flavour it place it on the fire and when it boils quickly drop in the macaroni Keep the water boiling until it is quite tender drain the macaroni and put it into a deep dish Have ready the grated cheese either Parmesan or Cheshire sprinkle it amongst the macaroni and some of the butter cut into small pieces reserving some of the cheese for the top layer Season with a little pepper and cover the top layer of cheese with some very fine bread crumbs Warm without oiling the remainder of the butter and pour it gently over the bread crumbs Place the dish before a bright fire to brown the crumbs turn it once or twice that it may be equally coloured and serve very hot The top of the macaroni may be browned with a salamander which is even better than placing it before the fire as the process is more expeditious but it should never be browned in the oven as the butter would oil and so impart a very disagreeable flavour to the dish In boiling the macaroni let it be perfectly tender but firm no part beginning to melt and the form entirely preserved It may be boiled in plain water with a little salt instead of using milk but should then have a small piece of butter mixed with it Time one one two to one three four hour to boil the macaroni five minutes to brown it before the fire Average cost ones sixd Sufficient for six or seven persons Seasonable at any time Note Riband macaroni may be dressed in the same

drain it and put it into rather a deep dish Have ready a pint of good brown gravy pour it hot over the macaroni and send it to table with grated Parmesan served on a separate dish When the flavour is liked a little pounded mace may be added to the water in which the macaroni is boiled but this must always be sparingly added as it will impart a very strong flavour Time one one two to one three four hour to boil the macaroni Average cost with the gravy and cheese ones threed Sufficient for three or four persons Seasonable at any time POUNDED CHEESE sixteen forty eight INGREDIENTS To every lb of cheese allow three oz of fresh butter Mode To pound cheese is an economical way of using it if it has become dry it is exceedingly good spread on bread and is the best way of eating it for those whose digestion is weak Cut up the cheese into small pieces and pound it smoothly in a mortar adding butter in the above proportion Press it down into a jar cover with clarified butter and it will keep for several days The flavour may be very much increased by adding mixed mustard about a teaspoonful to every lb or cayenne or pounded mace Curry powder is also not unfrequently mixed with it RAMAKINS to

seasoning and pound these ingredients well together Whisk the whites of the eggs mix them with the paste and put it into small pans or saucers which should not be more than half filled Bake them from ten to twelve minutes and serve them very hot and very quickly This batter answers equally well for macaroni after it is boiled tender Time ten to twelve minutes Average cost ones fourd Sufficient for

flavour Fold the paste in three roll it out again and sprinkle more cheese over fold the paste roll it out and with a paste cutter shape it in any way that may be desired Bake the ramakins in a brisk oven from ten to fifteen minutes dish them on a hot napkin and serve quickly The appearance of this dish may be very much improved by brushing the ramakins over with yolk of egg before they are placed

some nice rich sound cheese into rather thin slices melt it in a cheese toaster on a hot plate or over steam and when melted add a small quantity of mixed mustard and a seasoning of pepper stir the cheese until it is completely dissolved then brown it before the fire or with a salamander Fill the bottom of the cheese toaster with hot water and serve with dry or buttered toasts whichever may be preferred Our engraving illustrates a cheese toaster with hot water reservoir the cheese is melted in the upper tin which is placed in another vessel of boiling water so keeping the preparation beautifully hot A small quantity of porter or port wine is sometimes mixed with the cheese and if it be not very rich a few pieces of butter may be mixed with it to great advantage Sometimes the melted cheese is spread on the toasts and then laid in the cheese dish at the top of the hot water Whichever way it is served it is highly necessary that the mixture be very hot and very quickly sent to table or it will be worthless Time About five minutes to melt the cheese Average cost one one twod per slice Sufficient Allow a slice to each person Seasonable at any time TOASTED CHEESE or WELSH

the bread slightly without hardening or burning it and spread it with butter Cut some slices not quite so large as the bread from a good rich fat cheese lay them on the toasted bread in a cheese toaster be careful that the cheese does not burn and let it be equally melted Spread over the top a little made mustard and a seasoning of pepper and serve very hot with very hot plates To facilitate the melting of the cheese it may be cut into thin flakes or toasted on one side before it is laid on the bread As it is so essential to send this dish hot to table it is a good plan to melt the cheese in small round silver or metal pans and to send these pans to table allowing one for each guest Slices of dry or buttered toast should always accompany them with mustard pepper and salt Time About five minutes to melt the cheese Average cost one one twod each slice Sufficient Allow a slice to each person Seasonable at any time Note Should the cheese be dry a little butter mixed with it will be an improvement COW CHEESE It was only fifty years after Aristotle the fourth century before Christ that butter began to be noticed as an aliment The Greeks in imitation of the Parthians and Scythians

apply the tongue to the large end of the egg and if it feels warm it is new and may be relied on as a fresh egg Another mode of ascertaining their freshness is to hold them before a lighted candle or to the light and if the egg looks clear it will be tolerably good if thick it is stale and if there is a black spot attached to the shell it is worthless No egg should be used for culinary purposes with the slightest taint in it as it will render perfectly useless those with which it has been mixed Eggs that are purchased and that cannot be relied on should always be broken in a cup and then put into a basin by this means stale or bad eggs may be easily rejected without wasting the others EGGS contain for their volume a greater quantity of nutriment than any other article of food But it does not follow that they are always good for weak stomachs quite the contrary for it is often a great object to give the stomach a large surface to work upon a considerable volume of ingesta over which the nutritive matter is diffused and so exposed to the action of the gastric juice at many points There are many persons who cannot digest eggs however cooked It is said however that their digestibility decreases in proportion to the degree in which they are hardened by boiling TO KEEP EGGS FRESH FOR SEVERAL WEEKS sixteen fifty five Have ready a large saucepan capable of holding three or four quarts full of boiling water Put the eggs into a cabbage net say twenty at a time and hold them in the water which must be kept boiling for twenty seconds Proceed in this manner till you have done as many eggs as you wish to preserve then pack them away in sawdust We have tried this method of preserving eggs and can vouch for its excellence they will be found at the end of two or three months quite good enough for culinary purposes and although the white may be a little tougher than that of a new laid egg the yolk will be nearly the same Many persons keep eggs for a long time by smearing the shells with butter or sweet oil they should then be packed in plenty of bran or sawdust and the eggs not allowed to touch each other Eggs for storing should be collected in fine weather and should not be more than twenty four hours old when they are packed away or their flavour when used cannot be relied on Another simple way of preserving eggs is to immerse them in lime water soon after they have been laid and then to put the vessel containing the lime water in a cellar or cool outhouse Seasonable The best time for preserving eggs is from July to September EGGS The quality of eggs is said to be very much affected by the food of the fowls who lay them Herbs and grain together make a better food than grain only When the hens eat too many insects the eggs have a disagreeable flavour TO BOIL EGGS FOR BREAKFAST SALADS c Illustration EGG STAND FOR THE BREAKFAST TABLE sixteen fifty six Eggs for boiling cannot be too fresh or boiled too soon after they are laid but rather a longer time should be allowed for boiling a new laid egg than for one that is three or four days old Have ready a saucepan of boiling water put the eggs into it gently with a spoon letting the spoon touch the bottom of the saucepan before it is withdrawn that the egg may not fall and consequently crack For those who like eggs lightly boiled three minutes will be found sufficient three three four to four minutes will be ample time to set the white nicely and if liked hard six to seven minutes will not be found too long Should the eggs be unusually large as those of black Spanish fowls sometimes are allow an extra one two minute for them Eggs for salads should be boiled from ten minutes to one four hour and should be placed in a basin of cold water for a few minutes they should then be rolled on the table with the hand and the shell will peel off easily Time To boil eggs lightly for invalids or children three minutes to boil eggs to suit the generality of tastes three three four to four minutes to boil eggs hard six to seven minutes for salads ten to fifteen minutes Note Silver or plated egg dishes like that shown in our engraving are now very much used The price of the one illustrated is Ltwo twos and may be purchased of Messrs R J Slack three hundred thirty six Strand EGGS When fresh eggs are dropped into a vessel full of boiling water they crack because the eggs being well filled the shells give way to the efforts of the interior fluids dilated by heat If the volume of hot water be small the shells do not crack because its temperature is reduced by the eggs before the interior dilation can take place Stale eggs again do not crack because the air inside is easily compressed BUTTERED EGGS sixteen fifty seven INGREDIENTS four new laid eggs two oz of butter Mode Procure the eggs new laid if possible break them into a basin and beat them well put the butter into another basin which place in boiling water and stir till the butter is melted Pour that and the eggs into a lined saucepan hold it over a gentle fire and as the mixture begins to warm pour it two or three times into the basin and back again that the two ingredients may be well incorporated Keep stirring the eggs and butter one way until they are hot without boiling and serve on hot buttered toast If the mixture is allowed to boil it will curdle and so be entirely spoiled Time About five

perfectly fresh but not quite new laid those that are about thirty six hours old are the best for the purpose If quite new laid the white is so milky it is almost impossible to set it and on the other hand if the egg be at all stale it is equally difficult to poach it nicely Strain some boiling water into a deep clean frying pan break the egg into a cup without damaging the yolk and when the water boils remove the pan to the side of the fire and gently slip the egg into it Place the pan over a gentle fire and keep the water simmering until the white looks nicely set when the egg is ready Take it up gently with a slice cut away the ragged edges of the white and serve either on toasted bread or on slices of ham or bacon or on spinach c A poached egg should not be overdone as its appearance and taste will be quite spoiled if the yolk be allowed to harden When the egg is slipped into the water the white should be gathered together to keep it a little in form or the cup should be turned over it for one minute To poach an egg to perfection is rather a difficult operation so for inexperienced cooks a tin egg poacher may be purchased which greatly facilitates this manner of dressing ecgs Our illustration clearly shows what it is it consists of a tin plate with a handle with a space for three perforated cups An egg should be broken into each cup and the machine then placed in a stewpan of boiling water which has been previously strained When the whites of the eggs appear set they are done and should then be carefully slipped on to the toast or spinach or with whatever they are served In poaching eggs in a frying pan never do more than four at a time and when a little vinegar is liked mixed with the water in which the eggs are done use the above proportion Time two one

for man the Cereals hold the first place By means of skilful cultivation mankind have transformed the original forms of these growths poor and ill flavoured as they perhaps were into various fruitful and agreeable species which yield an abundant and pleasant supply Classified according to their respective richness in alimentary elements the Cereals stand thus Wheat and its varieties Rye Barley Oats Rice Indian Corn Everybody knows it is wheat flour which yields the best bread Rye bread is viscous hard less easily soluble by the gastric juice and not so rich in nutritive power Flour produced from barley Indian corn or rice is not so readily made into bread and the article when made is heavy and indigestible sixteen sixty nine On examining a grain of corn from any of the numerous cereals Footnote Cereal a corn producing plant from Ceres the goddess of agriculture used in the preparation of flour such as wheat maize rye barley c it will be found to consist of two parts the husk or exterior covering which is generally of a dark colour and the inner or albuminous part which is more or less white In grinding these two portions are separated and the husk being blown away in the process of winnowing the flour remains in the form of a light brown powder consisting principally of starch and gluten In order to render it white it undergoes a process called bolting It is passed through a series of fine sieves which separate the coarser parts leaving behind fine white flour the fine firsts of the corn dealer The process of bolting as just described tends to deprive flour of its gluten the coarser and darker portion containing much of that substance while the lighter part is peculiarly rich in starch Bran contains a large proportion of gluten hence it will be seen why brown broad is so much more nutritious than white in fact we may lay it down as a general rule that the whiter the bread the less nourishment it contains Majendie proved this by feeding a dog for forty days with white wheaten bread at the end of which time he died while another dog fed on brown bread made with flour mixed with bran lived without any disturbance of his health The bolting process then is rather injurious than beneficial in its result and is one of the numerous instances where fashion has chosen a wrong standard to go by In ancient times down to the Emperors no bolted flour was known In many parts of Germany the entire meal is used and in no part of the world are the digestive organs of the people in a better condition In years of famine when corn is scarce the use of bolted flour is most culpable for from eighteen to twenty per cent is lost in bran Brown bread has of late years become very popular and many physicians have recommended it to invalids with weak digestions with great success This rage for white bread has introduced adulterations of a very serious character affecting the health of the whole community Potatoes are added for this purpose but this is a comparatively harmless cheat only reducing the nutritive property of the bread but bone dust and alum are also put in which are far from harmless sixteen seventy Bread making is a very ancient art indeed The Assyrians Egyptians and Greeks used to make bread in which oil with aniseed and other spices was an element but this was unleavened Every family used to prepare the bread for its own consumption the trade of baking not having yet taken shape It is said that somewhere about the beginning of the thirtieth Olympiad the slave of an archon at Athens made leavened bread by accident He had left some wheaten dough in an earthen pan and forgotten it some days afterwards he lighted upon it again and found it turning sour His first thought was to throw it away but his master coming up he mixed this now acescent dough with some fresh dough which he was working at The bread thus produced by the introduction of dough in which alcoholic fermentation had begun was found delicious by the archon and his friends and the slave being summoned and catechised told the secret It spread all over Athens and everybody wanting leavened bread at once certain persons set up as bread makers or bakers In a short time bread baking became quite an art and Athenian bread was quoted all over Greece as the best bread just as the honey of Hyamettus was celebrated as the best honey sixteen seventy one In our own times and among civilized peoples bread has become an article of food of the first necessity and properly so for it constitutes of itself a complete life sustainer the gluten starch and sugar which it contains representing azotized and hydro carbonated nutrients and combining the sustaining powers of the animal and vegetable kingdoms in one product sixteen seventy two WHEATEN BREAD The finest wholesomest and most savoury bread is made from wheaten flour There are of wheat three leading qualities the soft the medium and the hard wheat the last of which yields a kind of bread that is not so white as that made from soft wheat but is richer in gluten and consequently more nutritive sixteen seventy three RYE BREAD This comes next to wheaten bread it is not so rich in gluten but is said to keep fresh longer and to have some laxative qualities sixteen seventy four BARLEY BREAD INDIAN CORN BREAD c Bread made from barley maize oats rice potatoes c rises badly because the grains in question contain but little gluten which makes the bread heavy close in texture and difficult of digestion in fact corn flour has to be added before panification can take place In countries where wheat is scarce and maize abundant the people make the latter a chief article of sustenance when prepared in different forms BREAD MAKING sixteen seventy five PANIFICATION or bread making consists of the following processes in the case of Wheaten Flour Fifty or sixty per cent of water is added to the flour with the addition of some leavening matter and preferably of yeast from malt and hops All kinds of leavening matter have however been and are still used in different parts of the world in the East Indies toddy which is a liquor that flows from the wounded cocoa nut tree and in the West Indies dunder or the refuse of the distillation of rum The dough then undergoes the well known process called kneading The yeast produces fermentation a process which may be thus described The dough reacting upon the leavening matter introduced the starch of the flour is transformed into saccharine matter the saccharine matter being afterwards changed into alcohol and carbonic acid The dough must be well bound and yet allow the escape of the little bubbles of carbonic acid which accompany the fermentation and which in their passage cause the numerous little holes which are seen in light bread sixteen seventy six The yeast must be good and fresh if the bread is to be digestible and nice Stale yeast produces instead of vinous fermentation an acetous fermentation which flavours the bread and makes it disagreeable A poor thin yeast produces an imperfect fermentation the result being a heavy unwholesome loaf sixteen seventy seven When the dough is well kneaded it is left to stand for some time and then as soon as it begins to swell it is divided into loaves after which it is again left to stand when it once more swells up and manifests for the last time the symptoms of fermentation It is then put into the oven where the water contained in the dough is partly evaporated and the loaves swell up again while a yellow crust begins to form upon the surface When the bread is sufficiently baked the bottom crust is hard and resonant if struck with the finger while the crumb is elastic and rises again after being pressed down with the finger The bread is in all probability baked sufficiently if on opening the door of the oven you are met by a cloud of steam which quickly passes away sixteen seventy eight One word as to the unwholesomeness of new bread and hot rolls When bread is taken out of the oven it is full of moisture the starch is held together in masses and the bread instead of being crusted so as to expose each grain of starch to the saliva actually prevents their digestion by being formed by the teeth into leathery poreless masses which lie on the stomach like so many bullets Bread should always be at least a day old before it is eaten and if properly made and kept in a cool dry place ought to be perfectly soft and palatable at the end of three or four days Hot rolls swimming in melted butter and new bread ought to be carefully shunned by everybody who has the slightest respect for that much injured individual the Stomach sixteen seventy nine AERATED BREAD It is not unknown to some of our readers that doctor Dauglish of Malvern has recently patented a process for making bread light without the use of leaven The ordinary process of bread making by fermentation is tedious and much labour of human hands is requisite in the kneading in order that the dough may be thoroughly interpenetrated with the leaven The new process impregnates the bread by the application of machinery with carbonic acid gas or fixed air Different opinions are expressed about the bread but it is curious to note that as corn is now reaped by machinery and dough is baked by machinery the whole process of bread making is probably in course of undergoing changes which will emancipate both the housewife and the professional baker from a large amount of labour sixteen eighty In the production of Aerated Bread wheaten flour water salt and carbonic acid gas generated by proper machinery are the only materials employed We need not inform our readers that carbonic acid gas is the source of the effervescence whether in common water coming from a depth or in lemonade or any aerated drink Its action in the new bread takes the place of fermentation in the old sixteen eighty one In the patent process the dough is mixed in a great iron ball inside which is a system of paddles perpetually turning and doing the kneading part of the business Into this globe the flour is dropped till it is full and then the common atmospheric air is pumped out and the pure gas turned on The gas is followed by the water which has been aerated for the purpose and then begins the churning or kneading part of the business sixteen eighty two Of course it is not long before we have the dough and very light and nice it looks This is caught in tins and passed on to the floor of the oven which is an endless floor moving slowly through the fire Done to a turn the loaves emerge at the other end of the apartment and the Aerated Bread is made sixteen eighty three It may be added that it is a good plan to change one s baker from time to time and so secure a change in the quality of the bread that is eaten sixteen eighty four MIXED BREADS Rye bread is hard of digestion and requires longer and slower baking than wheaten bread It is better when made with leaven of wheaten flour rather than yeast and turns out lighter It should not be eaten till two days old It will keep a long time sixteen eighty five A good bread may be made by mixing rye flour wheat flour and rice paste in equal proportions also by mixing rye wheat and barley In Norway it is said that they only bake their barley broad once a year such is its keeping quality sixteen eighty six Indian corn flour mixed with wheat flour half with half makes a nice bread but it is not considered very digestible though it keeps well sixteen eighty seven Rice cannot be made into bread nor can potatoes but one third potato flour to three fourths wheaten flour makes a tolerably good loaf sixteen eighty eight A very good bread better than the ordinary sort and of a delicious flavour is said to be produced by adopting the following recipe Take ten parts of wheat flour five parts of potato flour one part of rice paste knead together add the yeast and bake as usual This is of course cheaper than wheaten bread sixteen eighty nine Flour when freshly ground is too glutinous to make good bread and should therefore not be used immediately but should be kept dry for a few weeks and stirred occasionally until it becomes dry and crumbles easily between the fingers sixteen ninety Flour should be perfectly dry before being used for bread or cakes if at all damp the preparation is sure to be heavy Before mixing it with the other ingredients it is a good plan to place it for an hour or two before the fire until it feels warm and dry sixteen ninety one Yeast from home brewed beer is generally preferred to any other it is very bitter and on that account should be well washed and put away until the thick mass settles If it still continues bitter the process should be repeated and before being used all the water floating at the top must be poured off German yeast is now very much used and should be moistened and thoroughly mixed with the milk or water with which the bread is to be made sixteen ninety two The following observations are extracted from a valuable work on Bread making Footnote The English Bread Book By Eliza Acton London Longman and will be found very useful to our readers sixteen ninety three The first thing required for making wholesome bread is the utmost cleanliness the next is the soundness and sweetness of all the ingredients used for it and in addition to these there must be attention and care through the whole process sixteen ninety four An almost certain way of spoiling dough is to leave it half made and to allow it to become cold before it is finished The other most common causes of failure are using yeast which is no longer sweet or which has been frozen or has had hot liquid poured over it sixteen ninety five Too small a proportion of yeast or insufficient time allowed for the dough to rise will cause the bread to be heavy sixteen ninety six Heavy bread will also most likely be the result of making the dough very hard and letting it become quite cold particularly in winter sixteen ninety seven If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself that is to say if the mixing and kneading be neglected when it has reached the proper point for either sour bread will probably be the consequence in warm weather and bad bread in any The goodness will also be endangered by placing it so near a fire as to make any part of it hot instead of maintaining the gentle and equal degree of heat required for its due fermentation sixteen ninety eight MILK OR BUTTER Milk which is not perfectly sweet will not only injure the flavour of the bread but in sultry weather will often cause it to be quite uneatable yet either of them if fresh and good will materially improve its quality sixteen ninety nine To keep bread sweet and fresh as soon as it is cold it should be put into a clean earthen pan with a cover to it this pan should be placed at a little distance from the ground to allow a current of air to pass underneath Some persons prefer keeping bread on clean wooden shelves without being covered that the crust may not soften Stale bread may be freshened by warming it through in a gentle oven Stale pastry cakes c may also be improved by this method seventeen hundred The utensils required for making bread on a moderate scale are a kneading trough or pan sufficiently large that the dough may be kneaded freely without throwing the flour over the edges and also to allow for its rising a hair sieve for straining yeast and one or two strong spoons seventeen oh one Yeast must always be good of its kind and in a fitting state to produce ready and proper fermentation Yeast of strong beer or ale produces more effect than that of milder kinds and the fresher the yeast the smaller the quantity will be required to raise the dough seventeen oh two As a general rule the oven for baking bread should be rather quick and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without hardening the outside The oven door should not be opened after the bread is put in until the dough is set or has become firm as the cool air admitted will have an unfavourable effect on it seventeen oh three Brick ovens are generally considered the best adapted for baking bread these should be heated with wood faggots and then swept and mopped out to cleanse them for the reception of the bread Iron ovens are more difficult to manage being apt to burn the surface of the bread before the middle is baked To remedy this a few clean bricks should be set at the bottom of the oven close together to receive the tins of bread In many modern stoves the ovens are so much improved that they bake admirably and they can always be brought to the required temperature when it is higher than is needed by leaving the door open for a time A FEW HINTS respecting the Making and Baking of CAKES seventeen oh four Eggs should always be broken into a cup the whites and yolks separated and they should always be strained Breaking the eggs thus the bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling the others and so cause no waste As eggs are used instead of yeast they should be very thoroughly whisked they are generally sufficiently beaten when thick enough to carry the drop that falls from the whisk seventeen oh five Loaf Sugar should be well pounded and then sifted through a fine sieve seventeen oh six Currants should be nicely washed picked dried in a cloth and then carefully examined that no pieces of grit or stone may be left amongst them They should then be laid on a dish before the fire to become thoroughly dry as if added damp to the other ingredients cakes will be liable to be heavy seventeen oh seven Good Butter should always be used in the manufacture of cakes and if beaten to a cream it saves much time and labour to warm but not melt it before beating seventeen oh eight Less butter and eggs are required for cakes when yeast is mixed with the other ingredients seventeen oh nine The heat of the oven is of great importance especially for large cakes If the heat be not tolerably fierce the batter will not rise If the oven is too quick and there is any danger of the cake burning or catching put a sheet of clean paper over the top Newspaper or paper that has been printed on should never be used for this purpose seventeen ten To know when a cake is sufficiently baked plunge a clean knife into the middle of it draw it quickly out and if it looks in the least sticky put the cake back and close the oven door until the cake is done seventeen eleven Cakes should be kept in closed tin canisters or jars and in a dry place Those made with yeast do not keep so long as those made without it BISCUITS seventeen twelve Since the establishment of the large modern biscuit manufactories biscuits have been produced both cheap and wholesome in comparatively speaking endless variety Their actual component parts are perhaps known only to the various makers but there are several kinds of biscuits which have long been in use that may here be advantageously described seventeen thirteen Biscuits belong to the class of unfermented bread and are perhaps the most wholesome of that class In cases where fermented bread does not agree with the human stomach they may be recommended in many instances they are considered lighter and less liable to create acidity and flatulence The name is derived from the French bis cuit twice baked because originally that was the mode of entirely depriving them of all moisture to insure their keeping but although that process is no longer employed the name is retained The use of this kind of bread on land is pretty general and some varieties are luxuries but at sea biscuits are articles of the first necessity seventeen fourteen SEA or SHIP BISCUITS are made of wheat flour from which only the coarsest bran has been separated The dough is made up as stiff as it can be worked and is then formed into shapes and baked in an oven after which the biscuits are exposed in lofts over the oven until perfectly dry to prevent them from becoming mouldy when stored seventeen fifteen CAPTAINS BISCUITS are made in a similar manner only of fine flour RECIPES CHAPTER XXXV TO MAKE YEAST FOR BREAD seventeen sixteen INGREDIENTS one one two oz of hops three quarts of water one lb of bruised malt one two pint of yeast Mode Boil the hops in the water for twenty minutes let it stand for about five minutes then add it to one lb of bruised malt prepared as for brewing Let the mixture stand covered till about lukewarm then put in not quite one two pint of yeast keep it warm and let it work three or four hours then put it into small one two pint bottles ginger beer bottles are the best for the purpose cork them well and tie them down The yeast is now ready for use it will keep good for a few weeks and one bottle will be found sufficient for eighteen lbs of flour When required for use boil three lbs of potatoes without salt mash them in the same water in which they were boiled and rub them through a colander Stir in about one two lb of flour then put in the yeast pour it in the middle of the flour and let it stand warm on the hearth all night and in the morning let it be quite warm when it is kneaded The bottles of yeast require very careful opening as it is generally exceedingly ripe Time twenty minutes to boil the hops and water the yeast to work three or four hours Sufficient one two pint sufficient for eighteen lbs of flour KIRKLEATHAM YEAST seventeen seventeen INGREDIENTS two oz of hops four quarts of water one two lb of flour one two pint of yeast Mode Boil the hops and water for twenty minutes strain and mix with the liquid one two lb of flour and not quite one two pint of yeast Bottle it up and tie the corks down When wanted for use boil potatoes according to the quantity of bread to be made about three lbs are sufficient for about a peck of flour mash them add to them one two lb of flour and mix about one two pint of the yeast with them let this mixture stand all day and lay the bread to rise the night before it is wanted Time twenty minutes to boil the hops and water Sufficient one two pint of this yeast sufficient for a peck of flour or rather more TO MAKE GOOD HOME MADE BREAD Miss Acton s Recipe seventeen eighteen INGREDIENTS one quartern of flour one large tablespoonful of solid brewer s yeast or nearly one oz of fresh German yeast one one four to one one two pint of warm milk and water Illustration COTTAGE LOAF Illustration TIN BREAD Mode Put the flour into a large earthenware bowl or deep pan then with a strong metal or wooden spoon hollow out the middle but do not clear it entirely away from the bottom of the pan as in that case the sponge or leaven as it was formerly termed would stick to it which it ought not to do Next take either a large tablespoonful of brewer s yeast which has been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water and letting it afterwards stand to settle for a day and night or nearly an ounce of German yeast put it into a large basin and proceed to mix it so that it shall be as smooth as cream with three four pint of warm milk and water or with water only though even a very little milk will much improve the bread Pour the yeast into the hole made in the flour and stir into it as much of that which lies round it as will make a thick batter in which there must be no lumps Strew plenty of flour on the top throw a thick clean cloth over and set it where the air is warm but do not place it upon the kitchen fender for it will become too much heated there Look at it from time to time when it has been laid for nearly an hour and when the yeast has risen and broken through the flour so that bubbles appear in it you will know that it is ready to be made up into dough Then place the pan on a strong chair or dresser or table of convenient height pour into the sponge the remainder of the warm milk and water stir into it as much of the flour as you can with the spoon then wipe it out clean with your fingers and lay it aside Next take plenty of the remaining flour throw it on the top of the leaven and begin with the knuckles of both hands to knead it well When the flour is nearly all kneaded in begin to draw the edges of the dough towards the middle in order to mix the whole thoroughly and when it is free from flour and lumps and crumbs and does not stick to the hands when touched it will be done and may again be covered with the cloth and left to rise a second time In three four hour look at it and should it have swollen very much and begin to crack it will be light enough to bake Turn it then on to a paste board or very clean dresser and with a large sharp knife divide it in two make it up quickly into loaves and dispatch it to the oven make one or two incisions across the tops of the loaves as they will rise more easily if this be done If baked in tins or pans rub them with a tiny piece of butter laid on a piece of clean paper to prevent the dough from sticking to them All bread should be turned upside down or on its side as soon as it is drawn from the oven if this be neglected the under part of the loaves will become wet and blistered from the steam which cannot then escape from them To make the dough without setting a sponge merely mix the yeast with the greater part of the warm milk and water and wet up the whole of the flour at once after a little salt has been stirred in proceeding exactly in every other respect as in the directions just given As the dough will soften in the rising it should be made quite firm at first or it will be too lithe by the time it is ready for the oven Illustration ITALIAN MILLET Time To be left to rise an hour the first time three four hour the second time to be baked from one to one one four hour or baked in one loaf from one one two to two hours ITALIAN MILLET or Great Indian Millet is cultivated in Egypt and Nubia where it is called dhourra and is used as human food as well as for the fermentation of beer It will grow on poor soils and is extremely productive It has been introduced into Italy where they make a coarse bread from it and it is also employed in pastry and puddings they also use it for feeding horses and domestic fowls It is the largest variety growing to the height of six feet but it requires a warm climate and will not ripen in this country A yellow variety called Golden Millet is sold in the grocers shops for making puddings and is very delicate and wholesome TO MAKE A PECK OF GOOD BREAD seventeen nineteen INGREDIENTS three lbs of potatoes six pints of cold water one two pint of good yeast a peck of flour two oz of salt Mode Peel and boil the potatoes beat them to a cream while warm then add one pint of cold water strain through a colander and add to it one two pint of good yeast which should have been put in water over night to take off its bitterness Stir all well together with a wooden spoon and pour the mixture into the centre of the flour mix it to the substance of cream cover it over closely and let it remain near the fire for an hour then add the five pints of water milk warm with two oz of salt pour this in and mix the whole to a nice light dough Let it remain for about two hours then make it into seven loaves and bake for about one one two hour in a good oven When baked the bread should weigh nearly twenty lbs Time About one one two hour THE RED VARIETIES OF WHEAT are generally hardier and more easily grown than the white sorts and although of less value to the miller they are fully more profitable to the grower in consequence of the better crops which they produce Another advantage the red wheats possess is their comparative immunity from the attacks of mildew and fly The best English wheat comes from the counties of Kent and Essex the qualities under these heads always bearing a higher price than others as will be seen by the periodical lists in the journals RICE BREAD seventeen twenty INGREDIENTS To every lb of rice allow four lbs of wheat flour nearly three tablespoonfuls of yeast one four oz of salt Mode Boil the rice in water until it is quite tender pour off the water and put the rice before it is cold to the flour Mix these well together with the yeast salt and sufficient warm water to make the whole into a smooth dough let it rise by the side of the fire then form it into loaves and bake them from one one two to two hours according to their size If the rice is boiled in milk instead of water it makes very delicious bread or cakes When boiled in this manner it may be mixed with the flour without straining the liquid from it Time one one two to two hours INDIAN CORN FLOUR BREAD seventeen twenty one INGREDIENTS To four lbs of flour allow two lbs of Indian corn flour two tablespoonfuls of yeast three pints of warm water one four oz of salt Mode Mix the two flours well together with the salt make a hole in the centre and stir the yeast up well with one two pint of the warm water put this into the middle of the flour and mix enough of it with the yeast to make a thin batter throw a little flour over the surface of this batter cover the whole with a thick cloth and set it to rise in a warm place When the batter has nicely risen work the whole to a nice smooth dough adding the water as required knead it well and mould the dough into loaves let them rise for nearly one two hour then put them into a well heated oven If made into two loaves they will require from one one two to two hours baking Time one one two to two hours Illustration MAIZE PLANT Illustration EAR OF MAIZE MAIZE Next to wheat and rice maize is the grain most used in the nourishment of man In Asia Africa and America it is the principal daily food of a large portion of the population especially of the colonists In some of the provinces of France too it is consumed in large quantities There are eight varieties of the maize the most productive is the maize of Cusco The flour of maize is yellow and it contains an oily matter which when fresh gives it an agreeable flavour and odour but the action of the air on it soon develops rancidity If carried any distance it should be stored away in air tight vessels An excellent soup is prepared with meat and maize flour The inhabitants of some countries where wheat is scarce make with maize and water or milk and salt a kind of biscuit which is pleasant in taste but indigestible Some of the preparations of maize flour are very good and when partaken in moderation suitable food for almost everybody SODA BREAD seventeen twenty two INGREDIENTS To every two lbs of flour allow one teaspoonful of tartaric acid one teaspoonful of salt one teaspoonful of carbonate of soda two breakfast cupfuls of cold milk Mode Let the tartaric acid and salt be reduced to the finest possible powder then mix them well with the flour Dissolve the soda in the milk and pour it several times from one basin to another before adding it to the flour Work the whole quickly into a light dough divide it into two loaves and put them into a well heated oven immediately and bake for an hour Sour milk or buttermilk may be used but then a little less acid will be needed Time one hour POLISH AND POMERANIAN WHEAT are accounted by authorities most excellent Large raft like barges convey this grain down the rivers from the interior of the country to the seaports This corn is described as being white hard and thin skinned and it yields a large quantity of flour having a small proportion of bran EXCELLENT ROLLS seventeen twenty three INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow one oz of butter one four pint of milk one large teaspoonful of yeast a little salt Illustration ROLLS Mode Warm the butter in the milk add to it the yeast and salt and mix these ingredients well together Put the flour into a pan stir in the above ingredients and let the dough rise covered in a warm place Knead it well make it into rolls let them rise again for a few minutes and bake in a quick oven Richer rolls may be made by adding one or two eggs and a larger proportion of butter and their appearance improved by brushing the tops over with yolk of egg or a little milk Time one lb of flour divided into six rolls from fifteen to twenty minutes HOT ROLLS seventeen twenty four This dish although very unwholesome and indigestible is nevertheless a great favourite and eaten by many persons As soon as the rolls come from the baker s they should be put into the oven which in the early part of the morning is sure not to be very hot and the rolls must not be buttered until wanted When they are quite hot divide them lengthwise into three put some thin flakes of good butter between the slices press the rolls together and put them in the oven for a minute or two but not longer or the butter would oil take them out of the oven spread the butter equally over divide the rolls in half and put them on to a very hot clean dish and send them instantly to table TO MAKE DRY TOAST seventeen twenty five To make dry toast properly a great deal of attention is required much more indeed than people generally suppose Never use new bread for making any kind of toast as it eats heavy and besides is very extravagant Procure a loaf of household bread about two days old cut off as many slices as may be required not quite one four inch in thickness trim off the crusts and ragged edges put the bread on a toasting fork and hold it before a very clear fire Move it backwards and forwards until the bread is nicely coloured then turn it and toast the other side and do not place it so near the fire that it blackens Dry toast should be more gradually made than buttered toast as its great beauty consists in its crispness and this cannot be attained unless the process is slow and the bread is allowed gradually to colour It should never be made long before it is wanted as it soon becomes tough unless placed on the fender in front of the fire As soon as each piece is ready it should be put into a rack or stood upon its edges and sent quickly to table TO MAKE HOT BUTTERED TOAST seventeen twenty six A loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making toast better than cottage bread the latter not being a good shape and too crusty for the purpose Cut as many nice even slices as may be required rather more than one four inch in thickness and toast them before a very bright fire without allowing the bread to blacken which spoils the appearance and flavour of all toast When of a nice colour on both sides put it on a hot plate divide some good butter into small pieces place them on the toast set this before the fire and when the butter is just beginning to melt spread it lightly over the toast Trim off the crust and ragged edges divide each round into four pieces and send the toast quickly to table Some persons cut the slices of toast across from corner to corner so making the pieces of a three cornered shape Soyer recommends that each slice should be cut into pieces as soon as it is buttered and when all are ready that they should be piled lightly on the dish they are intended to be served on He says that by cutting through four or five slices at a time all the butter is squeezed out of the upper ones while the bottom one is swimming in fat liquid It is highly essential to use good butter for making this dish MUFFINS seventeen twenty seven INGREDIENTS To every quart of milk allow one one two oz of German yeast a little salt flour Illustration MUFFINS Mode Warm the milk add to it the yeast and mix these well together put them into a pan and stir in sufficient flour to make the whole into a dough of rather a soft consistence cover it over with a cloth and place it in a warm place to rise and when light and nicely risen divide the dough into pieces and round them to the proper shape with the hands place them in a layer of flour about two inches thick on wooden trays and let them rise again when this is effected they each will exhibit a semi globular shape Then place them carefully on a hot plate or stove and bake them until they are slightly browned turning them when they are done on one side Muffins are not easily made and are more generally purchased than manufactured at home To toast them divide the edge of the muffin all round by pulling it open to the depth of about an inch with the fingers Put it on a toasting fork and hold it before a very clear fire until one side is nicely browned but not burnt turn and toast it on the other Do not toast them too quickly as if this is done the middle of the muffin will not be warmed through When done divide them by pulling them open butter them slightly on both sides put them together again and cut them into halves when sufficient are toasted and buttered pile them on a very hot dish and send them very quickly to table Time From twenty minutes to one two hour to bake them Sufficient Allow one muffin to each person CRUMPETS Illustration CRUMPETS seventeen twenty eight These are made in the same manner as muffins only in making the mixture let it be more like batter than dough Let it rise for about one two hour pour it into iron rings which should be ready on a hot plate bake them and when one side appears done turn them quickly on the other To toast them have ready a very bright clear fire put the crumpet on a toasting fork and hold it before the fire not too close until it is nicely brown on one side but do not allow it to blacken Turn it and brown the other side then spread it with good butter cut it in half and when all are done pile them on a hot dish and send them quickly to table Muffins and crumpets should always be served on separate dishes and both toasted and served as expeditiously as possible Time From ten to fifteen minutes to bake them Sufficient Allow two crumpets to each person PLAIN BUNS seventeen twenty nine INGREDIENTS To every two lbs of flour allow six oz of moist sugar one two gill of yeast one two pint of milk one two lb of butter warm milk Mode Put the flour into a basin mix the sugar well with it make a hole in the centre and stir in the yeast and milk which should be lukewarm with enough of the flour to make it the thickness of cream Cover the basin over with a cloth and let the sponge rise in a warm place which will be accomplished in about one one two hour Melt the butter but do not allow it to oil stir it into the other ingredients with enough warm milk to make the whole into a soft dough then mould it into buns about the size of an egg lay them in rows quite three inches apart set them again in a warm place until they have risen to double their size then put them into a good brisk oven and just before they are done wash them over with a little milk From fifteen to twenty minutes will be required to bake them nicely These buns may be varied by adding a few currants candied peel or caraway seeds to the other ingredients and the above mixture answers for hot cross buns by putting in a little ground allspice and by pressing a tin mould in the form of a cross in the centre of the bun Time fifteen to twenty minutes Average cost oned each Sufficient to make eighteen buns TO MAKE GOOD PLAIN BUNS seventeen thirty INGREDIENTS one lb of flour six oz of good butter one four lb of sugar one egg nearly one four pint of milk two small teaspoonfuls of baking powder a few drops of essence of lemon Mode Warm the butter without oiling it beat it with a wooden spoon stir the flour in gradually with the sugar and mix these ingredients well together Make the milk lukewarm beat up with it the yolk of the egg and the essence of lemon and stir these to the flour c Add the baking powder beat the dough well for about ten minutes divide it into twenty four pieces put them into buttered tins or cups and bake in a brisk oven from twenty to thirty minutes Time twenty to thirty minutes Average cost ones Sufficient to make twelve buns Seasonable at any time LIGHT BUNS Illustration BUNS seventeen thirty one INGREDIENTS one two teaspoonful of tartaric acid one two teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda one lb of flour two oz of butter two oz of loaf sugar one four lb of currants or raisins when liked a few caraway seeds one two pint of cold new milk one egg Mode Rub the tartaric acid soda and flour all together through a hair sieve work the butter into the flour add the sugar currants and caraway seeds when the flavour of them latter is liked Mix all these ingredients well together make a hole in the middle of the flour and pour in the milk mixed with the egg which should be well beaten mix quickly and set the dough with a fork on baking tins and bake the buns for about twenty minutes This mixture makes a very good cake and if put into a tin should be baked one one two hour The same quantity of flour soda and tartaric acid with one two pint of milk and a little salt will make either bread or teacakes if wanted quickly Time twenty minutes for the buns if made into a cake one one two hour Sufficient to make about twelve buns VICTORIA BUNS seventeen thirty two INGREDIENTS two oz of pounded loaf sugar one egg one one two oz of ground rice two oz of butter one one two oz of currants a few thin slices of candied peel flour Mode Whisk the egg stir in the sugar and beat these ingredients well together beat the butter to a cream stir in the ground rice currants and candied peel and as much flour as will make it of such a consistency that it may be rolled into seven or eight balls Put these on to a buttered tin and bake them from one two to three four hour They should be put into the oven immediately or they will become heavy and the oven should be tolerably brisk Time one two to three four hour Average cost sixd Sufficient to make seven or eight buns Seasonable at any time ITALIAN RUSKS seventeen thirty three A stale Savoy or lemon cake may be converted into very good rusks in the following manner Cut the cake into slices divide each slice in two put them on a baking sheet in a slow oven and when they are of a nice brown and quite hard they are done They should be kept in a closed tin canister in a dry place to preserve their crispness Illustration PANNICLED MILLET PANNICLED MILLET This is the smallest seeded of the corn plants being a true grass but the number of the seeds in each ear makes up for their size It grows in sandy soils that will not do for the cultivation of many other kinds of grain and forms the chief sustenance in the arid districts of Arabia Syria Nubia and parts of India It is not cultivated in England being principally confined to the East The nations who make use of it grind it in the primitive manner between two stones and make it into a diet which cannot be properly called bread but rather a kind of soft thin cake half baked When we take into account that the Arabians are fond of lizards and locusts as articles of food their cuisine altogether is scarcely a tempting one TO MAKE RUSKS Suffolk Recipe seventeen thirty four INGREDIENTS To every lb of flour allow two oz of butter one four pint of milk two oz of loaf sugar three eggs one tablespoonful of yeast Illustration RUSKS Mode Put the milk and butter into a saucepan and keep shaking it round until the latter is melted Put the flour into a

leave the dough to rise by the side of the fire then knead it and divide it into twelve pieces place them in a brisk oven and bake for about twenty minutes Take the rusks out break them in half and then set them in the oven to get crisp on the other side When cold they should be put into tin canisters to keep them dry and if intended for the cheese course the sifted sugar should be omitted Time twenty minutes to bake the rusks five minutes to render them crisp after being divided Average cost eightd Sufficient to make two dozen rusks Seasonable at any time ALMOND ICING FOR CAKES seventeen thirty five INGREDIENTS To every lb of finely pounded loaf sugar allow one lb of sweet almonds the whites of four eggs a little rose water Mode Blanch the almonds and pound them a few at a time in a mortar to a paste adding a little rose water to facilitate the operation Whisk the whites of the eggs to a strong froth mix them with the pounded almonds stir in the sugar and beat altogether When the cake is sufficiently baked lay on the almond icing and put it into the oven to dry Before laying this preparation on the cake great care must be taken that it is nice and smooth which is easily accomplished by well beating the mixture SUGAR ICING FOR CAKES seventeen thirty six INGREDIENTS To every lb of loaf sugar allow the whites of four eggs one oz of fine starch Mode Beat the eggs to a strong froth and gradually sift in the sugar which should be reduced to the finest possible powder and gradually add the starch also finely powdered Beat the mixture well until the sugar is smooth then with a spoon or broad knife lay the icing equally over the cakes These should then be placed in a very cool oven and the icing allowed to dry and harden but not to colour The icing may be coloured with strawberry or currant juice or with prepared cochineal If it be put on the cakes as soon as they are withdrawn from the oven it will become firm and hard by the time the cakes are cold On very rich cakes such as wedding christening cakes c a layer of almond icing No seventeen thirty five is usually spread over the top and over that the white icing as described All iced cakes should be kept in a very dry place BISCUIT POWDER generally used for Infants Food seventeen thirty seven This powder may be purchased in tin canisters and may also be prepared at home Dry the biscuits well

Blanch skin and dry the almonds and pound them well with a little orange flower water or plain water then add to them the sifted sugar and the whites of the eggs which should be beaten to a stiff froth and mix all the ingredients well together When the paste looks soft drop it at equal distances from a biscuit syringe on to sheets of wafer paper put a strip of almond on the top of each strew some sugar over and bake the macaroons in rather a slow oven of a light brown colour when hard and set they are done and must not be allowed to get very brown as that would spoil their appearance If the cakes when baked appear heavy add a little more white of egg but let this always be well whisked before it is added to the other ingredients We have given a recipe for making these cakes but we think it almost or quite as economical to purchase such articles as these at a good confectioner s Time From fifteen to twenty minutes in a slow oven Average cost ones eightd per lb RATAFIAS

in the south of Spain is delicious it is white as snow close as cake and yet very light the flavour is most admirable for the wheat is good and pure and the bread well kneaded The way they make this bread is as follows From large round panniers filled with wheat they take out a handful at a time sorting it most carefully and expeditiously and throwing every defective grain into another basket This done the wheat is ground between two circular stones as it was ground in Egypt two thousand years ago see No one hundred seventeen the requisite rotary motion being given by a blindfolded mule which paces round and round with untiring patience a bell being attached to his neck which as long as he is in movement tinkles on and when it stops he is urged to his duty by the shout of Arre mula from some one within hearing When ground the wheat is sifted through three sieves the last of these being so fine that only the pure flour can pass through it this is of a pale apricot colour The bread is made in the evening It is mixed with only sufficient water with a little salt in it to make it into dough a very small quantity of leaven or fermenting mixture is added The Scripture says A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump but in England to avoid the trouble of kneading many put as much leaven or yeast in one batch of household bread as in Spain would last them a week for the six or eight donkey loads of bread they send every night from their oven The dough made it is put into sacks and carried on the donkeys backs to the oven in the centre of the village so as to bake it immediately it is kneaded On arriving there the dough is divided into portions weighing three lbs each Two long narrow wooden tables on trestles are then placed down the room and now a curious sight may be seen About twenty men bakers come in and range themselves on one side of the tables A lump of dough is handed to the nearest which he commences kneading and knocking about with all his might for about three or four minutes and then passes it on to his neighbour who does the same and so on successively until all have kneaded it when it becomes as soft as new putty and ready for the oven Of course as soon as the first baker has handed the first lump to his neighbour another is given to him and so on till the whole quantity of dough is successively kneaded by them all The bakers wives and daughters shape the loaves for the oven and some of them are very small and they are baked immediately The ovens are very large and not heated by fires under them but a quantity of twigs of the herbs of sweet marjoram and thyme which cover the hills in great profusion are put in the oven and ignited They heat the oven to any extent required and as the bread gets baked the oven gets gradually colder so the bread is never burned They knead the bread in Spain with such force that the palm of the hand and the second joints of the fingers of the bakers are covered with corns and it so affects the chest that they cannot work more than two hours at a time SNOW CAKE seventeen seventy seven INGREDIENTS one two lb of tous les mois one four lb of white pounded sugar one four lb of fresh or

occasioned by microscopic fungi which sow themselves and grow upon the stems and ears destroying the nutritive principles and introducing matter of a deleterious kind The farmer is at the utmost pains to keep away these intruders Wheat as well as all kinds of corn is also very liable to be injured by being stacked before it is quite dry in which case it will heat and become musty in the ricks In wet harvests it is sometimes impossible to get it sufficiently dried and a great deal of corn is thus often spoiled It is generally reckoned that the sweetest bread is made from wheat threshed out before it is stacked which shows the importance of studying the best modes of preserving it The erudite are not agreed as to the aboriginal country of corn some say it is Egypt others Tartary and the learned Bailly as well as the traveller Pallas affirms that it grows spontaneously in Siberia Be that as it may the Phocians brought it to Marseilles before the Romans had penetrated into Gaul The

and bake them in rather a quick oven but do not allow them to take too much colour as they should be rather pale Remove them from the tins before they get cold and turn them on their faces where let them remain until quite cold when store them away in a closed tin canister or wide mouthed glass bottle Time ten to fifteen minutes in a quick oven Average cost oned each Seasonable at any time TEA CAKES seventeen eighty six INGREDIENTS two lbs of flour one two teaspoonful of salt one four lb of butter or lard one egg a piece of German yeast the size of a walnut warm milk Mode Put the flour which should be perfectly dry into a basin mix with it the salt and rub in the butter or lard then beat the egg well stir to it the yeast and add these to the flour with as much warm milk as will make the whole into a smooth paste and knead it well Let it rise near the fire and when well risen form it into cakes place them on tins let them rise again for a few minutes before putting them into the oven and bake from one four to one two hour in a moderate oven These are very nice with a few currants and a little sugar added to the other ingredients they should be put in after the butter is rubbed in These cakes should be buttered and eaten hot as soon as baked but when stale they are very nice split and toasted or if dipped in milk or even water and covered with a basin in the oven till hot they will be almost equal to new Time one four to one two hour Average cost tend Sufficient to make eight tea cakes Seasonable at any time TO TOAST TEA CAKES Illustration TEA CAKES seventeen eighty seven Cut each tea cake into three or four slices according to its thickness toast them on both sides before a nice clear fire and as each slice is done spread it with butter on both sides When a cake is toasted pile the slices one on the top of the other cut them into quarters put them on a very hot plate and send the cakes immediately to table As they are wanted send them in hot one or two at a time as if allowed to stand they spoil unless kept in a muffin plate over a basin of boiling water A NICE YEAST CAKE seventeen eighty eight INGREDIENTS one one two lb of flour one two lb of butter one two pint of milk one one two tablespoonful of good yeast three eggs three four lb of currants one two lb of white moist sugar two oz of candied peel Mode Put the milk and butter into a saucepan and shake it round over a fire until the butter is melted but do not allow the milk to get very hot Put the flour into a basin stir to it the milk and butter the yeast and eggs which should be well beaten and form the whole into a smooth dough Let it stand in a warm place covered with a cloth to rise and when sufficiently risen add the currants sugar and candied peel cut into thin slices When all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed line two moderate sized cake tins with buttered paper which should be about six inches higher than the tin pour in the mixture let it stand to rise again for another one two hour and then bake the cakes in a brisk oven for about one one two hour If the tops of them become too brown cover them with paper until they are done through A few drops of essence of lemon or a little grated nutmeg may be added when the flavour is liked Time From one one four to one one two hour Average cost twos Sufficient to make two moderate sized cakes Seasonable at

none	none	GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON BEVERAGES seventeen eighty nine Beverages are innumerable in their variety but the ordinary beverages drunk in the British isles may be divided into three classes one Beverages of the simplest kind not fermented two 
1472_142848_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Beverages consisting of water containing a considerable quantity of carbonic acid 
none	none	three 
1472_142848_000007_000006	train-clean-360	Beverages composed partly of fermented liquors 
none	none	Of the first class may be mentioned water toast and water barley water eau sucre lait sucre cheese and milk whey milk and water lemonade orangeade sherbet apple and pear juice capillaire vinegar and water raspberry vinegar and water seventeen ninety 
1472_142848_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Of the common class of beverages consisting of water impregnated with carbonic acid gas we may name soda water single and double ordinary effervescing draughts and ginger beer

1472_142848_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The beverages composed partly of fermented liquors are hot spiced wines bishop egg flip egg hot ale posset sack posset punch and spirits and water 
none	none	seventeen ninety two 
1472_142848_000010_000001	train-clean-360	We will however forthwith treat on the most popular of our beverages beginning with the one which makes the cup that cheers but not inebriates 
none	none	seventeen ninety three The beverage called tea has now become almost a necessary of life Previous to the middle of the seventeenth century it was not used in England and it was wholly unknown to the Greeks and Romans 
1472_142848_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Pepys says in his Diary September twenty fifth sixteen sixty one I sent for a cup of tea a China drink of which I had never drunk before Two years later it was so rare a commodity in England that the English East India Company bought two lbs two oz of it as a present for his majesty 
none	none	In sixteen sixty six it was sold in London for sixty shillings a pound From that date the consumption has gone on increasing from five thousand lbs to fifty million lbs seventeen ninety four 
1472_142848_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Linnaeus was induced to think that there were two species of tea plant one of which produced the black and the other the green teas but later observations do not confirm this 
1472_142848_000012_000002	train-clean-360	When the leaves of black and green tea are expanded by hot water and examined by the botanist though a difference of character is perceived yet this is not sufficient to authorize considering them as distinct species 
1472_142848_000012_000003	train-clean-360	The tea tree flourishes best in temperate regions in China it is indigenous 
1472_142848_000012_000004	train-clean-360	The part of China where the best tea is cultivated is called by us the tea country The cultivation of the plant requires great care 
1472_142848_000012_000005	train-clean-360	It is raised chiefly on the sides of hills and in order to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the leaves the shrub is pruned so as not to exceed the height of from two to three feet much in the same manner as the vine is treated in France 
1472_142848_000012_000006	train-clean-360	They pluck the leaves one selecting them according to the kinds of tea required and notwithstanding the tediousness of the operation each labourer is able to gather from four to ten or fifteen pounds a day 
none	none	When the trees attain to six or seven years of age the produce becomes so inferior that they are removed to make room for a fresh succession or they are cut down to allow of numerous young shoots 
1472_142848_000012_000008	train-clean-360	Teas of the finest flavour consist of the youngest leaves and as these are gathered at four different periods of the year the younger the leaves the higher flavoured the tea and the scarcer and consequently the dearer the article 
none	none	seventeen ninety five The various names by which teas are sold in the British market are corruptions of Chinese words 
1472_142848_000013_000002	train-clean-360	There are about a dozen different kinds but the principal are Bohea Congou and Souchong and signify respectively inferior middling and superior 
none	none	Teas are often perfumed and flavoured with the leaves of different kinds of plants grown on purpose Different tea farms in China produce teas of various qualities raised by skilful cultivation on various soils seventeen ninety six 
1472_142848_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Tea when chemically analyzed is found to contain woody fibre mucilage a considerable quantity of the astringent principle or tannin a narcotic principle which is perhaps connected with a peculiar aroma 
1472_142848_000014_000002	train-clean-360	The tannin is shown by its striking a black colour with sulphate of iron and is the cause of the dark stain which is always formed when tea is spilt upon buff coloured cottons dyed with iron 
none	none	A constituent called Theine has also been discovered in tea supposed to be identical with Caffeine one of the constituents of coffee Liebig says Theine yields in certain processes of decomposition a series of most remarkable products which have much analogy with those derived from uric acid in similar circumstances The infusion of tea differs from that of coffee by containing iron and manganese 
1472_142848_000014_000006	train-clean-360	We have in tea of many kinds a beverage which contains the active constituents of the most powerful mineral springs and however small the amount of iron may be which we daily take in this form it cannot be destitute of influence on the vital processes 
none	none	seventeen ninety seven Chinese tea has frequently been adulterated in this country by the admixture of the dried leaves of certain plants 
1472_142848_000015_000002	train-clean-360	The leaves of the sloe white thorn ash elder and some others have been employed for this purpose such as the leaves of the speedwell wild germander black currants syringa purple spiked willow herb sweet brier and cherry tree 
1472_142848_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Some of these are harmless others are to a certain degree poisonous as for example are the leaves of all the varieties of the plum and cherry tribe to which the sloe belongs 
1472_142848_000015_000004	train-clean-360	Adulteration by means of these leaves is by no means a new species of fraud and several acts of parliament from the time of George II have been passed specifying severe penalties against those guilty of the offence which notwithstanding numerous convictions continues to the present time 
none	none	seventeen ninety eight In the purchase of tea that should be chosen which possesses an agreeable odour and is as whole as possible in order that the leaf may be easily examined 
1472_142848_000016_000002	train-clean-360	The greatest care should be taken that it has not been exposed to the air which destroys its flavour 
none	none	seventeen ninety nine 
1472_142848_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It would be impossible in the space at our command to enumerate the various modes adopted in different countries for making coffee that is the phrase commonly understood to mean the complete preparation of this delicious beverage for drinking 
1472_142848_000017_000002	train-clean-360	For performing this operation such recipes or methods as we have found most practical will be inserted in their proper place but the following facts connected with coffee will be found highly interesting 
none	none	eighteen hundred The introduction of coffee into this country is comparatively of recent date We are assured by Bruce that the coffee tree is a native of Abyssinia and it is said to have been cultivated in that country from time immemorial eighteen oh one 
1472_142848_000019_000001	train-clean-360	It appears that coffee was first introduced into England by Daniel Edwards a Turkey merchant whose servant Pasqua a Greek understood the manner of roasting it 
1472_142848_000019_000002	train-clean-360	This servant under the patronage of Edwards established the first coffee house in London in George Yard Lombard Street 
none	none	Coffee was then sold at four or five guineas a pound and a duty was soon afterwards laid upon it of fourpence a gallon when made into a beverage In the course of two centuries however this berry unknown originally as an article of food except to some savage tribes on the confines of Abyssinia has made its way through the whole of the civilized world Mahommedans of all ranks drink coffee twice a day it is in universal request in France and the demand for it throughout the British isles is daily increasing the more especially since so much attention has been given to mechanical contrivances for roasting and grinding the berry and preparing the beverage eighteen oh two 
1472_142848_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Of the various kinds of coffee the Arabian is considered the best It is grown chiefly in the districts of Aden and Mocha whence the name of our Mocha coffee 
1472_142848_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Mocha coffee has a smaller and rounder bean than any other and likewise a more agreeable smell and taste 
none	none	The next in reputation and quality is the Java and Ceylon coffee and then the coffees of Bourbon and Martinique and that of Berbice a district of the colony of British Guiana The Jamaica and saint Domingo coffees are less esteemed eighteen oh three 
1472_142848_000021_000001	train-clean-360	A considerable change takes place in the arrangement of the constituents of coffee by the application of heat in roasting it Independently of one of the objects of roasting namely that of destroying its toughness and rendering it easily ground its tannin and other principles are rendered partly soluble in water and it is to the tannin that the brown colour of the decoction of coffee is owing 
none	none	An aromatic flavour is likewise developed during torrefaction which is not perceived in the raw berry and which is not produced in the greatest perfection until the heat has arrived at a certain degree of temperature but if the heat be increased beyond this the flavour is again dissipated and little remains but a bitter and astringent matter with carbon eighteen oh four 
1472_142848_000022_000001	train-clean-360	The roasting of coffee in the best manner requires great nicety and much of the qualities of the beverage depends upon the operation The roasting of coffee for the dealers in London and Paris has now become a separate branch of business and some of the roasters perform the operation on a great scale with considerable skill 
1472_142848_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Roasted coffee loses from twenty to thirty per cent by sufficient roasting and the powder suffers much by exposure to the air but while raw it not only does not lose its flavour for a year or two but improves by keeping 
1472_142848_000022_000003	train-clean-360	If a cup of the best coffee be placed upon a table boiling hot it will fill the room with its fragrance but the coffee when warmed again after being cold will be found to have lost most of its flavour 
none	none	eighteen oh five 
1472_142848_000023_000001	train-clean-360	To have coffee in perfection it should be roasted and ground just before it is used and more should not be ground at a time than is wanted for immediate use or if it be necessary to grind more it should be kept closed from the air 
none	none	Coffee readily imbibes exhalations from other substances and thus often acquires a bad flavour brown sugar placed near it will communicate a disagreeable flavour It is stated that the coffee in the West Indies has often been injured by being laid in rooms near the sugar works or where rum is distilled and the same effect has been produced by bringing over coffee in the same ships with rum and sugar doctor Moseley mentions that a few bags of pepper on board a ship from India spoiled a whole cargo of coffee eighteen oh six 
1472_142848_000024_000001	train-clean-360	With respect to the quantity of coffee used in making the decoction much depends upon the taste of the consumer 
none	none	The greatest and most common fault in English coffee is the too small quantity of the ingredient Count Rumford says that to make good coffee for drinking after dinner a pound of good Mocha coffee which when roasted and ground weighs only thirteen ounces serves to make fifty six full cups or a little less than a quarter of an ounce to a coffee cup of moderate size RECIPES CHAPTER XXXVII TO MAKE CHOCOLATE eighteen oh seven INGREDIENTS Allow one two oz of chocolate to each person to every oz allow one two pint of water one two pint of milk Mode Make the milk and water hot scrape the chocolate into it and stir the mixture constantly and quickly until the chocolate is dissolved bring it to the boiling point stir it well and serve directly with white sugar Chocolate prepared with in a mill as shown in the engraving is made by putting in the scraped chocolate pouring over it the boiling milk and water and milling it over the fire until hot and frothy Sufficient Allow one two oz of cake chocolate to each person Illustration MILL CHOCOLATE AND COCOA Both these preparations are made from the seeds or beans of the cacao tree which grows in the West Indies and South America The Spanish and the proper name is cacao not cocoa as it is generally spelt From this mistake the tree from which the beverage is procured has been often confounded with the palm that produces the edible cocoa nuts which are the produce of the cocoa tree Cocos nucifera whereas the tree from which chocolate is procured is very different the Theobroma cacao The cocoa tree was cultivated by the aboriginal inhabitants of South America particularly in Mexico where according to Humboldt it was reared by Montezuma It was transplanted thence into other dependencies of the Spanish monarchy in fifteen twenty and it was so highly esteemed by Linnaeus receive from him the name now conferred upon it of Theobroma a term derived from the Greek and signifying food for gods Chocolate has always been a favourite beverage among the Spaniards and Creoles and was considered here as a great luxury when first introduced after the discovery of America but the high duties laid upon it confined it long almost entirely to the wealthier classes Before it was subjected to duty mister Bryan Edwards stated that cocoa plantations were numerous in Jamaica but that the duty caused their almost entire ruin The removal of this duty has increased their cultivation For engraving of cocoa bean see No eighteen sixteen TO MAKE ESSENCE OF COFFEE eighteen oh eight INGREDIENTS To every one four lb of ground coffee allow one small teaspoonful of powdered chicory three small teacupfuls or one pint of water Mode Let the coffee be freshly ground and if possible freshly roasted put it into a percolater or filter with the chicory and pour slowly over it the above proportion of boiling water When it has all filtered through warm the coffee sufficiently to bring it to the simmering point but do not allow it to boil then filter it a second time put it into a clean and dry bottle cork it well and it will remain good for several days Two tablespoonfuls of this essence are quite sufficient for a breakfast cupful of hot milk This essence will be found particularly useful to those persons who have to rise extremely early and having only the milk to make boiling is very easily and quickly prepared When the essence is bottled pour another three tea cupfuls of boiling water slowly on the grounds which when filtered through will be a very weak coffee The next time there is essence to be prepared make this weak coffee boiling and pour it on the ground coffee instead of plain water by this means a better coffee will be obtained Never throw away the grounds without having made use of them in this manner and always cork the bottle well that contains this preparation until the day that it is wanted for making the fresh essence Time To be filtered once then brought to the boiling point and filtered again Average cost with coffee at ones eightd per lb sixd Sufficient Allow two tablespoonfuls for a breakfast cupful of hot milk TO ROAST COFFEE A French Recipe eighteen oh nine It being an acknowledged fact that French coffee is decidedly superior to that made in England and as the roasting of the berry is of great importance to the flavour of the preparation it will be useful and interesting to know how they manage these things in France In Paris there are two houses justly celebrated for the flavour of their coffee La Maison Corcellet and La Maison Royer de Chartres and to obtain this flavour before roasting they add to every three lbs of coffee a piece of butter the size of a nut and a dessert spoonful of powdered sugar it is then roasted in the usual manner The addition of the butter and sugar develops the flavour and aroma of the berry but it must be borne in mind that the quality of the butter must be of the very best description TO MAKE COFFEE eighteen ten INGREDIENTS Allow four oz or one tablespoonful of ground coffee to each person to every oz of coffee allow one three pint of water Mode To make coffee good it should never be boiled but the boiling water merely poured on it the same as for tea The coffee should always be purchased in the berry if possible freshly roasted and it should never be ground long before it is wanted for use There are very many new kinds of coffee pots but the method of making the coffee is nearly always the same namely pouring the boiling water on the powder and allowing it to filter through Our illustration shows one of Loysel s Hydrostatic Urns which are admirably adapted for making good and clear coffee which should be made in the following manner Warm the urn with boiling water remove the lid and movable filter and place the ground coffee at the bottom of the urn Put the movable filter over this and screw the lid inverted tightly on the end of the centre pipe Pour into the inverted lid the above proportion of boiling water and when all the water so poured has disappeared from the funnel and made its way down the centre pipe and up again through the ground coffee by hydrostatic pressure unscrew screw the lid and cover the urn Pour back direct into the urn not through the funnel one two or three cups according to the size of the percolater in order to make the infusion of uniform strength the contents will then be ready for use and should run from the tap strong hot and clear The coffee made in these urns generally turns out very good and there is but one objection to them the coffee runs rather slowly from the tap This is of no consequence where there is a small party but tedious where there are many persons to provide for A remedy for this objection may be suggested namely to make the coffee very strong so that not more than one three of a cup would be required as the rest would be filled up with milk Making coffee in filters or percolaters does away with the necessity of using isinglass white of egg and various other preparations to clear it Coffee should always be served very hot and if possible in the same vessel in which it is made as pouring it from one pot to another cools and consequently spoils it Many persons may think that the proportion of water we have given for each oz of coffee is rather small it is so and the coffee produced from it will be very strong one three of a cup will be found quite sufficient which should be filled with nice hot milk or milk and cream mixed This is the cafe au lait for which our neighbours over the Channel are so justly celebrated Should the ordinary method of making coffee be preferred use double the quantity of water and in pouring it into the cups put in more coffee and less milk Illustration LOYSEL S HYDROSTATIC URN Sufficient For very good coffee allow one two oz or one tablespoonful to each person A VERY SIMPLE METHOD OF MAKING COFFEE eighteen eleven INGREDIENTS Allow one two oz or one tablespoonful of coffee to each person to every oz allow one pint of water Mode Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffee pot inside and to this ring sew a small muslin bag the muslin for the purpose must not be too thin Fit the bag into the pot pour some boiling water in it and when the pot is well warmed put the ground coffee into the bag pour over as much boiling water as is required close the lid and when all the water has filtered through remove the bag and send the coffee to table Making it in this manner prevents the necessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another which cools and spoils it The water should be poured on the coffee gradually so that the infusion may be stronger and the bag must be well made that none of the grounds may escape through the seams and so make the coffee thick and muddy Sufficient Allow one tablespoonful or one two oz to each person Illustration COFFEE THE COFFEE PLANT grows to the height of about twelve or fifteen feet with leaves not unlike those of the common laurel although more pointed and not so dry and thick The blossoms are white much like those of jasmine and issue from the angles of the leaf stalks When the flowers fade they are succeeded by the coffee bean or seed which is inclosed in a berry of a red colour when ripe resembling a cherry The coffee beans are prepared by exposing them to the sun for a few days that the pulp may ferment and throw off a strong acidulous moisture They are then gradually dried for about three weeks and put into a mill to separate the husk from the seed CAFE AU LAIT eighteen twelve This is merely very strong coffee added to a large proportion of good hot milk about six tablespoonfuls of strong coffee being quite sufficient for a breakfast cupful of milk Of the essence No eighteen oh eight which answers admirably for cafe an lait so much would not be required This preparation is infinitely superior to the weak watery coffee so often served at English tables A little cream mixed with the milk if the latter cannot be depended on for richness improves the taste of the coffee as also the richness of the beverage Sufficient six tablespoonfuls of strong coffee or two tablespoonfuls of the essence to a breakfast cupful of milk TEA AND COFFEE It is true says Liebig that thousands have lived without a knowledge of tea and coffee and daily experience teaches us that under certain circumstances they may be dispensed with without disadvantage to the merely animal functions but it is an error certainly to conclude from this that they may be altogether dispensed with in reference to their effects and it is a question whether if we had no tea and no coffee the popular instinct would not seek for and discover the means of replacing them Science which accuses us of so much in these respects will have in the first place to ascertain whether it depends on sensual and sinful inclinations merely that every people of the globe have appropriated some such means of acting on the nervous life from the shore of the Pacific where the Indian retires from life for days in order to enjoy the bliss of intoxication with koko to the Arctic regions where Kamtschatdales and Koriakes prepare an intoxicating beverage from a poisonous mushroom We think it on the contrary highly probable not to say certain that the instinct of man feeling certain blanks certain wants of the intensified life of our times which cannot be satisfied or filled up by mere quantity has discovered in these products of vegetable life the true means of giving to his food the desired and necessary quality CAFE NOIR eighteen thirteen This is usually handed round after dinner and should be drunk well sweetened with the addition of a little brandy or liqueurs which may be added or not at pleasure The coffee should be made very strong and served in very small cups but never mixed with milk or cream Cafe noir may be made of the essence of coffee No eighteen oh eight by pouring a tablespoonful into each cup and filling it up with boiling water This is a very simple and expeditious manner of preparing coffee for a large party but the essence for it must be made very good and kept well corked until required for use TO MAKE TEA eighteen fourteen There is very little art in making good tea if the water is boiling and there is no sparing of the fragrant leaf the beverage will almost invariably be good The old fashioned plan of allowing a teaspoonful to each person and one over is still practised Warm the teapot with boiling water let it remain for two or three minutes for the vessel to become thoroughly hot then pour it away Put in the tea pour in from one two to three four pint of boiling water close the lid and let it stand for the tea to draw from five to ten minutes then fill up the pot with water The tea will be quite spoiled unless made with water that is actually boiling as the leaves will not open and the flavour not be extracted from them the beverage will consequently be colourless and tasteless in fact nothing but tepid water Where there is a very large party to make tea for it is a good plan to have two teapots instead of putting a large quantity of tea into one pot the tea besides will go farther When the infusion has been once completed the addition of fresh tea adds very little to the strength so when more is required have the pot emptied of the old leaves scalded and fresh tea made in the usual manner Economists say that a few grains of carbonate of soda added before the boiling water is poured on the tea assist to draw out the goodness if the water is very hard perhaps it is a good plan as the soda softens it but care must be taken to use this ingredient sparingly as it is liable to give the tea a soapy taste if added in too large a quantity For mixed tea the usual proportion is four spoonfuls of black to one of green more of the latter when the flavour is very much liked but strong green tea is highly pernicious and should never be partaken of too freely Time two minutes to warm the teapot five to ten minutes to draw the strength from the tea Sufficient Allow one teaspoonful to each person and one over TEA The tea tree or shrub belongs to the class and order of Monadelphia polyandria in the Linnaean system and to the natural order of Aurantiaceae in the system of Jussieu Lately it has been made into a new order the Theasia which includes the Camellia and some other plants It commonly grows to the height of from three to six feet but it is said that in its wild or native state it reaches twenty feet or more In China it is cultivated in numerous small plantations In its general appearance and the form of its leaf it resembles the myrtle The blossoms are white and fragrant not unlike those of the wild rose but smaller and they are succeeded by soft green capsules containing each from one to three white seeds These capsules are crushed for oil which is in general use in China Illustration TEA AN EXCELLENT SUBSTITUTE FOR MILK OR CREAM IN TEA OR COFFEE eighteen fifteen INGREDIENTS Allow one new laid egg to every large breakfast cupful of tea or coffee Mode Beat up the whole of the egg in a basin put it into a cup or a portion of it if the cup be small and pour over it the tea or coffee very hot These should be added very gradually and stirred all the time to prevent the egg from curdling In point of nourishment both these beverages are much improved by this addition Sufficient Allow one egg to every large breakfast cupful of tea or coffee TO MAKE COCOA eighteen sixteen INGREDIENTS Allow two teaspoonfuls of the prepared cocoa to one breakfast cup boiling milk and boiling water Illustration COCOA BEAN Mode Put the cocoa into a breakfast cup pour over it sufficient cold milk to make it into a smooth paste then add equal quantities of boiling milk and boiling water and stir all well together Care must be taken not to allow the milk to get burnt as it will entirely spoil the flavour of the preparation The above directions are usually given for making the prepared cocoa The rock cocoa or that bought in a solid piece should be scraped and made in the same manner taking care to rub down all the lumps before the boiling liquid is added Sufficient two teaspoonfuls of prepared cocoa for one breakfast cup or one four oz of the rock cocoa for the same quantity COWSLIP WINE eighteen seventeen INGREDIENTS To every gallon of water allow three lbs of lump sugar the rind of two lemons the juice of one the rind and juice of one Seville orange one gallon of cowslip pips To every four one two gallons of wine allow one bottle of brandy Mode Boil the sugar and water together for one two hour carefully removing all the scum as it rises Pour this boiling liquor on the orange and lemon rinds and the juice which should be strained when milk warm add the cowslip pips or flowers picked from the stalks and seeds and to nine gallons of wine three tablespoonfuls of good fresh brewers yeast Let it ferment three or four days then put all together in a cask with the brandy and let it remain for two months when bottle it off for use Time To be boiled one two hour to ferment three or four days to remain in the cask two months Average cost exclusive of the cowslips which may be picked in the fields twos nined per gallon Seasonable Make this in April or May ELDER WINE eighteen eighteen INGREDIENTS To every three gallons of water allow one peck of elderberries to every gallon of juice allow three lbs of sugar one two oz of ground ginger six cloves one lb of good Turkey raisins one two pint of brandy to every gallon of wine To every nine gallons of wine three or four tablespoonfuls of fresh brewer s yeast Mode Pour the water quite boiling on the elderberries which should be picked from the stalks and let these stand covered for twenty four hours then strain the whole through a sieve or bag breaking the fruit to express all the juice from it Measure the liquor and to every gallon allow the above proportion of sugar Boil the juice and sugar with the ginger cloves and raisins for one hour skimming the liquor the whole time let it stand until milk warm then put it into a clean dry cask with three or four tablespoonfuls of good fresh yeast to every nine gallons of wine Let it ferment for about a fortnight then add the brandy bung up the cask and let it stand some months before it is bottled when it will be found excellent A bunch of hops suspended to a string from the bung some persons say will preserve the wine good for several years Elder wine is usually mulled and served with sippets of toasted bread and a little grated nutmeg Time To stand covered twenty four hours to be boiled one hour Average cost when made at home threes sixd per gallon Seasonable Make this in September Illustration ELDER BERRIES ELDER BERRY WINE The elder berry is well adapted for the production of wine its juice contains a considerable portion of the principle necessary for a vigorous fermentation and its beautiful colour communicates a rich tint to the wine made from it It is however deficient in sweetness and therefore demands an addition of sugar It is one of the very best of the genuine old English wines and a cup of it mulled just previous to retiring to bed on a winter night is a thing to be run for as Cobbett would say it is not however agreeable to every taste GINGER WINE eighteen nineteen INGREDIENTS To nine gallons of water allow twenty seven lbs of loaf sugar nine lemons twelve oz of bruised ginger three tablespoonfuls of yeast two lbs of raisins stoned and chopped one pint of brandy Mode Boil together for one hour in a copper let it previously be well scoured and beautifully clean the water sugar lemon rinds and bruised ginger remove every particle of scum as it rises and when the liquor is sufficiently boiled put it into a large tub or pan as it must not remain in the copper When nearly cold add the yeast which must be thick and very fresh and the next day put all in a dry cask with the strained lemon juice and chopped raisins Stir the wine every day for a fortnight then add the brandy stop the cask down by degrees and in a few weeks it will be fit to bottle Average cost twos per gallon Sufficient to make nine gallons of wine Seasonable The best time for making this wine is either in March or September Note Wine made early in March will be fit to bottle in June GOOSEBERRY VINEGAR An Excellent Recipe eighteen twenty INGREDIENTS two pecks of crystal gooseberries six gallons of water twelve lbs of foots sugar of the coarsest brown quality Mode Mash the gooseberries which should be quite ripe in a tub with a mallet put to them the water nearly milk warm let this stand twenty four hours then strain it through a sieve and put the sugar to it mix it well and tun it These proportions are for a nine gallon cask and if it be not quite full more water must be added Let the mixture be stirred from the bottom of the cask two or three times daily for three or four days to assist the melting of the sugar then paste a piece of linen cloth over the bunghole and set the cask in a warm place but not in the sun any corner of a warm kitchen is the best situation for it The following spring it should be drawn off into stone bottles and the vinegar will be fit for use twelve months after it is made This will be found a most excellent preparation greatly superior to much that is sold under the name of the best white wine vinegar Many years experience has proved that pickle made with this vinegar will keep when bought vinegar will not preserve the ingredients The cost per gallon is merely nominal especially to those who reside in the country and grow their own gooseberries the coarse sugar is then the only ingredient to be purchased Time To remain in the cask nine months Average cost when the gooseberries have to be purchased ones per gallon when they are grown at home sixd per gallon Seasonable This should be made the end of June or the beginning of July when gooseberries are ripe and plentiful EFFERVESCING GOOSEBERRY WINE eighteen twenty one INGREDIENTS To every gallon of water allow six lbs of green gooseberries three lbs of lump sugar Mode This wine should be prepared from unripe gooseberries in order to avoid the flavour which the fruit would give to the wine when in a mature state Its briskness depends more upon the time of bottling than upon the unripe state of the fruit for effervescing wine can be made from fruit that is ripe as well as that which is unripe The fruit should be selected when it has nearly attained its full growth and consequently before it shows any tendency to ripen Any bruised or decayed berries and those that are very small should be rejected The blossom and stalk ends should be removed and the fruit well bruised in a tub or pan in such quantities as to insure each berry being broken without crushing the seeds Pour the water which should be warm on the fruit squeeze and stir it with the hand until all the pulp is removed from the skin and seeds and cover the whole closely for twenty four hours after which strain it through a coarse bag and press it with as much force as can be conveniently applied to extract the whole of the juice and liquor the fruit may contain To every forty or fifty lbs of fruit one gallon more of hot water may be passed through the marc or husks in order to obtain any soluble matter that may remain and be again pressed The juice should be put into a tub or pan of sufficient size to contain all of it and the sugar added to it Let it be well stirred until the sugar is dissolved and place the pan in a warm situation keep it closely covered and let it ferment for a day or two It must then be drawn off into clean casks placed a little on one side for the scum that arises to be thrown out and the casks kept filled with the remaining must that should be reserved for that purpose When the active fermentation has ceased the casks should be plugged upright again filled if necessary the bungs be put in loosely and after a few days when the fermentation is a little more languid which may be known by the hissing noise ceasing the bungs should be driven in tight and a spile hole made to give vent if necessary About November or December on a clear fine day the wine should he racked from its lees into clean casks which may be rinsed with brandy After a month it should be examined to see if it is sufficiently clear for bottling if not it must be fined with isinglass which may be dissolved in some of the wine one oz will be sufficient for nine gallons In March or April or when the gooseberry bushes begin to blossom the wine must be bottled in order to insure its being effervescing Seasonable Make this the end of May or beginning of June before the berries ripen LEMON SYRUP eighteen twenty two INGREDIENTS two lbs of loaf sugar two pints of water one oz of citric acid twelve drachm of essence of lemon Mode Boil the sugar and water together for one four hour and put it into a basin where let it remain till cold Beat the

when it has ceased working put in the isinglass Stop the cask down in about six months put in the brandy and bottle the wine off Seasonable The best time to make this is in January or February when lemons are best and cheapest MALT WINE eighteen twenty four INGREDIENTS five gallons of water twenty eight lbs of sugar six quarts of sweet wort six quarts of tun three lbs of raisins one two lb of candy one pint of brandy Mode Boil the sugar and water together for ten minutes skim it well and put the liquor into a convenient sized pan or tub Allow it to cool then mix it with the sweet wort and tun Let it stand for three days then put it into a barrel here it will work or ferment for another three days or more then bung up the cask and keep it undisturbed for two or three months After this add the raisins whole the candy and brandy and in six months time bottle the wine off Those who do not brew may procure the sweet wort and tun from any brewer Sweet wort is the liquor that leaves the mash of malt before it is boiled with the hops tun is the new beer after the whole of the brewing operation has been completed Time To be boiled ten minutes to stand three days after mixing to ferment three days to remain in the cask two mouths before the raisins are added bottle six months after Seasonable Make this in March or October HOME MADE NOYEAU eighteen twenty five INGREDIENTS two oz of bitter almonds one oz of sweet ditto one lb of loaf sugar the rinds of three lemons one quart of Irish whiskey or gin one tablespoonful of clarified honey four pint of new milk Mode Blanch and pound

Seville orange juice one one four lb of loaf sugar Mode To bring out the full flavour of the orange peel rub a few lumps of the sugar on two or three unpared oranges and put these lumps to the rest Mix the brandy with the orange juice strained the rinds of six of the oranges pared very thin and the sugar Let all stand in a closely covered jar for about three days stirring it three or four times a day When clear it should be bottled and closely corked for a year it will then be ready for use but will keep any length of time This is a most excellent stomachic when taken pure in small quantities or as the strength of the brandy is very little deteriorated by the other ingredients it may be diluted with water Time To be stirred every day for three days Average cost sevens Sufficient to make two quarts Seasonable Make this in March A VERY SIMPLE AND EASY METHOD OF MAKING A VERY SUPERIOR ORANGE WINE eighteen twenty seven INGREDIENTS ninety Seville oranges thirty two lbs of lump sugar water Mode Break up the sugar into small pieces and put it into a dry sweet nine gallon cask placed in a cellar or other storehouse where it is intended to be kept Have ready close to the cask two large pans or wooden keelers into one of which put the peel of the oranges pared quite thin and into the other the pulp after the juice has been squeezed from it Strain the juice through a piece of double muslin and put it into the cask with the sugar Then pour about one one two gallon of cold spring water on both the peels and pulp let it stand for twenty four hours and then strain it into the cask add more water to the peels and pulp when this is done and repeat the same process every day for a week it should take about a week to fill up the cask Be careful to apportion the quantity as nearly as possible to the seven days and to stir the contents of the cask each day On the third day after the cask is full that is the tenth day after the commencement of making the cask may be securely bunged down This is a very simple and easy method and the wine made according to it will be pronounced to be most excellent There is no troublesome boiling and all fermentation takes place in the cask When the above directions are attended to the wine cannot fail to be good It should be bottled in eight or nine months and will be fit for use in a twelve month after the time of making Ginger wine may be made in precisely the same manner only with the nine gallon cask for ginger wine two lbs of the best whole ginger bruised must be put with the sugar It will be found convenient to tie the ginger loosely in a muslin bag Time Altogether ten days to make it Average cost twos sixd per gallon Sufficient for nine gallons Seasonable Make this in March and bottle it the following

to every gallon put three lbs of loaf sugar stir in the sugar until it is quite dissolved and add the lemon rind let the liquor remain and in four five or six days the fermentation will begin to subside and a crust or head will be formed which should be skimmed off or the liquor drawn from it when the crust begins to crack or separate Put the wine into a cask and if after that it ferments rack it off into another cask and in a fortnight stop it down If the wine should have lost any of its original sweetness add a little more loaf sugar taking care that the cask is full Bottle it off in February or March and in the summer it should be fit to drink It will improve greatly by keeping and should a very brilliant colour be desired add a little currant juice Seasonable Make this about the middle of May WELSH NECTAR eighteen thirty INGREDIENTS one lb of raisins three lemons two lbs of loaf sugar two gallons of boiling water Mode Cut the peel of the lemons very thin pour upon it the

Put all the ingredients into a silver cup regulating the proportion of ice by the state of the weather if very warm a larger quantity would be necessary Hand the cup round with a clean napkin passed through one of the handles that the edge of the cup may be wiped after each guest has partaken of the contents thereof Seasonable in summer CLARETS All those wines called in England clarets are the produce of the country round Bordeaux or the Bordelais but it is remarkable that there is no pure wine in France known by the name of claret which is a corruption of clairet a term that is applied there to any red or rose coloured wine Round Bordeaux are produced a number of wines of the first quality which pass under the name simply of vins de Bordeaux or have the designation of the particular district where they are made as Lafitte Latour c The clarets brought to the English market are frequently prepared for it by the wine growers by mixing together several Bordeaux wines or by adding to them a portion of some other wines but in France the pure wines are carefully preserved distinct The genuine wines of Bordeaux are of great variety that part being one of the most distinguished in France and the principal vineyards are those of Medoc Palus Graves and Blanche the product of each having characters considerably different CHAMPAGNE CUP eighteen thirty two INGREDIENTS one quart bottle of champagne two bottles of soda water one liqueur glass of brandy or Curacoa two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar one lb of pounded ice a sprig of green borage Mode Put all the ingredients into a silver cup stir them together and serve the same as claret cup No eighteen thirty one Should the above proportion of sugar not be found sufficient to suit some tastes increase the quantity When borage is not easily obtainable substitute for it a few slices of cucumber rind Seasonable Suitable for pic nics balls weddings and other festive occasions CHAMPAGNE This the most celebrated of French wines is the produce chiefly of the province of that name and is generally understood in England to be a brisk effervescing or sparkling white wine of a very fine flavour but this is only one of the varieties of this class There is both red and white champagne and each of these may be either still or brisk There are the sparkling wines mousseux and the still wines non mousseux The brisk are in general the most highly esteemed or at least are the most popular in this country on account of their delicate flavour and the agreeable pungency which they derive from the carbonic acid they contain and to which they owe their briskness GINGER BEER eighteen thirty three INGREDIENTS two one two lbs of loaf sugar one one two oz of bruised ginger one oz of cream of tartar the rind and juice of two lemons three gallons of boiling water two large tablespoonfuls of thick and fresh brewer s yeast Mode Peel the lemons squeeze the juice strain it and put the peel and juice into a large earthen pan with the bruised ginger cream of tartar and loaf sugar Pour over these ingredients three gallons of boiling water let it stand until just warm when add the yeast which should be thick and perfectly fresh Stir the contents of the pan well and let them remain near the fire all night covering the pan over with a cloth The next day skim off the yeast and pour the liquor carefully into another vessel leaving the sediment then bottle immediately and tie the corks down and in three days the ginger beer will be fit for use For some tastes the above proportion of sugar may be found rather too large when it may be diminished but the beer will not keep so long good Average cost for this quantity twos or one twod per bottle Sufficient to fill four dozen ginger beer bottles Seasonable This should be made during the summer months LEMONADE eighteen thirty four INGREDIENTS The rind of two lemons the juice of three large or four small ones one lb of loaf sugar one quart of boiling water Mode Rub some

quart of boiling water When the sugar is dissolved strain the lemonade through a fine sieve or piece of muslin and when cool it will be ready for use The lemonade will be much improved by having the white of an egg beaten up in it a little sherry mixed with it also makes this beverage much nicer Average cost sixd per quart LEMONADE There is a current opinion among women says Brillat Savarin which every year causes the death of many young women that acids especially vinegar are preventives of obesity Beyond all doubt acids have the effect of destroying obesity but they also destroy health and freshness Lemonade is of all acids the most harmless but few stomachs can resist it long I knew in seventeen seventy six at Dijon a young lady of great beauty to whom I was attached by bonds of friendship great almost as those of love One day when she had for some time gradually grown pale and thin previously she had a slight embonpoint she told me in confidence that as her young friends had ridiculed her for being fat she had to counteract the tendency been in the habit every day of drinking a large glass of vinaigre She died at eighteen years of age from the effects of these potions TO MAKE NEGUS eighteen thirty five INGREDIENTS To every pint of port wine allow one quart of boiling water one four lb of sugar one lemon grated nutmeg to taste Mode As this beverage is more usually drunk at children s parties than at any other the wine need not be very old or expensive for the purpose a new fruity wine answering very well for it Put the wine into a jug rub some lumps of sugar equal to one four lb on the lemon rind until all the yellow part of the skin is absorbed then squeeze the juice and strain it Add the sugar and lemon juice to the port wine with the grated nutmeg pour over it the boiling water cover the jug and when the beverage has cooled a little it will be fit for use Negus may also be made of sherry or any other sweet white wine but is more usually made of port than of any other beverage Sufficient Allow one pint of wine with the other ingredients in proportion for a party of nine or ten children A PLEASANT DRINK FOR WARM WEATHER eighteen thirty six INGREDIENTS To every one one two pint of good ale allow one bottle of ginger beer Mode For this beverage the ginger beer must be in an effervescing state and the beer not in the least turned or sour Mix them together and drink immediately The draught is refreshing and wholesome as the ginger corrects the action of the beer It does not deteriorate by standing a little but of course is better when taken fresh FOR A SUMMER DRAUGHT eighteen thirty seven INGREDIENTS The juice of one lemon a tumbler ful of cold water pounded sugar to taste four small teaspoonful of carbonate of soda Mode Squeeze the juice from the lemon strain and add it to the water with sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely When well mixed put in the soda stir well and drink while the mixture is in an effervescing state TO MULL WINE eighteen thirty eight INGREDIENTS To every pint of wine allow one large cupful of water sugar and spice to taste Mode In making preparations like the above it is very difficult to give the exact proportions of ingredients like sugar and spice as what quantity might suit one person would be to another quite distasteful Boil the spice in the water until the flavour is extracted then add the wine and sugar and bring the whole to the boiling point when serve with strips of crisp dry toast or with biscuits The spices usually used for mulled wine are cloves grated nutmeg and cinnamon or mace Any kind of wine may be mulled but port and claret are those usually selected for the purpose and the latter requires a very large proportion of sugar The vessel that the wine is boiled in must be delicately clean and should be kept exclusively for the purpose Small tin warmers may be purchased for a trifle which are more suitable than saucepans as if the latter are not scrupulously clean they will spoil the wine by imparting to it a very disagreeable flavour These warmers should be used for no other purposes TO MAKE HOT PUNCH eighteen thirty nine INGREDIENTS one two pint of rum one two pint of brandy one four lb of sugar one large lemon one two teaspoonful of nutmeg one pint of boiling water Illustration PUNCH BOWL AND LADLE Mode Rub the sugar over the lemon until it has absorbed all the yellow part of the skin then put the sugar into a punchbowl add the lemon juice free from pips and mix these two ingredients well together Pour over them the boiling water stir well together add the rum brandy and nutmeg mix thoroughly and the punch will be ready to serve It is very important in making good punch that all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated and to insure success the processes of mixing must be diligently attended to Sufficient Allow a quart for four persons but this information must be taken cum grano salis for the capacities of persons for this kind of beverage are generally supposed to vary considerably PUNCH is a beverage made of various spirituous liquors or wine hot water the acid juice of fruits and sugar It is considered to be very intoxicating but this is probably because the spirit being partly sheathed by the mucilaginous juice and the sugar its strength does not appear to the taste so great as it really is Punch which was almost universally drunk among the middle classes about fifty or sixty years ago has almost disappeared from our domestic tables being superseded by wine There are many different varieties of punch It is sometimes kept cold in bottles and makes a most agreeable summer drink In Scotland instead of the Madeira or sherry generally used in its manufacture whiskey is substituted and then its insidious properties are more than usually felt Where fresh lemons cannot be had for punch or similar beverages crystallized citric acid and a few drops of the essence of lemon will be very nearly the same thing In the composition of Regent s punch champagne brandy and veritable Martinique are required Norfolk punch requires Seville oranges Milk punch may be extemporized by adding a little hot milk to lemonade and then straining it through a jelly bag Then there are Wine punch Tea punch and French punch made with lemons spirits and wine in fantastic proportions But of all the compounds of these materials perhaps for a summer drink the North American mint julep is the most inviting Captain Marryat gives the following recipe for its preparation Put into a tumbler about a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint upon them put a spoonful of white sugar and equal proportions of peach and common brandy so as to fill up one third or perhaps a little less then take rasped or pounded ice and fill up the tumbler Epicures rub the lips of the tumbler with a piece of fresh pineapple and the tumbler itself is very often encrusted outside with stalactites of ice As the ice melts you drink The Virginians say Captain Marryat claim the merit of having invented this superb compound but from a passage in the Comus of Milton he claims it for his own country WHISKEY CORDIAL eighteen forty INGREDIENTS one lb of ripe white currants the rind of two lemons one four oz of grated ginger one quart of whiskey one lb of lump sugar Mode Strip the currants from the stalks put them into a large jug add the lemon rind ginger and whiskey cover the jug closely and let it remain covered for twenty four hours Strain through a hair sieve add the lump sugar and let it stand twelve hours longer then bottle and cork well Time To stand twenty four hours before being strained twelve hours after the sugar is added Seasonable Make this in July Illustration INVALID COOKERY CHAPTER XXXVIII A FEW RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN COOKING FOR INVALIDS eighteen forty one LET all the kitchen utensils used in the preparation of invalids cookery be delicately and scrupulously clean if this is not the case a disagreeable flavour may be imparted to the preparation which flavour may disgust and prevent the patient from partaking of the refreshment when brought to him or her eighteen forty two For invalids never make a large quantity of one thing as they seldom require much at a time and it is desirable that variety be provided for them eighteen forty three Always have something in readiness a little beef tea nicely made and nicely skimmed a few spoonfuls of jelly c c that it may be administered as soon almost as the invalid wishes for it If obliged to wait a long time the patient loses the desire to eat and often turns against the food when brought to him or her eighteen forty four In sending dishes or preparations up to invalids let everything look as tempting as possible Have a clean tray cloth laid smoothly over the tray let the spoons tumblers cups and saucers c be very clean and bright Gruel served in a tumbler is more appetizing than when served in a basin or cup and saucer eighteen forty five As milk is an important article of food for the sick in warm weather let it be kept on ice to prevent its turning sour Many other delicacies may also be preserved good in the same manner for some little time eighteen forty six If the patient be allowed to eat vegetables never send them up undercooked or half raw and let a small quantity only be temptingly arranged on a dish This rule will apply to every preparation as an invalid is much more likely to enjoy his food if small delicate pieces are served to him eighteen forty seven Never leave food about a sick room if the patient cannot eat it when brought to him take it away and bring it to him in an hour or two s time Miss Nightingale says To leave the patient s untasted food by his side from meal to meal in hopes that he will eat it in the interval is simply to prevent him from taking any food at all She says I have known patients literally incapacitated from taking one article of food after another by this piece of ignorance Let the food come at the right time and be taken away eaten or uneaten at the right time but never let a patient have something always standing by him if you don t wish to disgust him of everything eighteen forty eight Never serve beef tea or broth with the smallest particle of fat or grease on the surface It is better after making either of these to allow them to get perfectly cold when all the fat may be easily removed then warm up as much as may be required Two or three pieces of clean whity brown paper laid on the broth will absorb any greasy particles that may be floating at the top as the grease will cling to the paper eighteen forty nine Roast mutton chickens rabbits calves feet or head game fish simply dressed and simple puddings are all light food and easily digested Of course these things are only partaken of supposing the patient is recovering eighteen fifty A mutton chop nicely cut trimmed and broiled to a turn is a dish to be recommended for invalids but it must not be served with all the fat at the end nor must it be too thickly cut Let it be cooked over a fire free from smoke and sent up with the gravy in it between two very hot plates Nothing is more disagreeable to an invalid than smoked food eighteen fifty one In making toast and water never blacken the bread but toast it only a nice brown Never leave toast and water to make until the moment it is required as it cannot then be properly prepared at least the patient will be obliged to drink it warm which is anything but agreeable eighteen fifty two In boiling eggs for invalids let the white be just set if boiled hard they will be likely to disagree with the patient eighteen fifty three In Miss Nightingale s admirable Notes on Nursing a book that no mother or nurse should be without she says You cannot be too careful as to quality in sick diet A nurse should never put before a patient milk that is sour meat or soup that is turned an egg that is bad or vegetables underdone Yet often she says she has seen these things brought in to the sick in a state perfectly perceptible to every nose or eye except the nurse s It is here that the clever nurse appears she will not bring in the peccant article but not to disappoint the patient she will whip up something else in a few minutes Remember that sick cookery should half do the work of your poor patient s weak digestion eighteen fifty four She goes on to caution nurses by saying Take care not to spill into your patient s saucer in other words take care that the outside bottom rim of his cup shall be quite dry and clean If every time he lifts his cup to his lips he has to carry the saucer with it or else to drop the liquid upon and to soil his sheet or bedgown or pillow or if he is sitting up his dress you have no idea what a difference this minute want of care on your part makes to his comfort and even to his willingness for food RECIPES CHAPTER XXXIX TO MAKE ARROWROOT eighteen fifty five INGREDIENTS Two teaspoonfuls of arrowroot three tablespoonfuls of cold water one two pint of boiling water Mode Mix the arrowroot smoothly in a basin with the cold water then pour on it the boiling water stirring all the time The water must be boiling at the time it is poured on the mixture or it will not thicken if mixed with hot water only it must be put into a clean saucepan and boiled until it thickens but this is more trouble and quite unnecessary if the water is boiling at first Put the arrowroot into a tumbler sweeten it with lump sugar and flavour it with grated nutmeg or cinnamon or a piece of lemon peel or when allowed three tablespoonfuls of port or sherry As arrowroot is in itself flavourless and insipid it is almost necessary to add the wine to make it palatable Arrowroot made with milk instead of water is far nicer but is not so easily digested It should be mixed in the same manner with three tablespoonfuls of cold water the boiling milk then poured on it and well stirred When made in this manner no wine should be added but merely sugar and a little grated nutmeg or lemon peel Time If obliged to be boiled two minutes Average cost twod per pint Sufficient to make one two pint of arrowroot MISS NIGHTINGALE says in her Notes on Nursing that arrowroot is a grand dependence of the nurse As a vehicle for wine and as a restorative quickly prepared it is all very well but it is nothing but starch and water flour is both more nutritive and less liable to ferment and is preferable wherever it can be used BARLEY GRUEL eighteen fifty six INGREDIENTS two oz of Scotch or pearl barley one two pint of port wine the rind of one lemon one quart and one two pint of water sugar to taste Mode After well washing the barley boil it in one two pint of water for one four hour then pour this water away put to the barley the quart of fresh boiling water and let it boil until the liquid is reduced to half then strain it off Add the wine sugar and lemon peel simmer for five minutes and put it away in a clean jug It can be warmed from time to time as required Time To be boiled until reduced to half Average cost ones sixd Sufficient with the wine to make one one two pint of gruel TO MAKE BARLEY WATER eighteen fifty seven INGREDIENTS two oz of pearl barley two quarts of boiling water one pint of cold water Mode Wash the barley in cold water put it into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water and when it has boiled for about one four hour strain off the water and add the two quarts of fresh boiling water Boil it until the liquid is reduced one half strain it and it will be ready for use It may be flavoured with lemon peel after being sweetened or a small piece may be simmered with the barley When the invalid may take it a little lemon juice gives this pleasant drink in illness a very nice flavour Time To boil until the liquid is reduced one half Sufficient to make one quart of barley water TO MAKE BEEF TEA eighteen fifty eight INGREDIENTS one lb of lean gravy beef one quart of water one saltspoonful of salt Mode Have the meat cut without fat and bone and choose a nice fleshy piece Cut it into small pieces about the size of dice and put it into a clean saucepan Add the water cold to it put it on the fire and bring it to the boiling point then skim well Put in the salt when the water boils and simmer the beef tea gently from one two to three four hour removing any more scum should it appear on the surface Strain the tea through a hair sieve and set it by in a cool place When wanted for use remove every particle of fat from the top warm up as much as may be required adding if necessary a little more salt This preparation is simple beef tea and is to be administered to those invalids to whom flavourings and seasonings are not allowed When the patient is very low use double the quantity of meat to the same proportion of water Should the invalid be able to take the tea prepared in a more palatable manner it is easy to make it so by following the directions in the next recipe which is an admirable one for making savoury beef tea Beef tea is always better when made the day before it is wanted and then warmed up It is a good plan to put the tea into a small cup or basin and to place this basin in a saucepan of boiling water When the tea is warm it is ready to serve Time one four to three four hour Average cost sixd per pint Sufficient Allow one lb of meat for a pint of good beef tea MISS NIGHTINGALE says one of the most common errors among nurses with respect to sick diet is the belief that beef tea is the most nutritive of all article She says Just try and boil down a lb of beef into beef tea evaporate your beef tea and see what is left of your beef you will find that there is barely a teaspoonful of solid nourishment to one four pint of water in beef tea Nevertheless there is a certain reparative quality in it we do not know what as there is in tea but it maybe safely given in almost any inflammatory disease and is as little to be depended upon with the healthy or convalescent where much nourishment is required SAVOURY BEEF TEA Soyer s Recipe eighteen fifty nine INGREDIENTS one lb of solid beef one oz of butter one clove two button onions or one two a large one one saltspoonful of salt one quart of water Mode Cut the beef into very small dice put it into a stewpan with the butter clove onion and salt stir the meat round over the fire for a few minutes until it produces a thin gravy then add the water and let it simmer gently from one two to three four hour skimming off every particle of fat When done strain it through a sieve and put it by in a cool place until required The same if wanted quite plain is done by merely omitting the vegetables salt and clove the butter cannot be objectionable as it is taken out in skimming Time one two to three four hour Average cost eightd per pint Sufficient Allow one lb of beef to make one pint of good beef tea Note The meat loft from beef tea may be boiled a little longer and pounded with spices c for potting It makes a very nice breakfast dish doctor CHRISTISON says that every one will be struck with the readiness with which certain classes of patients will often take diluted meat juice or beef tea repeatedly when they refuse all other kinds of food This is particularly remarkable in case of gastric fever in which he says little or nothing else besides beef tea or diluted meat juice has been taken for weeks or even months and yet a pint of beef tea contains scarcely one four oz of anything but water The result is so striking that he asks What is its mode of action Not simple nutriment one four oz of the most nutritive material cannot nearly replace the daily wear and tear of the tissue in any circumstances Possibly he says it belongs to a new denomination of remedies BAKED BEEF TEA eighteen sixty INGREDIENTS one lb of fleshy beef one one two pint of water one four saltspoonful of salt Mode Cut the beef into small square pieces after trimming off all the fat and put it into a baking jar with the above proportion of water and salt cover the jar well place it in a warm but not hot oven and bake for three or four hours When the oven is very fierce in the daytime it is a good plan to put the jar in at night and let it remain till the next morning when the tea will be done It should be strained and put by in a cool place until wanted It may also be flavoured with an onion a clove and a few sweet herbs c when the stomach is sufficiently strong to take those Time three or four hours or to be left in the oven all night Average cost sixd per pint Sufficient Allow one lb of meat for one pint of good beef tea BAKED OR STEWED CALF S FOOT eighteen sixty one INGREDIENTS one calf s foot one pint of milk one pint of water one blade of mace the rind of one four lemon pepper and salt to taste Mode Well clean the foot and either stew or bake it in the milk and water with the other ingredients from three to four hours To enhance the flavour an onion and a small quantity of celery may be added if approved one two a teacupful of cream stirred in just before serving is also a great improvement to this dish Time three to four hours Average cost in full season nined each Sufficient for one person Seasonable from March to October CALF S FOOT BROTH eighteen sixty two INGREDIENTS one calf s foot three pints of water one small lump of sugar nutmeg to taste the yolk of one egg a piece of butter the size of a nut Mode Stew the foot in the water with the lemon peel very gently until the liquid is half wasted removing any scum should it rise to the surface Set it by in a basin until quite cold then take off every particle of fat Warm up about one two pint of the broth adding the butter sugar and a very small quantity of grated nutmeg take it off the fire for a minute or two then add the beaten yolk of the egg keep stirring over the fire until the mixture thickens but do not allow it to boil again after the egg is added or it will curdle and the broth will be spoiled Time To be boiled until the liquid is reduced one half Average cost in full season nined each Sufficient to make one one four pint of broth Seasonable from March to October CHICKEN BROTH eighteen sixty three INGREDIENTS one two fowl or the inferior joints of a whole one one quart of water one blade of mace one two onion a small bunch of sweet herbs salt to taste ten peppercorns Mode An old fowl not suitable for eating may be converted into very good broth or if a young one be used the inferior joints may be put in the broth and the best pieces reserved for dressing in some other manner Put the fowl into a saucepan with all the ingredients and simmer gently for one one two hour carefully skimming the broth well When done strain and put by in a cool place until wanted then take all the fat off the top warm up as much as may be required and serve This broth is of course only for those invalids whose stomachs are strong enough to digest it with a flavouring of herbs c It may be made in the same manner as beef tea with water and salt only but the preparation will be but tasteless and insipid When the invalid cannot digest this chicken broth with the flavouring we would recommend plain beef tea in preference to plain chicken tea which it would be without the addition of herbs onions c Time one one two hour Sufficient to make rather more than one pint of broth NUTRITIOUS COFFEE eighteen sixty four INGREDIENTS one two oz of ground coffee one pint of milk Mode Let the coffee be freshly ground put it into a saucepan with the milk which should be made nearly boiling before the coffee is put in and boil both together for three minutes clear it by pouring some of it into a cup and then back again and leave it on the hob for a few minutes to settle thoroughly This coffee may be made still more nutritious by the addition of an egg well beaten and put into the coffee cup Time five minutes to boil five minutes to settle Sufficient to make one large breakfast cupful of coffee Our great nurse Miss Nightingale remarks that a great deal too much against tea is said by wise people and a great deal too much of tea is given to the sick by foolish people When you see the natural and almost universal craving in English sick for their tea you cannot but feel that Nature knows what she is about But a little tea or coffee restores them quite as much as a great deal and a great deal of tea and especially of coffee impairs the little power of digestion they have Yet a nurse because she sees how one or two cups of tea or coffee restore her patient thinks that three or four cups will do twice as much This is not the case at all it is however certain that there is nothing yet discovered which is a substitute to the English patient for his cup of tea he can take it when he can take nothing else and he often can t take anything else if he has it not Coffee is a better restorative than tea but a greater impairer of the digestion In making coffee it is absolutely necessary to buy it in the berry and grind it at home otherwise you may reckon upon its containing a certain amount of chicory at least This is not a question of the taste or of the wholesomeness of chicory it is that chicory has nothing at all of the properties for which you give coffee and therefore you may as well not give it THE INVALID S CUTLET eighteen sixty five INGREDIENTS one nice cutlet from a loin or neck of mutton two teacupfuls of water one very small stick of celery pepper and salt to taste Mode Have the cutlet cut from a very nice loin or neck of mutton take off all the fat put it into a stewpan with the other ingredients stew very gently indeed for nearly two hours and skim off every particle of fat that may rise to the surface from time to time The celery should be cut into thin slices before it is added to the meat and care must be taken not to put in too much of this ingredient or the dish will not be good If the water is allowed to boil fast the cutlet will be hard Time two hours very gentle stewing Average cost sixd Sufficient for one person Seasonable at any time EEL BROTH eighteen sixty six INGREDIENTS one two lb of eels a small bunch of sweet herbs including parsley one two onion ten peppercorns three pints of water two cloves salt and pepper to taste Mode After having cleaned and skinned the eel cut it into small pieces and put it into a stewpan with the other ingredients simmer gently until the liquid is reduced nearly half carefully removing the scum as it rises Strain it through a hair sieve put it by in a cool place and when wanted take off all the fat from the top warm up as much as is required and serve with sippets of toasted bread This is a very nutritious broth and easy of digestion Time To be simmered until the liquor is reduced to half Average cost sixd Sufficient to make one one two pint of broth Seasonable from June to March EGG WINE eighteen sixty seven INGREDIENTS one egg one tablespoonful and one two glass of cold water one glass of sherry sugar and grated nutmeg to taste Mode Beat the egg mixing with it a tablespoonful of cold water make the wine and water hot but not boiling pour it on the egg stirring all the time Add sufficient lump sugar to sweeten the mixture and a little grated nutmeg put all into a very clean saucepan set it on a gentle fire and stir the contents one way until they thicken but do not allow them to boil Serve in a glass with sippets of toasted bread or plain crisp biscuits When the egg is not warmed the mixture will be found easier of digestion but it is not so pleasant a drink Sufficient for one person TO MAKE GRUEL eighteen sixty eight INGREDIENTS one tablespoonful of Robinson s patent groats two tablespoonfuls of cold water one pint of boiling water Mode Mix the prepared groats smoothly with the cold water in a basin pour over them the boiling water stirring it all the time Put it into a very clean saucepan boil the gruel for ten minutes keeping it well stirred sweeten to taste and serve It may be flavoured with a small piece of lemon peel by boiling it in the gruel or a little grated nutmeg may be put in but in these matters the taste of the patient should be consulted Pour the gruel in a tumbler and serve When wine is allowed to the invalid two tablespoonfuls of sherry or port make this preparation very nice In cases of colds the same quantity of spirits is sometimes added instead of wine Time ten minutes Sufficient to make a pint of gruel INVALID S JELLY eighteen sixty nine INGREDIENTS twelve shanks of mutton three quarts of water a bunch of sweet herbs pepper and salt to taste three blades of mace one onion one lb of lean beef a crust of bread toasted brown Mode Soak the shanks in plenty of water for some hours and scrub them well put them with the beef and other ingredients into a saucepan with the water and let them simmer very gently for five hours Strain the broth and when cold take off all the fat It may be eaten either warmed up or cold as a jelly Time five hours Average cost ones Sufficient to make from one one two to two pints of jelly Seasonable at any time LEMONADE FOR INVALIDS eighteen seventy INGREDIENTS one two lemon lump sugar to taste one pint of boiling water Mode Pare off the rind of the lemon thinly cut the lemon into two or three thick slices and remove as much as possible of the white outside pith and all the pips Put the slices of lemon the peel and lump sugar into a jug pour over the boiling water cover it closely and in two hours it will be fit to drink It should either be strained or poured off from the sediment Time two hours Average cost twod Sufficient to make one pint of lemonade Seasonable at any time NOURISHING LEMONADE eighteen seventy one INGREDIENTS one one two pint of boiling water the juice of four lemons the rinds of two one two pint of sherry four eggs six oz of loaf sugar Mode Pare off the lemon rind thinly put it into a jug with the sugar and pour over the boiling water Let it cool then strain it add the wine lemon juice and eggs previously well beaten and also strained and the beverage will be ready for use If thought desirable the quantity of sherry and water could be lessened and milk substituted for them To obtain the flavour of the lemon rind properly a few lumps of the sugar should be rubbed over it until some of the yellow is absorbed Time Altogether one hour to make it Average cost ones eightd Sufficient to make two one two pints of lemonade Seasonable at any time TO MAKE MUTTON BROTH eighteen seventy two INGREDIENTS one lb of the scrag end of the neck of mutton one onion a bunch of sweet herbs four turnip one two pints of water pepper and salt to taste Mode Put the mutton into a stewpan pour over the water cold and add the other ingredients When it boils skim it very carefully cover the pan closely and let it simmer very gently for an hour strain it let it cool take off all the fat from the surface and warm up as much as may be required adding if the patient be allowed to take it a teaspoonful of minced parsley which has been previously scalded Pearl barley or rice are very nice additions to mutton broth and should be boiled as long as the other ingredients When either of these is added the broth must not be strained but merely thoroughly skimmed Plain mutton broth without seasoning is made by merely boiling the mutton water and salt together straining it letting the broth cool skimming all the fat off and warming up as much as is required This preparation would be very tasteless and insipid but likely to agree with very delicate stomachs whereas the least addition of other ingredients would have the contrary effect Time one hour Average cost sevend Sufficient to make from one one two to two pints of broth Seasonable at any time Note Veal broth may be made in the same manner the knuckle of a leg or shoulder is the part usually used for this purpose It is very good with the addition of the inferior joints of a fowl or a few shank bones MUTTON BROTH QUICKLY MADE eighteen seventy three INGREDIENTS one or two chops from a neck of mutton one pint of water a small bunch of sweet herbs one four of an onion pepper and salt to taste Mode Cut the meat into small pieces put it into a saucepan with the bones but no skin or fat add the other ingredients cover the saucepan and bring the water quickly to boil Take the lid off and continue the rapid boiling for twenty minutes skimming it well during the process strain the broth into a basin if there should be any fat left on the surface remove it by laying a piece of thin paper on the top the greasy particles will adhere to the paper and so free the preparation from them To an invalid nothing is more disagreeable than broth served with a quantity of fat floating on the top to avoid this it is always better to allow it to get thoroughly cool the fat can then be so easily removed Time twenty minutes after the water boils Average cost fived Sufficient to make one two pint of broth Seasonable at any time STEWED RABBITS IN MILK eighteen seventy four INGREDIENTS two very young rabbits not nearly half grown one one two pint of milk one blade of mace one dessertspoonful of flour a little salt and cayenne Mode Mix the flour very smoothly with four tablespoonfuls of the milk and when this is well mixed add the remainder Cut up the rabbits into joints put them into a stewpan with the milk and other ingredients and simmer them very gently until quite tender Stir the contents from time to time to keep the milk smooth and prevent it from burning one two hour will be sufficient for the cooking of this dish Time one two hour Average cost from ones to ones sixd each Sufficient for three or four meals Seasonable from September to February RICE MILK eighteen seventy five INGREDIENTS three tablespoonfuls of rice one quart of milk sugar to taste when liked a little grated nutmeg Mode Well wash the rice put it into a saucepan with the milk and simmer gently until the rice is tender stirring it from time to time to prevent the milk from burning sweeten it add a little grated nutmeg and serve This dish is also very suitable and wholesome for children it may be flavoured with a little lemon peel and a little finely minced suet may be boiled with it which renders it more strengthening and more wholesome Tapioca semolina vermicelli and macaroni may all be dressed in the same manner Time From three four to one hour Seasonable at any time TO MAKE TOAST AND WATER eighteen seventy six INGREDIENTS A slice of bread one quart of boiling water Mode Cut a slice from a stale loaf a piece of hard crust is better than anything else for the purpose toast it of a nice brown on every side but do not allow it to burn or blacken Put it into a jug pour the boiling water over it cover it closely and let it remain until cold When strained it will be ready for use Toast and water should always be made a short time before it is required to enable it to get cold if drunk in a tepid or lukewarm state it is an exceedingly disagreeable beverage If as is sometimes the case this drink is wanted in a hurry put the toasted bread into a jug and only just cover it with the boiling water when this is cool cold water may be added in the proportion required the toast and water strained it will then be ready for use and is more expeditiously prepared than by the above method TOAST SANDWICHES eighteen seventy seven INGREDIENTS Thin cold toast thin slices of bread and butter pepper and salt to taste Mode Place a very thin piece of cold toast between two slices of thin bread and butter in the form of a sandwich adding a seasoning of pepper and salt This sandwich may be varied by adding a little pulled meat or very fine slices of cold meat to the toast and in any of these forms will be found very tempting to the appetite of an invalid eighteen seventy eight Besides the recipes contained in this chapter there are in the previous chapters on cookery many others suitable for invalids which it would be useless to repeat here Recipes for fish simply dressed light soups plain roast meat well dressed vegetables poultry simple puddings jelly stewed fruits c c all of which dishes may be partaken of by invalids and convalescents will be found in preceding chapters DINNERS AND DINING CHAPTER XL eighteen seventy nine Man it has been said is a dining animal Creatures of the inferior races eat and drink man only dines It has also been said that he is a cooking animal but some races eat food without cooking it A Croat captain said to M Brillat Savarin When in campaign we feel hungry we knock over the first animal we find cut off a steak powder it with salt put it under the saddle gallop over it for half a mile and then eat it Huntsmen in Dauphiny when out shooting have been known to kill a bird pluck it salt and pepper it and cook it by carrying it some time in their caps It is equally true that some races of men do not dine any more than the tiger or the vulture It is not a dinner at which sits the aboriginal Australian who gnaws his bone half bare and then flings it behind to his squaw And the native of Terra del Fuego does not dine when he gets his morsel of red clay Dining is the privilege of civilization The rank which a people occupy in the grand scale may be measured by their way of taking their meals as well as by their way of treating their women The nation which knows how to dine has learnt the leading lesson of progress It implies both the will and the skill to reduce to order and surround with idealisms and graces the more material conditions of human existence and wherever that will and that skill exist life cannot be wholly ignoble eighteen eighty Dinner being the grand solid meal of the day is a matter of considerable importance and a well served table is a striking index of human ingenuity and resource Their table says Lord Byron in describing a dinner party given by Lord and Lady Amundevillo at Norman Abbey Their table was a board to tempt even ghosts To pass the Styx for more substantial feasts I will not dwell upon ragouts or roasts Albeit all human history attests That happiness for man the hungry sinner Since Eve ate apples much depends on dinner And then he goes on to observe upon the curious complexity of the results produced by human cleverness and application catering for the modifications which occur in civilized life one of the simplest of the primal instincts The mind is lost in mighty contemplation Of intellect expended on two courses And indigestion s grand multiplication Requires arithmetic beyond my forces Who would suppose from Adam s simple ration That cookery could have call d forth such resources As form a science and a nomenclature From out the commonest demands of nature And we may well say Who indeed would suppose it The gulf between the Croat with a steak under his saddle and Alexis Soyer getting up a great dinner at the Reform Club or even Thackeray s missus Raymond Gray giving a little dinner to mister Snob with one of those famous roly poly puddings of hers what a gulf it is eighteen eighty one That Adam s ration however was simple is a matter on which we have contrary judgments given by the poets When Raphael paid that memorable visit to Paradise which we are expressly told by Milton he did exactly at dinner time Eve seems to have prepared a little dinner not wholly destitute of complexity and to have added ice creams and perfumes Nothing can be clearer than the testimony of the poet on these points And Eve within due at her home prepared For dinner savoury fruits of taste to please True appetite and not disrelish thirst Of nectarous draughts between With dispatchful looks in haste She turns on hospitable thoughts intent What choice to choose for delicacy best What order so contrived as not to mix Tastes not well join d inelegant but bring Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change She tempers dulcet creams then strews the ground With rose and odours It may be observed in passing that the poets though they have more to say about wine than solid food because the former more directly stimulates the intellect and the feelings do not flinch from the subject of eating and drinking There is infinite zest in the above passage from Milton and even more in the famous description of a dainty supper given by Keats in his Eve of Saint Agnes Could Queen Mab herself desire to sit down to anything nicer both as to its appointments and serving and as to its quality than the collation served by Porphyro in the lady s bedroom while she slept There by the bedside where the faded moon Made a dim silver twilight soft he set A table and half anguish d threw thereor A cloth of woven crimson gold and jet While he from forth the closet brought a heap Of candied apple quince and plum and gourd With jellies smoother than the creamy curd And lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon Manna and dates in argosy transferr d From Fez and spiced dainties every one From silken Samarcand to cedar d Lebanon But Tennyson has ventured beyond dates and quinces and syrups which may be thought easy to be brought in by a poet In his idyl of Audley Court he gives a most appetizing description of a pasty at a pic nic There on a slope of orchard Francis laid A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home And half cut down a pasty costly made Where quail and pigeon lark and leveret lay Like fossils of the rock with golden yolks Imbedded and injellied We gladly quote passages like these to show how eating and drinking may be surrounded with poetical associations and how man using his privilege to turn any and every repast into a feast of reason with a warm and plentiful flow of soul may really count it as not the least of his legitimate prides that he is a dining animal eighteen eighty two It has been said indeed that great men in general are great diners This however can scarcely be true of any great men but men of action and in that case it would simply imply that persons of vigorous constitution who work hard eat heartily for of course a life of action requires a vigorous constitution even though there may be much illness as in such cases as William III and our brave General Napier Of men of thought it can scarcely be true that they eat so much in a general way though even they eat more than they are apt to suppose they do for as mister Lewes observes nerve tissue is very expensive Leaving great men of all kinds however to get their own dinners let us who are not great look after ours Dine we must and we may as well dine elegantly as well as wholesomely eighteen eighty three There are plenty of elegant dinners in modern days and they were not wanting in ancient times It is well known that the dinner party or symposium was a not unimportant and not unpoetical feature in the life of the sociable talkative tasteful Greek Douglas Jerrold said that such is the British humour for dining and giving of dinners that if London were to be destroyed by an earthquake the Londoners would meet at a public dinner to consider the subject The Greeks too were great diners their social and religious polity gave them many chances of being merry and making others merry on good eating and drinking Any public or even domestic sacrifice to one of the gods was sure to be followed by a dinner party the remains of the slaughtered offering being served up on the occasion as a pious piece de resistance and as the different gods goddesses and demigods worshipped by the community in general or by individuals were very numerous indeed and some very religious people never let a day pass without offering up something or other the dinner parties were countless A birthday too was an excuse for a dinner a birthday that is of any person long dead and buried as well as of a living person being a member of the family or otherwise esteemed Dinners were of course eaten on all occasions of public rejoicing Then among the young people subscription dinners very much after the manner of modern times were always being got up only that they would be eaten not at an hotel but probably at the house of one of the heterae A Greek dinner party was a handsome well regulated affair The guests came in elegantly dressed and crowned with flowers A slave approaching each person as he entered took off his sandals and washed his feet During the repast the guests reclined on couches with pillows among and along which were set small tables After the solid meal came the symposium proper a scene of music merriment and dancing the two latter being supplied chiefly by young girls There was a chairman or symposiarch appointed by the company to regulate the drinking and it was his duty to mix the wine in the mighty bowl From this bowl the attendants ladled the liquor into goblets and with the goblets went round and round the tables filling the cups of the guests eighteen eighty four The elegance with which a dinner is served is a matter which depends of course partly upon the means but still more upon the taste of the master and mistress of the house It may be observed in general that there should always be flowers on the table and as they form no item of expense there is no reason why they should not be employed every day eighteen eighty five The variety in the dishes which furnish forth a modern dinner table does not necessarily imply anything unwholesome or anything capricious Food that is not well relished cannot be well digested and the appetite of the over worked man of business or statesman or of any dweller in towns whose occupations are exciting and exhausting is jaded and requires stimulation Men and women who are in rude health and who have plenty of air and exercise eat the simplest food with relish and consequently digest it well but those conditions are out of the reach of many men They must suit their mode of dining to their mode of living if they cannot choose the latter It is in serving up food that is at once appetizing and wholesome that the skill of the modern housewife is severely tasked and she has scarcely a more important duty to fulfil It is in fact her particular vocation in virtue of which she may be said to hold the health of the family and of the friends of the family in her hands from day to day It has been said that the destiny of nations depends on the manner in which they are fed and a great gastronomist exclaims Tell me what kind of food you eat and I will tell you what kind of man you are The same writer has some sentences of the same kind which are rather hyperbolical but worth quoting The pleasures of the table belong to all ages to all conditions to all countries and to all eras they mingle with all other pleasures and remain at last to console us for their departure The discovery of a new dish confers more happiness upon humanity than the discovery of a new star eighteen eighty six The gastronomist from whom we have already quoted has some aphorisms and short directions in relation to dinner parties which are well deserving of notice Let the number of your guests never exceed twelve so that the conversation may be general Footnote We have seen this varied by saying that the number should never exceed that of the Muses or fall below that of the Graces Let the temperature of the dining room be about sixty eight deg Let the dishes be few in number in the first course but proportionally good The order of food is from the most substantial to the lightest The order of drinking wine is from the mildest to the most foamy and most perfumed To invite a person to your house is to take charge of his happiness so long as he is beneath your roof The mistress of the house should always be certain that the coffee be excellent whilst the master should be answerable for the quality of his wines and liqueurs BILLS OF FARE JANUARY

servants being required to carve and to help the guests besides there being a necessity for more plates dishes knives forks and spoons than are usually to be found in any other than a very large establishment Where however a service a la Russe is practicable there it perhaps no mode of serving a dinner so enjoyable as this SUPPERS twenty one thirty nine Much may be done in the arrangement of a supper table at a very small expense provided taste and ingenuity are exercised The colours and flavours of the various dishes should contrast nicely there should be plenty of fruit and flowers on the table and the room should be well lighted We have endeavoured to show how the various dishes may be placed but of course these little matters entirely depend on the length and width of the table used on individual taste whether the tables are arranged round the room whether down the centre with a cross one at the top or whether the supper is laid in two separate rooms c c The garnishing of the dishes has also much to do with the appearance of a supper table Hams and tongues should be ornamented with cut vegetable flowers raised pies with aspic jelly cut in dice and all the dishes garnished sufficiently to be in good taste without looking absurd The eye in fact should be as much gratified as the palate Hot soup is now often served at suppers but is not placed on the table The servants fill the plates from a tureen on the buffet and then hand them to the guests when these plates are removed the business of supper commences twenty one forty Where small rooms and large parties necessitate having a standing supper many things enumerated in the following bill of fare may be placed on the buffet Dishes for these suppers should be selected which may be eaten standing without any trouble The following list may perhaps assist our readers in the arrangement of a buffet for a standing supper twenty one forty one Beef ham and tongue sandwiches lobster and oyster patties sausage rolls meat rolls lobster salad dishes of fowls the latter all cut up dishes of sliced ham sliced tongue sliced beef and galantine of veal various jellies blancmanges and creams custards in glasses compotes of fruit tartlets of jam and several dishes of small fancy pastry dishes of fresh fruit bonbons sweetmeats two or three sponge cakes a few plates of biscuits and the buffet ornamented with vases of fresh or artificial flowers The above dishes are quite sufficient for a standing supper where more are desired a supper must then be laid and arranged in the usual

spaces filled up with the smaller dishes fruit and flowers taking care that the flavours and colours contrast nicely and that no two dishes of a sort come together This bill of fare may be made to answer three or four purposes placing a wedding cake or christening cake in the centre on a high stand if required for either of these occasions A few dishes of fowls lobster salads c c should be kept in reserve to replenish those that are most likely to be eaten first A joint of cold roast and boiled beef should be placed on the buffet as being something substantial for the gentlemen of the party to partake of Besides the articles enumerated in the bill of fare biscuits and wafers will be required cream and water ices tea coffee wines liqueurs soda water ginger beer and lemonade BREAKFASTS twenty one forty four It will not be necessary to give here a long bill of fare of cold joints c which may be placed on the side board and do duty at the breakfast table Suffice it to say that any cold meat the larder may furnish should be nicely garnished and be placed on the buffet Collared and potted meats or fish cold game or poultry veal and ham pies game and Rump steak pies are all suitable dishes for the breakfast table as also cold ham tongue c c twenty one forty five The following list of hot dishes may perhaps assist our readers in knowing what to provide for the comfortable meal called breakfast Broiled fish such as mackerel whiting herrings dried haddocks c mutton chops and rump steaks broiled sheep s kidneys kidneys a la maitre d hotel sausages plain rashers of bacon bacon and poached eggs ham and poached eggs omelets plain boiled eggs oeufs au plat poached eggs on toast muffins toast marmalade butter c c twenty one forty six In the summer and when they are obtainable always have a vase of freshly gathered flowers on the breakfast table and when convenient a nicely arranged dish of fruit when strawberries are in season these are particularly refreshing as also grapes or even currants LUNCHEONS AND SUPPERS twenty one forty seven The remains of cold joints nicely garnished a few sweets or a little hashed meat poultry or game are the usual articles placed on the table for luncheon with bread and cheese biscuits butter c If a substantial meal is desired rump steaks or mutton chops may he served as also veal cutlets kidneys or any dish of that kind In families where there is a nursery the mistress of the house often partakes of the meal with the children and makes it her luncheon In the summer a few dishes of fresh fruit should be added to the luncheon or instead of this a compote of fruit or fruit tart or pudding twenty one forty eight Of suppers we have little to say as we have already given two bills of fare for a large party which will answer very well for a smaller number by reducing the quantity of dishes and by omitting a few Hot suppers are now very little in request as people now generally dine at an hour which precludes the possibility of requiring supper at all events not one of a substantial kind Should however a bill of fare be required one of those under the head of DINNERS with slight alterations will be found to answer for a hot supper BILL OF FARE FOR A PICNIC FOR forty PERSONS twenty one forty nine A joint of cold roast beef a joint of cold boiled beef two ribs of lamb two shoulders of lamb four roast fowls two roast ducks one ham one tongue two veal and ham pies two pigeon pies six medium sized lobsters one piece of collared calf s head eighteen lettuces six baskets of salad six cucumbers twenty

a tin of mixed biscuits one two lb of tea Coffee is not suitable for a picnic being difficult to make Things not to be forgotten at a Picnic twenty one fifty one A stick of horseradish a bottle of mint sauce well corked a bottle of salad dressing a bottle of vinegar made mustard pepper salt good oil and pounded sugar If it can be managed take a little ice It is scarcely necessary to say that plates tumblers wine glasses knives forks and spoons must not be forgotten as also teacups and saucers three or four teapots some lump sugar and milk if this last named article cannot be obtained in the neighbourhood Take three corkscrews twenty one fifty two Beverages three dozen quart bottles of ale packed in hampers ginger beer soda water and lemonade of each two dozen bottles six bottles of sherry six bottles of claret champagne a discretion and any other light wine that may be preferred and two bottles of brandy Water can usually be obtained so it is useless to take it DOMESTIC SERVANTS CHAPTER XLI twenty one fifty three It is the custom of Society to abuse its servants a facon de parler such as leads their lords and masters to talk of the weather and when rurally inclined of the crops leads matronly ladies and ladies just entering on their probation in that honoured and honourable state to talk of servants and as we are told wax eloquent over the greatest plague in life while taking a quiet cup of tea Young men at their clubs also we are told like to abuse their fellows perhaps not without a certain pride and pleasure at the opportunity of intimating that they enjoy such appendages to their state It is another conviction of Society that the race of good servants has died out at least in England although they do order these things better in France that there is neither honesty conscientiousness nor the careful and industrious habits which distinguished the servants of our grandmothers and great grandmothers that domestics no longer know their place that the introduction of cheap silks and cottons and still more recently those ambiguous materials and tweeds have removed the landmarks between the mistress and her maid between the master and his man twenty one fifty four When the distinction really depends on things so insignificant this is very probably the case when the lady of fashion chooses her footman without any other consideration than his height shape and tournure of his calf it is not surprising that she should find a domestic who has no attachment for the family who considers the figure he cuts behind her carriage and the late hours he is compelled to keep a full compensation for the wages he exacts for the food he wastes and for the perquisites he can lay his hands on Nor should the fast young man who chooses his groom for his knowingness in the ways of the turf and in the tricks of low horse dealers be surprised if he is sometimes the victim of these learned ways But these are the exceptional cases which prove the existence of a better state of things The great masses of society among us are not thus deserted there are few families of respectability from the shopkeeper in the next street to the nobleman whose mansion dignifies the next square which do not contain among their dependents attached and useful servants and where these are absent altogether there are good reasons for it The sensible master and the kind mistress know that if servants depend on them for their means of living in their turn they are dependent on their servants for very many of the comforts of life and that with a proper amount of care in choosing servants and treating them like reasonable beings and making slight excuses for the shortcomings of human nature they will save in some exceptional case be tolerably well served and in most instances surround themselves with attached domestics twenty one fifty five This remark which is applicable to all domestics is especially so to men servants Families accustomed to such attendants have always about them humble dependents whose children have no other prospect than domestic service to look forward to to them it presents no degradation but the reverse to be so employed they are initiated step by step into the mysteries of the household with the prospect of rising in the service if it is a house admitting of promotion to the respectable position of butler or house steward In families of humbler pretensions where they must look for promotion elsewhere they know that can only be attained by acquiring the goodwill of their employers Can there be any stronger security for their good conduct any doubt that in the mass of domestic servants good conduct is the rule the reverse the exception twenty one fifty six The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth and position of the master from the owner of the ducal mansion with a retinue of attendants at the head of which is the chamberlain and house steward to the occupier of the humbler house where a single footman or even the odd man of all work is the only male retainer The majority of gentlemen s establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery or butler a footman and coachman or coachman and groom where the horses exceed two or three DUTIES OF THE BUTLER twenty one fifty seven The domestic duties of the butler are to bring in the eatables at breakfast and wait upon the family at that meal assisted by the footman and see to the cleanliness of everything at table On taking away he removes the tray with the china and plate for which he is responsible At luncheon he arranges the meal and waits unassisted the footman being now engaged in other duties At dinner he places the silver and plated articles on the table sees that everything is in its place and rectifies what is wrong He carries in the first dish and announces in the drawing room that dinner is on the table and respectfully stands by the door until the company are seated when he takes his place behind his master s chair on the left to remove the covers handing them to the other attendants to carry out After the first course of plates is supplied his place is at the sideboard to serve the wines but only when called on twenty one fifty eight The first course ended he rings the cook s bell and hands the dishes from the table to the other servants to carry away receiving from them the second course which he places on the table removing the covers as before and again taking his place at the sideboard twenty one fifty nine At dessert the slips being removed the butler receives the dessert from the other servants and arranges it on the table with plates and glasses and then takes his place behind his master s chair to hand the wines and ices while the footman stands behind his mistress for the same purpose the other attendants leaving the room Where the old fashioned practice of having the dessert on the polished table without any cloth is still adhered to the butler should rub off any marks made by the hot dishes before arranging the dessert twenty one sixty Before dinner he has satisfied himself that the lamps candles or gas burners are in perfect order if not lighted which will usually be the case Having served every one with their share of the dessert put the fires in order when these are used and seen the lights are all right at a signal from his master he and the footman leave the room twenty one sixty one He now proceeds to the drawing room arranges the fireplace and sees to the lights he then returns to his pantry prepared to answer the bell and attend to the company while the footman is clearing away and cleaning the plate and glasses twenty one sixty two At tea he again attends At bedtime he appears with the candles he locks up the plate secures doors and windows and sees that all the fires are safe twenty one sixty three In addition to these duties the butler where only one footman is kept will be required to perform some of the duties of the valet to pay bills and superintend the other servants But the real duties of the butler are in the wine cellar there he should be competent to advise his master as to the price and quality of the wine to be laid in fine bottle cork and seal it and place it in the binns Brewing racking and bottling malt liquors belong to his office as well as their distribution These and other drinkables are brought from the cellar every day by his own hands except where an under butler is kept and a careful entry of every bottle used entered in the cellar book so that the book should always show the contents of the cellar twenty one sixty four The office of butler is thus one of very great trust in a household Here as elsewhere honesty is the best policy the butler should make it his business to understand the proper treatment of the different wines under his charge which he can easily do from the wine merchant and faithfully attend to it his own reputation will soon compensate for the absence of bribes from unprincipled wine merchants if he serves a generous and hospitable master Nothing spreads more rapidly in society than the reputation of a good wine cellar and all that is required is wines well chosen and well cared for and this a little knowledge carefully applied will soon supply twenty one sixty five The butler we have said has charge of the contents of the cellars and it is his duty to keep them in a proper condition to fine down wine in wood bottle it off and store it away in places suited to the sorts Where wine comes into the cellar ready bottled it is usual to return the same number of empty bottles the butler has not in this case the same inducements to keep the bottles of the different sorts separated but where the wine is bottled in the house he will find his account not only in keeping them separate but in rinsing them well and even washing them with clean water as soon as they are empty twenty one sixty six There are various modes of fining wine isinglass gelatine and gum Arabic are all used for the purpose Whichever of these articles is used the process is always the same Supposing eggs the cheapest to be used Draw a gallon or so of the wine and mix one quart of it with the whites of four eggs by stirring it with a whisk afterwards when thoroughly mixed pour it back into the cask through the bunghole and stir up the whole cask in a rotatory direction with a clean split stick inserted through the bunghole Having stirred it sufficiently pour in the remainder of the wine drawn off until the cask is full then stir again skimming off the bubbles that rise to the surface When thoroughly mixed by stirring close the bunghole and leave it to stand for three or four days This quantity of clarified wine will fine thirteen dozen of port or sherry The other clearing ingredients are applied in the same manner the material being cut into small pieces and dissolved in the quart of wine and the cask stirred in the same manner twenty one sixty seven To Bottle Wine Having thoroughly washed and dried the bottles supposing they have been before used for the same kind of wine provide corks which will be improved by being slightly boiled or at least steeped in hot water a wooden hammer or mallet a bottling boot and a squeezer for the corks Bore a hole in the lower part of the cask with a gimlet receiving the liquid stream which follows in the bottle and filterer which is placed in a tub or basin This operation is best performed by two persons one to draw the wine the other to cork the bottles The drawer is to see that the bottles are up to the mark but not too full the bottle being placed in a clean tub to prevent waste The corking boot is buckled by a strap to the knee the bottle placed in it and the cork after being squeezed in the press driven in by a flat wooden mallet twenty one sixty eight As the wine draws near to the bottom of the cask a thick piece of muslin is placed in the strainer to prevent the viscous grounds from passing into the bottle twenty one sixty nine Having carefully counted the bottles they are stored away in their respective binns a layer of sand or sawdust being placed under the first tier and another over it a second tier is laid over this protected by a lath the head of the second being laid to the bottom of the first over this another bed of sawdust is laid not too thick another lath and so on till the binn is filled twenty one seventy Wine so laid in will be ready for use according to its quality and age Port wine old in the wood will be ready to drink in five or six months but if it is a fruity wine it will improve every year Sherry if of good quality will be fit to drink as soon as the sickness as its first condition after bottling is called ceases and will also improve but the cellar must be kept at a perfectly steady temperature neither too hot nor too cold but about fifty five deg or sixty deg and absolutely free from draughts of cold air DUTIES OF THE FOOTMAN twenty one seventy one Where a single footman or odd man is the only male servant then whatever his ostensible position he is required to make himself generally useful He has to clean the knives and shoes the furniture the plate answer the visitors who call the drawing room and parlour bells and do all the errands His life is no sinecure and a methodical arrangement of his time will be necessary in order to perform his many duties with any satisfaction to himself or his master twenty one seventy two The footman only finds himself in stockings shoes and washing Where silk stockings or other extra articles of linen are worn they are found by the family as well as his livery a working dress consisting of a pair of overalls a waistcoat a fustian jacket with a white or jean one for times when he is liable to be called to answer the door or wait at breakfast and on quitting his service he is expected to leave behind him any livery had within six months twenty one seventy three The footman is expected to rise early in order to get through all his dirty work before the family are stirring Boots and shoes and knives and forks should be cleaned lamps in use trimmed his master s clothes brushed the furniture rubbed over so that he may put aside his working dress tidy himself and appear in a clean jean jacket to lay the cloth and prepare breakfast for the family twenty one seventy four We need hardly dwell on the boot cleaning process three good brushes and good blacking must be provided one of the brushes hard to brush off the mud the other soft to lay on the blacking the third of a medium hardness for polishing and each should be kept for its particular use The blacking should be kept corked up except when in use and applied to the brush with a sponge tied to a stick which when put away rests in a notch cut in the cork When boots come in very muddy it is a good practice to wash off the mud and wipe them dry with a sponge then leave them to dry very gradually on their sides taking care they are not placed near the fire or scorched Much delicacy of treatment is required in cleaning ladies boots so as to make the leather look well polished and the upper part retain a fresh appearance with the lining free from hand marks which are very offensive to a lady of refined tastes twenty one seventy five Patent leather boots require to be wiped with a wet sponge and afterwards with a soft dry cloth and occasionally with a soft cloth and sweet oil blacking and polishing the edge of the soles in the usual way but so as not to cover the patent polish with blacking A little milk may also be used with very good effect for patent leather boots twenty one seventy six Top boots are still occasionally worn by gentlemen While cleaning the lower part in the usual manner protect the tops by inserting a cloth or brown paper under the edges and bringing it over them In cleaning the tops let the covering fall down over the boot wash the tops clean with soap and flannel and rub out any spots with pumice stone If the tops are to be whiter dissolve an ounce of oxalic acid and half an ounce of pumice stone in a pint of soft water if a brown colour is intended mix an ounce of muriatic acid half an ounce of alum half an ounce of gum Arabic and half an ounce of spirit of lavender in a pint and a half of skimmed milk turned These mixtures apply by means of a sponge and polish when dry with a rubber made of soft flannel twenty one seventy seven Knives are now generally cleaned by means of Kent s or Masters s machine which gives very little trouble and is very effective before however putting the knives into the machine it is highly necessary that they be first washed in a little warm not hot water and then thoroughly wiped if put into the machine with any grease on them it adheres to the brushes and consequently renders them unfit to use for the next knives that may be put in When this precaution is not taken the machine must come to pieces so causing an immense amount of trouble which may all be avoided by having the knives thoroughly free from grease before using the machine Brushes are also used for cleaning forks which facilitate the operation When knives are so cleaned see that they are carefully polished wiped and with a good edge the ferules and prongs free from dirt and place them in the basket with the handles all one way twenty one seventy eight Lamp trimming requires a thorough acquaintance with the mechanism after that constant attention to cleanliness and an occasional entire clearing out with hot water when this is done all the parts should be carefully dried before filling again with oil When lacquered wipe the lacquered parts with a soft brush and cloth and wash occasionally with weak soapsuds wiping carefully afterwards Brass lamps may be cleaned with oil and rottenstone every day when trimmed With bronze and other ornamental lamps more care will be required and soft flannel and oil only used to prevent the removal of the bronze or enamel Brass work or any metal work not lacquered is cleaned by a little oil and rottenstone made into a paste or with fine emery powder and oil mixed in the same manner A small portion of sal ammoniac beat into a fine powder and moistened with soft water rubbed over brass ornaments and heated over a charcoal fire and rubbed dry with bran or whitening will give to brass work the brilliancy of gold In trimming moderator lamps let the wick be cut evenly all round as if left higher in one place than it is in another it will cause it to smoke and burn badly The lamp should then be filled with oil from a feeder and afterwards well wiped with a cloth or rag kept for the purpose If it can be avoided never wash the chimneys of a lamp as it causes them to crack when they become hot Small sticks covered with wash leather pads are the best things to use for cleaning the glasses inside and a clean duster for polishing the outside The globe of a moderator lamp should be occasionally washed in warm soap and water then well rinsed in cold water and either wiped dry or left to drain Where candle lamps are used take out the springs occasionally and free them well from the grease that adheres to them twenty one seventy nine French polish so universally applied to furniture is easily kept in condition by dusting and rubbing with a soft cloth or a rubber of old silk but dining tables can only be kept in order by hard rubbing or rather by quick rubbing which warms the wood and removes all spots twenty one eighty Brushing clothes is a very simple but very necessary operation Fine cloths require to be brushed lightly and with rather a soft brush except where mud is to be removed when a hard one is necessary being previously beaten lightly to dislodge the dirt Lay the garment on a table and brush it in the direction of the nap Having brushed it properly turn the sleeves back to the collar so that the folds may come at the elbow joints next turn the lappels or sides back over the folded sleeves then lay the skirts over level with the collar so that the crease may fall about the centre and double one half over the other so as the fold comes in the centre of the back twenty one eighty one Having got through his dirty work the single footman has now to clean himself and prepare the breakfast He lays the cloth on the table over it the breakfast cloth and sets the breakfast things in order and then proceeds to wait upon his master if he has any of the duties of a valet to perform twenty one eighty two Where a valet is not kept a portion of his duties falls to the footman s share brushing the clothes among others When the hat is silk it requires brushing every day with a soft brush after rain it requires wiping the way of the nap before drying and when nearly dry brushing with the soft brush and with the hat stick in it If the footman is required to perform any part of a valet s duties he will have to see that the housemaid lights a fire in the dressing room in due time that the room is dusted and cleaned that the washhand ewer is filled with soft water and that the bath whether hot or cold is ready when required that towels are at hand that hair brushes and combs are properly cleansed and in their places that hot water is ready at the hour ordered the dressing gown and slippers in their place the clean linen aired and the clothes to be worn for the day in their proper places After the master has dressed it will be the footman s duty to restore everything to its place properly cleansed and dry and the whole restored to order twenty one eighty three At breakfast when there is no butler the footman carries up the tea urn and assisted by the housemaid he waits during breakfast Breakfast over he removes the tray and other things off the table folds up the breakfast cloth and sets the room in order by sweeping up all crumbs shaking the cloth and laying it on the table again making up the fire and sweeping up the hearth twenty one eighty four At luncheon time nearly the same routine is observed except where the footman is either out with the carriage or away on other business when in the absence of any butler the housemaid must assist twenty one eighty five For dinner the footman lays the cloth taking care that the table is not too near the fire if there is one and that passage room is left A tablecloth should be laid without a wrinkle and this requires two persons over this the slips are laid which are usually removed preparatory to placing dessert on the table He prepares knives forks and glasses with five or six plates for each person This done he places chairs enough for the party distributing them equally on each side of the table and opposite to each a napkin neatly folded within it a piece of bread or small roll and a knife on the right side of each plate a fork on the left and a carving knife and fork at the top and bottom of the table outside the others with the rests opposite to them and a gravy spoon beside the knife The fish slice should be at the top where the lady of the house with the assistance of the gentleman next to her divides the fish and the soup ladle at the bottom it is sometimes usual to add a dessert knife and fork at the same time on the right side also of each plate put a wine glass for as many kinds of wine as it is intended to hand round and a finger glass or glass cooler about four inches from the edge The latter are frequently put on the table with the dessert twenty one eighty six About half an hour before dinner he rings the dinner bell where that is the practice and occupies himself with carrying up everything he is likely to require At the expiration of the time having communicated with the cook he rings the real dinner bell and proceeds to take it up with such assistance as he can obtain Having ascertained that all is in order that his own dress is clean and presentable and his white cotton gloves are without a stain he announces in the drawing room that dinner is served and stands respectfully by the door until the company are seated he places himself on the left behind his master who is to distribute the soup where soup and fish are served together his place will be at his mistress s left hand but he must be on the alert to see that whoever is assisting him whether male or female are at their posts If any of the guests has brought his own servant with him his place is behind his master s chair rendering such assistance to others as he can while attending to his master s wants throughout the dinner so that every guest has what he requires This necessitates both activity and intelligence and should be done without bustle without asking any questions except where it is the custom of the house to hand round dishes or wine when it will be necessary to mention in a quiet and unobtrusive manner the dish or wine you present twenty one eighty seven Salt cellars should be placed on the table in number sufficient for the guests so that each may help themselves or at least their immediate neighbours DINNERS A LA RUSSE twenty one eighty eight In some houses the table is laid out with plate and glass and ornamented with flowers the dessert only being placed on the table the dinner itself being placed on the sideboard and handed round in succession in courses of soup fish entries meat game and sweets This is not only elegant but economical as fewer dishes are required the symmetry of the table being made up with the ornaments and dessert The various dishes are also handed round when hot but it involves additional and superior attendance as the wines are also handed round and unless the servants are very active and intelligent many blunders are likely to be made See p nine hundred fifty four GENERAL OBSERVATIONS twenty one eighty nine While attentive to all the footman should be obtrusive to none he should give nothing but on a waiter and always hand it with the left hand and on the left side of the person he serves and hold it so that the guest may take it with ease In lifting dishes from the table he should use both hands and remove them with care so that nothing is spilt on the table cloth or on the dresses of the guests twenty one ninety Masters as well as servants sometimes make mistakes but it is not expected that a servant will correct any omissions even if he should have time to notice them although with the best intentions thus it would not be correct for instance if he observed that his master took wine with the ladies all round as some gentlemen still continue to do but stopped at some one to nudge him on the shoulder and say as was done by the servant of a Scottish gentleman What ails you at her in the green gown It will be better to leave the lady unnoticed than for the servant thus to turn his master into ridicule twenty one ninety one During dinner each person s knife fork plate and spoon should be changed as soon as he has done with it the vegetables and sauces belonging to the different dishes presented without remark to the guests and the footman should tread lightly in moving round and if possible should bear in mind if there is a wit or humorist of the party whose good things keep the table in a roar that they are not expected to reach his ears twenty one ninety two In opening wine let it be done quietly and without shaking the bottle if crusted let it be inclined to the crusted side and decanted while in that position In opening champagne it is not necessary to discharge it with a pop properly cooled the cork is easily extracted without an explosion when the cork is out the mouth of the bottle should be wiped with the napkin over the footman s arm twenty one ninety three At the end of the first course notice is conveyed to the cook who is waiting to send up the second which is introduced in the same way as before the attendants who remove the fragments carrying the dishes from the kitchen and handing them to the footman or butler whose duty it is to arrange them on the table After dinner the dessert glasses and wines are placed on the table by the footman who places himself behind his master s chair to supply wine and hand round the ices and other refreshments all other servants leaving the room twenty one ninety four As soon as the drawing room bell rings for tea the footman enters with the tray which has been previously prepared hands the tray round to the company with cream and sugar the tea and coffee being generally poured out while another attendant hands cakes toast or biscuits If it is an ordinary family party where this social meal is prepared by the mistress he carries the urn or kettle as the case may be hands round the toast or such other eatable as may be required removing the whole in the same manner when tea is over twenty one ninety five After each meal the footman s place is in his pantry here perfect order should prevail a place for everything and everything in its place A sink with hot and cold water laid on is very desirable cold absolutely necessary Wooden bowls or tubs of sufficient capacity are required one for hot and another for cold water Have the bowl three parts full of clean hot water in this wash all plate and plated articles which are greasy wiping them before cleaning with the brush twenty one ninety six The footman in small families where only one man is kept has many of the duties of the upper servants to perform as well as his own and more constant occupation he will also have the arrangement of his time more immediately under his own control and he will do well to reduce it to a methodical division All his rough work should be done before breakfast is ready when he must appear clean and in a presentable state After breakfast when everything belonging to his pantry is cleaned and put in its place the furniture in the dining and drawing rooms requires rubbing Towards noon the parlour luncheon is to be prepared and he must be at his mistress s disposal to go out with the carriage or follow her if she walks out twenty one ninety seven Glass is a beautiful and most fragile article hence it requires great care in washing A perfectly clean wooden bowl is best for this operation one for moderately hot and another for cold water Wash the glasses well in the first and rinse them in the second and turn them down on a linen cloth folded two or three times to drain for a few minutes When sufficiently drained wipe them with a cloth and polish with a finer one doing so tenderly and carefully Accidents will happen but nothing discredits a servant in the drawing room more than continual reports of breakages which of course must reach that region twenty one ninety eight Decanters and water jugs require still more tender treatment in cleaning inasmuch as they are more costly to replace Fill them about two thirds with hot but not boiling water and put in a few pieces of well soaped brown paper leave them thus for two or three hours then shake the water up and down in the decanters empty this out rinse them well with clean cold water and put them in a rack to drain When dry polish them outside and inside as far as possible with a fine cloth To remove the crust of port or other wines add a little muriatic acid to the water and let it remain for some time twenty one ninety nine When required to go out with the carriage it is the footman s duty to see that it has come to the door perfectly clean and that the glasses and sashes and linings are free from dust In receiving messages at the carriage door he should turn his ear to the speaker so as to comprehend what is said in order that he may give his directions to the coachman clearly When the house he is to call at is reached he should knock and return to the carriage for orders In closing the door upon the family he should see that the handle is securely turned and that no part of the ladies dress is shut in twenty two hundred It is the footman s duty to carry messages or letters for his master or mistress to their friends to the post or to the tradespeople and nothing is more important than dispatch and exactness in doing so although writing even the simplest message is now the ordinary and very proper practice Dean Swift among his other quaint directions all of which are to be read by contraries recommends a perusal of all such epistles in order that you may be the more able to fulfil your duty to your master An old lady of Forfarshire had one of those odd old Caleb Balderston sort of servants who construed the Dean of saint Patrick more literally On one occasion when dispatch was of some importance knowing his inquiring nature she called her Scotch Paul Pry to her opened the note and read it to him herself saying Now Andrew you ken a aboot it and needna stop to open and read it but just take it at once Probably most of the notes you are expected to carry might with equal harmlessness be communicated to you but it will be better not to take so lively an interest in your mistress s affairs twenty two oh one Politeness and civility to visitors is one of the things masters and mistresses have a right to expect and should exact rigorously When visitors present themselves the servant charged with the duty of opening the door will open it promptly and answer without hesitation if the family are not at home or engaged which generally means the same thing and might be oftener used with advantage to morals On the contrary if he has no such orders he will answer affirmatively open the door wide to admit them and precede them to open the door of the drawing room If the family are not there he will place chairs for them open the blinds if the room is too dark and intimate civilly that he goes to inform his mistress If the lady is in her drawing room he announces the name of the visitors having previously acquainted himself with it In this part of his duty it is necessary to be very careful to repeat the names correctly mispronouncing names is very apt to give offence and leads sometimes to other disagreeables The writer was once initiated into some of the secrets on the other side of a legal affair in which he took an interest before he could correct a mistake made by the servant in announcing him When the visitor is departing the servant should be at hand ready when rung for to open the door he should open it with a respectful manner and close it gently when the visitors are fairly beyond the threshold When several visitors arrive together he should take care not to mix up the different names together where they belong to the same family as mister missus and Miss if they are strangers he should announce each as distinctly as possible twenty two oh two Receptions and Evening Parties The drawing rooms being prepared the card tables laid out with cards and counters and such other arrangements as are necessary made for the reception of the company the rooms should be lighted up as the hour appointed approaches Attendants in the drawing room even more than in the dining room should move about actively but noiselessly no creaking of shoes which is an abomination watching the lights from time to time so as to keep up their brilliancy But even if the attendant likes a game of cribbage or whist himself he must not interfere in his master or mistress s game nor even seem to take an interest in it We once knew a lady who had a footman and both were fond of a game of cribbage John in the kitchen the lady in her drawing room The lady was a giver of evening parties where she frequently enjoyed her favourite amusement While handing about the tea and toast John could not always suppress his disgust at her mistakes There is more in that hand ma am he has been known to say or Ma am you forgot to count his nob in fact he identified himself with his mistress s game and would have lost twenty places rather than witness a miscount It is not necessary to adopt his example on this point although John had many qualities a good servant might copy with advantage THE COACHHOUSE AND STABLES twenty two oh three THE HORSE is the noblest of quadrupeds whether we view him in his strength his sagacity or his beauty He is also the most useful to man of all the animal creation but his delicacy is equal to his power and usefulness No other animal probably is so dependent on man in the state of domestication to which he has been reduced or deteriorates so rapidly under exposure bad feeding or bad grooming It is therefore a point of humanity not to speak of its obvious impolicy for the owner of horses to overlook any neglect in their feeding or grooming His interest dictates that so valuable an animal should be well housed well fed and well groomed and he will do well to acquire so much of stable lore as will enable him to judge of these points himself In a general way where a horse s coat is habitually rough and untidy there is a sad want of elbow grease in the stable When a horse of tolerable breeding is dull and spiritless he is getting ill or badly fed and where he is observed to perspire much in the stables is overfed and probably eats his litter in addition to his regular supply of food twenty two oh four Stables The architectural form of the stables will be subject to other influences than ours we confine ourselves therefore to their internal arrangements They should be roomy in proportion to the number of stalls warm with good ventilation and perfectly free from cold draughts the stalls roomy without excess with good and well trapped drainage so as to exclude bad smells a sound ceiling to prevent the entrance of dust from the hayloft which is usually above them and there should be plenty of light coming however either from above or behind so as not to glare in the horse s eye twenty two oh five Heat The first of these objects is attained if the stables are kept within a degree or two of fifty deg in winter and sixty deg in summer although some grooms insist on a much higher temperature in the interests of their own labour twenty two oh six Ventilation is usually attained by the insertion of one or more tubes or boxes of wood or iron through the ceiling and the roof with a sloping covering over the opening to keep out rain and valves or ventilators below to regulate the atmosphere with openings in the walls for the admission of fresh air this is still a difficulty however for the effluvium of the stable is difficult to dispel and draughts must be avoided This is sometimes accomplished by means of hollow walls with gratings at the bottom outside for the exit of bad air which is carried down through the hollow walls and discharged at the bottom while for the admission of fresh air the reverse takes place the fresh by this means gets diffused and heated before it is discharged into the stable twenty two oh seven The Stalls should be divided by partitions of wood work eight or nine feet high at the head and six at the heels and nine feet deep so as to separate each horse from its neighbour A hay rack placed within easy reach of the horse of wood or iron occupies either a corner or the whole breadth of the stall which should be about six feet for on ordinary sized horse A manger formerly of wood but of late years more generally of iron lined with enamel occupies a corner of the stall The pavement of the stall should be nearly level with a slight incline towards the gutter to keep the bed dry paved with hard Dutch brick laid on edge or asphalte or smithy clinkers or rubble stones laid in strong cement In the centre about five feet from the wall a grating should be firmly fixed in the pavement and in communication with a well trapped drain to carry off the water the gutter outside the stall should also communicate with the drains by trapped openings The passage between the stall and the hall should be from five to six feet broad at least on the wall opposite to each stall pegs should be placed for receiving the harness and other things in daily use twenty two oh eight A Harness room is indispensable to every stable It should be dry and airy and furnished with a fireplace and boiler both for the protection of the harness and to prepare mashes for the horses when required The partition wall should be boarded where the harness goes with pegs to hang the various pieces of harness on with saddle trees to rest the saddles on a cupboard for the brushes sponges and leathers and a lock up corn bin twenty two oh nine The furniture of a stable with coachhouse consists of coach mops jacks for raising the wheels horse brushes spoke brushes water brushes crest and bit brushes dandy brushes currycombs birch and heath brooms trimming combs scissors and pickers oil cans and brushes harness brushes of three sorts leathers sponges for horse and carriage stable forks dung baskets or wheelbarrow corn sieves and measures horse cloths and stable pails horn or glass lanterns Over the stables there should be accommodation for the coachman or groom to sleep Accidents sometimes occur and he should be at hand to interfere DUTIES OF THE COACHMAN GROOM AND STABLE BOY twenty two ten The Establishment we have in view will consist of coachman groom and stable boy who are capable of keeping in perfect order four horses and perhaps the pony Of this establishment the coachman is chief Besides skill in driving he should possess a good general knowledge of horses he has usually to purchase provender to see that the horses are regularly fed and properly groomed watch over their condition apply simple remedies to trifling ailments in the animals under his charge and report where he observes symptoms of more serious ones which he does not understand He has either to clean the carriage himself or see that the stable boy does it properly twenty two eleven The Groom s first duties are to keep his horses in condition but he is sometimes expected to perform the duties of a valet to ride out with his master on occasions to wait at table and otherwise assist in the house in these cases he should have the means of dressing himself and keeping his clothes entirely away from the stables In the morning about six o clock or rather before the stables should be opened and cleaned out and the horses fed first by cleaning the rack and throwing in fresh hay putting it lightly in the rack that the horses may get it out easily a short time afterwards their usual morning feed of oats should be put into the manger While this is going on the stable boy has been removing the stable dung and sweeping and washing out the stables both of which should be done every day and every corner carefully swept in order to keep the stable sweet and clean The real duties of the groom follow where the horses are not taken out for early exercise the work of grooming immediately commences Having tied up the head to use the excellent description of the process given by old Barrett take a currycomb and curry him all over the body to raise the dust beginning first at the neck holding the left cheek of the headstall in the left hand and curry him from the setting on of his head all over the body to the buttocks down to the point of the hock then change your hands and curry him before on his breast and laying your right arm over his back join your right side to his left and curry him all under the belly near the fore bowels and so all over from the knees and back upwards after that go to the far side and do that likewise Then take a dead horse s tail or failing that a cotton dusting cloth and strike that away which the currycomb hath raised Then take a round brush made of bristles with a leathern handle and dress him all over both head body and legs to the very fetlocks always cleansing the brush from the dust by rubbing it with the currycomb In the curry combing process as well as brushing it must be applied with mildness especially with fine skinned horses otherwise the tickling irritates them much The brushing is succeeded by a hair cloth with which rub him all over again very hard both to take away loose hairs and lay his coat then wash your hands in fair water and rub him all over while they are wet as well over the head as the body Lastly take a clean cloth and rub him all over again till he be dry then take another hair cloth and rub all his legs exceeding well from the knees and hocks downwards to his hoofs picking and dressing them very carefully about the fetlocks so as to remove all gravel and dust which will sometimes lie in the bending of the joints In addition to the practice of this old writer modern grooms add wisping which usually follows brushing The best wisp is made from a hayband untwisted and again doubled up after being moistened with water this is applied to every part of the body as the brushing had been by changing the hands taking care in all these operations to carry the hand in the direction of the coat Stains on the hair are removed by sponging or when the coat is very dirty by the water brush the whole being finished off by a linen or flannel cloth The horsecloth should now be put on by taking the cloth in both hands with the outside next you and with your right hand to the off side throw it over his back placing it no farther back than will leave it straight and level which will be about a foot from the tail Put the roller round and the pad piece under it about six or eight inches from the fore legs The horse s head is now loosened he is turned about in his stall to have his head and ears rubbed and brushed over every part including throat with the dusting cloth finishing by pulling his ears which all horses seem to enjoy very much This done the mane and foretop should be combed out passing a wet sponge over them sponging the mane on both sides by throwing it back to the midriff to make it lie smooth The horse is now returned to his headstall his tail combed out cleaning it of stains with a wet brush or sponge trimming both tail and mane and forelock when necessary smoothing them down with a brush on which a little oil has been dropped twenty two twelve Watering usually follows dressing but some horses refuse their food until they have drunk the groom should not therefore lay down exclusive rules on this subject but study the temper and habits of his horse twenty two thirteen Exercise All horses not in work require at least two hours exercise daily and in exercising them a good groom will put them through the paces to which they have been trained In the case of saddle horses he will walk trot canter and gallop them in order to keep them up to their work With draught horses they ought to be kept up to a smart walk and trot twenty two fourteen Feeding must depend on their work but they require feeding three times a day with more or less corn each time according to their work In the fast coaching days it was a saying among proprietors that his belly was the measure of his food but the horse s appetite is not to be taken as a criterion of the quantity of food under any circumstances Horses have been known to consume forty lbs of hay in twenty four hours whereas sixteen lbs to eighteen lbs is the utmost which should have been given mister Croall an extensive coach proprietor in Scotland limited his horses to four one two lbs cut straw eight lbs bruised oats and two one two lbs bruised beans in the morning and noon giving them at night twenty five lbs of the following viz five hundred sixty lbs steamed potatoes thirty six lbs barley dust forty lbs cut straw and six lbs salt mixed up together under this the horses did their work well The ordinary measure given a horse is a peck of oats about forty lbs to the bushel twice a day a third feed and a rack full of hay which may be about fifteen lbs or eighteen lbs when he is in full work twenty two fifteen You cannot take up a paper without having the question put Do you bruise your oats Well that depends on circumstances a fresh young horse can bruise its own oats when it can get them but aged horses after a time lose the power of masticating and bruising them and bolt them whole thus much impeding the work of digestion For an old horse then bruise the oats for a young one it does no harm and little good Oats should be bright and dry and not too new Where they are new sprinkle them with salt and water otherwise they overload the horse s stomach Chopped straw mixed with oats in the proportion of a third of straw or hay is a good food for horses in full work and carrots of which horses are remarkably fond have a perceptible effect in a short time on the gloss of the coat twenty two sixteen The water given to a horse merits some attention it should not be too cold hard water is not to be recommended stagnant or muddy water is positively injurious river water is the best for all purposes and anything is preferable to spring water which should be exposed to the sun in summer for an hour or two and stirred up before using it a handful of oatmeal thrown into the pail will much improve its quality twenty two seventeen Shoeing A horse should not be sent on a journey or any other hard work immediately after new shoeing the stiffness incidental to new shoes is not unlikely to bring him down A day s rest with reasonable exercise will not be thrown away after this operation On reaching home very hot the groom should walk him about for a few minutes this done he should take off the moisture with the scraper and afterwards wisp him over with a handful of straw and a flannel cloth if the cloth is dipped in some spirit all the better He should wash pick and wipe dry the legs and feet take off the bridle and crupper and fasten it to the rack then the girths and put a wisp of straw under the saddle When sufficiently cool the horse should have some hay given him and then a feed of oats if he refuse the latter offer him a little wet bran or a handful of oatmeal in tepid water When he has been fed he should be thoroughly cleaned and his body clothes put on and if very much harassed with fatigue a little good ale or wine will be well bestowed on a valuable horse adding plenty of fresh litter under the belly twenty two eighteen Bridles Every time a horse is unbridled the bit should be carefully washed and dried and the leather wiped to keep them sweet as well as the girths and saddle the latter being carefully dried and beaten with a switch before it is again put on In washing a horse s feet after a day s work the master should insist upon the legs and feet being washed thoroughly with a sponge until the water flows over them and then rubbed with a brush till quite dry twenty two nineteen Harness if not carefully preserved very soon gets a shabby tarnished appearance Where the coachman has a proper harness room and sufficient assistance this is inexcusable and easily prevented The harness room should have a wooden lining all round and be perfectly dry and well ventilated Around the walls hooks and pegs should be placed for the several pieces of harness at such a height as to prevent their touching the ground and every part of the harness should have its peg or hook one for the halters another for the reins and others for snaffles and other bits and metal work and either a wooden horse or saddle trees for the saddles and pads All these parts should be dry clean and shining This is only to be done by careful cleaning and polishing and the use of several requisite pastes The metallic parts when white should be cleaned by a soft brush and plate powder the copper and brass parts burnished with rottenstone powder and oil steel with emery powder both made into a paste with a little oil twenty two twenty An excellent paste for polishing harness and the leather work of carriages is made by melting eight lbs of yellow wax stirring it till completely dissolved Into this pour one lb of litharge of the shops which has been pounded up with water and dried and sifted through a sieve leaving the two when mixed to simmer on the fire stirring them continually till all is melted When it is a little cool mix this with one one four lb of good ivory black place this again on the fire and stir till it boils anew and suffer it to cool When cooled a little add distilled turpentine till it has the consistence of a thickish paste scenting it with any essence at hand thinning it when necessary from time to time by adding distilled turpentine twenty two twenty one When the leather is old and greasy it should be cleaned before applying this polish with a brush wetted in a weak solution of potass and water washing afterwards with soft river water and drying thoroughly If the leather is not black one or two coats of black ink may be given before applying the polish When quite dry the varnish should be laid on with a soft shoe brush using also a soft brush to polish the leather twenty two twenty two When the leather is very old it may be softened with fish oil and after putting on the ink a sponge charged with distilled turpentine passed over to scour the surface of the leather which should be polished as above twenty two twenty three For fawn or yellow coloured leather take a quart of skimmed milk pour into it one oz of sulphuric acid and when cold add to it four oz of hydrochloric acid shaking the bottle gently until it ceases to emit white vapours separate the coagulated from the liquid part by straining through a sieve and store it away till required In applying it clean the leather by a weak solution of oxalic acid washing it off immediately and apply the composition when dry with a sponge twenty two twenty four Wheel grease is usually purchased at the shops but a good paste is made as follows Melt eighty parts of grease and stir into it mixing it thoroughly and smoothly twenty parts of fine black lead in powder and store away in a tin box for use This grease is used in the mint at Paris and is highly approved twenty two twenty five Carriages in an endless variety of shapes and names are continually making their appearance but the hackney cab or clarence seems most in request for light carriages the family carriage of the day being a modified form of the clarence adapted for family use The carriage is a valuable piece of furniture requiring all the care of the most delicate upholstery with the additional disadvantage of continual exposure to the weather and to the muddy streets twenty two sixteen It requires therefore to be carefully cleaned before putting away and a coach house perfectly dry and well ventilated for the wood work swells with moisture it shrinks also with heat unless the timber has undergone a long course of seasoning it should also have a dry floor a boarded one being recommended It must be removed from the ammoniacal influence of the stables from open drains and cesspools and other gaseous influences likely to affect the paint and varnish When the carriage returns home it should be carefully washed and dried and that if possible before the mud has time to dry on it This is done by first well slushing it with clean water so as to wash away all particles of sand having first closed the sashes to avoid wetting the linings The body is then gone carefully over with a soft mop using plenty of clean water and penetrating into every corner of the carved work so that not an atom of dirt remains the body of the carriage is then raised by placing the jack under the axletree and raising it so that the wheel turns freely this is now thoroughly washed with the mop until the dirt is removed using a water brush for corners where the mop does not penetrate Every particle of mud and sand removed by the mop and afterwards with a wet sponge the carriage is wiped dry and as soon after as possible the varnish is carefully polished with soft leather using a little sweet oil for the leather parts and even for the panels so as to check any tendency of the varnish to crack Stains are removed by rubbing them with the leather and sweet oil if that fails a little Tripoli powder mixed with the oil will be more successful twenty two twenty seven In preparing the carriage for use the whole body should be rubbed over with a clean leather and carefully polished the iron work and joints oiled the plated and brass work occasionally cleaned the one with plate powder or with well washed whiting mixed with sweet oil and leather kept for the purpose the other with rottenstone mixed with a little oil and applied without too much rubbing until the paste is removed but if rubbed every day with the leather little more will be required to keep it untarnished The linings require careful brushing every day the cushions being taken out and beaten and the glass sashes should always be bright and clean The wheel tires and axletree are carefully seen to and greased when required the bolts and nuts tightened and all the parts likely to get out of order overhauled twenty two twenty eight These duties however are only incidental to the coachman s office which is to drive and much of the enjoyment of those in the carriage depends on his proficiency in his art much also of the wear of the carriage and horses He should have sufficient knowledge of the construction of the carriage to know when it is out of order to know also the pace at which he can go over the road he has under him without risking the springs and without shaking those he is driving too much twenty two twenty nine Having with or without the help of the groom or stable boy put his horses to the carriage and satisfied himself by walking round them that everything is properly arranged the coachman proceeds to the off side of the carriage takes the reins from the back of the horses where they were thrown buckles them together and placing his foot on the step ascends to his box having his horses now entirely under control In ordinary circumstances he is not expected to descend for where no footman accompanies the carriage the doors are usually so arranged that even a lady may let herself out if she wishes it from the inside The coachman s duties are to avoid everything approaching an accident and all his attention is required to guide his horses twenty two thirty The pace at which he drives will depend upon his orders in all probability a moderate pace of seven or eight miles an hour less speed is injurious to the horses getting them into lazy and sluggish habits for it is wonderful how soon these are acquired by some horses The writer was once employed to purchase a horse for a country friend and he picked a very handsome gelding out of Collins s stables which seemed to answer to his friend s wants It was duly committed to the coachman who was to drive it after some very successful trials in harness and out of it and seemed likely to give great satisfaction After a time the friend got tired of his carriage and gave it up as the easiest mode of getting rid of the horse it was sent up to the writer s stables a present Only twelve months had elapsed the horse was as handsome as ever with plenty of flesh and a sleek glossy coat and he was thankfully enough received but on trial it was found that a stupid coachman who was imbued with one of their old maxims that it s the pace that kills had driven the horse capable of doing his nine miles an hour with ease at a jog trot of four miles or four and a half and now no persuasion of the whip could get more out of him After many unsuccessful efforts to bring him back to his pace in one of which a break down occurred under the hands of a professional trainer he was sent to the hammer and sold for a sum that did not pay for the attempt to break him in This maxim therefore that it s the pace that kills is altogether fallacious in the moderate sense in which we are viewing it In the old coaching days indeed when the Shrewsbury Wonder drove into the inn yard while the clock was striking week after week and mouth after month with unerring regularity twenty seven hours to a hundred and sixty two miles when the Quicksilver mail was timed to eleven miles an hour between London and Plymouth with a fine of Lfive to the driver if behind time when the Brighton Age tool d and horsed by the late mister Stevenson used to dash round the square as the fifth hour was striking having stopped at the half way house while his servant handed a sandwich and a glass of sherry to his passengers then the pace was indeed killing But the truth is horses that are driven at a jog trot pace lose that elan with which a good driver can inspire them and they are left to do their work by mere weight and muscle therefore unless he has contrary orders a good driver will choose a smart pace but not enough to make his horses perspire on level roads this should never be seen twenty two thirty one In choosing his horses every master will see that they are properly paired that their paces are about equal When their habits differ it is the coachman s duty to discover how he can with least annoyance to the horses get that pace out of them Some horses have been accustomed to be driven on the check and the curb irritates them others with harder mouths cannot be controlled with the slight leverage this affords he must therefore accommodate the horses as he best can The reins should always be held so that the horses are in hand but he is a very bad driver who always drives with a tight rein the pain to the horse is intolerable and causes him to rear and plunge and finally break sway if he can He is also a bad driver when the reins are always slack the horse then feels abandoned to himself he is neither directed nor supported and if no accident occurs it is great good luck twenty two thirty two The true coachman s hands are so delicate and gentle that the mere weight of the reins is felt on the bit and the directions are indicated by a turn of the wrist rather than by a pull the horses are guided and encouraged and only pulled up when they exceed their intended pace or in the event of a stumble for there is a strong though gentle hand on the reins twenty two thirty three The Whip in the hands of a good driver and with well bred cattle is there more as a precaution than a tool for frequent use if he uses it it is to encourage by stroking the flanks except indeed he has to punish some waywardness of temper and then he does it effectually taking care however that it is done on the flank where there is no very tender part never on the crupper In driving the coachman should never give way to temper How often do we see horses stumble from being conducted or at least allowed to go over bad ground by some careless driver who immediately wreaks that vengeance on the poor horse which might with much more justice be applied to his own brutal shoulders The whip is of course useful and even necessary but should be rarely used except to encourage and excite the horses DUTIES OF THE VALET twenty two thirty four Attendants on the Person No man is a hero to his valet saith the proverb and the corollary may run No lady is a heroine to her maid The infirmities of humanity are perhaps too numerous and too equally distributed to stand the severe microscopic tests which attendants on the person have opportunities of applying The valet and waiting maid are placed near the persons of the master and mistress receiving orders only from them dressing them accompanying them in all their journeys the confidants and agents of their most unguarded moments of their most secret habits and of course subject to their commands even to their caprices they themselves being subject to erring judgment aggravated by an imperfect education All that can be expected from such servants is polite manners modest demeanour and a respectful reserve which are indispensable To these good sense good temper some self denial and consideration for the feelings of others whether above or below them in the social scale will be useful qualifications Their duty leads them to wait on those who are from sheer wealth station and education more polished and consequently more susceptible of annoyance and any vulgar familiarity of manner is opposed to all their notions of self respect Quiet unobtrusive manners therefore and a delicate reserve in speaking of their employers either in praise or blame is as essential in their absence as good manners and respectful conduct in their presence twenty two thirty five Some of the duties of the valet we have just hinted at in treating of the duties of the footman in a small family His day commences by seeing that his master s dressing room is in order that the housemaid has swept and dusted it properly that the fire is lighted and burns cheerfully and some time before his master is expected he will do well to throw up the sash to admit fresh air closing it however in time to recover the temperature which he knows his master prefers It is now his duty to place the body linen on the horse before the fire to be aired properly to lay the trousers intended to be worn carefully brushed and cleaned on the back of his master s chair while the coat and waistcoat carefully brushed and folded and the collar cleaned are laid in their place ready to put on when required All the articles of the toilet should be in their places the razors properly set and stropped and hot water ready for use twenty two thirty six Gentlemen generally prefer performing the operation of shaving themselves but a valet should be prepared to do it if required and he should besides be a good hairdresser Shaving over he has to brush the hair beard and moustache where that appendage is encouraged arranging the whole simply and gracefully according to the age and style of countenance Every fortnight or three weeks at the utmost the hair should be cut and the points of the whiskers trimmed as often as required A good valet will now present the various articles of the toilet as they are wanted afterwards the body linen neck tie which he will put on if required and afterwards waistcoat coat and boots in suitable order and carefully brushed and polished twenty two thirty seven Having thus seen his master dressed if he is about to go out the valet will hand him his cane gloves and hat the latter well brushed on the outside with a soft brush and wiped inside with a clean handkerchief respectfully attend him to the door and open it for him and receive his last orders for the day twenty two thirty eight He now proceeds to put everything in order in the dressing room cleans the combs and brushes and brushes and folds up any clothes that may be left about the room and puts them away in the drawers twenty two thirty nine Gentlemen are sometimes indifferent as to their clothes and appearance it is the valet s duty in this case where his master permits it to select from the wardrobe such things as are suitable for the occasion so that he may appear with scrupulous neatness and cleanliness that his linen and neck tie where that is white or coloured are unsoiled and where he is not accustomed to change them every day that the cravat is turned and even ironed to remove the crease of the previous fold The coat collar which where the hair is oily and worn long is apt to get greasy should also be examined a careful valet will correct this by removing the spots day by day as they appear first by moistening the grease spots with a little rectified spirits of wine or spirits of hartshorn which has a renovating effect and the smell of which soon disappears The grease is dissolved and removed by gentle scraping The grease removed add a little more of the spirit and rub with a piece of clean cloth finish by adding a few drops more rub it with the palm of the hand in the direction of the grain of the cloth and it will be clean and glossy as the rest of the garment twenty two forty Polish for the boots is an important matter to the valet and not always to be obtained good by purchase never so good perhaps as he can make for himself after the following recipes Take of ivory black and treacle each four oz sulphuric acid one oz best olive oil two spoonfuls best white wine vinegar three half pints mix the ivory black and treacle well in an earthen jar then add the sulphuric acid continuing to stir the mixture next pour in the oil and lastly add the vinegar stirring it in by degrees until thoroughly incorporated two hundred forty one Another polish is made by mixing one oz each of pounded galls and logwood chips and three lbs of red French vine ordinaire Boil together till the liquid is reduced to half the quantity and pour it off through a strainer Now take one two lb each of pounded gum arabic and lump sugar one oz of green copperas and three lbs of brandy Dissolve the gum arabic in the preceding decoction and add the sugar and copperas when all is dissolved and mixed together stir in the brandy mixing it smoothly This mixture will yield five or six lbs of a very superior polishing paste for boots and shoes twenty two forty two It is perhaps unnecessary to add that having discharged all the commissions intrusted to him by his master such as conveying notes or messages to friends or the tradesmen all of which he should punctually and promptly attend to it is his duty to be in waiting when his master returns home to dress for dinner or for any other occasion and to have all things prepared for this second dressing Previous to this he brings under his notice the cards of visitors who may have called delivers the messages be may have received for him and otherwise acquits himself of the morning s commissions and receives his orders for the remainder of the day The routine of his evening duty is to have the dressing room and study where there is a separate one arranged comfortably for his master the fires lighted candles prepared dressing gown and slippers in their place and aired and everything in order that is required for his master s comforts FEMALE DOMESTICS DUTIES OF THE LADY S MAID twenty two forty three The duties of a lady s maid are more numerous and perhaps more onerous than those of the valet for while the latter is aided by the tailor the hatter the linen draper and the perfumer the lady s maid has to originate many parts of the mistress s dress herself she should indeed be a tolerably expert milliner and dressmaker a good hairdresser and possess some chemical knowledge of the cosmetics with which the toilet table is supplied in order to use them with safety and effect Her first duty in the morning after having performed her own toilet is to examine the clothes put off by her mistress the evening before either to put them away or to see that they are all in order to put on again During the winter and in wet weather the dresses should be carefully examined and the mud removed Dresses of tweed and other woollen materials may be laid out on a table and brushed all over but in general even in woollen fabrics the lightness of the tissues renders brushing unsuitable to dresses and it is better to remove the dust from the folds by beating them lightly with a handkerchief or thin cloth Silk dresses should never be brushed but rubbed with a piece of merino or other soft material of a similar colour kept for the purpose Summer dresses of barege muslin mohair and other light materials simply require shaking but if the muslin be tumbled it must be ironed afterwards If the dresses require slight repair it should be done at once a stitch in time saves nine twenty two forty four The bonnet should be dusted with a light feather plume in order to remove every particle of dust but this has probably been done as it ought to have been the night before Velvet bonnets and other velvet articles of dress should be cleaned with a soft brush If the flowers with which the bonnet is decorated have been crushed or displaced or the leaves tumbled they should be raised and readjusted by means of flower pliers If feathers have suffered from damp they should be held near the fire for a few minutes and restored to their natural state by the hand or a soft brush twenty two forty five The Chausserie or foot gear of a lady is one of the few things left to mark her station and requires special care Satin boots or shoes should be dusted with a soft brush or wiped with a cloth Kid or varnished leather should have the mud wiped off with a sponge charged with milk which preserves its softness and polish The following is also an excellent polish for applying to ladies boots instead of blacking them Mix equal proportions of sweet oil vinegar and treacle with one oz of lamp black When all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated rub the mixture on the boots with the palm of the hand and put them in a cool place to dry Ladies blacking which may be purchased in sixd and ones bottles is also very much used for patent leather and kid boots particularly when they are a little worn This blacking is merely applied with a piece of sponge and the boots should not be put on until the blacking is dry und hardened twenty two forty six These various preliminary offices performed the lady s maid should prepare for dressing her mistress arranging her dressing room toilet table and linen according to her mistress s wishes and habits The details of dressing we need not touch upon every lady has her own mode of doing so but the maid should move about quietly perform any offices about her mistress s person as lacing stays gently and adjust her linen smoothly twenty two forty seven Having prepared the dressing room by lighting the fire sweeping the hearth and made everything ready for dressing her mistress placed her linen before the fire to air and laid out the various articles of dress she is to wear which will probably have been arranged the previous evening the lady s maid is prepared for the morning s duties twenty two forty eight Hairdressing is the most important part of the lady s maid s office If ringlets are worn remove the curl papers and after thoroughly brushing the back hair both above and below dress it according to the prevailing fashion If bandeaux are worn the hair is thoroughly brushed and frizzed outside and inside folding the hair back round the head brushing it perfectly smooth giving it a glossy appearance by the use of pomades or oil applied by the palm of the hand smoothing it down with a small brush dipped in bandoline Double bandeaux are formed by bringing most of the hair forward and rolling it over frizettes made of hair the same colour as that of the wearer it is finished behind by plaiting the hair and arranging it in such a manner as to look well with the head dress twenty two forty nine Lessons in hairdressing may be obtained and at not an unreasonable charge If a lady s maid can afford it we would advise her to initiate herself in the mysteries of hairdressing before entering on her duties If a mistress finds her maid handy and willing to learn she will not mind the expense of a few lessons which are almost necessary as the fashion and mode of dressing the hair is so continually changing Brushes and combs should be kept scrupulously clean by washing them about twice a week to do this oftener spoils the brushes as very frequent washing makes them so very soft To wash Brushes twenty two fifty Dissolve a piece of soda in some hot water allowing a piece the size of a walnut to a quart of water Put the water into a basin and after combing out the hair from the brushes dip them bristles downwards into the water and out again keeping the backs and handles as free from the water as possible Repeat this until the bristles look clean then rinse the brushes in a little cold water shake them well and wipe the handles and backs with a towel but not the bristles and set the brushes to dry in the sun or near the fire but take care not to put them too close to it Wiping the bristles of a brush makes them soft as does also the use of soap To clean Combs twenty two fifty one If it can be avoided never wash combs as the water often makes the teeth split and the tortoiseshell or horn of which they are made rough Small brushes manufactured purposely for cleaning combs may be purchased at a trifling cost with this the comb should be well brushed and afterwards wiped with a cloth or towel A good Wash for the Hair twenty two fifty two INGREDIENTS one pennyworth of borax one two pint of olive oil one pint of boiling water Mode Pour the boiling water over the borax and oil let it cool then put the mixture into a bottle Shake it before using and apply it with a flannel Camphor and borax dissolved in boiling water and left to cool make a very good wash for the hair as also does rosemary water mixed with a little borax After using any of these washes when the hair becomes thoroughly dry a little pomatum or oil should be rubbed in to make it smooth and glossy To make Pomade for the Hair twenty two fifty three INGREDIENTS one four lb of lard two pennyworth of castor oil scent Mode Let the lard be unsalted beat it up well then add the castor oil and mix thoroughly together with a knife adding a few drops of any scent that may be preferred Put the pomatum into pots which keep well covered to prevent it turning rancid Another Recipe for Pomatum twenty two fifty four INGREDIENTS eight oz of olive oil one oz of spermaceti three pennyworth of essential oil of almonds three pennyworth of essence of lemon Mode Mix these ingredients together and store away in jars for use To make Bandoline twenty five fifty five INGREDIENTS one oz of gum tragacanth one four pint of cold water three pennyworth of essence of almonds two teaspoonfuls of old rum Mode Put the gum tragacanth into a wide mouthed bottle with the cold water let it stand till dissolved then stir into it the essence of almonds let it remain for an hour or two when pour the rum on the top This should make the stock bottle and when any is required for use it is merely necessary to dilute it with a little cold water until the desired consistency is obtained and to keep it in a small bottle well corked for use This bandoline instead of injuring the hair as many other kinds often do improves it by increasing its growth and making it always smooth and glossy An excellent Pomatum twenty two fifty six INGREDIENTS one one two lb of lard one two pint of olive oil one two pint of castor oil four oz of spermaceti bergamot or any other scent elder flower water Mode Wash the lard well in the elder flower water drain and beat it to a cream Mix the two oils together and heat them sufficiently to dissolve the spermaceti which should be beaten fine in a mortar Mix all these ingredients together with the brandy and whatever kind of scent may be preferred and whilst warm pour into glass bottles for use keeping them well corked The best way to liquefy the pomatum is to set the bottle in a saucepan of warm water It will remain good for many months To promote the Growth of Hair twenty two fifty seven INGREDIENTS Equal quantities of olive oil and spirit of rosemary a few drops of oil of nutmeg Mode Mix the ingredients together rub the roots of the hair every night with a little of this liniment and the growth of it will very soon sensibly increase twenty two fifty eight Our further remarks on dressing must be confined to some general advice In putting on a band see that it is laid quite flat and is drawn tightly round the waist before it is pinned in front that the pin is a strong one and that it is secured to the stays so as not to slip up or down or crease in the folds Arrange the folds of the dress over the crinoline petticoats if the dress fastens behind put a small pin in the slit to prevent it from opening See that the sleeves fall well over the arms If it is finished with a jacket or other upper dress see that it fits smoothly under the arms pull out the flounces and spread out the petticoat at the bottom with the hands so that it falls in graceful folds In arranging the petticoat itself a careful lady s maid will see that this is firmly fastened round the waist twenty two fifty nine Where sashes are worn pin the bows securely on the inside with a pin so as not to be visible then raise the bow with the fingers The collar is arranged and carefully adjusted with brooch or bow in the centre twenty two sixty Having dressed her mistress for breakfast and breakfasted herself the further duties of the lady s maid will depend altogether upon the habits of the family in which hardly two will probably agree Where the duties are entirely confined to attendance on her mistress it is probable that the bedroom and dressing room will be committed to her care that the housemaid will rarely enter except for the weekly or other periodical cleaning she will therefore have to make her mistress s bed and keep it in order and as her duties are light and easy there can be no allowance made for the slightest approach to uncleanliness or want of order Every morning immediately after her mistress has left it and while breakfast is on she should throw the bed open by taking off the clothes open the windows except in rainy weather and leave the room to air for half an hour After breakfast except her attendance on her mistress prevents it if the rooms are carpeted she should sweep them carefully having previously strewed the room with moist tea leaves dusting every table and chair taking care to penetrate to every corner and moving every article of furniture that is portable This done satisfactorily and having cleaned the dressing glass polished up the furniture and the ornaments and made the glass jug and basin clean and bright emptied all slops emptied the water jugs and filled them with fresh water and arranged the rooms the dressing room is ready for the mistress when she thinks proper to appear twenty two sixty one The dressing room thoroughly in order the same thing is to be done in the bedroom in which she will probably be assisted by the housemaid to make the bed and empty the slops In making the bed she will study her lady s wishes whether it is to be hard or soft sloping or straight and see that it is done accordingly twenty two sixty two Having swept the bedroom with equal care dusted the tables and chairs chimney ornaments and put away all articles of dress left from yesterday and cleaned and put away any articles of jewellery her next care is to see before her mistress goes out what requires replacing in her department and furnish her with a list of them that she may use her discretion about ordering them All this done she may settle herself down to any work on which she is engaged This will consist chiefly in mending which is first to be seen to everything except stockings being mended before washing Plain work will probably be one of the lady s maid s chief employments twenty two sixty three A waiting maid who wishes to make herself useful will study the fashion books with attention so as to be able to aid her mistress s judgment in dressing according to the prevailing fashion with such modifications as her style of countenance requires She will also if she has her mistress s interest at heart employ her spare time in repairing and making up dresses which have served one purpose to serve another also or turning many things unfitted for her mistress to use for the younger branches of the family The lady s maid may thus render herself invaluable to her mistress and increase her own happiness in so doing The exigencies of fashion and luxury are such that all ladies except those of the very highest rank will consider themselves fortunate in having about them a thoughtful person capable of diverting their finery to a useful purpose twenty two sixty four Among other duties the lady s maid should understand the various processes for washing and cleaning and repairing laces edging of collars removing stains and grease spots from dresses and similar processes for which the following recipes will be found very useful In washing twenty two sixty five Blonde fine toilet soap is used the blonde is soaped over very slightly and washed in water in which a little fig blue is dissolved rubbing it very gently when clean dry it Dip it afterwards in very thin gum water dry it again in linen spread it out as flat as it will lie and iron it Where the blonde is of better quality and wider it may be stretched on a hoop to dry after washing in the blue water applying the gum with a sponge or it may be washed finally in water in which a lump of sugar has been dissolved which gives it more the appearance of new blonde twenty two sixty six Lace collars soil very quickly when in contact with the neck they are cleaned by beating the edge of the collar between the folds of a fine linen cloth then washing the edges as directed above and spreading it out on an ironing board pinning it at each corner with fine pins then going carefully over it with a sponge charged with water in which some gum dragon and fig blue have been dissolved to give it a proper consistence To give the collar the same tint throughout the whole collar should be sponged with the same water taking care not to touch the flowers twenty two sixty seven A multiplicity of accidents occur to soil and spot dresses which should be removed at once To remove twenty two sixty eight Grease spots from cotton or woollen materials of fast colours absorbent pastes purified bullock s blood and even common soap are used applied to the spot when dry When the colours are not fast use fuller s earth or pulverized potter s clay laid in a layer over the spot and press it with a very hot iron twenty two sixty nine For Silks Moires and plain or brocaded Satins begin by pouring over the spot two drops of rectified spirits of wine cover it over with a linen cloth and press it with a hot iron changing the linen instantly The spot will look tarnished for a portion of the grease still remains this will be removed entirely by a little sulphuric ether dropped on the spot and a very little rubbing If neatly done no perceptible mark or circle will remain nor will the lustre of the richest silk be changed the union of the two liquids operating with no injurious effects from rubbing twenty two seventy Fruit spots are removed from white and fast coloured cottons by the use of chloride of soda Commence by cold soaping the article then touch the spot with a hair pencil or feather dipped in the chloride dipping it immediately into cold water to prevent the texture of the article being injured twenty two seventy one Ink spots are removed when fresh applied to the spot by a few drops of hot water being poured on immediately afterwards By the same process iron mould in linen or calico may be removed dipping immediately in cold water to prevent injury to the fabric twenty two seventy two Wax dropped on a shawl table cover or cloth dress is easily discharged by applying spirits of wine twenty two seventy three Syrups or Preserved Fruits by washing in lukewarm water with a dry cloth and pressing the spot between two folds of clean linen twenty two seventy four Essence of Lemon will remove grease but will make a spot itself in a few days To clean Silk or Ribbons twenty two seventy five INGREDIENTS one two pint of gin one two lb of honey one two lb of soft soap one two pint of water Mode Mix the above ingredients together then lay each breadth of silk upon a clean kitchen table or dresser and scrub it well on the soiled side with the mixture Have ready three vessels of cold water take each piece of silk at two corners and dip it up and down in each vessel but do not wring it and take care that each breadth has one vessel of quite clean water for the last dip Hang it up dripping for a minute or two then dab it in a cloth and iron it quickly with a very hot iron To remove Paint spots from Silk Cloth twenty two seventy six If the fabric will bear it sharp rubbing will frequently entirely discharge a newly made paint stain but if this is not successful apply spirit of turpentine with a quill till the stains disappear To make old Crape look nearly equal to new twenty two seventy seven Place a little water in a teakettle and let it boil until there is plenty of steam from the spout then holding the crape in both hands pass it to and fro several times through the steam and it will to clean and look nearly equal to new twenty two seventy eight Linen Before sending linen to wash the lady s maid should see that everything under her charge is properly mended for her own sake she should take care that it is sent out in an orderly manner each class of garments by themselves with a proper list of which she retains a copy On its return it is still more necessary to examine every piece separately so that all missing buttons be supplied and only the articles properly washed and in perfect repair passed into the wardrobe twenty two seventy nine Ladies who keep a waiting maid for their own persons are in the habit of paying visits to their friends in which it is not unusual for the maid to accompany them at all events it is her duty to pack the trunks and this requires not only knowledge but some practice although the improved trunks and portmanteaus now made in which there is a place for nearly everything render this more simple than formerly Before packing let the trunks be thoroughly well cleaned and if necessary lined with paper and everything intended for packing laid out on the bed or chairs so that it may be seen what is to be stowed away the nicer articles of dress neatly folded in clean calico wrappers Having satisfied herself that everything wanted is laid out and that it is in perfect order the packing is commenced by disposing of the most bulky articles the dressing case and work box skirts and other articles requiring room leaving the smaller articles to fill up finally having satisfied herself that all is included she should lock and cover up the trunk in its canvas case and then pack her own box if she is to accompany her mistress twenty two eighty On reaching the house the lady s maid will be shown her lady s apartment and her duties here are what they were at home she will arrange her mistress s things and learn which is her bell in order to go to her when she rings Her meals will be taken in the housekeeper s room and here she must be discreet and guarded in her talk to any one of her mistress or her concerns Her only occupation here will be attending in her lady s room keeping her things in order and making her rooms comfortable for her twenty two eighty one The evening duties of a lady s maid are pretty nearly a repetition of those of the morning She is in attendance when her mistress retires she assists her to undress if required brushes her hair and renders such other assistance as is demanded removes all slops takes care that the fire if any is safe before she retires to rest herself twenty two eighty two Ironing is a part of the duties of a lady s maid and she should be able to do it in the most perfect manner when it becomes necessary Ironing is often badly done from inattention to a few very simple requirements Cleanliness is the first essential the ironing board the fire the iron and the ironing blanket should all be perfectly clean It will not be necessary here to enter into details on ironing as full directions are given in the Duties of the Laundry maid A lady s maid will have a great deal of Ironing out to do such as light evening dresses muslin dresses c which are not dirty enough to be washed but merely require smoothing out to remove the creases In summer particularly an iron will be constantly required as also a skirt board which should be covered with a nice clean piece of flannel To keep muslin dresses in order they almost require smoothing out every time they are worn particularly if made with many flounces The lady s maid may often have to perform little services for her mistress which require care such as restoring the colour to scorched linen c c The following recipe is we believe a very good one To restore Whiteness to scorched Linen twenty two eighty three INGREDIENTS one two pint of vinegar two oz of fuller s earth one oz of dried fowls dung one two oz of soap the juice of two large onions Mode Boil all these ingredients together to the consistency of paste spread the composition thickly over the damaged part and if the threads be not actually consumed after it has been allowed to dry on and the place has subsequently been washed once or twice every trace of scorching will disappear twenty two eighty four Furs Feathers and Woollens require the constant care of the waiting maid Furs and feathers not in constant use should be wrapped up in linen washed in lye From May to September they are subject to being made the depositary of the moth eggs They should be looked too and shaken and beaten from time to time in case some of the eggs should have been lodged in them in spite of every precaution laying them up again or rather folding them up as before wrapping them in brown paper which is itself a preservative Shawls and cloaks which would be damaged by such close folds must be looked to and aired and beaten putting them away dry before the evening Preservatives against the Ravages of Moths twenty two eighty five Place pieces of camphor cedar wood Russia leather tobacco leaves bog myrtle or anything else strongly aromatic in the drawers or boxes where furs or other things to be preserved from moths are kept and they will never take harm twenty two eighty six Jewels are generally wrapped up in cotton and kept in their cases but they are subject to tarnish from exposure to the air and require cleaning This is done by preparing clean soap suds using fine toilet soap Dip any article of gold silver gilt or precious stones into this lye and dry them by brushing with a brush of soft badgers hair or a fine sponge afterwards with a piece of fine cloth and lastly with a soft leather twenty two eighty seven Epaulettes of gold or silver and in general all articles of jewellery may be dressed by dipping them in spirits of wine warmed in a bain marie or shallow kettle placed over a slow fire or hot plate twenty two eighty eight The valet and lady s maid from their supposed influence with their master and mistress are exposed to some temptations to which other servants are less subjected They are probably in communication with the tradespeople who supply articles for the toilet such as batters tailors dressmakers and perfumers The conduct of waiting maid and valet to these people should be civil but independent making reasonable allowance for want of exact punctuality if any such can be made they should represent any inconvenience respectfully and if an excuse seems unreasonable put the matter fairly to master or mistress leaving it to them to notice it further if they think it necessary No expectations of a personal character should influence them one way or the other It would be acting unreasonably to any domestic to make them refuse such presents as tradespeople choose to give them the utmost that can be expected is that they should not influence their judgment in the articles supplied that they should represent them truly to master or mistress without fear and without favour Civility to all servility to none is a good maxim for every one Deference to a master and mistress and to their friends and visitors is one of the implied terms of their engagement and this deference must apply even to what may be considered their whims A servant is not to be seated or wear a hat in the house in his master s or mistress s presence nor offer any opinion unless asked for it nor even to say good night or good morning except in reply to that salutation To preserve cut Flowers twenty two eighty nine A bouquet of freshly cut flowers may be preserved alive for a long time by placing them in a glass or vase with fresh water in which a little charcoal has been steeped or a small piece of camphor dissolved The vase should be set upon a plate or dish and covered with a bell glass around the edges of which when it comes in contact with the plate a little water should be poured to exclude the air To revive cut Flowers after packing twenty two ninety Plunge the stems into boiling water and by the time the water is cold the flowers will have revived Then cut afresh the ends of the stems and keep them in fresh cold water UPPER AND UNDER HOUSEMAIDS twenty two ninety one Housemaids in large establishments have usually one or more assistants in this case they are upper and under housemaids Dividing the work between them the upper housemaid will probably reserve for herself the task of dusting the ornaments and cleaning the furniture of the principal apartments but it is her duty to see that every department is properly attended to The number of assistants depends on the number in the family as well as on the style in which the establishment is kept up In wealthy families it is not unusual for every grown up daughter to have her waiting maid whose duty it is to keep her mistress s apartments in order thus abridging the housemaid s duties In others perhaps one waiting maid attends on two or three when the housemaid s assistance will be more requisite In fact every establishment has some customs peculiar to itself on which we need not dwell the general duties are the same in all perfect cleanliness and order being the object DUTIES OF THE HOUSEMAID twenty two ninety two Cleanliness is next to godliness saith the proverb and order is in the next degree the housemaid then may be said to be the handmaiden to two of the most prominent virtues Her duties are very numerous and many of the comforts of the family depend on their performance but they are simple and easy to a person naturally clean and orderly and desirous of giving satisfaction In all families whatever the habits of the master and mistress servants will find it advantageous to rise early their daily work will thus come easy to them If they rise late there is a struggle to overtake it which throws an air of haste and hurry over the whole establishment Where the master s time is regulated by early business or professional engagements this will of course regulate the hours of the servants but even where that is not the case servants will find great personal convenience in rising early and getting through their work in an orderly and methodical manner The housemaid who studies her own ease will certainly be at her work by six o clock in the summer and probably half past six or seven in the winter months having spent a reasonable time in her own chamber in dressing Earlier than this would probably be an unnecessary waste of coals and candle in winter twenty two ninety three The first duty of the housemaid in winter is to open the shutters of all the lower rooms in the house and take up the hearth rugs of those rooms which she is going to do before breakfast In some families where there is only a cook and housemaid kept and where the drawing rooms are large the cook has the care of the dining room and the housemaid that of the breakfast room library and drawing rooms After the shutters are all opened she sweeps the breakfast room sweeping the dust towards the fire place of course previously removing the fonder She should then lay a cloth generally made of coarse wrappering over the carpet in front of the stove and on this should place her housemaid s box containing black lead brushes leathers emery paper cloth black lead and all utensils necessary for cleaning a grate with the cinder pail on the other side Illustration CARPET BROOMS twenty two ninety four She now sweeps up the ashes and deposits them in her cinder pail which is a japanned tin pail with a wire sifter inside and a closely fitting top In this pail the cinders are sifted and reserved for use in the kitchen or under the copper the ashes only being thrown away The cinders disposed of she proceeds to black lead the grate producing the black lead the soft brush for laying it on her blacking and polishing brushes from the box which contains her tools This housemaid s box should be kept well stocked Having blackened brushed and polished every part and made all clean and bright she now proceeds to lay the fire Sometimes it is very difficult to get a proper polish to black grates particularly if they have been neglected and allowed to rust at all Brunswick black which is an excellent varnish for grates may be prepared in the following manner Illustration STOVE BRUSHES Illustration HOUSEMAID S BOX twenty two ninety five INGREDIENTS one lb of common asphaltum one two pint of linseed oil one quart of oil of turpentine Mode Melt the asphaltum and add gradually to it the other two ingredients Apply this with a small painter s brush and leave it to become perfectly dry The grate will need no other cleaning but will merely require dusting every day and occasionally brushing with a dry black lead brush This is of course when no fires are used When they are required the bars cheeks and back of the grate will need black leading in the usual manner twenty two ninety six Fire lighting however simple is an operation requiring some skill a fire is readily made by laying a few cinders at the bottom in open order over this a few pieces of paper and over that again eight or ten pieces of dry wood over the wood a course of moderate sized pieces of coal taking care to leave hollow spaces between for air at the centre and taking care to lay the whole well back in the grate so that the smoke may go up the chimney and not into the room This done fire the paper with a match from below and if properly laid it will soon burn up the stream of flame from the wood and paper soon communicating to the coals and cinders provided there is plenty of air at the centre twenty two ninety seven A new method of lighting a fire is sometimes practised with advantage the fire lighting from the top and burning down in place of being lighted and burning up from below This is arranged by laying the coals at the bottom mixed with a few good sized cinders and the wood at the top with another layer of coals and some paper over it the paper is lighted in the usual way and soon burns down to a good fire with some economy of fuel as is said twenty two ninety eight Bright grates require unceasing attention to keep them in perfect order A day should never pass without the housemaid rubbing with a dry leather the polished parts of a grate as also the fender and fire irons A careful and attentive housemaid should have no occasion ever to use emery paper for any part but the bars which of course become blackened by the fire Some mistresses to save labour have a double set of bars one set bright for the summer and another black set to use when fires are in requisition When bright grates are once neglected small rust spots begin to show themselves which a plain leather will not remove the following method of cleaning them must then be resorted to First thoroughly clean with emery paper then take a large smooth pebble from the road sufficiently large to hold comfortably in the hand with which rub the steel backwards and forwards one way until the desired polish is obtained It may appear at first to scratch but continue rubbing and the result will be success The following is also an excellent polish for bright stoves and steel articles twenty two ninety nine INGREDIENTS one tablespoonful of turpentine one ditto of sweet oil emery powder Mode Mix the turpentine and sweet oil together stirring in sufficient emery powder to make the mixture of the thickness of cream Put it on the article with a piece of soft flannel rub off quickly with another piece then polish with a little dry emery powder and clean leather twenty three hundred The several fires lighted the housemaid proceeds with her dusting and polishing the several pieces of furniture in the breakfast parlour leaving no corner unvisited Before sweeping the carpet it is a good practice to sprinkle it all over with tea leaves which not only lay all dust but give a slightly fragrant smell to the room It is now in order for the reception of the family and where there is neither footman nor parlour maid she now proceeds to the dressing room and lights her mistress s fire if she is in the habit of having one to dress by Her mistress is called hot water placed in the dressing room for her use her clothes as far as they are under the house maid s charge put before the fire to air hanging a fire guard on the bars where there is one while she proceeds to prepare the breakfast twenty three oh one In summer the housemaid s work is considerably abridged she throws open the windows of the several rooms not occupied as bedrooms that they may receive the fresh morning air before they are occupied she prepares the breakfast room by sweeping the carpet rubbing tables and chairs dusting mantel shelf and picture frames with a light brush dusting the furniture and beating and sweeping the rug she cleans the grate when necessary and replaces the white paper or arranges the shavings with which it is filled leaving everything clean and tidy for breakfast It is not enough however in cleaning furniture just to pass lightly over the surface the rims and legs of tables and the backs and legs of chairs and sofas should be rubbed vigorously daily if there is a book case every corner of every pane and ledge requires to be carefully wiped so that not a speck of dust can be found in the room twenty three oh two After the breakfast room is finished the housemaid should proceed to sweep down the stairs commencing at the top whilst the cook has the charge of the hall door step and passages After this she should go into the drawing room cover up every article of furniture that is likely to spoil with large dusting sheets and put the chairs together by turning them seat to seat and in fact make as much room as possible by placing all the loose furniture in the middle of the room whilst she sweeps the corners and sides When this is accomplished the furniture can then be put back in its place and the middle of the room swept sweeping the dirt as before said towards the fireplace The same rules should be observed in cleaning the drawing room grates as we have just stated putting down the cloth before commencing to prevent the carpet from getting soiled In the country a room would not require sweeping thoroughly like this more than twice a week but the housemaid should go over it every morning with a dust pan and broom taking up every crumb and piece she may see After the sweeping she should leave the room shut the door and proceed to lay the breakfast Where there is neither footman nor parlour maid kept the duty of laying the breakfast cloth rests on the housemaid Illustration BANISTER BROOM Illustration STAIRCASE BROOM twenty three oh three Before laying the cloth for breakfast the heater of the tea urn is to be placed in the hottest part of the kitchen fire or where the kettle is used boiled on the kitchen fire and then removed to the parlour where it is kept hot Having washed herself free from the dust arising from the morning s work the housemaid collects the breakfast things on her tray takes the breakfast cloth from the napkin press and carries them all on the tray into the parlour arranges them on the table placing a sufficiency of knives forks and salt cellars for the family and takes the tray back to the pantry gets a supply of milk cream and bread fills the butter dish taking care that the salt is plentiful and soft and dry and that hot plates and egg cups are ready where warm meat or eggs are served and that butter knife and bread knife are in their places And now she should give the signal for breakfast holding herself ready to fill the urn with hot water or hand the kettle and take in the rolls toast and other eatables with which the cook supplies her when the breakfast room bell rings bearing in mind that she is never to enter the parlour with dirty hands or with a dirty apron and that everything is to be handed on a tray that she is to hand everything she may be required to supply on the left hand of the person she is serving and that all is done quietly and without bustle or hurry In some families where there is a large number to attend on the cook waits at breakfast whilst the housemaid is busy upstairs in the bedrooms or sweeping dusting and putting the drawing room in order twenty three oh four Breakfast served the housemaid proceeds to the bed chambers throws up the sashes if not already done pulls up the blinds throwing back curtains at the same time and opens the beds by removing the clothes placing them over a horse or failing that over the backs of chairs She now proceeds to empty the slops In doing this everything is emptied into the slop pail leaving a little scalding hot water for a minute in such vessels as require it adding a drop of turpentine to the water when that is not sufficient to cleanse them The basin is emptied well rinsed with clean water and carefully wiped the ewers emptied and washed finally the water jugs themselves emptied out and rinsed and wiped dry As soon as this is done she should remove and empty the pails taking care that they also are well washed scalded and wiped as soon as they are empty twenty three oh five Next follows bedmaking at which the cook or kitchen maid where one is kept usually assists but before beginning velvet chairs or other things injured by dust should be removed to another room In bedmaking the fancy of its occupant should be consulted some like beds sloping from the top towards the feet swelling slightly in the middle others perfectly flat a good housemaid will accommodate each bed to the taste of the sleeper taking care to shake beat and turn it well in the process Some persons prefer sleeping on the mattress in which case a feather bed is usually beneath resting on a second mattress and a straw paillasse at the bottom In this case the mattresses should change places daily the feather bed placed on the mattress shaken beaten taken up and opened several times so as thoroughly to separate the feathers if too large to be thus handled the maid should shake and beat one end first and then the other smoothing it afterwards equally all over into the required shape and place the mattress gently over it Any feathers which escape in this process a tidy servant will put back through the seam of the tick she will also be careful to sew up any stitch that gives way the moment it is discovered The bedclothes are laid on beginning with an under blanket and sheet which are tucked under the mattress at the bottom The bolster is then beaten and shaken and put on the top of the sheet rolled round it and the sheet tucked in all round The pillows and other bedclothes follow and the counterpane over all which should fall in graceful folds and at equal distance from the ground all round The curtains are drawn to the head and folded neatly across the bed and the whole finished in a smooth and graceful manner Where spring mattresses are used care should be taken that the top one is turned every day The housemaid should now take up in a dustpan any pieces that may be on the carpet she should dust the room shut the door and proceed to another room When all the bedrooms are finished she should dust the stairs and polish the handrail of the banisters and see that all ledges window sills c are quite free from dust It will be necessary for the housemaid to divide her work so that she may not have too much to do on certain days and not sufficient to fill up her time on other days In the country bedrooms should be swept and thoroughly cleaned once a week and to be methodical and regular in her work the housemaid should have certain days for doing certain rooms thoroughly For instance the drawing room on Monday two bedrooms on Tuesday two on Wednesday and so on reserving a day for thoroughly cleaning the plate bedroom candlesticks c c which she will have to do where there is no parlour maid or footman kept By this means the work will be divided and there will be no unnecessary bustling and hurrying as is the case where the work is done any time without rule or regulation Illustration SCRUBBING BRUSH twenty three oh six Once a week when a bedroom is to be thoroughly cleaned the house maid should commence by brushing the mattresses of the bed before it is made she should then make it shake the curtains lay them smoothly on the bed and pin or tuck up the bottom valance so that she may be able to sweep under the bed She should then unloop the window curtains shake them and pin them high up out of the way After clearing the dressing table and the room altogether of little articles of china c c she should shake the toilet covers fold them up and lay them on the bed over which a large dusting sheet should be thrown She should then sweep the room first of all sprinkling the carpet with well squeezed tea leaves or a little freshly pulled grass when this is obtainable After the carpet is swept and the grate cleaned she should wash with soap and water with a little soda in it the washing table apparatus removing all marks or fur round the jugs caused by the water The water bottles and tumblers must also have her attention as well as the top of the washing stand which should be cleaned with soap and flannel if it be marble if of polished mahogany no soap must be used When these are all clean and arranged in their places the housemaid should scrub the floor where it is not covered with carpet under the beds and round the wainscot She should use as little soap and soda as possible as too free a use of these articles is liable to give the boards a black appearance In the country cold soft water a clean scrubbing brush and a willing arm are all that are required to make bedroom floors look white In winter it is not advisable to scrub rooms too often as it is difficult to dry them thoroughly at that season of the year and nothing is more dangerous than to allow persons to sleep in a damp room The housemaid should now dust the furniture blinds ornaments c polish the looking glass arrange the toilet cover and muslin remove the cover from the bed and straighten and arrange the curtains and counterpane A bedroom should be cleaned like this every week There are times however when it is necessary to have the carpet up this should be done once a year in the country and twice a year in large cities The best time for these arrangements is spring and autumn when the bed furniture requires changing to suit the seasons of the year After arranging the furniture it should all be well rubbed and polished and for this purpose the housemaid should provide herself with an old silk pocket handkerchief to finish the polishing Illustration LONG HAIR BROOM twenty three oh seven As modern furniture is now nearly always French polished it should often be rubbed with an old silk rubber or a fine cloth or duster to keep it free from smears Three or four times a year any of the following polishes may be applied with very great success as any of them make French polished furniture look very well One precaution must be taken not to put too much of the polish on at one time and to rub not smear it over the articles FURNITURE POLISH twenty three oh eight INGREDIENTS one four pint of linseed oil one four pint of vinegar one oz of spirits of salts one two oz of muriatic antimony Mode Mix all well together and shake before using FURNITURE POLISH twenty three oh nine INGREDIENTS Equal proportions of linseed oil turpentine vinegar and spirits of wine Mode When used shake the mixture well and rub on the furniture with a piece of linen rag and polish with a clean duster Vinegar and oil rubbed in with flannel and the furniture rubbed with a clean duster produce a very good polish FURNITURE PASTE twenty three ten INGREDIENTS three oz of common beeswax one oz of white wax one oz of curd soap one pint of turpentine one pint of boiled water Illustration FURNITURE BRUSH Mode Mix the ingredients together adding the water when cold shake the mixture frequently in the bottle and do not use it for forty eight hours after it is made It should be applied with a piece of flannel the furniture polished with a duster and then with an old silk rubber twenty three eleven The chambers are finished the chamber candlesticks brought down and cleaned the parlour lamps trimmed and here the housemaid s utmost care is required In cleaning candlesticks as in every other cleaning she should have cloths and brushes kept for that purpose alone the knife used to scrape them should be applied to no other purpose the tallow grease should be thrown into a box kept for the purpose the same with everything connected with the lamp trimming the best mode of doing which she will do well to learn from the tradesman who supplies the oil always bearing in mind however that without perfect cleanliness which involves occasional scalding no lamp can be kept in order twenty three twelve The drawing and dining room inasmuch as everything there is more costly and valuable require even more care When the carpets are of the kind known as velvet pile they require to be swept firmly by a hard whisk brush made of cocoanut fibre twenty three thirteen The furniture must be carefully gone over in every corner with a soft cloth that it may be left perfectly free from dust or where that is beyond reach with a brush made of long feathers or a goose s wing The sofas are swept in the same manner slightly beaten the cushions shaken and smoothed the picture frames swept and everything arranged in its proper place This of course applies to dining as well as drawing room and morning room And now the housemaid may dress herself for the day and prepare for the family dinner at which she must attend twenty three fourteen We need not repeat the long instructions already given for laying the dinner table At the family dinner even where no footman waits the routine will be the same In most families the cloth is laid with the slips on each side with napkins knives forks spoons and wine and finger glasses on all occasions Illustration BUTLER S TRAY AND STAND twenty three fifteen She should ascertain that her plate is in order glasses free from smears water bottles and decanters the same and everything ready on her tray that she may be able to lay her cloth properly Few things add more to the neat and comfortable appearance of a dinner table than well polished plate indeed the state of the plate is a certain indication of a well managed or ill managed household Nothing is easier than to keep plate in good order and yet many servants from stupidity and ignorance make it the greatest trouble of all things under their care It should be remembered that it is utterly impossible to make greasy silver take a polish and that as spoons and forks in daily use are continually in contact with grease they must require good washing in soap and water to remove it Silver should be washed with a soapy flannel in one water rinsed in another and then wiped dry with a dry cloth The plate so washed may be polished with the plate rags as in the following directions Once a week all the plate should receive a thorough cleaning with the hartshorn powder as directed in the first recipe for cleaning plate and where the housemaid can find time rubbed every day with the plate rags twenty three sixteen Hartshorn we may observe is one of the best possible ingredients for plate powder in daily use It leaves on the silver a deep dark polish and at the same time does less injury than anything else It has also the advantage of being very cheap almost all the ordinary powders sold in boxes containing more or less of quicksilver in some form or another and this in process of time is sure to make the plate brittle If any one wishes to be convinced of the effect of quicksilver on plate he has only to rub a little of it on one place for some time on the handle of a silver teaspoon for instance and he will find it break in that spot with very little pressure To Clean Plate A very excellent method Illustration PLATE BRUSH twenty three seventeen Wash the plate well to remove all grease in a strong lather of common yellow soap and boiling water and wipe it quite dry then mix as much hartshorn powder as will be required into a thick paste with cold water or spirits of wine smear this lightly over the plate with a piece of soft rag and leave it for some little time to dry When perfectly dry brush it off quite clean with a soft plate brush and polish the plate with a dry leather If the plate be very dirty or much tarnished spirits of wine will be found to answer better than the water for mixing the paste Plate rags for daily use twenty three eighteen Boil soft rags nothing is better for the purpose than the tops of old cotton stockings in a mixture of new milk and hartshorn powder in the proportion of one oz of powder to a pint of milk boil them for five minutes wring them as soon as they are taken out for a moment in cold water and dry them before the fire With these rags rub the plate briskly as soon as it has been well washed and dried after daily use A most beautiful deep polish will be produced and the plate will require nothing more than merely to be dusted with a leather or a dry soft cloth before it is again put on the table twenty three nineteen For waiting at table the housemaid should be neatly and cleanly dressed and if possible her dress made with closed sleeves the large open ones dipping and falling into everything on the table and being very much in the way She should not wear creaking boots and should move about the room as noiselessly as possible anticipating people s wants by handing them things without being asked for them and altogether be as quiet as possible It will be needless here to repeat what we have already said respecting waiting at table in the duties of the butler and footman rules that are good to be observed by them are equally good for the parlour maid or housemaid twenty three twenty The housemaid having announced that dinner is on the table will hand the soup fish meat or side dishes to the different members of the family but in families who do not spend much of the day together they will probably prefer being alone at dinner and breakfast the housemaid will be required after all are helped if her master does not wish her to stay in the room to go on with her work of cleaning up in the pantry and answer the bell when rung In this case she will place a pile of plates on the table or a dumbwaiter within reach of her master and mistress and leave the room Illustration CRUMB BRUSH twenty three twenty one Dinner over the housemaid removes the plates and dishes on the tray places the dirty knives and forks in the basket prepared for them folds up the napkins in the ring which indicates by which member of the family it has been used brushes off the crumbs on the hand tray kept for the purpose folds up the table cloth in the folds already made and places it in the linen press to be smoothed out After every meal the table should be rubbed all marks from hot plates removed and the table cover thrown over and the room restored to its usual order If the family retire to the drawing room or any other room it is a good practice to throw up the sash to admit fresh air and ventilate the room twenty three twenty two The housemaid s evening service consists in washing up the dinner things the plate plated articles and glasses restoring everything to its place cleaning up her pantry and putting away everything for use when next required lastly preparing for tea as the time approaches by setting the things out on the tray getting the urn or kettle ready with cream and other things usually partaken of at that meal twenty three twenty three In summer time the windows of all the bedrooms which have been closed during the heat of the day should be thrown open for an hour or so after sunset in order to air them Before dark they should be closed the bedclothes turned down and the night clothes laid in order for use when required During winter where fires are required in the dressing rooms they should be lighted an hour before the usual time of retiring placing a fire guard before each fire At the same time the night things on the horse should be placed before it to be aired with a tin can of hot water if the mistress is in the habit of washing before going to bed We may add that there is no greater preservative of beauty than washing the face every night in hot water The housemaid will probably be required to assist her mistress to undress and put her dress in order for the morrow in which case her duties are very much those of the lady s maid twenty three twenty four And now the fire is made up for the night the fireguard replaced and everything in the room in order for the night the housemaid taking care to leave the night candle and matches together in a convenient place should they be required It is usual in summer to remove all highly fragrant flowers from sleeping rooms the impression being that their scent is injurious in a close chamber twenty three twenty five On leisure days the housemaid should be able to do some needlework for her mistress such as turning and mending sheets and darning the house linen or assist her in anything she may think fit to give her to do For this reason it is almost essential that a housemaid in a small family should be an expert needlewoman as if she be a good manager and an active girl she will have time on her hands to get through plenty of work twenty three twenty six Periodical Cleanings Besides the daily routine which we have described there are portions of every house which can only be thoroughly cleaned occasionally at which time the whole house usually undergoes a more thorough cleaning than is permitted in the general way On these occasions it is usual to begin at the top of the house and clean downwards moving everything out of the room washing the wainscoting or paint with soft soap and water pulling down the beds and thoroughly cleansing all the joints scrubbing the floor beating feather beds mattress and paillasse and thoroughly purifying every article of furniture before it is put back in its place twenty three twenty seven This general cleaning usually takes place in the spring or early summer when the warm curtains of winter are replaced by the light and cheerful muslin curtains Carpets are at the same time taken up and beaten except where the mistress of the house has been worried into an experiment by the often reiterated question Why beat your carpets In this case she will probably have made up her mind to try the cleaning process and arranged with the company to send for them on the morning when cleaning commenced It is hardly necessary to repeat that on this occasion every article is to be gone over the French polished furniture well rubbed and polished The same thorough system of cleaning should be done throughout the house the walls cleaned where painted and swept down with a soft broom or feather brush where papered the window and bed curtains which have been replaced with muslin ones carefully brushed or if they require it cleaned lamps not likely to be required washed out with hot water dried and cleaned The several grates are now to be furnished with their summer ornaments and we know none prettier than the following which the housemaid may provide at a small expense to her mistress Purchase two yards and a half of crinoline muslin and tear it into small strips the selvage way of the material about an inch wide strip this thread by thread on each side leaving the four centre threads this gives about six and thirty pieces fringed on each side which are tied together at one end and fastened to the trap of the register while the threads unravelled are spread gracefully about the grate the lower part of which is filled with paper shavings This makes a very elegant and very cheap ornament which is much stronger besides than those usually purchased Illustration CORNICE BRUSH Illustration HOUSE PAIL Illustration DUSTING BRUSH twenty three twenty eight As winter approaches this house cleaning will have to be repeated and the warm bed and window curtains replaced The process of scouring and cleaning is again necessary and must be gone through beginning at the top and going through the house down to the kitchens twenty three twenty nine Independently of these daily and periodical cleanings other occupations will present themselves from time to time which the housemaid will have to perform When spots show on polished furniture they can generally be restored by soap and water and a sponge the polish being brought out by using a little polish and then well rubbing it Again drawers which draw out stiffly may be made to move more easily if the spot where they press is rubbed over with a little soap twenty three thirty Chips broken off any of the furniture should be collected and replaced by means of a little glue applied to it Liquid glue which is sold prepared in bottles is very useful to have in the house as it requires no melting and anything broken can be so quickly repaired twenty three thirty one Breaking glass and china is about the most disagreeable thing that can happen in a family and it is probably a greater annoyance to a right minded servant than to the mistress A neat handed housemaid may sometimes repair these breakages where they are not broken in very conspicuous places by joining the pieces very neatly together with a cement made as follows Dissolve an ounce of gum mastic in a quantity of highly rectified spirits of wine then soften an ounce of isinglass in warm water and finally dissolve it in rum or brandy till it forms a thick jelly Mix the isinglass and gum mastic together adding a quarter of an ounce of finely powdered gum ammoniac put the whole into an earthen pipkin and in a warm place till they are thoroughly incorporated together pour it into a small phial and cork it down for use twenty three thirty two In using it dissolve a small piece of the cement in a silver teaspoon over a lighted candle The broken pieces of glass or china being warmed and touched with the now liquid cement join the parts neatly together and hold in their places till the cement has set then wipe away the cement adhering to the edge of the joint and leave it for twelve hours without touching it the joint will be as strong as the china itself and if neatly done it will show no joining It is essential that neither of the pieces be wetted either with hot or cold water USEFUL RECIPES FOR HOUSEMAIDS To clean Marble twenty three thirty three Mix with one four pint of soap lees one two gill of turpentine sufficient pipe clay and bullock s gall to make the whole into rather a thick paste Apply it to the marble with a soft brush and after a day or two when quite dry rub it off with a soft rag Apply this a second or third time till the marble is quite clean Another method twenty three thirty four Take two parts of soda one of pumice stone and one of finely powdered chalk Sift these through a fine sieve and mix them into a paste with water Rub this well all over the marble and the stains will be removed then wash it with soap and water and a beautiful bright polish will be produced To clean Floorcloth twenty three thirty five After having washed the floorcloth in the usual manner with a damp flannel wet it all over with milk and rub it well with a dry cloth when a most beautiful polish will be brought out Some persons use for rubbing a well waxed flannel but this in general produces an unpleasant slipperiness which is not the case with the milk To clean Decanters twenty three thirty six Roll up in small pieces some soft brown or blotting paper wet them and soap them well Put them into the decanters about one quarter full of warm water shake them well for a few minutes then rinse with clear cold water wipe the outsides with a nice dry cloth put the decanters to drain and when dry they will be almost as bright as new ones To brighten Gilt Frames twenty three thirty seven Take sufficient flour of sulphur to give a golden tinge to about one one two pint of water and in this boil four or five bruised onions or garlic which will answer the same purpose Strain off the liquid and with it when cold wash with a soft brush any gilding which requires restoring and when dry it will come out as bright as new work To preserve bright Grates or Fire irons from Rust twenty three thirty eight Make a strong paste of fresh lime and water and with a fine brush smear it as thickly as possible over all the polished surface requiring preservation By this simple means all the grates and fire irons in an empty house may be kept for months free from harm without further care or attention German Furniture Gloss twenty three thirty nine INGREDIENTS one two lb yellow wax one oz black rosin two oz of oil of turpentine Mode Cut the wax into small pieces and melt it in a pipkin with the rosin pounded very fine Stir in gradually while these two ingredients are quite warm the oil of turpentine Keep this composition well covered for use in a tin or earthen pot A little of this gloss should be spread on a piece of coarse woollen cloth and the furniture well rubbed with it afterwards it should be polished with a fine cloth DUTIES OF THE MAID OF ALL WORK twenty three forty The general servant or maid of all work is perhaps the only one of her class deserving of commiseration her life is a solitary one and in some places her work is never done She is also subject to rougher treatment than either the house or kitchen maid especially in her earlier career she starts in life probably a girl of thirteen with some small tradesman s wife as her mistress just a step above her in the social scale and although the class contains among them many excellent kind hearted women it also contains some very rough specimens of the feminine gender and to some of these it occasionally falls to give our maid of all work her first lessons in her multifarious occupations the mistress s commands are the measure of the maid of all work s duties By the time she has become a tolerable servant she is probably engaged in some respectable tradesman s house where she has to rise with the lark for she has to do in her own person all the work which in larger establishments is performed by cook kitchen maid and housemaid and occasionally the part of a footman s duty which consists in carrying messages twenty three forty one The general servant s duties commence by opening the shutters and windows if the weather permits of all the lower apartments in the house she should then brush up her kitchen range light the fire clear away the ashes clean the hearth and polish with a leather the bright parts of the range doing all as rapidly and as vigorously as possible that no more time be wasted than is necessary After putting on the kettle she should then proceed to the dining room or parlour to get it in order for breakfast She should first roll up the rug take up the fender shake and fold up the table cloth then sweep the room carrying the dirt towards the fireplace a coarse cloth should then be laid down over the carpet and she should proceed to clean the grate having all her utensils close to her When the grate is finished the ashes cleared away the hearth cleaned and the fender put back in its place she must dust the furniture not omitting the legs of the tables and chairs and if there are any ornaments or things on the sideboard she must not dust round them but lift them up on to another place dust well where they have been standing and then replace the things Nothing annoys a particular mistress so much as to find when she comes down stairs different articles of furniture looking as if they had never been dusted If the servant is at all methodical and gets into a habit of doing a room in a certain way she will scarcely ever leave her duties neglected After the rug is put down the table cloth arranged and everything in order she should lay the cloth for breakfast and then shut the dining room door twenty three forty two The hall must now be swept the mats shaken the door step cleaned and any brass knockers or handles polished up with the leather If the family breakfast very early the tidying of the hall must then be deferred till after that meal After cleaning the boots that are absolutely required the servant should now wash her hands and face put on a clean white apron and be ready for her mistress when she comes down stairs In families where there is much work to do before breakfast the master of the house frequently has two pairs of boots in wear so that they may be properly cleaned when the servant has more time to do them in the daytime This arrangement is perhaps scarcely necessary in the summer time when there are no grates to clean every morning but in the dark days of winter it is only kind and thoughtful to lighten a servant of all work s duties as much as possible Illustration BLACKING BRUSH BOX twenty three forty three She will now carry the urn into the dining room where her mistress will make the tea or coffee and sometimes will boil the eggs to insure them being done to her liking In the mean time the servant cooks if required the bacon kidneys fish c if cold meat is to be served she must always send it to table on a clean dish and nicely garnished with tufts of parsley if this is obtainable twenty three forty four After she has had her own breakfast and whilst the family are finishing theirs she should go upstairs into the bedrooms open all the windows strip the clothes off the beds and leave them to air whilst she is clearing away the breakfast things She should then take up the crumbs in a dustpan from under the table put the chairs in their places and sweep up the hearth twenty three forty five The breakfast things washed up the kitchen should be tidied so that it may be neat when her mistress comes in to give the orders for the day after receiving these orders the servant should go upstairs again with a jug of boiling water the slop pail and two cloths After emptying the slops and scalding the vessels with the boiling water and wiping them thoroughly dry she should wipe the top of the wash table and arrange it all in order She then proceeds to make the beds in which occupation she is generally assisted by the mistress or if she have any daughters by one of them Before commencing to make the bed the servant should put on a large bed apron kept for this purpose only which should be made very wide to button round the waist and meet behind while it should be made as long as the dress By adopting this plan the blacks and dirt on servants dresses which at all times it is impossible to help will not rub off on to the bed clothes mattresses and bed furniture When the beds are made the rooms should be dusted the stairs lightly swept down hall furniture closets c dusted The lady of the house where there is but one servant kept frequently takes charge of the drawing room herself that is to say dusting it the servant sweeping cleaning windows looking glasses grates and rough work of that sort If there are many ornaments and knick knacks about the room it is certainly better for the mistress to dust these herself as a maid of all work s hands are not always in a condition to handle delicate ornaments twenty three forty six Now she has gone the rounds of the house and seen that all is in order the servant goes to her kitchen to see about the cooking of the dinner in which very often her mistress will assist her She should put on a coarse apron with a bib to do her dirty work in which may be easily replaced by a white one if required twenty three forty seven Half an hour before dinner is ready she should lay the cloth that everything may be in readiness when she is dishing up the dinner and take all into the dining room that is likely to be required in the way of knives forks spoons bread salt water c c By exercising a little forethought much confusion and trouble may be saved both to mistress and servant by getting everything ready for the dinner in good time twenty three forty eight After taking in the dinner when every one is seated she removes the covers hands the plates round and pours out the beer and should be careful to hand everything on the left side of the person she is waiting on twenty three forty nine We need scarcely say that a maid of all work cannot stay in the dining room during the whole of dinner time as she must dish up her pudding or whatever is served after the first course When she sees every one helped she should leave the room to make her preparations for the next course and anything that is required such as bread c people may assist themselves to in the absence of the servant twenty three fifty When the dinner things are cleared away the servant should sweep up the crumbs in the dining room sweep the hearth and lightly dust the furniture then sit down to her own dinner Illustration KNIFE CLEANING MACHINE twenty three fifty one After this she washes up and puts away the dinner things sweeps the kitchen dusts and tidies it and puts on the kettle for tea She should now before dressing herself for the afternoon clean her knives boots and shoes and do any other dirty work in the scullery that may be necessary Knife cleaning machines are rapidly taking the place in most households of the old knife board The saving of labour by the knife cleaner is very great and its performance of the work is very satisfactory Small and large machines are manufactured some cleaning only four knives whilst others clean as many as twelve at once Nothing can be more simple than the process of machine knife cleaning and although in a very limited household the substitution of the machine for the board may not be necessary yet we should advise all housekeepers to whom the outlay is not a difficulty to avail themselves of the services of a machine We have already spoken of its management in the Duties of the Footman No twenty one seventy seven twenty three fifty two When the servant is dressed she takes in the tea and after tea turns down the beds sees that the water jugs and bottles are full closes the windows and draws down the blinds If the weather is very warm these are usually left open until the last thing at night to cool the rooms twenty three fifty three The routine of a general servant s duties depends upon the kind of situation she occupies but a systematic maid of all work should so contrive to divide her work that every day in the week may have its proper share By this means she is able to keep the house clean with less fatigue to herself than if she left all the cleaning to do at the end of the week Supposing there are five bedrooms in the house two sitting rooms kitchen scullery and the usual domestic offices on Monday she should thoroughly clean the drawing room on Tuesday two of the bedrooms on Wednesday two more on Thursday the other bedroom and stairs on Friday morning she should sweep the dining room very thoroughly clean the hall and in the afternoon her kitchen tins and bright utensils By arranging her work in this manner no undue proportion will fall to Saturday s share and she will then have this day for cleaning plate cleaning her kitchen and arranging everything in nice order The regular work must of course be performed in the usual manner as we have endeavoured to describe twenty three fifty four Before retiring to bed she will do well to clean up glasses plates c which have been used for the evening meal and prepare for her morning s work by placing her wood near the fire on the hob to dry taking care there is no danger of it igniting before she leaves the kitchen for the night Before retiring she will have to lock and bolt the doors unless the master undertakes this office himself twenty three fifty five If the washing or even a portion of it is done at home it will be impossible for the maid of all work to do her household duties thoroughly during the time it is about unless she have some assistance Usually if all the washing is done at home the mistress hires some one to assist at the wash tub and sees to little matters herself in the way of dusting clearing away breakfast things folding starching and ironing the fine things With a little management much can be accomplished provided the mistress be industrious energetic and willing to lend a helping hand Let washing week be not the excuse for having everything in a muddle and although things cannot be cleaned so thoroughly and so much time spent upon them as ordinarily yet the house may be kept tidy and clear from litter without a great deal of exertion either on the part of the mistress or servant We will conclude our remarks with an extract from an admirably written book called Home Truths for Home Peace The authoress says with respect to the great wash Amongst all the occasions in which it is most difficult and glorious to keep muddle out of a family the great wash stands pre eminent and as very little money is now saved by having everything done at home many ladies with the option of taking another servant or putting out the chief part of the washing have thankfully adopted the latter course She goes on to say When a gentleman who dines at home can t bear washing in the house but gladly pays for its being done elsewhere the lady should gratefully submit to his wishes and put out anything in her whole establishment rather than put out a good and generous husband twenty three fifty six A bustling and active girl will always find time to do a little needlework for herself if she lives with consistent and reasonable people In the summer evenings she should manage to sit down for two or three hours and for a short time in the afternoon in leisure days A general servant s duties are so multifarious that unless she be quick and active she will not be able to accomplish this To discharge these various duties properly is a difficult task and sometimes a thankless office but it must be remembered that a good maid of all work will make a good servant in any capacity and may be safely taken not only without fear of failure but with every probability of giving satisfaction to her employer DUTIES OF THE DAIRY MAID twenty three fifty seven The duties of the dairy maid differ considerably in different districts In Scotland Wales and some of the northern counties women milk the cows On some of the large dairy farms in other parts of England she takes her share in the milking but in private families the milking is generally performed by the cowkeeper and the dairy maid only receives the milkpails from him morning and night and empties and cleans them preparatory to the next milking her duty being to supply the family with milk cream and butter and other luxuries depending on the milky mothers of the herd twenty three fifty eight The Dairy The object with which gentlemen keep cows is to procure milk unadulterated and sweet butter for themselves and families in order to obtain this however great cleanliness is required and as visitors as well as the mistress of the house sometimes visit the dairy some efforts are usually made to render it ornamental and picturesque The locality is usually fixed near to the house it should neither be exposed to the fierce heat of the summer s sun nor to the equally unfavourable frosts of winter it must be both sheltered and shaded If it is a building apart from the house and other offices the walls should be tolerably thick and if hollow the temperature will be more equable The walls inside are usually covered with Dutch glazed tiles the flooring also of glazed tiles set in asphalte to resist water and the ceiling lath and plaster or closely jointed woodwork painted Its architecture will be a matter of fancy it should have a northern aspect and a thatched roof is considered most suitable from the shade and shelter it affords and it should contain at least two apartments besides a cool place for storing away butter One of the apartments in which the milk is placed to deposit cream or to ripen for churning is usually surrounded by shelves of marble or slate on which the milk dishes rest but it will be found a better plan to have a large square or round table of stone in the centre with a water tight ledge all round it in which water may remain in hot weather or if some attempt at the picturesque is desired a small fountain might occupy the centre which would keep the apartment cool and fresh Round this table the milk dishes should be ranged one shelf or dresser of slate or marble being kept for the various occupations of the dairy maid it will be found a better plan than putting them on shelves and corners against the wall There should be a funnel or ventilator in the ceiling communicating with the open air made to open and shut as required Double windows are recommended but of the lattice kind so that they may open and with wire gauze blinds fitted into the opening and calico blinds which may be wetted when additional coolness is required The other apartment will be used for churning washing and scrubbing in fact the scullery of the dairy with a boiler for hot water and a sink with cold water laid on which should be plentiful and good In some dairies a third apartment or at least a cool airy pantry is required for storing away butter with shelves of marble or slate to hold the cream jars while it is ripening and where cheeses are made a fourth becomes necessary The dairy utensils are not numerous churns milk pails for each cow hair sieves slices of tin milk pans marble dishes for cream for family use scales and weights a portable rack for drying the utensils wooden bowls butter moulds and butter patters and wooden tubs for washing the utensils comprising pretty nearly everything twenty three fifty nine Pails are made of maple wood or elm and hooped or of tin more or less ornamented One is required for each cow twenty three sixty The Hair Sieve is made of closely twisted horse hair with a rim through which the milk is strained to remove any hairs which may have dropped from the cow in milking twenty three sixty one Milk Dishes are shallow basins of glass of glazed earthenware or tin about sixteen inches in diameter at top and twelve at the bottom and five or six inches deep holding about eight to ten quarts each when full twenty three sixty two Churns are of all sorts and sizes from that which churns seventy or eighty gallons by means of a strap from the engine to the square box in which a pound of butter is made The churn used for families is a square box eighteen inches by twelve or thirteen and seventeen deep bevelled below to the plane of the dashers with a loose lid or cover The dasher consists of an axis of wood to which the four beaters or fanners are attached these fans are simply four pieces of elm strongly dovetailed together forming an oblong square with a space left open two of the openings being left broader than the others attached to an axle they form an axis with four projecting blades the axle fits into supports at the centre of the box a handle is fitted to it and the act of churning is done by turning the handle twenty three sixty three Such is the temple in which the dairy maid presides it should be removed both from stable and cowhouse and larder no animal smells should come near it and the drainage should be perfect twenty three sixty four The dairy maid receives the milk from the cowkeeper each pail being strained through the hair sieve into one of the milk basins This is left in the basins from twenty four to thirty six hours in the summer according to the weather after which it is skimmed off by means of the slicer and poured into glazed earthenware jars to turn for churning Some persons prefer making up a separate churning for the milk of each cow in which there is some advantage In this case the basins of each cow for two days would either be kept together or labelled As soon as emptied the pails should be scalded and every particle of milk washed out and placed away in a dry place till next required and all milk spilt on the floor or on the table or dresser cleaned up with a cloth and hot water Where very great attention is paid to the dairy the milk coolers are used larger in winter when it is desirable to retard the cooling down and increase the creamy deposit and smaller in summer to hasten it the temperature required being from fifty five deg to fifty deg In summer it is sometimes expedient in very sultry weather to keep the dairy fresh and cool by suspending cloths dipped in chloride of lime across the room twenty three sixty five In some dairies it is usual to churn twice and in others three times a week the former produces the best butter the other the greatest quantity With three cows the produce should be twenty seven to thirty quarts a day The dairy maid should churn every day when very hot if they are in full milk and every second day in more temperate weather besides supplying the milk and cream required for a large establishment The churning should always be done in the morning the dairy maid will find it advantageous in being at work on churning mornings by five o clock The operation occupies from twenty minutes to half an hour in summer and considerably longer in winter A steady uniform motion is necessary to produce sweet butter neither too quick nor too slow Rapid motion causes the cream to heave and swell from too much air being forced into it the result is a tedious churning and soft bad coloured butter twenty three sixty six In spring and summer when the cow has her natural food no artificial colour is required but in winter under stall feeding the colour is white and tallowy and some persons prefer a higher colour This is communicated by mixing a little finely powdered arnotto with the cream before putting it into the churn a still more natural and delicate colour is communicated by scraping a red carrot into a clean piece of linen cloth dipping it into water and squeezing it into the cream twenty three sixty seven As soon as the butter comes the milk is poured off and the butter put into a shallow wooden tub or bowl full of pure spring water in which it is washed and kneaded pouring off the water and renewing it until it comes away perfectly free from milk Imperfect washing is the frequent cause of bad butter and in nothing is the skill of the dairy maid tested more than in this process moreover it is one in which cleanliness of habits and person are most necessary In this operation we want the aid of Phyllis s neat soft and perfectly clean hand for no mechanical operation can so well squeeze out the sour particles of milk or curd twenty three sixty eight The operations of churning and butter making over the butter milk is disposed of usually in England it goes to the pigs but it is a very wholesome beverage when fresh and some persons like it the disposal therefore will rest with the mistress the dairy maid s duty is to get rid of it She must then scald with boiling water and scrub out every utensil she has used brush out the churn clean out the cream jars which will probably require the use of a little common soda to purify wipe all dry and place them in a position where the sun can reach them for a short time to sweeten them twenty three sixty nine In Devonshire celebrated for its dairy system the milk is always scalded The milk pans which are of tin and contain from ten to twelve quarts after standing ten or twelve hours are placed on a hot plate of iron over a stove until the cream has formed on the surface which is indicated by the air bubbles rising through the milk and producing blisters on the surface coating of cream This indicates its approach to the boiling point and the vessel is now removed to cool When sufficiently that is quite cool the cream is skimmed off with the slice it is now the clouted cream for which Devonshire is so famous It is now placed in the churn and churned until the butter comes which it generally does in a much shorter time than by the other process The butter so made contains more caseine than butter made in the usual way but does not keep so long twenty three seventy It is a question frequently discussed how far it is economical for families to keep cows and make their own butter It is calculated that a good cow costs from May one to October one when well but economically kept Lfive sixteens sixd and from October one to April thirty Lten twos sixd During that time she should produce two hundred twenty seven lbs of butter besides the skimmed milk Of course if new milk and cream are required that will diminish the quantity of butter twenty three seventy one Besides churning and keeping her dairy in order the dairy maid has charge of the whole produce handing it over to the cook butler or housemaid as required and she will do well to keep an exact account both of what she receives and how and when she disposes of it DUTIES OF THE LAUNDRY MAID twenty three seventy two The laundry maid is charged with the duty of washing and getting up the family linen a situation of great importance where the washing is all done at home but in large towns where there is little convenience for bleaching and drying it is chiefly done by professional laundresses and companies who apply mechanical and chemical processes to the purpose These processes however are supposed to injure the fabric of the linen and in many families the fine linen cottons and muslins are washed and got up at home even where the bulk of the washing is given out In country and suburban houses where greater conveniences exist washing at home is more common in country places universal twenty three seventy three The laundry establishment consists of a washing house an ironing and drying room and sometimes a drying closet heated by furnaces The washing house will probably be attached to the kitchen but it is better that it should be completely detached from it and of one story with a funnel or shaft to carry off the steam It will be of a size proportioned to the extent of the washing to be done A range of tubs either round or oblong opposite to and sloping towards the light narrower at the bottom than the top for convenience in stooping over and fixed at a height suited to the convenience of the women using them each tub having a tap for hot and cold water and another in the bottom communicating with the drains for drawing off foul water A boiler and furnace proportioned in size to the wants of the family should also be fixed The flooring should be York stone laid on brick piers with good drainage or asphalte sloping gently towards a gutter connected with the drain twenty three seventy four Adjoining the bleaching house a second room about the same size is required for ironing drying and mangling The contents of this room should comprise an ironing board opposite to the light a strong white deal table about twelve or fourteen feet long and about three and a half feet broad with drawers for ironing blankets a mangle in one corner and clothes horses for drying and airing cupboards for holding the various irons starch and other articles used in ironing a hot plate built in the chimney with furnace beneath it for heating the irons sometimes arranged with a flue for carrying the hot air round the room for drying Where this is the case however there should be a funnel in the ceiling for ventilation and carrying off steam but a better arrangement is to have a hot air closet adjoining heated by hot air pipes and lined with iron with proper arrangements for carrying off steam and clothes horses on castors running in grooves to run into it for drying purposes This leaves the laundry free from unwholesome vapour twenty three seventy five The laundry maid should commence her labours on Monday morning by a careful examination of the articles committed to her care and enter them in the washing book separating the white linen and collars sheets and body linen into one heap fine muslins into another coloured cotton and linen fabrics into a third woollens into a fourth and the coarser kitchen and other greasy cloths into a fifth Every article should be examined for ink or grease spots or for fruit or wine stains Ink spots are removed by dipping the part into hot water and then spreading it smoothly on the hand or on the back of a spoon pouring a few drops of oxalic acid or salts of sorel over the ink spot rubbing and rinsing it in cold water till removed grease spots by rubbing over with yellow soap and rinsing in hot water fruit and wine spots by dipping in a solution of sal ammonia or spirits of wine and rinsing twenty three seventy six Every article having been examined and assorted the sheets and fine linen should be placed in one of the tubs and just covered with lukewarm water in which a little soda has been dissolved and mixed and left there to soak till the morning The greasy cloths and dirtier things should be laid to soak in another tub in a liquor composed of one two lb of unslaked lime to every six quarts of water which has been boiled for two hours then left to settle and strained off when clear Each article should be rinsed in this liquor to wet it thoroughly and left to soak till the morning just covered by it when the things are pressed together Coppers and boilers should now be filled and the fires laid ready to light twenty three seventy seven Early on the following morning the fires should be lighted and as soon as hot water can be procured washing commenced the sheets and body linen being wanted to whiten in the morning should be taken first each article being removed in succession from the lye in which it has been soaking rinsed rubbed and wrung and laid aside until the tub is empty when the foul water is drawn off The tub should be again filled with luke warm water about eighty deg in which the articles should again be plunged and each gone over carefully with soap and rubbed Novices in the art sometimes rub the linen against the skin more experienced washerwomen rub one linen surface against the other which saves their hands and enables them to continue their labour much longer besides economizing time two parts being thus cleaned at once twenty three seventy eight After this first washing the linen should be put into a second water as hot as the hand can bear and again rubbed over in every part examining every part for spots not yet moved which require to be again soaped over and rubbed till thoroughly clean then rinsed and wrung the larger and stronger articles by two of the women the smaller and more delicate articles requiring gentler treatment twenty three seventy nine In order to remove every particle of soap and produce a good colour they should now be placed and boiled for about an hour and a half in the copper in which soda in the proportion of a teaspoonful to every two gallons of water has been dissolved Some very careful laundresses put the linen into a canvas bag to protect it from the scum and the sides of the copper When taken out it should again be rinsed first in clean hot water and then in abundance of cold water slightly tinged with fig blue and again wrung dry It should now be removed from the washing house and hung up to dry or spread out to bleach if there are conveniences for it and the earlier in the day this is done the clearer and whiter will be the linen twenty three eighty Coloured muslins cottons and linens require a milder treatment any application of soda will discharge the colour and soaking all night even in pure water deteriorates the more delicate tints When ready for washing if not too dirty they should be put into cold water and washed very speedily using the common yellow soap which should be rinsed off immediately One article should be washed at a time and rinsed out immediately before any others are wetted When washed thoroughly they should be rinsed in succession in soft water in which common salt has been dissolved in the proportion of a handful to three or four gallons and afterwards wrung gently as soon as rinsed with as little twisting as possible and then hung out to dry Delicate coloured articles should not be exposed to the sun but dried in the shade using clean lines and wooden pegs twenty three eighty one Woollen articles are liable to shrink unless the flannel has been well shrunk before making up This liability is increased where very hot water is used cold water would thus be the best to wash woollens in but as this would not remove the dirt lukewarm water about eighty five deg and yellow soap are recommended When thoroughly washed in this they require a good deal of rinsing in cold water to remove the soap twenty three eighty two Greasy cloths which have soaked all night in the liquid described should be now washed out with soap and water as hot as the hands can bear first in one water and rinsed out in a second and afterwards boiled for two hours in water in which a little soda is dissolved When taken out they should be rinsed in cold water and laid out or hung up to dry twenty three eighty three Silk handkerchiefs require to be washed alone When they contain snuff they should be soaked by themselves in lukewarm water two or three hours they should be rinsed out and put to soak with the others in cold water for an hour or two then washed in lukewarm water being soaped as they are washed If this does not remove all stains they should be washed a second time in similar water and when finished rinsed in soft water in which a handful of common salt has been dissolved In washing stuff or woollen dresses the band at the waist and the lining at the bottom should be removed and wherever it is gathered into folds and in furniture the hems and gatherings A black silk dress if very dirty must be washed but if only soiled soaking for four and twenty hours will do if old and rusty a pint of common spirits should be mixed with each gallon of water which is an improvement under any circumstances Whether soaked or washed it should be hung up to drain and dried without wringing twenty three eighty four Satin and silk ribbons both white and coloured may be cleaned in the same manner twenty three eighty five Silks when washed should be dried in the shade on a linen horse taking care that they are kept smooth and unwrinkled If black or blue they will be improved if laid again on the table when dry and sponged with gin or whiskey or other white spirit twenty three eighty six The operations should be concluded by rinsing the tubs cleaning the coppers scrubbing the floors of the washing house and restoring everything to order and cleanliness twenty three eighty seven Thursday and Friday in a laundry in full employ are usually devoted to mangling starching and ironing twenty three eighty eight Linen cotton and other fabrics after being washed and dried are made smooth and glossy by mangling and by ironing The mangling process which is simply passing them between rollers subjected to a very considerable pressure produced by weight is confined to sheets towels table linen and similar articles which are without folds or plaits Ironing is necessary to smooth body linen and made up articles of delicate texture or gathered into folds The mangle is too well known to need description twenty three eighty nine Ironing The irons consist of the common flat iron which is of different sizes varying from four to ten inches in length triangular in form and from two one two to four one two inches in width at the broad end the oval iron which is used for more delicate articles and the box iron which is hollow and heated by a red hot iron inserted into the box The Italian iron is a hollow tube smooth on the outside and raised on a slender pedestal with a footstalk Into the hollow cylinder a red hot iron is pushed which heats it and the smooth outside of the latter is used on which articles such as frills and plaited articles are drawn Crimping and gauffering machines are used for a kind of plaiting where much regularity is required the articles being passed through two iron rollers fluted so as to represent the kind of plait or fold required twenty three ninety Starching is a process by which stiffness is communicated to certain parts of linen as the collar and front of shirts by dipping them in a paste made of starch boiled in water mixed with a little gum Arabic where extra stiffness is required TO MAKE STARCH twenty three ninety one INGREDIENTS Allow one two pint of cold water and one quart of boiling water to every two tablespoonfuls of starch Mode Put the starch into a tolerably large basin pour over it the cold water and stir the mixture well with a wooden spoon until it is perfectly free from lumps and quite smooth Then take the basin to the fire and whilst the water is actually boiling in the kettle or boiler pour it over the starch stirring it the whole time If made properly in this manner the starch will require no further boiling but should the water not be boiling when added to the starch it will not thicken and must be put into a clean saucepan and stirred over the fire until it boils Take it off the fire strain it into a clean basin cover it up to prevent a skin forming on the top and when sufficiently cool that the hand may be borne in it starch the things Many persons to give a shiny and smooth appearance to the linen when ironed stir round two or three times in the starch a piece of wax candle which also prevents the iron from sticking twenty three ninety two When the things to be starched are washed dried and taken off the lines they should be dipped into the hot starch made as directed squeezed out of it and then just dipped into cold water and immediately squeezed dry If fine things be wrung or roughly used they are very liable to tear so too much care cannot be exercised in this respect If the article is lace clap it between the hands a few times which will assist to clear it then have ready laid out on the table a large clean towel or cloth shake out the starched things lay them on the cloth and roll it up tightly and let it remain for three or fours when the things will be ready to iron twenty three ninety three To be able to iron properly requires much practice and experience Strict cleanliness with all the ironing utensils must be observed as if this is not the case not the most expert ironer will be able to make her things look clear and free from smears c After wiping down her ironing table the laundry maid should place a coarse cloth on it and over that the ironing blanket with her stand and iron rubber and having ascertained that her irons are quite clean and of the right heat she proceeds with her work twenty three ninety four It is a good plan to try the heat of the iron on a coarse cloth or apron before ironing anything fine there is then no danger of scorching For ironing fine things such as collars cuffs muslins and laces there is nothing so clean and nice to use as the box iron the bottom being bright and never placed near the fire it is always perfectly clean it should however be kept in a dry place for fear of its rusting Gauffering tongs or irons must be placed in a clear fire for a minute then withdrawn wiped with a coarse rubber and the heat of them tried on a piece of paper as unless great care is taken these will very soon scorch twenty three ninety five The skirts of muslin dresses should be ironed on a skirt board covered with flannel and the fronts of shirts on a smaller board also covered with flannel this board being placed between the back and front twenty three ninety six After things are mangled they should also be ironed in the folds and gathers dinner napkins smoothed over as also table cloths pillow cases and sometimes sheets The bands of flannel petticoats and shoulder straps to flannel waistcoats must also undergo the same process UPPER AND UNDER NURSEMAIDS twenty three ninety seven The nursery is of great importance in every family and in families of distinction where there are several young children it is an establishment kept apart from the rest of the family under the charge of an upper nurse assisted by under nursery maids proportioned to the work to be done The responsible duties of upper nursemaid commence with the weaning of the child it must now be separated from the mother or wet nurse at least for a time and the cares of the nursemaid which have hitherto been only occasionally put in requisition are now to be entirely devoted to the infant She washes dresses and feeds it walks out with it and regulates all its little wants and even at this early age many good qualities are required to do so in a satisfactory manner Patience and good temper are indispensable qualities truthfulness purity of manners minute cleanliness and docility and obedience almost equally so She ought also to be acquainted with the art of ironing and trimming little caps and be handy with her needle twenty three ninety eight There is a considerable art in carrying an infant comfortably for itself and for the nursemaid If she carry it always seated upright on her arm and presses it too closely against her chest the stomach of the child is apt to get compressed and the back fatigued For her own comfort a good nurse will frequently vary this position by changing from one arm to the other and sometimes by laying it across both raising the head a little When teaching it to walk and guiding it by the hand she should change the hand from time to time so as to avoid raising one shoulder higher than the other This is the only way in which a child should be taught to walk leading strings and other foolish inventions which force an infant to make efforts with its shoulders and head forward before it knows how to use its limbs will only render it feeble and retard its progress twenty three ninety nine Most children have some bad habit of which they must be broken but this is never accomplished by harshness without developing worse evils kindness perseverance and patience in the nurse are here of the utmost importance When finger sucking is one of these habits the fingers are sometimes rubbed with bitter aloes or some equally disagreeable substance Others have dirty habits which are only to be changed by patience perseverance and above all by regularity in the nurse She should never be permitted to inflict punishment on these occasions or indeed on any occasion But if punishment is to be avoided it is still more necessary that all kinds of indulgences and flattery be equally forbidden Yielding to all the whims of a child picking up its toys when thrown away in mere wantonness would be intolerable A child should never be led to think others inferior to it to beat a dog or even the stone against which it falls as some children are taught to do by silly nurses Neither should the nurse affect or show alarm at any of the little accidents which must inevitably happen if it falls treat it as a trifle otherwise she encourages a spirit of cowardice and timidity But she will take care that such accidents are not of frequent occurrence or the result of neglect twenty four hundred The nurse should keep the child as clean as possible and particularly she should train it to habits of cleanliness so that it should feel uncomfortable when otherwise watching especially that it does not soil itself in eating At the same time vanity in its personal appearance is not to be encouraged by over care in this respect or by too tight lacing or buttoning of dresses nor a small foot cultivated by the use of tight shoes twenty four oh one Nursemaids would do well to repeat to the parents faithfully and truly the defects they observe in the dispositions of very young children If properly checked in time evil propensities may be eradicated but this should not extend to anything but serious defects otherwise the intuitive perceptions which all children possess will construe the act into spying and informing which should never be resorted to in the case of children nor indeed in any case twenty four oh two Such are the cares which devolve upon the nursemaid and it is her duty to fulfil them personally In large establishments she will have assistants proportioned to the number of children of which she has the care The under nursemaid lights the fires sweeps scours and dusts the rooms and makes the beds empties slops and carries up water brings up and removes the nursery meals washes and dresses all the children except the infant and assists in mending Where there is a nursery girl to assist she does the rougher part of the cleaning and all take their meals in the nursery together after the children of the family have done twenty four oh three In smaller families where there is only one nursemaid kept she is assisted by the housemaid or servant of all work who will do the rougher part of the work and carry up the nursery meals In such circumstances she will be more immediately under the eye of her mistress who will probably relieve her from some of the cares of the infant In higher families the upper nurse is usually permitted to sup or dine occasionally at the housekeeper s table by way of relaxation when the children are all well and her subordinates trustworthy twenty four oh four Where the nurse has the entire charge of the nursery and the mother is too much occupied to do more than pay a daily visit to it it is desirable that she be a person of observation and possess some acquaintance with the diseases incident to childhood as also with such simple remedies as may be useful before a medical attendant can be procured or where such attendance is not considered necessary All these little ailments are preceded by symptoms so minute as to be only perceptible to close observation such as twitching of the brows restless sleep grinding the gums and in some inflammatory diseases even to the child abstaining from crying from fear of the increased pain produced by the movement Dentition or cutting the teeth is attended with many of these symptoms Measles thrush scarlatina croup hooping cough and other childish complaints are all preceded by well known symptoms which may be alleviated and rendered less virulent by simple remedies instantaneously applied twenty four oh five Dentition is usually the first serious trouble bringing many other disorders in its train The symptoms are most perceptible to the mother the child sucks feebly and with gums hot inflamed and swollen In this case relief is yielded by rubbing them from time to time with a little of missus Johnson s soothing syrup a valuable and perfectly safe medicine Selfish and thoughtless nurses and mothers too sometimes give cordials and sleeping draughts whose effects are too well known twenty four oh six Convulsion Fits sometimes follow the feverish restlessness produced by these causes in which case a hot bath should be administered without delay and the lower parts of the body rubbed the bath being as hot as it can be without scalding the tender skin at the same time the doctor should be sent for immediately for no nurse should administer medicine in this case unless the fits have been repeated and the doctor has left directions with her how to act twenty four oh seven Croup is one of the most alarming diseases of childhood it is accompanied with a hoarse croaking ringing cough and comes on very suddenly and most so in strong robust children A very hot bath should be instantly administered followed by an emetic either in the form of tartar emetic croup powder or a teaspoonful of ipecacuanha wrapping the body warmly up in flannel after the bath The slightest delay in administering the bath or the emetic may be fatal hence the importance of nurses about very young children being acquainted with the symptoms twenty four oh eight Hooping Cough is generally preceded by the moaning noise during sleep which even adults threatened with the disorder cannot avoid it is followed by violent fits of coughing which little can be done to relieve A child attacked by this disorder should be kept as much as possible in the fresh pure air but out of draughts and kept warm and supplied with plenty of nourishing food Many fatal diseases flow from this scourge of childhood and a change to purer air if possible should follow convalescence twenty four oh nine Worms are the torment of some children the symptoms are an unnatural craving for food even after a full meal costiveness suddenly followed by the reverse fetid breath a livid circle under the eyes enlarged abdomen and picking the nose for which the remedies must be prescribed by the doctor twenty four ten Measles and Scarlatina much resemble each other in their early stages headache restlessness and fretfulness are the symptoms of both Shivering fits succeeded by a hot skin pains in the back and limbs accompanied by sickness and in severe cases sore throat pain about the jaws difficulty in swallowing running at the eyes which become red and inflamed while the face is hot and flushed often distinguish scarlatina and scarlet fever of which it is only a mild form twenty four eleven While the case is doubtful a dessert spoonful of spirit of nitre diluted in water given at bedtime will throw the child into a gentle perspiration and will bring out the rash in either case In measles this appears first on the face in scarlatina on the chest and in both cases a doctor should be called in In scarlatina tartar emetic powder or ipecacuanha may be administered in the mean time twenty four twelve In all cases cleanliness fresh air clean utensils and frequent washing of the person both of nurse and children are even more necessary in the nursery than in either drawing room or sick room inasmuch as the delicate organs of childhood are more susceptible of injury from smells and vapours than adults twenty four thirteen It may not be out of place if we conclude this brief notice of the duties of a nursemaid by an extract from Florence Nightingale s admirable Notes on Nursing Referring to children she says twenty four fourteen They are much more susceptible than grown people to all noxious influences They are affected by the same things but much more quickly and seriously by want of fresh air of proper warmth want of cleanliness in house clothes bedding or body by improper food want of punctuality by dulness by want of light by too much or too little covering in bed or when up And all this in health and then she quotes a passage from a lecture on sudden deaths in infancy to show the importance of careful nursing of children In the great majority of instances when death suddenly befalls the infant or young child it is an accident it is not a necessary inevitable result of any disease That which is known to injure children most seriously is foul air keeping the rooms where they sleep closely shut up is destruction to them and if the child s breathing be disordered by disease a few hours only of such foul air may endanger its life even where no inconvenience is felt by grown up persons in the room twenty four fifteen Persons moving in the beat society will see after perusing Miss Nightingale s book that this foul air want of light too much or too little clothing and improper food is not confined to Crown Street or saint Giles s that Belgravia and the squares have their north room where the rays of the sun never reach A wooden bedstead two or three mattresses piled up to above the height of the table a vallance attached to the frame nothing but a miracle could ever thoroughly dry or air such a bed and bedding is the ordinary bed of a private house than which nothing can be more unwholesome Don t treat your children like sick she sums up don t dose them with tea Let them eat meat and drink milk or half a glass of light beer Give them fresh light sunny and open rooms cool bedrooms plenty of outdoor exercise facing even the cold and wind and weather in sufficiently warm clothes and with sufficient exercise plenty of amusements and play more liberty and less schooling and cramming and training more attention to food and less to physic DUTIES OF THE SICK NURSE twenty four sixteen All women are likely at some period of their lives to be called on to perform the duties of a sick nurse and should prepare themselves as much as possible by observation and reading for the occasion when they may be required to perform the office The main requirements are good temper compassion for suffering sympathy with sufferers which most women worthy of the name possess neat handedness quiet manners love of order and cleanliness With these qualifications there will be very little to be wished for the desire to relieve suffering will inspire a thousand little attentions and surmount the disgusts which some of the offices attending the sick room are apt to create Where serious illness visits a household and protracted nursing is likely to become necessary a professional nurse will probably be engaged who has been trained to its duties but in some families and those not a few let us hope the ladies of the family would oppose such an arrangement as a failure of duty on their part There is besides even when a professional nurse is ultimately called in a period of doubt and hesitation while disease has not yet developed itself when the patient must be attended to and in these cases some of the female servants of the establishment must give their attendance in the sick room There are also slight attacks of cold influenza and accidents in a thousand forms to which all are subject where domestic nursing becomes a necessity where disease though unattended with danger is nevertheless accompanied by the nervous irritation incident to illness and when all the attention of the domestic nurse becomes necessary twenty four seventeen In the first stage of sickness while doubt and a little perplexity hang over the household as to the nature of the sickness there are some things about which no doubt can exist the patient s room must be kept in a perfectly pure state and arrangements made for proper attendance for the first canon of nursing according to Florence Nightingale its apostle is to keep the air the patient breathes as pure as the external air without chilling him This can be done without any preparation which might alarm the patient with proper windows open fireplaces and a supply of fuel the room may be as fresh as it is outside and kept at a temperature suitable for the patient s state twenty four eighteen Windows however must be opened from above and not from below and draughts avoided cool air admitted beneath the patient s head chills the lower strata and the floor The careful nurse will keep the door shut when the window is open she will also take care that the patient is not placed between the door and the open window nor between the open fireplace and the window If confined to bed she will see that the bed is placed in a thoroughly ventilated part of the room but out of the current of air which is produced by the momentary opening of doors as well as out of the line of draught between the window and the open chimney and that the temperature of the room is kept about sixty four deg Where it is necessary to admit air by the door the windows should be closed but there are few circumstances in which good air can be obtained through the chamber door through it on the contrary the gases generated in the lower parts of the house are likely to be drawn into the invalid chamber twenty four nineteen These precautions taken and plain nourishing diet such as the patient desires furnished probably little more can be done unless more serious symptoms present themselves in which case medical advice will be sought twenty four twenty Under no circumstances is ventilation of the sick room so essential as in cases of febrile diseases usually considered infectious such as typhus and puerperal fevers influenza hooping cough small and chicken pox scarlet fever measles and erysipelas all these are considered communicable through the air but there is little danger of infection being thus communicated provided the room is kept thoroughly ventilated On the contrary if this essential be neglected the power of infection is greatly increased and concentrated in the confined and impure air it settles upon the clothes of the attendants and visitors especially where they are of wool and is frequently communicated to other families in this manner twenty four twenty one Under all circumstances therefore the sick room should be kept as fresh and sweet as the open air while the temperature is kept up by artificial heat taking care that the fire burns clear and gives out no smoke into the room that the room is perfectly clean wiped over with a damp cloth every day if boarded and swept after sprinkling with damp tea leaves or other aromatic leaves if carpeted that all utensils are emptied and cleaned as soon as used and not once in four and twenty hours as is sometimes done A slop pail Miss Nightingale says should never enter a sick room everything should be carried direct to the water closet emptied there and brought up clean in the best hospitals the slop pail is unknown I do not approve says Miss Nightingale of making housemaids of nurses that would be waste of means but I have seen surgical sisters women whose hands were worth to them two or three guineas a week down on their knees scouring a room or hut because they thought it was not fit for their patients these women had the true nurse spirit twenty four twenty two Bad smells are sometimes met by sprinkling a little liquid chloride of lime on the floor fumigation by burning pastiles is also a common expedient for the purification of the sick room They are useful but only in the sense hinted at by the medical lecturer who commenced his lecture thus Fumigations gentlemen are of essential importance they make so abominable a smell that they compel you to open the windows and admit fresh air In this sense they are useful but ineffectual unless the cause be removed and fresh air admitted twenty four twenty three The sick room should be quiet no talking no gossiping and above all no whispering this is absolute cruelty to the patient he thinks his complaint the subject and strains his ear painfully to catch the sound No rustling of dresses nor creaking shoes either where the carpets are taken up the nurse should wear list shoes or some other noiseless material and her dress should be of soft material that does not rustle Miss Nightingale denounces crinoline and quotes Lord Melbourne on the subject of women in the sick room who said I would rather have men about me when ill than women it requires very strong health to put up with women Ungrateful man but absolute quiet is necessary in the sick room twenty four twenty four Never let the patient be waked out of his first sleep by noise never roused by anything like a surprise Always sit in the apartment so that the patient has you in view and that it is not necessary for him to turn in speaking to you Never keep a patient standing never speak to one while moving Never lean on the sick bed Above all be calm and decisive with the patient and prevent all noises over head twenty four twenty five A careful nurse when a patient leaves his bed will open the sheets wide and throw the clothes back so as thoroughly to air the bed She will avoid drying or airing anything damp in the sick room twenty four twenty six It is another fallacy says Florence Nightingale to suppose that night air is injurious a great authority told me that in London the air is never so good as after ten o clock when smoke has diminished but then it must be air from without not within and not air vitiated by gaseous airs A great fallacy prevails also she says in another section about flowers poisoning the air of the sick room no one ever saw them over crowding the sick room but if they did they actually absorb carbonic acid and give off oxygen Cut flowers also decompose water and produce oxygen gas Lilies and some other very odorous plants may perhaps give out smells unsuited to a close room while the atmosphere of the sick room should always be fresh and natural twenty four twenty seven Patients says Miss Nightingale are sometimes starved in the midst of plenty from want of attention to the ways which alone make it possible for them to take food A spoonful of beef tea or arrowroot and wine or some other light nourishing diet should be given every hour for the patient s stomach will reject large supplies In very weak patients there is often a nervous difficulty in swallowing which is much increased if food is not ready and presented at the moment when it is wanted the nurse should be able to discriminate and know when this moment is approaching twenty four twenty eight Diet suitable for patients will depend in some degree on their natural likes and dislikes which the nurse will do well to acquaint herself with Beef tea is useful and relishing but possesses little nourishment when evaporated it presents a teaspoonful of solid meat to a pint of water Eggs are not equivalent to the same weight of meat Arrowroot is less nourishing than flour Butter is the lightest and most digestible kind of fat Cream in some diseases cannot be replaced But to sum up with some of Miss Nightingale s useful maxims Observation is the nurse s best guide and the patient s appetite the rule Half a pint of milk is equal to a quarter of a pound of meat Beef tea is the least nourishing food administered to the sick and tea and coffee she thinks are both too much excluded from the sick room THE MONTHLY NURSE twenty four twenty nine The choice of a monthly nurse is of the utmost importance and in the case of a young mother with her first child it would be well for her to seek advice and counsel from her more experienced relatives in this matter In the first place the engaging a monthly nurse in good time is of the utmost importance as if she be competent and clever her services will be sought months beforehand a good nurse having seldom much of her time disengaged There are some qualifications which it is evident the nurse should possess she should be scrupulously clean and tidy in her person honest sober and noiseless in her movements should possess a natural love for children and have a strong nerve in case of emergencies Snuff taking and spirit drinking must not be included in her habits but these are happily much less frequent than they were in former days twenty four thirty Receiving as she often will instructions from the doctor she should bear these in mind and carefully carry them out In those instances where she does not feel herself sufficiently informed she should ask advice from the medical man and not take upon herself to administer medicines c without his knowledge twenty four thirty one A monthly nurse should be between thirty and fifty years of age sufficiently old to have had a little experience and yet not too old or infirm to be able to perform various duties requiring strength and bodily vigour She should be able to wake the moment she is called at any hour of the night that the mother or child may have their wants immediately attended to Good temper united to a kind and gentle disposition is indispensable and although the nurse will frequently have much to endure from the whims and caprices of the invalid she should make allowances for these and command her temper at the same time exerting her authority when it is necessary twenty four thirty two What the nurse has to do in the way of cleaning and dusting her lady s room depends entirely on the establishment that is kept Where there are plenty of servants the nurse of course has nothing whatever to do but attend on her patient and ring the bell for anything she may require Where the number of domestics is limited she should not mind keeping her room in order that is to say sweeping and dusting it every morning If fires be necessary the housemaid should always clean the grate and do all that is wanted in that way as this being rather dirty work would soil the nurse s dress and unfit her to approach the bed or take the infant without soiling its clothes In small establishments too the nurse should herself fetch things she may require and not ring every time she wants anything and she must of course not leave her invalid unless she sees everything is comfortable and then only for a few minutes When down stairs and in company with the other servants the nurse should not repeat what she may have heard in her lady s room as much mischief may be done by a gossiping nurse As in most houses the monthly nurse is usually sent for a few days before her services may be required she should see that all is in readiness that there be no bustle and hurry at the time the confinement takes place She should keep two pairs of sheets thoroughly aired as well as night dresses flannels c c All the things which will be required to dress the baby the first time should be laid in the basket in readiness in the order in which they are to be put on as well as scissors thread a few pieces of soft linen rag and two or three flannel squares If a berceaunette is to be used immediately the nurse should ascertain that the mattresses pillow c are all well aired and if not already done before she arrives she should assist in covering and trimming it ready for the little occupant A monthly nurse should be handy at her needle as if she is in the house some time before the baby is born she will require some work of this sort to occupy her time She should also understand the making up of little caps although we can scarcely say this is one of the nurse s duties As most children wear no caps except out of doors her powers in this way will not be much taxed twenty four thirty three A nurse should endeavour to make her room as cheerful as possible and always keep it clean and tidy She should empty the chamber utensils as soon as used and on no account put things under the bed Soiled baby s napkins should be rolled up and put into a pan when they should be washed out every morning and hung out to dry they are then in a fit state to send to the laundress and should on no account be left dirty but done every morning in this way The bedroom should be kept rather dark particularly for the first week or ten days of a regular temperature and as free as possible from draughts at the same time well ventilated and free from unpleasant smells twenty four thirty four The infant during the month must not be exposed to strong light or much air and in carrying it about the passages stairs c the nurse should always have its head flannel on to protect the eyes and ears from the currents of air For the management of children we must refer our readers to the following chapters and we need only say in conclusion that a good nurse should understand the symptoms of various ills incident to this period as in all cases prevention is better than cure As young mothers with their first baby are very often much troubled at first with their breasts the nurse should understand the art of emptying them by suction or some other contrivance If the breasts are kept well drawn there will be but little danger of inflammation and as the infant at first cannot take all that is necessary something must be done to keep the inflammation down This is one of the greatest difficulties a nurse has to contend with and we can only advise her to be very persevering to rub the breasts well and to let the infant suck as soon and as often as possible until they get in proper order THE WET NURSE twenty four thirty five We are aware that according to the opinion of some ladies there is no domestic theme during a certain period of their married lives more fraught with vexation and disquietude than that ever fruitful source of annoyance the Nurse but as we believe there are thousands of excellent wives and mothers who pass through life without even a temporary embroglio in the kitchen or suffering a state of moral hectic the whole time of a nurse s empire in the nursery or bedroom Our own experience goes to prove that although many unqualified persons palm themselves off on ladies as fully competent for the duties they so rashly and dishonestly undertake to perform and thus expose themselves to ill will and merited censure there are still very many fully equal to the legitimate exercise of what they undertake and if they do not in every case give entire satisfaction some of the fault and sometimes a great deal of it may be honestly placed to the account of the ladies themselves who in many instances are so impressed with the propriety of their own method of performing everything as to insist upon the adoption of their system in preference to that of the nurse whose plan is probably based on a comprehensive forethought and rendered perfect in all its details by an ample experience twenty four thirty six In all our remarks on this subject we should remember with gentleness the order of society from which our nurses are drawn and that those who make their duty a study and are termed professional nurses have much to endure from the caprice and egotism of their employers while others are driven to the occupation from the laudable motive of feeding their own children and who in fulfilling that object are too often both selfish and sensual performing without further interest than is consistent with their own advantage the routine of customary duties twenty four thirty seven Properly speaking there are two nurses the nurse for the mother and the nurse for the child or the monthly and the wet nurse Of the former we have already spoken and will now proceed to describe the duties of the latter and add some suggestions as to her age physical health and moral conduct subjects of the utmost importance as far as the charge intrusted to her is concerned and therefore demanding some special remarks twenty four thirty eight When from illness suppression of the milk accident or some natural process the mother is deprived of the pleasure of rearing her infant it becomes necessary at once to look around for a fitting substitute so that the child may not suffer by any needless delay a physical loss by the deprivation of its natural food The first consideration should be as regards age state of health and temper twenty four thirty nine The age if possible should not be less than twenty nor exceed thirty years with the health sound in every respect and the body free from all eruptive disease or local blemish The best evidence of a sound state of health will be found in the woman s clear open countenance the ruddy tone of the skin the full round and elastic state of the breasts and especially in the erectile firm condition of the nipple which in all unhealthy states of the body is pendulous flabby and relaxed in which case the milk is sure to be imperfect in its organization and consequently deficient in its nutrient qualities Appetite is another indication of health in the suckling nurse or mother for it is impossible a woman can feed her child without having a corresponding appetite and though inordinate craving for food is neither desirable nor necessary a natural vigour should be experienced at meal times and the food taken should be anticipated and enjoyed twenty four forty Besides her health the moral state of the nurse is to be taken into account or that mental discipline or principle of conduct which would deter the nurse from at any time gratifying her own pleasures and appetites at the cost or suffering of her infant charge twenty four forty one The conscientiousness and good faith that would prevent a nurse so acting are unfortunately very rare and many nurses rather than forego the enjoyment of a favourite dish though morally certain of the effect it will have on the child will on the first opportunity feed with avidity on fried meats cabbage cucumbers pickles or other crude and injurious aliments in defiance of all orders given or confidence reposed in their word good sense and humanity And when the infant is afterwards racked with pain and a night of disquiet alarms the mother the doctor is sent for and the nurse covering her dereliction by a falsehood the consequence of her gluttony is treated as a disease and the poor infant is dosed for some days with medicines that can do it but little if any good and in all probability materially retard its physical development The selfish nurse in her ignorance believes too that as long as she experiences no admonitory symptoms herself the child cannot suffer and satisfied that whatever is the cause of its screams and plunges neither she nor what she had eaten had anything to do with it with this flattering assurance at her heart she watches her opportunity and has another luxurious feast off the proscribed dainties till the increasing disturbance in the child s health or treachery from the kitchen opens the eyes of mother and doctor to the nurse s unprincipled conduct In all such cases the infant should be spared the infliction of medicine and as a wholesome corrective to herself and relief to her charge a good sound dose administered to the nurse twenty four forty two Respecting the diet of the wet nurse the first point of importance is to fix early and definite hours for every meal and the mother should see that no cause is ever allowed to interfere with their punctuality The food itself should be light easy of digestion and simple Boiled or roast meat with bread and potatoes with occasionally a piece of sago rice or tapioca pudding should constitute the dinner the only meal that requires special comment broths green vegetables and all acid or salt foods must be avoided Fresh fish once or twice a week may be taken but it is hardly sufficiently nutritious to be often used as a meal If the dinner is taken early at one o clock there will be no occasion for luncheon which too often to the injury of the child is made the cover for a first dinner Half a pint of stout with a Reading biscuit at eleven o clock will be abundantly sufficient between breakfast at eight and a good dinner with a pint of porter at one o clock About eight o clock in the evening half a pint of stout with another biscuit may be taken and for supper at ten or half past a pint of porter with a slice of toast or a small amount of bread and cheese may conclude the feeding for the day twenty four forty three Animal food once in twenty four hours is quite sufficient All spirits unless in extreme cases should be avoided and wine is still more seldom needed With a due quantity of plain digestible food and the proportion of stout and porter ordered with early hours and regularity the nurse will not only be strong and healthy herself but fully capable of rearing a child in health and strength There are two points all mothers who are obliged to employ wet nurses should remember and be on their guard against The first is never to allow a nurse to give medicine to the infant on her own authority many have such an infatuated idea of the healing excellence of castor oil that they would administer a dose of this disgusting grease twice a week and think they had done a meritorious service to the child The next point is to watch carefully lest to insure a night s sleep for herself she does not dose the infant with Godfrey s cordial syrup of poppies or some narcotic potion to insure tranquillity to the one and give the opportunity of sleep to the other The fact that scores of nurses keep secret bottles of these deadly syrups for the purpose of stilling their charges is notorious and that many use them to a fearful extent is sufficiently patent to all twenty four forty four It therefore behoves the mother while obliged to trust to a nurse to use her best discretion to guard her child from the unprincipled treatment of the person she must to a certain extent depend upon and trust and to remember in all cases rather than resort to castor oil or sedatives to consult a medical man for her infant in preference to following the counsel of her nurse THE REARING MANAGEMENT AND DISEASES OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD CHAPTER XLII Physiology of Life as illustrated by Respiration Circulation and Digestion twenty four forty five The infantine management of children like the mother s love for her offspring seems to be born with the child and to be a direct intelligence of Nature It may thus at first sight appear as inconsistent and presumptuous to tell a woman how to rear her infant as to instruct her in the manner of loving it Yet though Nature is unquestionably the best nurse Art makes so admirable a foster mother that no sensible woman in her novitiate of parent would refuse the admonitions of art or the teachings of experience to consummate her duties of nurse It is true that in a civilized state of society few young wives reach the epoch that makes them mothers without some insight traditional or practical into the management of infants consequently the cases wherein a woman is left to her own unaided intelligence or what in such a case may be called instinct and obliged to trust to the promptings of nature alone for the well being of her child are very rare indeed Again every woman is not gifted with the same physical ability for the harassing duties of a mother and though Nature as a general rule has endowed all female creation with the attributes necessary to that most beautiful and at the same time holiest function the healthy rearing of their offspring the cases are sufficiently numerous to establish the exception where the mother is either physically or socially incapacitated from undertaking these most pleasing duties herself and where consequently she is compelled to trust to adventitious aid for those natural benefits which are at once the mother s pride and delight to render to her child twenty four forty six In these cases when obliged to call in the services of hired assistance she must trust the dearest obligation of her life to one who from her social sphere has probably notions of rearing children diametrically opposed to the preconceived ideas of the mother and at enmity with all her sentiments of right and prejudices of position twenty four forty seven It has justly been said we think by Hood that the children of the poor are not brought up but dragged up However facetious this remark may seem there is much truth in it and that children reared in the reeking dens of squalor and poverty live at all is an apparent anomaly in the course of things that at first sight would seem to set the laws of sanitary provision at defiance and make it appear a perfect waste of time to insist on pure air and exercise as indispensable necessaries of life and especially so as regards infantine existence twenty four forty eight We see elaborate care bestowed on a family of children everything studied that can tend to their personal comfort pure air pure water regular ablution a dietary prescribed by art and every precaution adopted that medical judgment and maternal love can dictate for the well being of the parents hope and find in despite of all this care and vigilance disease and death invading the guarded treasure We turn to the foetor and darkness that in some obscure court attend the robust brood who coated in dirt and with mud and refuse for playthings live and thrive and grow into manhood and in contrast to the pale face and flabby flesh of the aristocratic child exhibit strength vigour and well developed frames and our belief in the potency of the life giving elements of air light and cleanliness receives a shock that at first sight would appear fatal to the implied benefits of these in reality all sufficient attributes of health and life twenty four forty nine But as we must enter more largely on this subject hereafter we shall leave its consideration for the present and return to what we were about to say respecting trusting to others aid in the rearing of children Here it is that the young and probably inexperienced mother may find our remarks not only an assistance but a comfort to her in as far as knowing the simplest and best system to adopt she may be able to instruct another and see that her directions are fully carried out twenty four fifty The human body materially considered is a beautiful piece of mechanism consisting of many parts each one being the centre of a system and performing its own vital function irrespectively of the others and yet dependent for its vitality upon the harmony and health of the whole It is in fact to a certain extent like a watch which when once wound up and set in motion will continue its function of recording true time only so long as every wheel spring and lever performs its allotted duty and at its allotted time or till the limit that man s ingenuity has placed to its existence as a moving automaton has been reached or in other words till it has run down twenty four fifty one What the key is to the mechanical watch air is to the physical man Once admit air into the mouth and nostrils and the lungs expand the heart beats the blood rushes to the remotest part of the body the mouth secretes saliva to soften and macerate the food the liver forms its bile to separate the nutriment from the digested aliment the kidneys perform their office the eye elaborates its tears to facilitate motion and impart that glistening to the orb on which depends so much of its beauty and a dewy moisture exudes from the skin protecting the body from the extremes of heat and cold and sharpening the perception of touch and feeling At the same instant and in every part the arteries like innumerable bees are everywhere laying down layers of muscle bones teeth and in fact like the coral zoophyte building up a continent of life and matter while the veins equally busy are carrying away the debris and refuse collected from where the zoophyte arteries are building this refuse in its turn being conveyed to the liver there to be converted into bile twenty four fifty two All these and they are but a few of the vital actions constantly taking place are the instant result of one gasp of life giving air No subject can be fraught with greater interest than watching the first spark of life as it courses with electric speed through all the gates and alleys of the soft insensate body of the infant The effect of air on the new born child is as remarkable in its results as it is wonderful in its consequence but to understand this more intelligibly it must first be remembered that life consists of the performance of three vital functions RESPIRATION CIRCULATION and DIGESTION The lungs digest the air taking from it its most nutritious element the oxygen to give to the impoverished blood that circulates through them The stomach digests the food and separates the nutriment chyle from the aliment which it gives to the blood for the development of the frame and the blood which is understood by the term circulation digests in its passage through the lungs the nutriment chyle to give it quantity and quality and the oxygen from the air to give it vitality Hence it will be seen that speaking generally the three vital functions resolve themselves into one DIGESTION and that the lungs are the primary and the most important of the vital organs and respiration the first in fact as we all know it is the last in deed of all the functions performed by the living body THE LUNGS RESPIRATION twenty four fifty three The first effect of air on the infant is a slight tremor about the lips and angles of the mouth increasing to twitchings and finally to a convulsive contraction of the lips and cheeks the consequence of sudden cold to the nerves of the face This spasmodic action produces a gasp causing the air to rush through the mouth and nostrils and enter the windpipe and upper portion of the flat and contracted lungs which like a sponge partly immersed in water immediately expand This is succeeded by a few faint sobs or pants by which larger volumes of air are drawn into the chest till after a few seconds and when a greater bulk of the lungs has become inflated the breast bone and ribs rise the chest expands and with a sudden start the infant gives utterance to a succession of loud sharp cries which have the effect of filling every cell of the entire organ with air and life To the anxious mother the first voice of her child is doubtless the sweetest music she ever heard and the more loudly it peals the greater should be her joy as it is an indication of health and strength and not only shows the perfect expansion of the lungs but that the process of life has set in with vigour Having welcomed in its own existence like the morning bird with a shrill note of gladness the infant ceases its cry and after a few short sobs usually subsides into sleep or quietude twenty four fifty four At the same instant that the air rushes into the lungs the valve or door between the two sides of the heart and through which the blood had previously passed is closed and hermetically sealed and the blood taking a new course bounds into the lungs now expanded with air and which we have likened to a wetted sponge to which they bear a not unapt affinity air being substituted for water It here receives the oxygen from the atmosphere and the chyle or white blood from the digested food and becomes in an instant arterial blood a vital principle from which every solid and fluid of the body is constructed Besides the lungs Nature has provided another respiratory organ a sort of supplemental lung that as well as being a covering to the body in spires air and ex pires moisture this is the cuticle or skin and so intimate is the connection between the skin and lungs that whatever injures the first is certain to affect the latter twenty four fifty five Hence the difficulty of breathing experienced after scalds or burns on the cuticle the cough that follows the absorption of cold or damp by the skin the oppressed and laborious breathing experienced by children in all eruptive diseases while the rash is coming to the surface and the hot dry skin that always attends congestion of the lungs and fever twenty four fifty six The great practical advantage derivable from this fact is the knowledge that whatever relieves the one benefits the other Hence too the great utility of hot baths in all affections of the lungs or diseases of the skin and the reason why exposure to cold or wet is in nearly all cases followed by tightness of the chest sore throat difficulty of breathing and cough These symptoms are the consequence of a larger quantity of blood than is natural remaining in the lungs and the cough is a mere effort of Nature to throw off the obstruction caused by the presence of too much blood in the organ of respiration The hot bath by causing a larger amount of blood to rush suddenly to the skin has the effect of relieving the lungs of their excess of blood and by equalizing the circulation and promoting perspiration from the cuticle affords immediate and direct benefit both to the lungs and the system at large THE STOMACH DIGESTION twenty four fifty seven The organs that either directly or indirectly contribute to the process of digestion are the mouth teeth tongue and gullet the stomach small intestines the pancreas the salivary glands and the liver Next to respiration digestion is the chief function in the economy of life as without the nutritious fluid digested from the aliment there would be nothing to supply the immense and constantly recurring waste of the system caused by the activity with which the arteries at all periods but especially during infancy and youth are building up the frame and developing the body In infancy the period of which our present subject treats the series of parts engaged in the process of digestion may be reduced simply to the stomach and liver or rather its secretion the bile The stomach is a thick muscular bag connected above with the gullet and at its lower extremity with the commencement of the small intestines The duty or function of the stomach is to secrete from the arteries spread over its inner surface a sharp acid liquid called the gastric juice this with a due mixture of saliva softens dissolves and gradually digests the food or contents of the stomach reducing the whole into a soft pulpy mass which then passes into the first part of the small intestines where it comes in contact with the bile from the gall bladder which immediately separates the digested food into two parts one is a white creamy fluid called chyle and the absolute concentration of all nourishment which is taken up by proper vessels and as we have before said carried directly to the heart to be made blood of and vitalized in the lungs and thus provide for the wear and tear of the system It must be here observed that the stomach can only digest solids for fluids being incapable of that process can only be absorbed and without the result of digestion animal at least human life could not exist Now as Nature has ordained that infantine life shall be supported on liquid aliment and as without a digestion the body would perish some provision was necessary to meet this difficulty and that provision was found in the nature of the liquid itself or in other words THE MILK The process of making cheese or fresh curds and whey is familiar to most persons but as it is necessary to the elucidation of our subject we will briefly repeat it The internal membrane or the lining coat of a calf s stomach having been removed from the organ is hung up like a bladder to dry when required a piece is cut off put in a jug a little warm water poured upon it and after a few hours it is fit for use the liquid so made being called rennet A little of this rennet poured into a basin of warm milk at once coagulates the greater part and separates from it a quantity of thin liquor called whey This is precisely the action that takes place in the infant s stomach after every supply from the breast The cause is the same in both cases the acid of the gastric juice in the infant s stomach immediately converting the milk into a soft cheese It is gastric juice adhering to the calf s stomach and drawn out by the water forming rennet that makes the curds in the basin The cheesy substance being a solid at once undergoes the process of digestion is separated into chyle by the bile and in a few hours finds its way to the infant s heart to become blood and commence the architecture of its little frame This is the simple process of a baby s digestion milk converted into cheese cheese into chyle chyle into blood and blood into flesh bone and tegument how simple is the cause but how sublime and wonderful are the effects twenty four fifty eight We have described the most important of the three functions that take place in the infant s body respiration and digestion the third namely circulation we hardly think it necessary to enter on not being called for by the requirements of the nurse and mother so we shall omit its notice and proceed from theoretical to more practical considerations Children of weakly constitutions are just as likely to be born of robust parents and those who earn their bread by toil as the offspring of luxury and affluence and indeed it is against the ordinary providence of Nature to suppose the children of the hardworking and necessitous to be hardier and more vigorous than those of parents blessed with ease and competence twenty four fifty nine All children come into the world in the same imploring helplessness with the same general organization and wants and demanding either from the newly awakened mother s love or from the memory of motherly feeling in the nurse or the common appeals of humanity in those who undertake the earliest duties of an infant the same assistance and protection and the same fostering care THE INFANT twenty four sixty We have already described the phenomena produced on the new born child by the contact of air which after a succession of muscular twitchings becomes endowed with voice and heralds its advent by a loud but brief succession of cries But though this is the general rule it sometimes happens from causes it is unnecessary here to explain that the infant does not cry or give utterance to any audible sounds or if it does they are so faint as scarcely to be distinguished as human accents plainly indicating that life as yet to the new visitor is neither a boon nor a blessing the infant being in fact in a state of suspended or imperfect vitality a state of quasi existence closely approximating the condition of a still birth twenty four sixty one As soon as this state of things is discovered the child should be turned on its right side and the whole length of the spine from the head downwards rubbed with all the fingers of the right hand sharply and quickly without intermission till the quick action has not only evoked heat but electricity in the part and till the loud and sharp cries of the child have thoroughly expanded the lungs and satisfactorily established its life The operation will seldom require above a minute to effect and less frequently demands a repetition If there is brandy at hand the fingers before rubbing may be dipped into that or any other spirit twenty four sixty two There is another condition of what we may call mute births where the child only makes short ineffectual gasps and those at intervals of a minute or two apart when the lips eyelids and fingers become of a deep purple or slate colour sometimes half the body remaining white while the other half which was at first swarthy deepens to a livid hue This condition of the infant is owing to the valve between the two sides of the heart remaining open and allowing the unvitalized venous blood to enter the arteries and get into the circulation twenty four sixty three The object in this case as in the previous one is to dilate the lungs as quickly as possible so that by the sudden effect of a vigorous inspiration the valve may be firmly closed and the impure blood losing this means of egress be sent directly to the lungs The same treatment is therefore necessary as in the previous case with the addition if the friction along the spine has failed of a warm bath at a temperature of about eighty deg in which the child is to be plunged up to the neck first cleansing the mouth and nostrils of the mucus that might interfere with the free passage of air twenty four sixty four While in the bath the friction along the spine is to be continued and if the lungs still remain unexpended while one person retains the child in an inclined position in the water another should insert the pipe of a small pair of bellows into one nostril and while the month is closed and the other nostril compressed on the pipe with the hand of the assistant the lungs are to be slowly inflated by steady puffs of air from the bellows the hand being removed from the mouth and nose after each inflation and placed on the pit of the stomach and by a steady pressure expelling it out again by the mouth This process is to be continued steadily inflating and expelling the air from the lungs till with a sort of tremulous leap Nature takes up the process and the infant begins to gasp and finally to cry at first low and faint but with every gulp of air increasing in length and strength of volume when it is to be removed from the water and instantly wrapped all but the face and mouth in a flannel Sometimes however all these means will fail in effecting an utterance from the child which will lie with livid lips and a flaccid body every few minutes opening its mouth with a short gasping pant and then subsiding into a state of pulseless inaction lingering probably some hours till the spasmodic pantings growing further apart it ceases to exist twenty four sixty five The time that this state of negative vitality will linger in the frame of an infant is remarkable and even when all the previous operations though long continued have proved ineffectual the child will often rally from the simplest of means the application of dry heat When removed from the bath place three or four hot bricks or tiles on the hearth and lay the child loosely folded in a flannel on its back along them taking care that there is but one fold of flannel between the spine and heated bricks or tiles When neither of these articles can be procured put a few clear pieces of red cinder in a warming pan and extend the child in the same manner along the closed lid As the heat gradually diffuses itself over the spinal marrow the child that was dying or seemingly dead will frequently give a sudden and energetic cry succeeded in another minute by a long and vigorous peal making up in volume and force for the previous delay and instantly confirming its existence by every effort in its nature twenty four sixty six With these two exceptions restored by the means we have pointed out to the functions of life we will proceed to the consideration of the child HEALTHILY BORN Here the first thing that meets us on the threshold of inquiry and what is often between mother and nurse not only a vexed question but one of vexatious import is the crying of the child the mother in her natural anxiety maintaining that her infant must be ill to cause it to cry so much or so often and the nurse insisting that all children cry and that nothing is the matter with it and that crying does good and is indeed an especial benefit to infancy The anxious and unfamiliar mother though not convinced by these abstract sayings of the truth or wisdom of the explanation takes both for granted and giving the nurse credit for more knowledge and experience on this head than she can have contentedly resigns herself to the infliction as a thing necessary to be endured for the good of the baby but thinking it at the same time an extraordinary instance of the imperfectibility of Nature as regards the human infant for her mind wanders to what she has observed in her childhood with puppies and kittens who except when rudely torn from their nurse seldom give utterance to any complaining twenty four sixty seven We undoubtedly believe that crying to a certain extent is not only conducive to health but positively necessary to the full development and physical economy of the infant s being But though holding this opinion we are far from believing that a child does not very often cry from pain thirst want of food and attention to its personal comfort but there is as much difference in the tone and expression of a child s cry as in the notes of an adult s voice and the mother s ear will not be long in discriminating between the sharp peevish whine of irritation and fever and the louder intermitting cry that characterizes the want of warmth and sleep All these shades of expression in the child s inarticulate voice every nurse should understand and every mother will soon teach herself to interpret them with an accuracy equal to language twenty four sixty eight There is no part of a woman s duty to her child that a young mother should so soon make it her business to study as the voice of her infant and the language conveyed in its cry The study is neither hard nor difficult a close attention to its tone and the expression of the baby s features are the two most important points demanding attention The key to both the mother will find in her own heart and the knowledge of her success in the comfort and smile of her infant We have two reasons both strong ones for urging on mothers the imperative necessity of early making themselves acquainted with the nature and wants of their child the first that when left to the entire responsibility of the baby after the departure of the nurse she may be able to undertake her new duties with more confidence than if left to her own resources and mother s instinct without a clue to guide her through the mysteries of those calls that vibrate through every nerve of her nature and secondly that she may be able to guard her child from the nefarious practices of unprincipled nurses who while calming the mother s mind with false statements as to the character of the baby s cries rather than lose their rest or devote that time which would remove the cause of suffering administer behind the curtains those deadly narcotics which while stupefying Nature into sleep insure for herself a night of many unbroken hours Such nurses as have not the hardihood to dose their infant charges are often full of other schemes to still that constant and reproachful cry The most frequent means employed for this purpose is giving it something to suck something easily hid from the mother or when that is impossible under the plea of keeping it warm the nurse covers it in her lap with a shawl and under this blind surreptitiously inserts a finger between the parched lips which possibly moan for drink and under this inhuman cheat and delusion the infant is pacified till Nature balked of its desires drops into a troubled sleep These are two of our reasons for impressing upon mothers the early the immediate necessity of putting themselves sympathetically in communication with their child by at once learning its hidden language as a delightful task twenty four sixty nine We must strenuously warn all mothers on no account to allow the nurse to sleep with the baby never herself to lay down with it by her side for a night s rest never to let it sleep in the parents bed and on no account keep it longer than absolutely necessary confined in on atmosphere loaded with the breath of many adults twenty four seventy The amount of oxygen required by an infant is so large and the quantity consumed by mid life and age and the proportion of carbonic acid thrown off from both so considerable that an infant breathing the same air cannot possibly carry on its healthy existence while deriving its vitality from so corrupted a medium This objection always in force is still more objectionable at night time when doors and windows are closed and amounts to a condition of poison when placed between two adults in sleep and shut in by bed curtains and when in addition to the impurities expired from the lungs we remember in quiescence and sleep how large a portion of mephitic gas is given off from the skin twenty four seventy one Mothers in the fullness of their affection believe there is no harbour sleeping or awake where their infants can be so secure from all possible or probable danger as in their own arms yet we should astound our readers if we told them the statistical number of infants who in despite of their motherly solicitude and love are annually killed unwittingly by such parents themselves and this from the persistency in the practice we are so strenuously condemning The mother frequently on awaking discovers the baby s face closely impacted between her bosom and her arm and its body rigid and lifeless or else so enveloped in the head blanket and superincumbent bedclothes as to render breathing a matter of physical impossibility In such cases the jury in general returns a verdict of Accidentally overlaid but one of Careless suffocation would be more in accordance with truth and justice The only possible excuse that can be urged either by nurse or mother for this culpable practice is the plea of imparting warmth to the infant But this can always be effected by an extra blanket in the child s crib or if the weather is particularly cold by a bottle of hot water enveloped in flannel and placed at the child s feet while all the objections already urged as derivable from animal heat imparted by actual contact are entirely obviated There is another evil attending the sleeping together of the mother and infant which as far as regards the latter we consider quite as formidable though not so immediate as the others and is always followed by more or less of mischief to the mother The evil we now allude to is that most injurious practice of letting the child suck after the mother has fallen asleep a custom that naturally results from the former and which as we hare already said is injurious to both mother and child It is injurious to the infant by allowing it without control to imbibe to distension a fluid sluggishly secreted and deficient in those vital principles which the want of mental energy and of the sympathetic appeals of the child on the mother so powerfully produce on the secreted nutriment while the mother wakes in a state of clammy exhaustion with giddiness dimness of sight nausea loss of appetite and a dull aching pain through the back and between the shoulders In fact she wakes languid and unrefreshed from her sleep with febrile symptoms and hectic flushes caused by her baby vampire who while dragging from her her health and strength has excited in itself a set of symptoms directly opposite but fraught with the same injurious consequences functional derangement THE MILK twenty four seventy two As Nature has placed in the bosom of the mother the natural food of her offspring it must be self evident to every reflecting woman that it becomes her duty to study as far as lies in her power to keep that reservoir of nourishment in as pure and invigorating a condition as possible for she must remember that the quantity is no proof of the quality of this aliment twenty four seventy three The mother while suckling as a general rule should avoid all sedentary occupations take regular exercise keep her mind as lively and pleasingly occupied as possible especially by music and singing Her diet should be light and nutritious with a proper sufficiency of animal food and of that kind which yields the largest amount of nourishment and unless the digestion is naturally strong vegetables and fruit should form a very small proportion of the general dietary and such preparations as broths gruels arrowroot c still less Tapioca or ground rice pudding made with several eggs may be taken freely but all slops and thin potations such as that delusion called chicken broth should be avoided as yielding a very small amount of nutriment and a large proportion of flatulence All purely stimulants should be avoided as much as possible especially spirits unless taken for some special object and that medicinally but as a part of the dietary they should be carefully shunned Lactation is always an exhausting process and as the child increases in size and strength the drain upon the mother becomes great and depressing Then something more even than an abundant diet is required to keep the mind and body up to a standard sufficiently healthy to admit of a constant and nutritious secretion being performed without detriment to the physical integrity of the mother or injury to the child who imbibes it and as stimulants are inadmissible if not positively injurious the substitute required is to be found in malt liquor To the lady accustomed to her Madeira and sherry this may appear a very vulgar potation for a delicate young mother to take instead of the more subtle and condensed elegance of wine but as we are writing from experience and with the avowed object of imparting useful facts and beneficial remedies to our readers we allow no social distinctions to interfere with our legitimate object twenty four seventy four We have already said that the suckling mother should avoid stimulants especially spirituous ones and though something of this sort is absolutely necessary to support her strength during the exhausting process it should be rather of a tonic than of a stimulating character and as all wines contain a large percentage of brandy they are on that account less beneficial than the pure juice of the fermented grape might be But there is another consideration to be taken into account on this subject the mother has not only to think of herself but also of her infant Now wines especially port wine very often indeed most frequently affect the baby s bowels and what might have been grateful to the mother becomes thus a source of pain and irritation to the child afterwards Sherry is less open to this objection than other wines yet still it very frequently does influence the second participator or the child whose mother has taken it twenty four seventy five The nine or twelve months a woman usually suckles must be to some extent to most mothers a period of privation and penance and unless she is deaf to the cries of her baby and insensible to its kicks and plunges and will not see in such muscular evidences the griping pains that rack her child she will avoid every article that can remotely affect the little being who draws its sustenance from her She will see that the babe is acutely affected by all that in any way influences her and willingly curtail her own enjoyments rather than see her infant rendered feverish irritable and uncomfortable As the best tonic then and the most efficacious indirect stimulant that a mother can take at such times there is no potation equal to porter and stout or what is better still an equal part of porter and stout Ale except for a few constitutions is too subtle and too sweet generally causing acidity or heartburn and stout alone is too potent to admit of a full draught from its proneness to affect the head and quantity as well as moderate strength is required to make the draught effectual the equal mixture therefore of stout and porter yields all the properties desired or desirable as a medicinal agent for this purpose twenty four seventy six Independently of its invigorating influence on the constitution porter exerts a marked and specific effect on the secretion of milk more powerful in exciting an abundant supply of that fluid than any other article within the range of the physician s art and in cases of deficient quantity is the most certain speedy and the healthiest means that can be employed to insure a quick and abundant flow In cases where malt liquor produces flatulency a few grains of the carbonate of soda may advantageously be added to each glass immediately before drinking which will have the effect of neutralizing any acidity that may be in the porter at the time and will also prevent its after disagreement with the stomach The quantity to be taken must depend upon the natural strength of the mother the age and demand made by the infant on the parent and other causes but the amount should vary from one to two pints a day never taking less than half a pint at a time which should be repeated three or four times a day twenty four seventy seven We have said that the period of suckling is a season of penance to the mother but this is not invariably the case and as so much must depend upon the natural strength of the stomach and its power of assimilating all kinds of food into healthy chyle it is impossible to define exceptions Where a woman feels she can eat any kind of food without inconvenience or detriment she should live during her suckling as she did before but as a general rule we are bound to advise all mothers to abstain from such articles as pickles fruits cucumbers and all acid and slowly digestible foods unless they wish for restless nights and crying infants twenty four seventy eight As regards exercise and amusement we would certainly neither prohibit a mother s dancing going to a theatre nor even from attending an assembly The first however is the best indoor recreation she can take and a young mother will do well to often amuse herself in the nursery with this most excellent means of healthful circulation The only precaution necessary is to avoid letting the child suck the milk that has lain long in the breast or is heated by excessive action twenty four seventy nine Every mother who can should be provided with a breast pump or glass tube to draw off the superabundance that has been accumulating in her absence from the child or the first gush excited by undue exertion the subsequent supply of milk will be secreted under the invigorating influence of a previous healthy stimulus twenty four eighty As the first milk that is secreted contains a large amount of the saline elements and is thin and innutritious it is most admirably adapted for the purpose Nature designed it to fulfil that of an aperient but which unfortunately it is seldom permitted in our artificial mode of living to perform twenty four eighty one So opposed are we to the objectionable plan of physicking new born children that unless for positive illness we would much rather advise that medicine should be administered through the mother for the first eight or ten weeks of its existence This practice which few mothers will object to is easily effected by the parent when such a course is necessary for the child taking either a dose of castor oil half an ounce of tasteless salts the phosphate of soda one or two teaspoonfuls of magnesia a dose of lenitive electuary manna or any mild and simple aperient which almost before it can have taken effect on herself will exhibit its action on her child twenty four eighty two One of the most common errors that mothers fall into while suckling their children is that of fancying they are always hungry and consequently overfeeding them and with this the great mistake of applying the child to the breast on every occasion of its crying without investigating the cause of its complaint and under the belief that it wants food putting the nipple into its crying mouth until the infant turns in revulsion and petulance from what it should accept with eagerness and joy At such times a few teaspoonfuls of water slightly chilled will often instantly pacify a crying and restless child who has turned in loathing from the offered breast or after imbibing a few drops and finding it not what nature craved throws back its head in disgust and cries more petulantly than before In such a case as this the young mother grieved at her baby s rejection of the tempting present and distressed at its cries and in terror of some injury over and over ransacks its clothes believing some insecure pin can alone be the cause of such sharp complaining an accident that from her own care in dressing however is seldom or ever the case twenty four eighty three These abrupt cries of the child if they do not proceed from thirst which a little water will relieve not unfrequently occur from some unequal pressure a fold or twist in the roller or some constriction round the tender body If this is suspected the mother must not be content with merely slackening the strings the child should be undressed and the creases and folds of the hot skin especially those about the thighs and groins examined to see that no powder has caked and becoming hard irritated the parts The violet powder should be dusted freely over all to cool the skin and everything put on fresh and smooth If such precautions have not afforded relief and in addition to the crying the child plunges or draws up its legs the mother may be assured some cause of irritation exists in the stomach or bowels either acidity in the latter or distension from overfeeding in the former but from whichever cause the child should be opened before the fire and a heated napkin applied all over the abdomen the infant being occasionally elevated to a sitting position and while gently jolted on the knee the back should be lightly patted with the hand twenty four eighty four Should the mother have any reason to apprehend that the cause of inconvenience proceeds from the bladder a not unfrequent source of pain the napkin is to be dipped in hot water squeezed out and immediately applied over the part and repeated every eight or ten minutes for several times in succession either till the natural relief is afforded or a cessation of pain allows of its discontinuance The pain that young infants often suffer and the crying that results from it is as we have already said frequently caused by the mother inconsiderately overfeeding her child and is produced by the pain of distension and the mechanical pressure of a larger quantity of fluid in the stomach than the gastric juice can convert into cheese and digest twenty four eighty five Some children are stronger in the enduring power of the stomach than others and get rid of the excess by vomiting concluding every process of suckling by an emission of milk and curd Such children are called by nurses thriving children and generally they are so simply because their digestion is good and they have the power of expelling with impunity that superabundance of aliment which in others is a source of distension flatulence and pain twenty four eighty six The length of time an infant should be suckled must depend much on the health and strength of the child and the health of the mother and the quantity and quality of her milk though when all circumstances are favourable it should never be less than nine nor exceed fifteen months but perhaps the true time will be found in the medium between both But of this we may be sure that Nature never ordained a child to live on suction after having endowed it with teeth to bite and to grind and nothing is more out of place and unseemly than to hear a child with a set of twenty teeth ask for the breast twenty four eighty seven The practice of protracted wet nursing is hurtful to the mother by keeping up an uncalled for and after the proper time an unhealthy drain on her system while the child either derives no benefit from what it no longer requires or it produces a positive injury on its constitution After the period when Nature has ordained the child shall live by other means the secretion of milk becomes thin and deteriorated showing in the flabby flesh and puny features of the child both its loss of nutritious properties and the want of more stimulating aliment twenty four eighty eight Though we have said that twelve months is about the medium time a baby should be suckled we by no means wish to imply that a child should be fed exclusively on milk for its first year quite the reverse the infant can hardly be too soon made independent of the mother Thus should illness assail her her milk fail or any domestic cause abruptly cut off the natural supply the child having been annealed to an artificial diet its life might be safely carried on without seeking for a wet nurse and without the slightest danger to its system twenty four eighty nine The advantage to the mother of early accustoming the child to artificial food is as considerable to herself as beneficial to her infant the demand on her physical strength in the first instance will be less severe and exhausting the child will sleep longer on a less rapidly digestible aliment and yield to both more quiet nights and the mother will be more at liberty to go out for business or pleasure another means of sustenance being at hand till her return Besides these advantages by a judicious blending of the two systems of feeding the infant will acquire greater constitutional strength so that if attacked by sickness or disease it will have a much greater chance of resisting its virulence than if dependent alone on the mother whose milk affected by fatigue and the natural anxiety of the parent for her offspring is at such a time neither good in its properties nor likely to be beneficial to the patient twenty four ninety All that we have further to say on suckling is an advice to mothers that if they wish to keep a sound and unchapped nipple and possibly avoid what is called a broken breast never to put it up with a wet nipple but always to have a soft handkerchief in readiness and the moment that delicate part is drawn from the child s mouth to dry it carefully of the milk and saliva that moisten it and further to make a practice of suckling from each breast alternately Dress and Dressing Washing c twenty four ninety one As respects the dress and dressing of a new born infant or of a child in arms during any stage of its nursing there are few women who will require us to give them guidance or directions for their instruction and though a few hints on the subject may not be out of place here yet most women intuitively take to a baby and with a small amount of experience are able to perform all the little offices necessary to its comfort and cleanliness with ease and completeness We shall therefore on this delicate subject hold our peace and only from afar hint at what we would leaving our suggestions to be approved or rejected according as they chime with the judgment and the apprehension of our motherly readers twenty four ninety two In these days of intelligence there are few ladies who have not in all probability seen the manner in which the Indian squaw the aborigines of Polynesia and even the Lapp and Esquimaux strap down their baby on a board and by means of a loop suspend it to the bough of a tree hang it up to the rafters of the hut or on travel dangle it on their backs outside the domestic implements which as the slave of her master man the wronged but uncomplaining woman carries in order that her lord may march in unhampered freedom Cruel and confining as this system of backboard dressing may seem to our modern notions of freedom and exercise it is positively less irksome less confining and infinitely less prejudicial to health than the mummying of children by our grandmothers a hundred ay fifty years ago for what with chin stays back stays body stays forehead cloths rollers bandages c an infant had as many girths and strings to keep head limbs and body in one exact position as a ship has halyards twenty four ninety three Much of this indeed we may say all has been abolished but still the child is far from being dressed loosely enough and we shall never be satisfied till the abominable use of the pin is avoided in toto in an infant s dressing and a texture made for all the under garments of a child of a cool and elastic material twenty four ninety four The manner in which an infant is encircled in a bandage called the roller as if it had fractured ribs compressing those organs that living on suction must be for the health of the child to a certain degree distended to obtain sufficient aliment from the fluid imbibed is perfectly preposterous Our humanity as well as our duty calls upon us at once to abrogate and discountenance by every means in our power Instead of the process of washing and dressing being made as with the adult a refreshment and comfort it is by the dawdling manner in which it is performed the multiplicity of things used and the perpetual change of position of the infant to adjust its complicated clothing rendered an operation of positive irritation and annoyance We therefore entreat all mothers to regard this subject in its true light and study to the utmost simplicity in dress and dispatch in the process twenty four ninety five Children do not so much cry from the washing as from the irritation caused by the frequent change of position in which they are placed the number of times they are turned on their face on their back and on their side by the manipulations demanded by the multiplicity of articles to be fitted tacked and carefully adjusted on their bodies What mother ever found her girl of six or seven stand quiet while she was curling her hair How many times nightly has she not to reprove her for not standing still during the process It is the same with the unconscious infant who cannot bear to be moved about and who has no sooner grown reconciled to one position than it is forced reluctantly into another It is true in one instance the child has intelligence to guide it and in the other not but the motitory nerves in both instances resent coercion and a child cannot be too little handled twenty four ninety six On this account alone and for the moment setting health and comfort out of the question we beg mothers to simplify their baby s dress as much as possible and not only to put on as little as is absolutely necessary but to make that as simple in its contrivance and adjustment as it will admit of to avoid belly bands rollers girths and everything that can impede or confine the natural expansion of the digestive organs on the due performance of whose functions the child lives thrives and develops its physical being REARING BY HAND Articles necessary and how to use them Preparation of Foods Baths Advantages of Rearing by Hand twenty four ninety seven As we do not for a moment wish to be thought an advocate for an artificial in preference to the natural course of rearing children we beg our renders to understand us perfectly on this head all we desire to prove is the fact that a child can be brought up as well on a spoon dietary as the best example to be found of those reared on the breast having more strength indeed from the more nutritious food on which it lives It will be thus less liable to infectious diseases and more capable of resisting the virulence of any danger that may attack it and without in any way depreciating the nutriment of its natural food we wish to impress on the mother s mind that there are many cases of infantine debility which might eventuate in rickets curvature of the spine or mesenteric disease where the addition to or total substitution of an artificial and more stimulating aliment would not only give tone and strength to the constitution but at the same time render the employment of mechanical means totally unnecessary And finally though we would never where the mother had the strength to suckle her child supersede the breast we would insist on making it a rule to accustom the child as early as possible to the use of an artificial diet not only that it may acquire more vigour to help it over the ills of childhood but that in the absence of the mother it might not miss the maternal sustenance and also for the parent s sake that should the milk from any cause become vitiated or suddenly cease the child can be made over to the bottle and the spoon without the slightest apprehension of hurtful consequences twenty four ninety eight To those persons unacquainted with the system or who may have been erroneously informed on the matter the rearing of a child by hand may seem surrounded by innumerable difficulties and a large amount of personal trouble and anxiety to the nurse or mother who undertakes the duty This however is a fallacy in every respect except as regards the fact of preparing the food but even this extra amount of work by adopting the course we shall lay down may be reduced to a very small sum of inconvenience and as respects anxiety the only thing calling for care is the display of judgment in the preparation of the food The articles required for the purpose of feeding an infant are a night lamp with its pan and lid to keep the food warm a nursing bottle with a prepared teat and a small pap saucepan for use by day Of the lamp we need hardly speak most mothers being acquainted with its operation but to those to whom it is unknown we may observe that the flame from the floating rushlight heats the water in the reservoir above in which the covered pan that contains the food floats keeping it at such a heat that when thinned by milk it will be of a temperature suitable for immediate use Though many kinds of nursing bottles have been lately invented and some mounted with India rubber nipples the common glass bottle with the calf s teat is equal in cleanliness and utility to any besides the nipple put into the child s mouth is so white and natural in appearance that no child taken from the breast will refuse it The black artificial ones of caoutchouc or gutta percha are unnatural The prepared teats can be obtained at any chemist s and as they are kept in spirits they will require a little soaking in warm water and gentle washing before being tied securely by means of fine twine round the neck of the bottle just sufficient being left projecting for the child to grasp freely in its lips for if left the full length or over long it will be drawn too far into the mouth and possibly make the infant heave When once properly adjusted the nipple need never be removed till replaced by a new one which will hardly be necessary oftener than once a fortnight though with care one will last for several weeks The nursing bottle should be thoroughly washed and cleaned every day and always rinsed out before and after using it the warm water being squeezed through the nipple to wash out any particles of food that might lodge in the aperture and become sour The teat can always be kept white and soft by turning the end of the bottle when not in use into a narrow jug containing water taking care to dry it first and then to warm it by drawing the food through before putting it into the child s mouth Food and its Preparation twenty four ninety nine The articles generally employed as food for infants consist of arrowroot bread flour baked flour prepared groats farinaceous food biscuit powder biscuits tops and bottoms and semolina or manna croup as it is otherwise called which like tapioca is the prepared pith of certain vegetable substances Of this list the least efficacious though perhaps the most believed in is arrowroot which only as a mere agent for change and then only for a very short time should ever be employed as a means of diet to infancy or childhood It is a thin flatulent and innutritious food and incapable of supporting infantine life with energy Bread though the universal regime with the labouring poor where the infant s stomach and digestive powers are a reflex in miniature of the father s should never be given to an infant under three months and even then however finely beaten up and smoothly made is a very questionable diet Flour when well boiled though infinitely better than arrowroot is still only a kind of fermentative paste that counteracts its own good by after acidity and flatulence twenty five hundred Baked flour when cooked into a pale brown mass and finely powdered makes a far superior food to the others and may be considered as a very useful diet especially for a change Prepared groats may be classed with arrowroot and raw flour as being innutritious The articles that now follow in our list are all good and such as we could with conscience and safety trust to for the health and development of any child whatever twenty five oh one We may observe in this place that an occasional change in the character of the food is highly desirable both as regards the health and benefit of the child and though the interruption should only last for a day the change will be advantageous twenty five oh two The packets sold as farinaceous food are unquestionably the best aliment that can be given from the first to a baby and may be continued with the exception of an occasional change without alteration of the material till the child is able to take its regular meals of animal and vegetable food Some infants are so constituted as to require a frequent and total change in their system of living seeming to thrive for a certain time on any food given to them but if persevered in too long declining in bulk and appearance as rapidly as they had previously progressed In such cases the food should be immediately changed and when that which appeared to agree best with the child is resumed it should be altered in its quality and perhaps in its consistency twenty five oh three For the farinaceous food there are directions with each packet containing instructions for the making but whatever the food employed is enough should be made at once to last the day and night at first about a pint basinful but as the child advances a quart will hardly be too much In all cases let the food boil a sufficient time constantly stirring and taking every precaution that it does not get burnt in which case it is on no account to be used twenty five oh four The food should always be made with water the whole sweetened at once and of such a consistency that when poured out and it has had time to cool it will cut with the firmness of a pudding or custard One or two spoonfuls are to be put into the pap saucepan and stood on the hob till the heat has softened it when enough milk is to be added and carefully mixed with the food till the whole has the consistency of ordinary cream it is then to be poured into the nursing bottle and the food having been drawn through to warm the nipple it is to be placed in the child s mouth For the first month or more half a bottleful will be quite enough to give the infant at one time but as the child grows it will be necessary not only to increase the quantity given at each time but also gradually to make its food more consistent and after the third month to add an egg to every pint basin of food made At night the mother puts the food into the covered pan of her lamp instead of the saucepan that is enough for one supply and having lighted the rush she will find on the waking of her child the food sufficiently hot to bear the cooling addition of the milk But whether night or day the same food should never be heated twice and what the child leaves should be thrown away twenty five oh five The biscuit powder is used in the same manner as the farinaceous food and both prepared much after the fashion of making starch But when tops and bottoms or the whole biscuit are employed they require soaking in cold water for some time previous to boiling The biscuit or biscuits are then to be slowly boiled in as much water as will when thoroughly soft allow of their being beaten by a three pronged fork into a fine smooth and even pulp and which when poured into a basin and become cold will cut out like a custard If two large biscuits have been so treated and the child is six or seven months old beat up two eggs sufficient sugar to properly sweeten it and about a pint of skim milk Pour this on the beaten biscuit in the saucepan stirring constantly boil for about five minutes pour into a basin and use when cold in the same manner as the other twenty five oh six This makes an admirable food at once nutritious and strengthening When tops and bottoms or rusks are used the quantity of the egg may be reduced or altogether omitted twenty five oh seven Semolina or manna croup being in little hard grains like a fine millet seed must be boiled for some time and the milk sugar and egg added to it on the fire and boiled for a few minutes longer and when cold used as the other preparations twenty five oh eight Many persons entertain a belief that cow s milk is hurtful to infants and consequently refrain from giving it but this is a very great mistake for both sugar and milk should form a large portion of every meal an infant takes TEETHING AND CONVULSIONS Fits c the consequence of Dentition and how to be treated The number and order of the Teeth and manner in which they are cut First and Second Set twenty five oh nine About three months after birth the infant s troubles may be said to begin teeth commence forming in the gums causing pain and irritation in the mouth and which but for the saliva it causes to flow so abundantly would be attended with very serious consequences At the same time the mother frequently relaxes in the punctuality of the regimen imposed on her and taking some unusual or different food excites diarrhoea or irritation in her child s stomach which not unfrequently results in a rash on the skin or slight febrile symptoms which if not subdued in their outset superinduce some more serious form of infantine disease But as a general rule the teeth are the primary cause of much of the child s sufferings in consequence of the state of nervous and functional irritation into which the system is thrown by their formation and progress out of the jaw and through the gums We propose beginning this branch of our subject with that most fertile source of an infant s suffering Teething twenty five ten That this subject may he better understood by the nurse and mother and the reason of the constitutional disturbance that to a greater or less degree is experienced by all infants may be made intelligible to those who have the care of children we shall commence by giving a brief account of the formation of the teeth the age at which they appear in the mouth and the order in which they pierce the gums The organs of mastication in the adult consist of thirty two distinct teeth sixteen in either jaw being in fact a double set The teeth are divided into four incisors two canine four first and second grinders and six molars but in childhood the complement or first set consists of only twenty and these only make their appearance as the development of the frame indicates the requirement of a different kind of food for the support of the system At birth some of the first cut teeth are found in the cavities of the jaw in a very small and rudimentary form but this is by no means universal About the third month the jaws which are hollow and divided into separate cells begin to expand making room for the slowly developing teeth which arranged for beauty and economy of space lengthwise gradually turn their tops upwards piercing the gum by their edges which being sharp assist in cutting a passage through the soft parts There is no particular period at which children cut their teeth some being remarkably early and others equally late The earliest age that we have ever ourselves known as a reliable fact was six weeks Such peculiarities are generally hereditary and as in this case common to a whole family The two extremes are probably represented by six and sixteen months Pain and drivelling are the usual but by no means the general indications of teething twenty five eleven About the sixth month the gums become tense and swollen presenting a red shiny appearance while the salivary glands pour out an unusual quantity of saliva After a time a white line or round spot is observed on the top of one part of the gums and the sharp edge of the tooth may be felt beneath if the finger is gently pressed on the part Through these white spots the teeth burst their way in the following order twenty five twelve Two incisors in the lower jaw are first cut though in general some weeks elapse between the appearance of the first and the advent of the second The next teeth cut are the four incisors of the upper jaw The next in order are the remaining two incisors of the bottom one on each side then two top and two bottom on each side but not joining the incisors and lastly about the eighteenth or twentieth month the four eye teeth filling up the space left between the side teeth and the incisors thus completing the infant s set of sixteen Sometimes at the same period but more frequently some months later four more double teeth slowly make their appearance one on each side of each jaw completing the entire series of the child s first set of twenty teeth It is asserted that a child while cutting its teeth should either dribble excessively vomit after every meal or be greatly relaxed Though one or other or all of these at once may attend a case of teething it by no means follows that any one of them should accompany this process of nature though there can be no doubt that where the pain consequent on the unyielding state of the gums and the firmness of the skin that covers the tooth is severe a copious discharge of saliva acts beneficially in saving the head and also in guarding the child from those dangerous attacks of fits to which many children in their teething are liable twenty five thirteen The Symptoms that generally indicate the cutting of teeth in addition to the inflamed and swollen state of the gums and increased flow of saliva are the restless and peevish state of the child the hands being thrust into the mouth and the evident pleasure imparted by rubbing the finger or nail gently along the gum the lips are often excoriated and the functions of the stomach or bowels are out of order In severe cases occurring in unhealthy or scrofulous children there are from the first considerable fever disturbed sleep fretfulness diarrhoea rolling of the eyes convulsive startings laborious breathing coma or unnatural sleep ending unless the head is quickly relieved in death twenty five fourteen The Treatment in all cases of painful teething is remarkably simple and consists in keeping the body cool by mild aperient medicines allaying the irritation in the gums by friction with a rough ivory ring or a stale crust of broad and when the head lungs or any organ is overloaded or unduly excited to use the hot bath and by throwing the body into a perspiration equalize the circulation and relieve the system from the danger of a fatal termination twenty five fifteen Besides these there is another means but that must be employed by a medical man namely scarifying the gums an operation always safe and which when judiciously performed and at a critical opportunity will often snatch the child from the grasp of death twenty five sixteen There are few subjects on which mothers have often formed such strong and mistaken opinions as on that of lancing an infant s gums some rather seeing their child go into fits and by the unrelieved irritation endangering inflammation of the brain water on the head rickets and other lingering affections than permit the surgeon to afford instant relief by cutting through the hard skin which like a bladder over the stopper of a bottle effectually confines the tooth to the socket and prevents it piercing the soft spongy substance of the gum This prejudice is a great error as we shall presently show for so far from hurting the child there is nothing that will so soon convert an infant s tears into smiles as scarifying the gums in painful teething that is if effectually done and the skin of the tooth be divided twenty five seventeen Though teething is a natural function and to an infant in perfect health should be unproductive of pain yet in general it is not only a fertile cause of suffering but often a source of alarm and danger the former from irritation in the stomach and bowels deranging the whole economy of the system and the latter from coma and fits that may excite alarm in severe cases and the danger that eventuates in some instances from organic disease of the head or spinal marrow twenty five eighteen We shall say nothing in this place of rickets or water on the head which are frequent results of dental irritation but proceed to finish our remarks on the treatment of teething Though strongly advocating the lancing of the gums in teething and when there are any severe head symptoms yet it should never be needlessly done or before being satisfied that the tooth is fully formed and is out of the socket and under the gum When assured on these points the gum should be cut lengthwise and from the top of the gum downwards to the tooth in an horizontal direction thus and for about half an inch in length The operation is then to be repeated in a transverse direction cutting across the gum in the centre of the first incision and forming a cross thus The object of this double incision is to insure a retraction of the cut parts and leave an open way for the tooth to start from an advantage not to be obtained when only one incision is made for unless the tooth immediately follows the lancing the opening reunites and the operation has to be repeated That this operation is very little or not at all painful is evidenced by the suddenness with which the infant falls asleep after the lancing and awakes in apparently perfect health though immediately before the use of the gum lancet the child may have been shrieking or in convulsions Convulsions or Infantine Fits twenty five nineteen From their birth till after teething infants are more or less subject or liable to sudden fits which often without any assignable cause will attack the child in a moment and while in the mother s arms and which according to their frequency and the age and strength of the infant are either slight or dangerous twenty five twenty Whatever may have been the remote cause the immediate one is some irritation of the nervous system causing convulsions or an effusion to the head inducing coma In the first instance the infant cries out with a quick short scream rolls up its eyes arches its body backwards its arms become bent and fixed and the fingers parted the lips and eyelids assume a dusky leaden colour while the face remains pale and the eyes open glassy or staring This condition may or may not be attended with muscular twitchings of the mouth and convulsive plunges of the arms The fit generally lasts from one to three minutes when the child recovers with a sigh and the relaxation of the body In the other case the infant is attacked at once with total insensibility and relaxation of the limbs coldness of the body and suppressed breathing the eyes when open being dilated and presenting a dim glistening appearance the infant appearing for the moment to be dead twenty five twenty one Treatment The first step in either case is to immerse the child in a hot bath up to the chin or if sufficient hot water cannot be procured to cover the body make a hip bath of what can be obtained and while the left hand supports the child in a sitting or recumbent position with the right scoop up the water and run it over the chest of the patient When sufficient water can be obtained the spine should be briskly rubbed while in the bath when this cannot be done lay the child on the knees and with the fingers dipped in brandy rub the whole length of the spine vigorously for two or three minutes and when restored to consciousness give occasionally a teaspoonful of weak brandy and water or wine and water twenty five twenty two An hour after the bath it may be necessary to give an aperient powder possibly also to repeat the dose for once or twice every three hours in which case the following prescription is to be employed Take of Powdered scammony six grains Grey powder six grains Antimonial powder four grains Lump sugar twenty grains Mix thoroughly and divide into three powders which are to be taken as advised for an infant one year old for younger or weakly infants divide into four powders and give as the other For thirst and febrile symptoms give drinks of barley water or cold water and every three hours put ten to fifteen drops of spirits of sweet nitre in a dessert spoonful of either beverage THRUSH AND ITS TREATMENT twenty five twenty three This is a disease to which infants are peculiarly subject and in whom alone it may be said to be a disease for when thrush shows itself in adult or advanced life it is not as a disease proper but only as a symptom or accessory of some other ailment generally of a chronic character and should no more be classed as a separate affection than the petechae or dark coloured spots that appear in malignant measles may be considered a distinct affection twenty five twenty four Thrush is a disease of the follicles of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal whereby there are formed small vesicles or bladders filled with a thick mucous secretion which bursting discharge their contents and form minute ulcers in the centre of each vessel To make this formal but unavoidable description intelligible we must beg the reader s patience while we briefly explain terms that may appear to many so unmeaning and make the pathology of thrush fully familiar twenty five twenty five The whole digestive canal of which the stomach and bowels are only a part is covered from the lips eyes and ears downwards with a thin glairy tissue like the skin that lines the inside of an egg called the mucous membrane this membrane is dotted all over in a state of health by imperceptible points called follicles through which the saliva or mucous secreted by the membrane is poured out twenty five twenty six These follicles or little glands then becoming enlarged and filled with a congealed fluid constitute thrush in its first stage and when the child s lips and mouth appear a mass of small pearls then as these break and discharge the second stage or that of ulceration sets in twenty five twenty seven Symptoms Thrush is generally preceded by considerable irritation by the child crying and fretting showing more than ordinary redness of the lips and nostrils hot fetid breath with relaxed bowels and dark feculent evacuations the water is scanty and high coloured whilst considerable difficulty in swallowing and much thirst are the other symptoms which a careful observation of the little patient makes manifest twenty five twenty eight The situation and character of thrush show at once that the cause is some irritation of the mucous membrane and can proceed only from the nature and quality of the food Before weaning this must be looked for in the mother and the condition of the milk after that time in the crude and indigestible nature of the food given In either case this exciting cause of the disease must be at once stopped When it proceeds from the mother it is always best to begin by physicking the infant through the parent that is to say let the parent first take the medicine which will sufficiently affect the child through the milk this plan has the double object of benefiting the patient and at the same time correcting the state of the mother and improving the condition of her milk In the other case when the child is being fed by hand then proceed by totally altering the style of aliment given and substituting farinaceous food custards blanc mange and ground rice puddings twenty five twenty nine As an aperient medicine for the mother the best thing she can take is a dessert spoonful of carbonate of magnesia once or twice a day in a cup of cold water and every second day for two or three times an aperient pill twenty five thirty As the thrush extends all over the mouth throat stomach and bowels the irritation to the child from such an extent of diseased surface is proportionately great and before attempting to act on such a tender surface by opening medicine the better plan is to soothe by an emollient mixture and for that purpose let the following be prepared Take of Castor oil two drachms Sugar one drachm Mucilage or powdered gum Arabic half a drachm Triturate till the oil is incorporated then add slowly Mint water One ounce and a half Laudanum Ten drops Half a teaspoonful three times a day to an infant from one to two years old a teaspoonful from two to three years old and a dessertspoonful at any age over that time After two days use of the mixture one of the following powders should be given twice a day accompanied with one dose daily of the mixture Grey powder twenty grains Powdered rhubarb fifteen grains Scammony ten grains Mix Divide into twelve powders for one year eight powders from one to two and six powders from two to six years old After that age double the strength by giving the quantity of two powders at once twenty five thirty one It is sometimes customary to apply borax and honey to the mouth for thrush but it is always better to treat the disease constitutionally rather than locally The first steps therefore to be adopted are to remove or correct the exciting cause the mother s milk or food allay irritation by a warm bath and the castor oil mixture followed by and conjoined with the powders twenty five thirty two To those however who wish to try the honey process the best preparation to use is the following Rub down one ounce of honey with two drachms of tincture of myrrh and apply it to the lips and mouth every four or six hours twenty five thirty three It is a popular belief and one most devoutly cherished by many nurses and elderly persons that everybody must at some time of their life between birth and death have an attack of thrush and if not in infancy or prime of life it will surely attack them on their death bed in a form more malignant than if the patient had been affected with the malady earlier the black thrush with which they are then reported to be affected being in all probability the petechae or purple spots that characterize the worst form and often the last stage of typhoid fever twenty five thirty four In general very little medicine is needed in this disease of the thrush an alterative powder or a little magnesia given once or twice being all with the warm bath that in the great majority of cases is needed to restore the mucous membrane to health As thrush is caused by an excess of heat or over action in the lining membrane of the stomach and bowels whatever will counteract this state by throwing the heat on the surface must materially benefit if not cure the disease and that means every mother has at hand in the form of a warm bath After the application of this a little magnesia to correct the acidity existing along the surface of the mucous membrane is often all that is needed to throw the system into such a state as will effect its own cure This favourable state is indicated by an excessive flow of saliva or what is called dribbling and by a considerable amount of relaxation of the bowels a condition that must not be mistaken for diarrhoea and checked as if a disease but rather for the day or two it continues encouraged as a critical evacuant twenty five thirty five Should there be much debility in the convalescence half a teaspoonful of stee wine given twice a day in a little barley water will be found sufficient for all the purposes of a tonic This with the precaution of changing the child s food or when it lives on the mother of correcting the quality of the milk by changing her own diet and by means of an antacid or aperient improving the state of the secretion Such is all the treatment that this disease in general requires twenty five thirty six The class of diseases we are now approaching are the most important both in their pathological features and in their consequences on the constitution of any group or individual disease that assails the human body and though more frequently attacking the undeveloped frame of childhood are yet by no means confined to that period These are called Eruptive Fevers and embrace chicken pox cow pox small pox scarlet fever measles milary fever and erysipelas or saint Anthony s fire twenty five thirty seven The general character of all these is that they are contagious and as a general rule attack a person only once in his lifetime that their chain of diseased actions always begins with fever and that after an interval of from one to four days the fever is followed by an eruption of the skin CHICKEN POX OR GLASS POX AND COW POX OR VACCINATION twenty five thirty eight CHICKEN POX or GLASS POX may in strict propriety be classed as a mild variety of small pox presenting all the mitigated symptoms of that formidable disease Among many physicians it is indeed classed as small pox and not a separate disease but as this is not the place to discuss such questions and as we profess to give only facts the result of our own practical experience we shall treat this affection of glass pox or chicken pox as we ourselves have found it as a distinct and separate disease twenty five thirty nine Chicken pox is marked by all the febrile symptoms presented by small pox with this difference that in the case of chicken pox each symptom is particularly slight The heat of body is much less acute and the principal symptoms are difficulty of breathing headache coated tongue and nausea which sometimes amounts to vomiting After a term of general irritability heat and restlessness about the fourth day or between the third and fourth an eruption makes its appearance over the face neck and body in its first two stages closely resembling small pox with this especial difference that whereas the pustules in small pox have flat and depressed centres an infallible characteristic of small pox the pustules in chicken pox remain globular while the fluid in them changes from a transparent white to a straw coloured liquid which begins to exude and disappear about the eighth or ninth day and in mild cases by the twelfth desquamates or peels off entirely twenty five forty There can be no doubt that chicken pox like small pox is contagious and under certain states of the atmosphere becomes endemic Parents should therefore avoid exposing young children to the danger of infection by taking them where it is known to exist as chicken pox in weakly constitutions or in very young children may superinduce small pox the one disease either running concurrently with the other or discovering itself as the other declines This of course is a condition that renders the case very hazardous as the child has to struggle against two diseases at once or before it has recruited strength from the attack of the first twenty five forty one Treatment In all ordinary cases of chicken pox and it is very seldom it assumes any complexity the whole treatment resolves itself into the use of the warm bath and a course of gentle aperients The bath should be used when the oppression of the lungs renders the breathing difficult or the heat and dryness of the skin with the undeveloped rash beneath the surface shows the necessity for its use twenty five forty two As the pustules in chicken pox very rarely run to the state of suppuration as in the other disease there is no fear of pitting or disfigurement except in very severe forms which however happen so seldom as not to merit apprehension When the eruption subsides however the face may be washed with elder flower water and the routine followed which is prescribed in the convalescent state of small pox twenty five forty three COW POX properly speaking is an artificial disease established in a healthy body as a prophylactic or preventive agent against the more serious attack of small pox and is merely that chain of slight febrile symptoms and local irritation consequent on the specific action of the lymph of the vaccination in its action on the circulating system of the body This is not the place to speak of the benefits conferred on mankind by the discovery of vaccination not only as the preserver of the human features from a most loathsome disfigurement but as a sanitary agent in the prolongation of life twenty five forty four Fortunately the State has now made it imperative on all parents to have their children vaccinated before or by the end of the twelfth week thus doing away as far as possible with the danger to public health proceeding from the ignorance or prejudice of those parents whose want of information on the subject makes them object to the employment of this specific preventive for though vaccination has been proved not to be always an infallible guard against small pox the attack is always much lighter should it occur and is seldom if indeed ever fatal after the precaution of vaccination The best time to vaccinate a child is after the sixth and before the twelfth week if it is in perfect health but still earlier if small pox is prevalent and any danger exists of the infant taking the disease It is customary and always advisable to give the child a mild aperient powder one or two days before inserting the lymph in the arm and should measles scarlet fever or any other disease arise during the progress of the pustule the child when recovered should be re vaccinated and the lymph taken from its arm on no account used for vaccinating purposes twenty five forty five The disease of cow pox generally takes twenty days to complete its course in other words the maturity and declension of the pustule takes that time to fulfil its several changes The mode of vaccination is either to insert the matter or lymph taken from a healthy child under the cuticle in several places on both arms or which is still better to make three slight scratches or abrasions with a lancet on one arm in this manner and work into the irritated parts the lymph allowing the arm to dry thoroughly before putting down the infant s sleeve by this means absorption is insured and the unnecessary pain of several pustules on both arms avoided No apparent change is observable by the eye for several days indeed not till the fourth in many cases is there any evidence of a vesicle about the fifth day however a pink areola or circle is observed round one or all of the places surrounding a small pearly vesicle or bladder This goes on deepening in hue till the seventh or eighth day when the vesicle is about an inch in diameter with a depressed centre on the ninth the edges are elevated and the surrounding part hard and inflamed The disease is now at its height and the pustule should be opened if not for the purpose of vaccinating other children to allow the escape of the lymph and subdue the inflammatory action After the twelfth day the centre is covered by a brown scab and the colour of the swelling becomes darker gradually declining in hardness and colour till the twentieth when the scab falls off leaving a small pit or cicatrix to mark the seat of the disease and for life prove a certificate of successful vaccination twenty five forty six In some children the inflammation and swelling of the arm is excessive and extremely painful and the fever about the ninth or tenth day very high the pustule therefore at that time should sometimes be opened the arm fomented every two hours with a warm bread poultice and an aperient powder given to the infant MEASLES AND SCARLET FEVER WITH THE TREATMENT OF BOTH Measles twenty five forty seven This much dreaded disease which forms the next subject in our series of infantine diseases and which entails more evils on the health of childhood than any other description of physical suffering to which that age of life is subject may be considered more an affection of the venous circulation tending to general and local congestion attended with a diseased condition of the blood than either as a fever or an inflammation and though generally classed before or after scarlet fever is in its pathology and treatment irrespective of its after consequences as distinct and opposite as one disease can well be from another four thousand five hundred forty eight As we have already observed measles are always characterized by the running at the nose and eyes and great oppression of breathing so in the mode of treatment two objects are to be held especially in view first to unload the congested state of the lungs the cause of the oppressed breathing and secondly to act vigorously both during the disease and afterwards on the bowels At the same time it cannot be too strongly borne in mind that though the patient in measles should on no account be kept unduly hot more care than in most infantine complaints should be taken to guard the body from cold or any abrupt changes of temperature With these special observations we shall proceed to give a description of the disease as recognized by its usual twenty five forty nine Symptoms which commence with cold chills and flushes lassitude heaviness pain in the head and drowsiness cough hoarseness and extreme difficulty of breathing frequent sneezing deduction or running at the eyes and nose nausea sometimes vomiting thirst a furred tongue the pulse throughout is quick and sometimes full and soft at others hard and small with other indications of an inflammatory nature twenty five fifty On the third day small red points make their appearance first on the face and neck gradually extending over the upper and lower part of the body On the fifth day the vivid red of the eruption changes into a brownish hue and in two or three days more the rash entirely disappears leaving a loose powdery desquamation on the skin which rubs off like dandriff At this stage of the disease a diarrhoea frequently comes on which being what is called critical should never be checked unless seriously severe Measles sometimes assume a typhoid or malignant character in which form the symptoms are all greatly exaggerated and the case from the first becomes both doubtful and dangerous In this condition the eruption comes out sooner and only in patches and often after showing for a few hours suddenly recedes presenting instead of the usual florid red a dark purple or blackish hue a dark brown fur forms on the gums and mouth the breathing becomes laborious delirium supervenes and if unrelieved is followed by coma a fetid diarrhoea takes place and the patient sinks under the congested state of the lungs and the oppressed functions of the brain twenty five fifty one The unfavourable symptoms in measles are a high degree of fever the excessive heat and dryness of the skin hurried and short breathing and a particularly hard pulse The sequels or after consequences of measles are croup bronchitis mesenteric disease abscesses behind the ear ophthalmia and glandular swellings in other parts of the body twenty five fifty two Treatment In the first place the patient should be kept in a cool room the temperature of which must be regulated to suit the child s feelings of comfort and the diet adapted to the strictest principles of abstinence When the inflammatory symptoms are severe bleeding in some form is often necessary though when adopted it must be in the first stage of the disease and if the lungs are the apprehended seat of the inflammation two or more leeches according to the age and strength of the patient must be applied to the upper part of the chest followed by a small blister or the blister may be substituted for the leeches the attendant bearing in mind that the benefit effected by the blister can always be considerably augmented by plunging the feet into very hot water about a couple of hours after applying the blister and kept in the water for about two minutes And let it further be remembered that this immersion of the feet in hot water may be adopted at any time or stage of the disease and that whenever the head or lungs are oppressed relief will always accrue from its sudden and brief employment When the symptoms commence with much shivering and the skin early assumes a hot dry character the appearance of the rash will be facilitated and all the other symptoms rendered milder if the patient is put into a warm bath and kept in the water for about three minutes Or where that is not convenient the following process which will answer quite as well can be substituted Stand the child naked in a tub and having first prepared several jugs of sufficiently warm water empty them in quick succession over the patient s shoulders and body immediately wrap in a hot blanket and put the child to bed till it rouses from the sleep that always follows the effusion or bath This agent by lowering the temperature of the skin and opening the pores producing a natural perspiration and unloading the congested state of the lungs in most cases does away entirely with the necessity both for leeches and a blister Whether any of these external means have been employed or not the first internal remedies should commence with a series of aperient powders and a saline mixture as prescribed in the following formularies at the same time as a beverage to quench the thirst let a quantity of barley water be made slightly acidulated by the juice of an orange and partially sweetened by some sugar candy and of which when properly made and cold let the patient drink as often as thirst or the dryness of the mouth renders necessary twenty five fifty three Aperient Powders Take of scammony and jalap each twenty four grains grey powder and powdered antimony each eighteen grains Mix and divide into twelve powders if for a child between two and four years of age into eight powders if for a child between four and eight years of ago and into six powders for between eight and twelve years One powder to be given in a little jelly or sugar and water every three or four hours according to the severity of the symptoms twenty five fifty four Saline Mixture Take of mint water six ounces powdered nitre twenty grains antimonial wine three drachms spirits of nitre two drachms syrup of saffron two drachms Mix To children under three years give a teaspoonful every two hours from that age to six a dessertspoonful at the same times and a tablespoonful every three or four hours to children between six and twelve twenty five fifty five The object of these aperient powders is to keep up a steady but gentle action on the bowels but whenever it seems necessary to administer a stronger dose and effect a brisk action on the digestive organs a course particularly imperative towards the close of the disease two of these powders given at once according to the age will be found to produce that effect that is two of the twelve for a child under four years and two of the eight and two of the six according to the age of the patient twenty five fifty six When the difficulty of breathing becomes oppressive as it generally does towards night a hot bran poultice laid on the chest will be always found highly beneficial The diet throughout must be light and consist of farinaceous food such as rice and sago puddings beef tea and toast and not till convalescence sets in should hard or animal food be given twenty five fifty seven When measles assume the malignant form the advice just given must be broken through food of a nutritious and stimulating character should be at once substituted and administered in conjunction with wine and even spirits and the disease regarded and treated as a case of typhus But as this form of measles is not frequent and if occurring hardly likely to be treated without assistance it is unnecessary to enter on the minutiae of its practice here What we have prescribed in almost all cases will be found sufficient to meet every emergency without resorting to a multiplicity of agents twenty five fifty eight The great point to remember in measles is not to give up the treatment with the apparent subsidence of the disease as the after consequences of measles are too often more serious and to be more dreaded than the measles themselves To guard against this danger and thoroughly purify the system after the subsidence of all the symptoms of the disease a corrective course of medicine and a regimen of exercise should be adopted for some weeks after the cure of the disease To effect this an active aperient powder should be given every three or four clays with a daily dose of the subjoined tonic mixture with as much exercise by walking running after a hoop or other bodily exertion as the strength of the child and the state of the atmosphere will admit the patient being wherever possible removed to a purer air as soon as convalescence warrants the change twenty five fifty nine Tonic Mixture Take of infusion of rose leaves six ounces quinine eight grains diluted sulphuric acid fifteen drops Mix Dose from half a teaspoonful up to a dessertspoonful once a day according to the ago of the patient Scarlatina or Scarlet Fever twenty five sixty Though professional accuracy has divided this disease into several forms we shall keep to the one disease most generally mot with the common or simple scarlet fever which in all cases is characterized by an excessive heat on the skin sore throat and a peculiar speckled appearance of the tongue twenty five sixty one Symptoms Cold chills shivering nausea thirst hot skin quick pulse with difficulty of swallowing the tongue is coated presenting through its fur innumerable specks the elevated papillae of the tongue which gives it the speckled character that if not the invariable sign of scarlet fever is only met with in cases closely analogous to that disease Between the second and third day but most frequently on the third a bright red efflorescence breaks out in patches on the face neck and back from which it extends over the trunk and extremities always showing thicker and deeper in colour wherever there is any pressure such as the elbows back and hips when the eruption is well out the skin presents the appearance of a boiled lobster shell At first the skin is smooth but as the disease advances perceptible roughness is apparent from the elevation of the rash or more properly the pores of the skin On the fifth and sixth days the eruption begins to decline and by the eighth has generally entirely disappeared During the whole of this period there is more or less constant sore throat twenty five sixty two The Treatment of scarlet fever is in general very simple Where the heat is great and the eruption comes out with difficulty or recedes as soon as it appears the body should be sponged with cold vinegar and water or tepid water as in measles poured over the chest and body the patient being as in that disease wrapped in a blanket and put to bed and the same powders and mixture ordered in measles administered with the addition of a constant hot bran poultice round the throat which should be continued from the first symptom till a day or two after the declension of the rash The same low diet and cooling drink with the same general instructions are to be obeyed in this as in the former disease twenty five sixty three When the fever runs high in the first stage and there is much nausea before employing the effusions of water give the patient an emetic of equal parts of ipecacuanha and antimonial wine in doses of from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful according to age By these means nine out of every ten cases of scarlatina may be safely and expeditiously cured especially if the temperature of the patient s room is kept at an even standard of about sixty degrees HOOPING COUGH CROUP AND DIARRHOEA WITH THEIR MODE OF TREATMENT Hooping Cough twenty five sixty four THIS is purely a spasmodic disease and is only infectious through the faculty of imitation a habit that all children are remarkably apt to fall into and even where adults have contracted hooping cough it has been from the same cause and is as readily accounted for on the principle of imitation as that the gaping of one person will excite or predispose a whole party to follow the same spasmodic example If any one associates for a few days with a person who stammers badly he will find when released from his company that the sequence of his articulation and the fluency of his speech are for a time gone and it will be a matter of constant vigilance and some difficulty to overcome the evil of so short an association The manner in which a number of school girls will one after another fall into a fit on beholding one of their number attacked with epilepsy must be familiar to many These several facts lead us to a juster notion of how to treat this spasmodic disease Every effort should therefore be directed mentally and physically to break the chain of nervous action on which the continuance of the cough depends twenty five sixty five Symptoms Hooping cough comes on with a slight oppression of breathing thirst quick pulse hoarseness and a hard dry cough This state may exist without any change from one to two or three weeks before the peculiar feature of the disease the hoop sets in As the characteristics of this cough are known to all it is unnecessary to enter here physiologically on the subject We shall therefore merely remark that the frequent vomiting and bleeding at the mouth or nose are favourable signs and proceed to the twenty five sixty six Treatment which should consist in keeping up a state of nausea and vomiting For this purpose give the child doses of ipecacuanha and antimonial wines in equal parts and quantities varying from half to one and a half teaspoonful once a day or when the expectoration is hard and difficult of expulsion giving the following cough mixture every four hours Take of Syrup of squills one two ounce Antimonial wine one ounce Laudanum fifteen drops Syrup of Toulou two drachms Water one one two ounce Mix The dose is from half a spoonful to a dessertspoonful When the cough is urgent the warm bath is to be used and either one or two leeches applied over the breastbone or else a small blister laid on the lower part of the throat twenty five sixty seven Such is the medical treatment of hooping cough but there is a moral regimen based on the nature of the disease which should never be omitted And on the principle that a sudden start or diversion of the mind will arrest a person in the act of sneezing or gaping so the like means should be adopted with the hooping cough patient and in the first stage before the hooping has been added the parent should endeavour to break the paroxysm of the cough by abruptly attracting the patient s attention and thus if possible preventing the cough from reaching that height when the ingulp of air gives the hoop or crow that marks the disease but when once that symptom has set in it becomes still more necessary to endeavour by even measures of intimidation to break the spasmodic chain of the cough Exercise in the open air when dry is also requisite and charge of scene and air in all cases is of absolute necessity and may be adopted at any stage of the disease Croup twenty five sixty eight This is by far the most formidable and fatal of all the diseases to which infancy and childhood are liable and is purely an inflammatory affection attacking that portion of the mucous membrane lining the windpipe and bronchial tubes and from the effect of which a false or loose membrane is formed along the windpipe resembling in appearance the finger of a glove suspended in the passage and consequently terminating the life of the patient by suffocation for as the lower end grows together and becomes closed no air can enter the lungs and the child dies choked All dull fat and heavy children are peculiarly predisposed to this disease and those with short necks and who make a wheezing noise in their natural breathing Croup is always sudden in its attack and rapid in its career usually proving fatal within three days most frequently commences in the night and generally attacking children between the ages of three and ten years Mothers should therefore be on their guard who have children predisposed to this disease and immediately resort to the means hereafter advised twenty five sixty nine Symptoms Languor and restlessness hoarseness wheezing and short dry cough with occasional rattling in the throat during sleep the child often plucking at its throat with its fingers difficulty of breathing which quickly becomes hard and laboured causing great anxiety of the countenance and the veins of the neck to swell and become knotted the voice in speaking acquires a sharp crowing or croupy sound while the inspirations have a harsh metallic intonation After a few hours a quantity of thick ropy mucus is thrown out hanging about the mouth and causing suffocating fits of coughing to expel twenty five seventy Treatment Place the child immediately in a hot bath up to the throat and on removal from the water give an emetic of the antimonial or ipecacuanha wine and when the vomiting has subsided lay a long blister down the front of the throat and administer one of the following powders every twenty minutes to a child from three to six years of age twenty five seventy one Take of calomel twelve grains tartar emetic two grains lump sugar thirty grains Mix accurately and divide into twelve powders For a child from six to twelve years divide into six powders and give one every half hour twenty five seventy two Should the symptoms remain unabated after a few hours apply one or two leeches to the throat and put mustard poultices to the foot and thighs retaining them about eight minutes and in extreme cases a mustard poultice to the spine between the shoulders and at the same time rub mercurial ointment into the armpits and the angles of the jaws twenty five seventy three Such is a vigorous and reliable system of treatment in severe cases of croup but in the milder and more general form the following abridgment will in all probability be all that will be required First the hot bath second the emetic third a mustard plaster round the throat for five minutes fourth the powders fifth another emetic in six hours if needed and the powders continued without intermission while the urgency of the symptoms continues When relief has been obtained these are to be discontinued and a dose of senna tea given to act on the bowels Diarrhoea twenty five seventy four The diarrhoea with which children are so frequently affected especially in infancy should demand the nurse s immediate attention and when the secretion from its clayey colour indicates an absence of bile a powder composed of three grains of grey powder and one grain of rhubarb should be given twice with an interval of four hours between each dose to a child from one to two years and a day or two afterwards an aperient powder containing the same ingredients and quantities with the addition of two or three grains of scammony For the relaxation consequent on an overloaded stomach or acidity in the bowels a little magnesia dissolved in milk should be employed two or three times a day twenty five seventy five When much griping and pain attend the diarrhoea half a teaspoonful of Dalby s Carminative the best of all patent medicines should be given either with or without a small quantity of castor oil to carry off the exciting cause twenty five seventy six For any form of diarrhoea that by excessive action demands a speedy correction the most efficacious remedy that can be employed in all ages and conditions of childhood is the tincture of Kino of which from ten to thirty drops mixed with a little sugar and water in a spoon are to be given every two or three hours till the undue action has been checked Often the change of diet to rice milk eggs or the substitution of animal for vegetable food or vice versa will correct an unpleasant and almost chronic state of diarrhoea twenty five seventy seven A very excellent carminative powder for flatulent infants may be kept in the house and employed with advantage whenever the child is in pain or griped by dropping five grains of oil of aniseed and two of peppermint on half an ounce of lump sugar and rubbing it in a mortar with a drachm of magnesia into a fine powder A small quantity of this may be given in a little water at any time and always with benefit THE DOCTOR CHAPTER XLIII twenty five seventy eight Time according to the old proverb is money and it may also in many cases and with equal truthfulness be said to be life for a few moments in great emergencies often turn the balance between recovery and death This applies more especially to all kinds of poisoning fits submersion in water or exposure to noxious gases and many accidents If people knew how to act during the interval that must necessarily elapse from the moment that a medical man is sent for until he arrives many lives might be saved which now unhappily are lost Generally speaking however nothing is done all is confusion and fright and the surgeon on his arrival finds that death has already seized its victim who had his friends but known a few rough rules for their guidance might have been rescued We shall therefore in a series of papers give such information as to the means to be employed in event of accidents injuries c as by the aid of a gentleman of large professional experience we are warranted in recommending List of Drugs c necessary to carry out all Instructions twenty five seventy nine We append at once A LIST OF DRUGS c and a few PRESCRIPTIONS necessary to carry out all the instructions given in this series of articles It will be seen that they are few they are not expensive and by laying in a little stock of them our instructions will be of instant value in all cases of accident c The drugs are Antimonial Wine Antimonial Powder Blister Compound Blue Pill Calomel Carbonate of Potash Compound Iron Pills Compound Extract of Colocynth Compound Tincture of Camphor Epsom Salts Goulard s Extract Jalap in Powder Linseed Oil Myrrh and Aloes Pills Nitre Oil of Turpentine Opium powdered and Laudanum Sal Ammoniac Senna Leaves Soap Liniment Opodeldoc Sweet Spirits of Nitre Turner s Cerate To which should be added Common Adhesive Plaster Isinglass Plaster Lint A pair of small Scales with Weights An ounce and a drachm Measure glass A Lancet A Probe A pair of Forceps and some curved Needles twenty five eighty The following PRESCRIPTIONS may be made up for a few shillings and by keeping them properly labelled and by referring to the remarks on the treatment of any particular case much suffering and perhaps some lives may be saved twenty five eighty one Draught Twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water This draught is to be repeated in a quarter of an hour if vomiting does not take place twenty five eighty two Clyster Two tablespoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of warm gruel twenty five eighty three Liniments one Equal parts of lime water and linseed oil well mixed together Lime water is made thus Pour six pints of boiling water upon one four lb of lime mix well together and when cool strain the liquid from off the lime which has fallen to the bottom taking care to get it as clear as possible two Compound camphor liniment twenty five eighty four Lotions one Mix a dessert spoonful of Goulard s extract and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar in a pint of water two Mix one two oz of sal ammoniac two tablespoonfuls of vinegar and the same quantity of gin or whisky in half a pint of water twenty five eighty five Goulard Lotion one drachm of sugar of lead two pints of rain water two teaspoonfuls of spirits of wine For inflammation of the eyes or elsewhere The better way of making Goulard Lotion if for the eyes is to add to six oz of distilled water or water that has been well boiled one drachm of the extract of lead twenty five eighty six Opodeldoc This lotion being a valuable application for sprains lumbago weakness of joints c and it being difficult to procure either pure or freshly made we give a recipe for its preparation Dissolve one oz of camphor in a pint of rectified spirits of wine then dissolve four oz of hard white Spanish soap scraped thin in four oz of oil of rosemary and mix them together twenty five eighty seven The Common Black Draught Infusion of senna ten drachms Epsom salts ten drachms tincture of senna compound tincture of cardamums compound spirit of lavender of each one drachm Families who make black draught in quantity and wish to preserve it for some time without spoiling should add about two drachms of spirits of hartshorn to each pint of the strained mixture the use of this drug being to prevent its becoming mouldy or decomposed A simpler and equally efficacious form of black draught is made by infusing one two oz of Alexandrian senna three oz of Epsom salts and two drachms of bruised ginger and coriander seeds for several hours in a pint of boiling water straining the liquor and adding either two drachms of sal volatile or spirits of hartshorn to the whole and giving three tablespoonfuls for a dose to an adult twenty five eighty eight

two pills twenty five ninety two Pills one Mix five grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little bread crumb and make into two pills Dose for a full grown person two pills two Mix five grains of blue pill and the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth together and make into two pills the dose for a full grown person twenty five ninety three Powders Mix a grain of calomel and four grains of powdered jalap together twenty five ninety four In all cases the dose of medicines given is to be regulated by the age of the patient twenty five ninety five Abernethy s Plan for making a Bread and Water Poultice First scald out a basin then having put in some boiling water throw in coarsely crumbled bread and cover it with a plate When the bread has soaked up as much water as it will imbibe drain off the remaining water and there will be left a light pulp Spread it a third of an inch thick on folded linen and apply it when of the temperature of a warm bath To preserve it moist occasionally drop warm water on it twenty five ninety six Linseed Meal Poultice Scald your basin by pouring a little hot water into it then put a small quantity of finely ground linseed meal into the basin pour a little hot water on it and stir it round briskly until you have well incorporated them add a little more meal and a little more water then stir it again Do not let any lumps remain in the basin but stir the poultice well and do not be sparing of your trouble What you do next is to take as much of it out of the basin as you may require lay it on a piece of soft linen and let it be about a quarter of an inch thick Abernethy twenty five ninety seven Mustard Poultice Mix equal parts of dry mustard and linseed meal in warm vinegar When the poultice is wanted weak warm water may be used for the vinegar and when it is required very strong mustard alone without any linseed meal is to be mixed with warm vinegar twenty five ninety eight An ordinary Blister Spread a little blister compound on a piece of common adhesive plaster with the right thumb It should be put on just thickly enough to conceal the appearance of the plaster beneath The part from which a blister has been taken should be covered till it heals over with soft linen rags smeared with lard Baths and Fomentations twenty five ninety nine All fluid applications to the body are exhibited either in a hot or cold form and the object for which they are administered is to produce a stimulating effect over the entire or a part of the system for the effect though differently obtained and varying in degree is the same in principle whether procured by hot or cold water twenty six hundred Heat There are three forms in which heat is universally applied to the body that of the tepid warm and vapour bath but as the first is too inert to be worth notice and the last dangerous and inapplicable except in public institutions we shall confine our remarks to the really efficacious and always attainable one the twenty six oh one Warm and Hot Bath These baths are used whenever there is congestion or accumulation of blood in the internal organs causing pain difficulty of breathing or stupor and are employed by their stimulating property to cause a rush of blood to the surface and by unloading the great organs produce a temporary inflammation in the skin and so equalize the circulation The effect of the hot bath is to increase the fulness of the pulse accelerate respiration and excite perspiration In all inflammations of the stomach and bowels the hot bath is of the utmost consequence the temperature of the warm bath varies from ninety two deg to one hundred deg and may be obtained by those who have no thermometer to test the exact heat by mixing one measure of boiling with two of cold water twenty six oh two Fomentations are generally used to effect in a part the benefit produced on the whole body by the bath to which a sedative action is occasionally given by the use of roots herbs or other ingredients the object being to relieve the internal organ as the throat or muscles round a joint by exciting a greater flow of blood to the skin over the affected part As the real agent of relief is heat the fomentation should always be as hot as it can comfortably be borne and to insure effect should be repeated every half hour Warm fluids are applied in order to render the swelling which accompanies inflammation less painful by the greater readiness with which the skin yields than when it is harsh and dry They are of various kinds but the most simple and oftentimes the most useful that can be employed is Warm Water Another kind of fomentation is composed of dried poppyheads four oz Break them to pieces empty out the seeds put them into four pints of water boil for a quarter of an hour then strain through a cloth or sieve and keep the water for use Or chamomile flowers hemlock and many other plants may be boiled and the part fomented with the hot liquor by means of flannels wetted with the decoction twenty six oh three Cold when applied in excess to the body drives the blood from the surface to the centre reduces the pulse makes the breathing hard and difficult produces coma and if long continued death But when medicinally used it excites a reaction on the surface equivalent to a stimulating effect as in some cases of fever when the body has been sponged with cold water it excites by reaction increased circulation on the skin Cold is sometimes used to keep up a repellent action as when local inflammation takes place a remedy is applied which by its benumbing and astringent effect causes the blood or the excess of it in the part to recede and by contracting the vessels prevents the return of any undue quantity till the affected part recovers its tone Such remedies are called Lotions and should when used be applied with the same persistency as the fomentation for as the latter should be renewed as often as the heat passes off so the former should be applied as often as the heat from the skin deprives the application of its cold twenty six oh four Poultices are only another form of fomentation though chiefly used for abscesses The ingredient best suited for a poultice is that which retains heat the longest of these ingredients the best are linseed meal bran and bread Bran sewed into a bag as it can be reheated will be found the cleanest and most useful especially for sore throats How to Bleed twenty six oh five In cases of great emergency such as the strong kind of apoplexy and when a surgeon cannot possibly be obtained for some considerable time the life of the patient depends almost entirely upon the fact of his being bled or not We therefore give instructions how the operation of bleeding is to be performed but caution the reader only to attempt it in cases of the greatest emergency Place a handkerchief or piece of tape rather but not too tightly round the arm about three or four inches above the elbow This will cause the veins below to swell and become very evident If this is not sufficient the hand should be constantly and quickly opened and shut for the same purpose There will now be seen passing up the middle of the fore arm a vein which just below the bend of the elbow sends a branch inwards and outwards each branch shortly joining another large vein It is from the outer branch that the person is to be bled The right arm is the one mostly operated on The operator should take the lancet in his right hand between the thumb and first finger place the thumb of his left hand on the vein below the part where he is going to bleed from and then gently thrust the tip of the lancet into the vein and taking care not to push it too deeply cut in a gently curved direction thus and bring it out point upwards at about half an inch from the part of the vein into which he had thrust it The vein must be cut lengthways and not across When sufficient blood has been taken away remove the bandage from above the elbow and place the thumb of the left hand firmly over the cut until all the bleeding ceases A small pad of lint is then to be put over the cut with a larger pad over it and the two kept in their places by means of a handkerchief or linen roller bound pretty tightly over them and round the arm twenty six oh six When a person is bled he should always be in the standing or at any rate in the sitting position for if as is often the case he should happen to faint he can in most eases at least easily be brought to again by the operator placing him flat on his back and stopping the bleeding This is of the greatest importance It has been recommended for what supposed advantages we don t know to bleed people when they are lying down Should a person under these circumstances faint what could be done to bring him to again The great treatment of lowering the body of the patient to the flat position cannot be followed here It is in that position already and cannot be placed lower than it at present is except as is most likely to be the case under the ground twenty six oh seven BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE Many children especially those of a sanguineous temperament are subject to sudden discharges of blood from some part of the body and as all such fluxes are in general the result of an effort of nature to relieve the system from some overload or pressure such discharges unless in excess and when likely to produce debility should not be rashly or too abruptly checked In general these discharges are confined to the summer or spring months of the year and follow pains in the head a sense of drowsiness languor or oppression and as such symptoms are relieved by the loss of blood the hemorrhage should to a certain extent be encouraged When however the bleeding is excessive or returns too frequently it becomes necessary to apply means to subdue or mitigate the amount For this purpose the sudden and unexpected application of cold is itself sufficient in most cases to arrest the most active hemorrhage A wet towel laid suddenly on the back between the shoulders and placing the child in a recumbent posture is often sufficient to effect the object where however the effusion resists such simple means napkins wrung out of cold water must be laid across the forehead and nose the hands dipped in cold water and a bottle of hot water applied to the feet If in spite of these means the bleeding continues a little fine wool or a few folds of lint tied together by a piece of thread must be pushed up the nostril from which the blood flows to act as a plug and pressure on the bleeding vessel When the discharge has entirely ceased the plug is to be pulled out by means of the thread To prevent a repetition of the hemorrhage the body should be sponged every morning with cold water and the child put under a course of steel wine have open air exercise and if possible salt water bathing For children a key suddenly dropped down the back between the skin and clothes will often immediately arrest a copious bleeding twenty six oh eight SPITTING OF BLOOD or hemorrhage from the lungs is generally known from blood from the stomach by its being of a brighter colour and in less quantities than that which is always grumous and mixed with the half digested food In either case rest should be immediately enjoined total abstinence from stimulants and a low poor diet accompanied with the horizontal position and bottles of boiling water to the feet At the same time the patient should suck through a quill every hour half a wine glass of water in which ten or fifteen drops of the elixir of vitriol has been mixed and till further advice has been procured keep a towel wrung out of cold water on the chest or stomach according to the seat of the hemorrhage Bites and Stings twenty six oh nine BITES AND STINGS may be divided into three kinds one Those of Insects two Those of Snakes three Those of Dogs and other Animals twenty six ten one The Bites or Stings of Insects such as gnats bees wasps c need cause very little alarm and are generally speaking easily cured They are very serious however when they take place on some delicate part of the body such as near the eye or in the throat The treatment is very simple in most cases and consists in taking out the sting if it is left behind with a needle and applying to the part a liniment made of finely scraped chalk and olive oil mixed together to about the thickness of cream twenty six eleven Bathing the part bitten with warm turpentine or warm vinegar is also of great use If the person feels faint he should lie quietly on his back and take a little brandy and water or sal volatile and water When the inside of the throat is the part stung there is great danger of violent inflammation taking place In this case from eight to twelve leeches should be immediately put to the outside of the throat and when they drop off the part to which they had been applied should be well fomented with warm water The inside of the throat is to be constantly gargled with salt and water Bits of ice are to be sucked Rubbing the face and hands well over with plain olive oil before going to bed will often keep gnats and musquitoes from biting during the night Strong scent such as eau de Cologne will have the same effect twenty six twelve two Bites of Snakes These are much more dangerous than the preceding and require more powerful remedies The bites of the different kinds of snakes do not all act alike but affect people in different ways Treatment of the part bitten The great thing is to prevent the poison getting into the blood and if possible to remove the whole of it at once from the body A pocket handkerchief a piece of tape or cord or in fact of anything that is at hand should be tied tightly round the part of the body bitten if it be the leg or arm immediately above the bite and between it and the heart The bite should then be sucked several times by any one who is near There is no danger in this provided the person who does it has not got the skin taken off any part of his mouth What has been sucked into the mouth should be immediately spit out again But if those who are near have sufficient nerve for the operation and a suitable instrument they should cut out the central part bitten and then bathe the wound for some time with warm water to make it bleed freely The wound should afterwards be rubbed with a stick of lunar caustic or what is better a solution of this sixty grains of lunar caustic dissolved in an ounce of water should be dropped into it The band should be kept on the part during the whole of the time that these means are being adopted The wound should afterwards be covered with lint dipped in cold water The best plan however to be adopted if it can be managed is the following take a common wine glass and holding it upside down put a lighted candle or a spirit lamp into it for a minute or two This will take out the air Then clap the glass suddenly over the bitten part and it will become attached and hold on to the flesh The glass being nearly empty the blood containing the poison will in consequence flow into it from the wound of its own accord This process should be repeated three or four times and the wound sucked or washed with warm water before each application of the glass As a matter of course when the glass is removed all the blood should be washed out of it before it is applied again Constitutional Treatment There is mostly at first great depression of strength in these cases and it is therefore requisite to give some stimulant a glass of hot brandy and water or twenty drops of sal volatile is the best that can be given When the strength has returned and if the patient has not already been sick a little mustard in hot water should be given to make him so If on the other hand as is often the case the vomiting is excessive a large mustard poultice should be placed over the stomach and a grain of solid opium swallowed in the form of a pill for the purpose of stopping it Only one of these pills should be given by a non professional person In all cases of bites from snakes send for a surgeon as quickly as possible and act according to the above directions until he arrives If he is within any reasonable distance content yourself by putting on the band sucking the wound applying the glass and if necessary giving a little brandy and water twenty six thirteen three Bites of Dogs For obvious reasons these kinds of bites are more frequently met with than those of snakes The treatment is the same as that for snake bites more especially that of the bitten part The majority of writers on the subject are in favour of keeping the wound open as long as possible This may be done by putting a few beans on it and then by applying a large linseed meal poultice over them Injuries and Accidents to Bones twenty six fourteen Dislocation of Bones When the end of a bone is pushed out of its natural position it is said to be dislocated This may be caused by violence disease or natural weakness of the parts about a joint Symptoms Deformity about the joint with unnatural prominence at one part and depression at another The limb may be shorter or longer than usual and is stiff and unable to be moved differing in these last two respects from a broken limb which is mostly shorter never longer than usual and which is always more movable Treatment So much practical science and tact are requisite in order to bring a dislocated bone into its proper position again that we strongly advise the reader never to interfere in these cases unless indeed it is altogether impossible to obtain the services of a surgeon But because any one of us may very possibly be placed in that emergency we give a few rough rules for the reader s guidance In the first place make the joint from which the bone has been displaced perfectly steady either by fixing it to some firm object or else by holding it with the hands then pull the dislocated bone in a direction towards the place from which it has been thrust so that if it moves at all from its unnatural position it may have the best chance of returning to its proper place Do not however pull or press against the parts too violently as you may perhaps by doing so rupture blood vessels and produce most serious consequences When you do attempt to reduce a dislocated bone do it as quickly as possible after the accident has taken place every hour making the operation more difficult When the patient is very strong he may be put into a warm bath until he feels faint or have sixty drops of antimonial wine given him every ten minutes until he feels sickish These two means are of great use in relaxing the muscles If the bone has been brought back again to its proper place keep it there by means of bandages and if there is much pain about the joint apply a cold lotion to it and keep it perfectly at rest The lotion should be a dessert spoonful of Goulard s extract and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar mixed in a pint of water Leeches are sometimes necessary Unless the local pain or general feverish symptoms are great the patient s diet should be the same as usual Dislocations may be reduced a week or even a fortnight after they have taken place As therefore although the sooner a bone is reduced the better there is no very great emergency and as the most serious consequences may follow improper or too violent treatment it is always better for people in these cases to do too little than too much inasmuch as the good which has not yet may still be done whereas the evil that has been done cannot so easily be undone twenty six fifteen FRACTURES OF BONES Symptoms one Deformity of the part two Unnatural looseness three A grating sound when the two ends of the broken bone are rubbed together four Loss of natural motion and power In some cases there is also shortening of the limb Fracture takes place from several causes as a fall a blow a squeeze and sometimes from the violent action of muscles Treatment In cases where a surgeon cannot be procured immediately after the accident the following general rules are offered for the reader s guidance The broken limb should be placed and kept as nearly as possible in its natural position This is to be done by first pulling the two portions of the bone in opposite directions until the limb becomes as long as the opposite one and then by applying a splint and binding it to the part by means of a roller When there is no deformity the pulling is of course unnecessary If there is much swelling about the broken part a cold lotion is to be applied This lotion which we will call Lotion No one may be thus made Mix a dessert spoonful of Goulard s extract and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar in a pint of water When the leg or arm is broken always if possible get it to the same length and form as the opposite limb The broken part should be kept perfectly quiet When a broken limb is deformed and a particular muscle is on the stretch place the limb in such a position as will relax it This will in most cases cure the deformity Brandy and water or sal volatile and water are to be given when the patient is faint Surgical aid should of course be procured as soon as possible twenty six sixteen JOINTS INJURIES TO All kinds of injuries to joints of whatever description require particular attention in consequence of the violent inflammations which are so liable to take place in these parts of the body and which do so much mischief in a little time The joint injured should always be kept perfectly at rest and when it is very painful and the skin about it red swollen hot and shining at the same time that the patient has general feverish symptoms such as great thirst and headache leeches and when they drop off warm poppy fomentations are to be applied the No one pills above mentioned are to be given two are a dose for a grown person with a black draught three hours afterwards Give also two tablespoonfuls of the fever mixture every four hours and keep the patient on low diet When the injury and swelling are not very great warm applications with rest low diet and a dose of aperient medicine will be sufficient When a joint has received a penetrating wound it will require the most powerful treatment and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon The patient s friends will have to use their own judgment to a great extent in these and in many other cases as to when leeches fever mixture c are necessary A universal rule however without a single exception is always to rest a joint well after it has been injured in any way whatever to purge the patient and to keep him on low diet without beer unless he has been a very great drinker indeed in which case he may still be allowed to take a little for if the stimulant that a person has been accustomed to in excess be all taken away at once he is very likely to have an attack of delirium tremens The quantity given should not however be much say a pint or at the most a pint and a half a day Rubbing the joint with opodeldoc or the application of a blister to it is of great service in taking away the thickenings which often remain after all heat pain and redness have left an injured joint Great care should be observed in not using a joint too quickly after it has been injured When the shoulder joint is the one injured the arm should be bound tightly to the body by means of a linen or flannel roller and the elbow raised when the elbow it should be kept raised in the straight position on a pillow when the wrist it should be raised on the chest and suspended in a sling when the knee it should be kept in the straight position and lastly when the ankle it should be a little raised on a pillow twenty six seventeen BRUISES LACERATIONS AND CUTS Wherever the bruise may be or however swollen or discoloured the skin may become two or three applications of the extract of lead kept to the part by means of lint will in an hour or little more remove all pain swelling and tenderness Simple or clean cuts only require the edges of the wound to be placed in their exact situation drawn close together and secured there by one or two slips of adhesive plaster When the wound however is jagged or the flesh or cuticle lacerated the parts are to be laid as smooth and regular as possible and a piece of lint wetted in the extract of lead laid upon the wound and a piece of greased lint placed above it to prevent the dressing sticking the whole covered over to protect from injury and the part dressed in the same manner once a day till the cure is effected twenty six eighteen BRUISES AND THEIR TREATMENT The best application for a bruise be it large or small is moist warmth therefore a warm bread and water poultice in hot moist flannels should be put on as they supple the skin If the bruise be very severe and in the neighbourhood of a joint it will be well to apply ten or a dozen leeches over the whole bruised part and afterwards a poultice But leeches should not be put on young children If the bruised part be the knee or the ankle walking should not be attempted till it can be performed without pain Inattention to this point often lays the foundation for serious mischief in these joints especially in the case of scrofulous persons In all conditions of bruises occurring in children whether swellings or abrasions no remedy is so quick or certain of effecting a cure as the pure extract of lead applied to the part Burns and Scalds twenty six nineteen BURNS AND SCALDS being essentially the same in all particulars and differing only in the manner of their production may be spoken of together As a general rule scalds are less severe than burns because the heat of water by which scalds are mostly produced is not even when it is boiling so intense as that of flame oil however and other liquids whose boiling point is high produce scalds of a very severe nature Burns and scalds have been divided into three classes The first class comprises those where the burn is altogether superficial and merely reddens the skin the second where the injury is greater and we get little bladders containing a fluid called serum dotted over the affected part in the third class we get in the case of burns a charring and in that of scalds a softening or pulpiness perhaps a complete and immediate separation of the part This may occur at once or in the course of a little time The pain from the second kind of burns is much more severe than that in the other two although the danger as a general rule is less than it is in the third class These injuries are much more dangerous when they take place on the trunk than when they happen on the arms or legs The danger arises more from the extent of surface that is burnt than from the depth to which the burn goes This rule of course has certain exceptions because a small burn on the chest or belly penetrating deeply is more dangerous than a more extensive but superficial one on the arm or leg When a person s clothes are in flames the best way of extinguishing them is to wind a rug or some thick material tightly round the whole of the body twenty six twenty Treatment of the First Class of Burns and Scalds Of the part affected Cover it immediately with a good coating of common flour or cotton wool with flour dredged well into it The great thing is to keep the affected surface of the skin from the contact of the air The part will shortly get well and the skin may or may not peel off Constitutional Treatment If the burn or scald is not extensive and there is no prostration of strength this is very simple and consists in simply giving a little aperient medicine pills No two as follows Mix five grains of blue pill and the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth and make into two pills the dose for a full grown person Three hours after the pills give a black draught If there are general symptoms of fever such as hot skin thirst headache c c two tablespoonfuls of fever mixture are to be given every four hours The fever mixture we remind our readers is made thus Mix a drachm of powdered nitro two drachms of carbonate of potash two teaspoonfuls of antimonial wine and a tablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitro in half a pint of water twenty six twenty one Second Class Local Treatment As the symptoms of these kinds of burns are more severe than those of the first class so the remedies appropriate to them are more powerful Having as carefully as possible removed the clothes from the burnt surface and taking care not to break the bladders spread the following liniment No one on a piece of linen or lint not the fluffy side and apply it to the part the liniment should be equal parts of lime water and linseed oil well mixed If the burn is on the trunk of the body it is better to use a warm linseed meal poultice After a few days dress the wound with Turner s cerate If the burn is at the bend of the elbow place the arm in the straight position for if it is bent the skin when healed will be contracted and the arm in all probability always remain in the same un natural position This indeed applies to all parts of the body therefore always place the part affected in the most stretched position possible Constitutional Treatment The same kind of treatment is to be used as for the first class only it must be more powerful Stimulants are move often necessary but must be given with great caution If as is often the case there is great irritability and restlessness a dose of opium paregoric in doses of from sixty to a hundred drops according to age is best is of great service The feverish symptoms will require aperient medicines and the fever mixture A drink made of about a tablespoonful of cream of tartar and a little lemon juice in a quart of warm water allowed to cool is a very nice one in these cases The diet throughout should not be too low especially if there is much discharge from the wound After a few days it is often necessary to give wine ammonia and strong beef tea These should be had recourse to when the tongue gets dry and dark and the pulse weak and frequent If there should be after the lapse of a week or two pain over one particular part of the belly a blister should be put on it and a powder of mercury and chalk grey powder and Dover s powder two grains of the former and five of the latter given three times a day Affections of the head and chest also frequently occur as a consequence of these kinds of burns but no one who is not a medical man can treat them twenty six twenty two Third Class These are so severe as to make it impossible for a non professional person to be of much service in attending to them When they occur a surgeon should always be sent for Until he arrives however the following treatment should be adopted Place the patient full length on his back and keep him warm Apply fomentations of flannels wrung out of boiling water and sprinkled with spirits of turpentine to the part and give wine and sal volatile in such quantities as the prostration of strength requires always bearing in mind the great fact that you have to steer between two quicksands death from present prostration and death from future excitement which will always be increased in proportion to the amount of stimulants given Give therefore only just as much as is absolutely necessary to keep life in the body twenty six twenty three CONCUSSION OF BRAIN STUNNING This may be caused by a blow or a fall Symptoms Cold skin weak pulse almost total insensibility slow weak breathing pupil of eye sometimes bigger sometimes smaller than natural inability to move unwillingness to answer when spoken to These symptoms come on directly after the accident Treatment Place the patient quietly on a warm bed send for a surgeon and do nothing else for the first four or six hours After this time the skin will become hot the pulse full and the patient feverish altogether If the surgeon has not arrived by the time these symptoms have set in shave the patient s head and apply the following lotion No two Mix half an ounce of sal ammoniac two tablespoonfuls of vinegar and the same quantity of gin or whisky in half a pint of water Then give this pill No one Mix five grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little bread crumb and make into two pills Give a black draught three hours after the pill and two tablespoonfuls of the above mentioned fever mixture every four hours Keep on low diet Leeches are sometimes to be applied to the head These cases are often followed by violent inflammation of the brain They can therefore only be attended to properly throughout by a surgeon The great thing for people to do in these cases is nothing contenting themselves with putting the patient to bed and waiting the arrival of a surgeon twenty six twenty four THE CHOLERA AND AUTUMNAL COMPLAINTS To oppose cholera there seems no surer or better means than cleanliness sobriety and judicious ventilation Where there is dirt that is the place for cholera where windows and doors are kept most jealously shut there cholera will find easiest entrance and people who indulge in intemperate diet during the hot days of autumn are actually courting death To repeat it cleanliness sobriety and free ventilation almost always defy the pestilence but in case of attack immediate recourse should be had to a physician The faculty say that a large number of lives have been lost in many seasons solely from delay in seeking medical assistance They even assert that taken early the cholera is by no means a fatal disorder The copious use of salt is recommended on very excellent authority Other autumnal complaints there are of which diarrhoea is the worst example They come on with pain flatulence sickness with or without vomiting followed by loss of appetite general lassitude and weakness If attended to at the first appearance they may soon be conquered for which purpose it is necessary to assist nature in throwing off the contents of the bowels which may be one by means of the following prescription Take of calomel three grains rhubarb eight grains mix and take it in a little honey or jelly and repeat the dose three times at the intervals of four or five hours The next purpose to be answered is the defence of the lining membrane of the intestines from their acrid contents which will be best effected by drinking copiously of linseed tea or of a drink made by pouring boiling water on quince seeds which are of a very mucilaginous nature or what is still better full draughts of whey If the complaint continue after these means have been employed some astringent or binding medicine will be required as the subjoined Take of prepared chalk two drachms cinnamon water seven oz syrup of poppies one oz mix and take three tablespoonfuls every four hours Should this fail to complete the cure one two oz of tincture of catechu or of kino may be added to it and then it will seldom fail or a teaspoonful of the tincture of kino alone with a little water every three hours till the diarrhoea is checked While any symptoms of derangement are present particular attention must be paid to the diet which should be of a soothing lubricating and light nature as instanced in veal or chicken broth which should contain but little salt Rice batter and bread puddings will be generally relished and be eaten with advantage but the stomach is too much impaired to digest food of a more solid nature Indeed we should give that organ together with the bowels as little trouble as possible while they are so incapable of acting in their accustomed manner Much mischief is frequently produced by the absurd practice of taking tincture of rhubarb which is almost certain of aggravating that species of disorder of which we have now treated for it is a spirit as strong as brandy and cannot fail of producing harm upon a surface which is rendered tender by the formation and contact of vitiated bile But our last advice is upon the first appearance of such symptoms as are above detailed have immediate recourse to a doctor where possible twenty six twenty five TO CURE A COLD Put a large teacupful of linseed with one four lb of sun raisins and two oz of stick liquorice into two quarts of soft water and let it simmer over a slow fire till reduced to one quart add to it one four lb of pounded sugar candy a tablespoonful of old rum and a tablespoonful of the best white wine vinegar or lemon juice The rum and vinegar should be added as the decoction is taken for if they are put in at first the whole soon becomes flat and less efficacious The dose is half a pint made warm on going to bed and a little may be taken whenever the cough is troublesome The worst cold is generally cured by this remedy in two or three days and if taken in time is considered infallible twenty six twenty six COLD ON THE CHEST A flannel dipped in boiling water and sprinkled with turpentine laid on the chest as quickly as possible will relieve the most severe cold or hoarseness twenty six twenty seven SUBSTANCES IN THE EYE To remove fine particles of gravel lime c the eye should be syringed with lukewarm water till free from them Be particular not to worry the eye under the impression that the substance is still there which the enlargement of some of the minute vessels makes the patient believe is actually the case twenty six twenty eight SORE EYES Incorporate thoroughly in a glass mortar or vessel one part of strong citron ointment with three parts of spermaceti ointment Use the mixture night and morning by placing a piece of the size of a pea in the corner of the eye affected only to be used in cases of chronic or long standing inflammation of the organ or its lids twenty six twenty nine LIME IN THE EYE Bathe the eye with a little weak vinegar and water and carefully remove any little piece of lime which may be seen with a feather If any lime has got entangled in the eyelashes carefully clear it away with a bit of soft linen soaked in vinegar and water Violent inflammation is sure to follow a smart purge must be therefore administered and in all probability a blister must be applied on the temple behind the ear or nape of the neck twenty six thirty STYE IN THE EYE Styes are little abscesses which form between the roots of the eyelashes and are rarely larger than a small pea The best way to manage them is to bathe them frequently with warm water or in warm poppy water if very painful When they have burst use an ointment composed of one part of citron ointment and four of spermaceti well rubbed together and smear along the edge of the eyelid Give a grain or two of calomel with five or eight grains of rhubarb according to the age of the child twice a week The old fashioned and apparently absurd practice of rubbing the stye with a ring is as good and speedy a cure as that by any process of medicinal application though the number of times it is rubbed or the quality of the ring and direction of the strokes has nothing to do with its success The pressure and the friction excite the vessels of the part and cause an absorption of the effused matter under the eyelash The edge of the nail will answer as well as a ring twenty six thirty one INFLAMMATION OF THE EYELIDS The following ointment has been found very beneficial in inflammations of the eyeball and edges of the eyelids Take of prepared calomel one scruple spermaceti ointment one two oz Mix them well together in a glass mortar apply a small quantity to each corner of the eye every night and morning and also to the edges of the lids if they are affected If this should not eventually remove the inflammation elder flower water may be applied three or four times a day by means of an eye cup The bowels should be kept in a laxative state by taking occasionally a quarter of an ounce of the Cheltenham or Epsom salts twenty six thirty two FASTING It is said by many able physicians that fasting is a means of removing incipient disease and of restoring the body to its customary healthy sensations Howard the celebrated philanthropist says a writer used to fast one day in every week Napoleon when he felt his system unstrung suspended his wonted repast and took his exercise on horseback Fits twenty six thirty three Fits come on so suddenly often without even the slightest warning and may prove fatal so quickly that all people should be acquainted at least with their leading symptoms and treatment as a few moments more or less will often decide the question between life and death The treatment in very many cases at least to be of the slightest use should be immediate as a person in a fit of apoplexy for instance may die while a surgeon is being fetched from only the next street We shall give as far as the fact of our editing a work for non professional readers will permit the peculiar and distinctive symptoms of all kind of fits and the immediate treatment to be adopted in each case twenty six thirty four APOPLEXY These fits may be divided into two kinds the strong and the weak twenty six thirty five one The strong kind These cases mostly occur in stout strong short necked bloated faced people who are in the habit of living well Symptoms The patient may or may not have had headache sparks before his eyes with confusion of ideas and giddiness for a day or two before the attack When it takes place he falls down insensible the body becomes paralyzed generally more so on one side than the other the face and head are hot and the blood vessels about them swollen the pupils of the eyes are larger than natural and the eyes themselves are fixed the mouth is mostly drawn down at one corner the breathing is like loud snoring the pulse full and hard Treatment Place the patient immediately in bed with his head well raised take off everything that he has round his neck and bleed freely and at once from the arm If you have not got a lancet use a penknife or anything suitable that may be at hand Apply warm mustard poultices to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs put two drops of castor oil mixed up with eight grains of calomel on the top of the tongue as far back as possible a most important part of the treatment being to open the bowels as quickly and freely as possible The patient cannot swallow but these medicines especially the oil will be absorbed into the stomach altogether independent of any voluntary action If possible throw up a warm turpentine clyster two tablespoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of warm gruel or if this cannot be obtained one composed of about a quart of warm salt and water and soap Cut off the hair and apply rags dipped in weak vinegar and water or weak gin and water or even simple cold water to the head If the blood vessels about the head and neck are much swollen put from eight to ten leeches on the temple opposite to the paralyzed side of the body Always send for a surgeon immediately and act according to the above rules doing more or less according to the means at hand and the length of time that must necessarily elapse until he arrives A pint or even a quart of blood in a very strong person may be taken away When the patient is able to swallow give him the No one pills and the No one mixture directly The No one pills are made as follows Mix five grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little bread crumb make into two pills the dose for a full grown person For the No one mixture dissolve on ounce of Epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea take a quarter of the mixture as a dose Repeat these remedies if the bowels are not well opened Keep the patient s head well raised and cool as above Give very low diet indeed gruel arrowroot and the like When a person is recovering he should have blisters applied to the nape of the neck his bowels should be kept well open light diet given and fatigue worry and excess of all kinds avoided twenty six thirty six two The weak kind Symptoms These attacks are more frequently preceded by warning symptoms than the first kind The face is pale the pulse weak and the body especially the hands and legs cold After a little while these symptoms sometimes alter to those of the first class in a mild degree Treatment At first if the pulse is very feeble indeed a little brandy and water or sal volatile must be given Mustard poultices are to be put as before to the soles of the foot and the insides of the thighs and legs Warm bricks or bottles filled with warm water are also to be placed under the armpits When the strength has returned the body become warmer and the pulse fuller and harder the head should be shaved and wet rags applied to it as before described Leeches should be put as before to the temple opposite the side paralyzed and the bowels should be opened as freely and as quickly as possible Bleeding from the arm is often necessary in these cases but a non professional person should never have recourse to it Blisters may be applied to the nape of the neck at once The diet in those cases should not be so low as in the former indeed it is often necessary in a day or so after one of these attacks to give wine strong beef tea c according to the condition of the patient s strength twenty six thirty seven Distinctions between Apoplexy and Epilepsy one Apoplexy mostly happens in people over thirty whereas epilepsy generally occurs under that ago at any rate for the first time A person who has epileptic fits over thirty has generally suffered from them for some years two Again in apoplexy the body is paralyzed and therefore has not the convulsions which take place in epilepsy three The peculiar snoring will also distinguish apoplexy from epilepsy twenty six thirty eight Distinctions between Apoplexy and Drunkeness one The known habits of the person two The fact of a person who was perfectly sober and sensible a little time before being found in a state of insensibility three The absence in apoplexy of the smell of drink on applying the nose to the mouth four A person in a fit of apoplexy cannot be roused at all in drunkenness he mostly can to a certain extent twenty six thirty nine Distinction between Apoplexy and Hysteria Hysterics mostly happen in young nervous unmarried women and are attended with convulsions sobbing laughter throwing about of the body c c twenty six forty Distinction between Apoplexy and Poisoning by Opium It is exceedingly difficult to distinguish between these two cases In poisoning by opium however we find the particular smell of the drug in the patient s breath We should also in forming our opinion take into consideration the person s previous conduct whether he has been low and desponding for some time before or has ever talked about committing suicide twenty six forty one EPILEPSY Falling Sickness Those fits mostly happen at any rate for the first time to young people and are more common in boys than girls They are produced by numerous causes Symptoms The fit may be preceded by pains in the head palpitations c c but it mostly happens that the person falls down insensible suddenly and without any warning whatever The eyes are distorted so that only their whites can be seen there is mostly foaming from the mouth the fingers are clinched and the body especially on one side is much agitated the tongue is often thrust out of the mouth When the fit goes off the patient feels drowsy and faint and often sleeps soundly for some time Treatment During the fit keep the patient flat on his back with his head slightly raised and prevent him from doing any harm to himself dash cold water into his face and apply smelling salts to his nose loosen his shirt collar c hold a piece of wood about as thick as a finger the handle of a tooth brush or knife will do as well between the two rows of teeth at the back part of the mouth This will prevent the tongue from being injured A teaspoonful of common salt thrust into the patient s mouth during the fit is of much service The after treatment of these fits is various and depends entirely upon their causes A good general rule however is always to keep the bowels well open and the patient quiet and free from fatigue worry and excess of all kinds twenty six forty two Fainting Fits are sometimes very dangerous and at others perfectly harmless the question of danger depending altogether upon the causes which have produced them and which are exceedingly various For instance fainting produced by disease of the heart is a very serious symptom indeed whereas that arising from some slight cause such as the sight of blood c need cause no alarm whatever The symptoms of simple fainting are so well known that it would be quite superfluous to enumerate them here The treatment consists in laying the patient at full length upon his back with his head upon a level with the rest of his body loosening everything about the neck dashing cold water into the face and sprinkling vinegar and water about the mouth applying smelling salts to the nose and when the patient is able to swallow in giving a little warm brandy and water or about twenty drops of sal volatile in water twenty six forty three Hysterics These fits take place for the most part in young nervous unmarried women They happen much less often in married women and even in some rare cases indeed in men Young women who are subject to these fits are apt to think that they are suffering from all the ills that flesh is heir to and the false symptoms of disease which they show are so like the true ones that it is often exceedingly difficult to detect the difference The fits themselves are mostly preceded by great depression of spirits shedding of tears sickness palpitation of the heart c A pain as if a nail were being driven in is also often felt at one particular part of the head In almost all cases when a fit is coming on pain is felt on the left side This pain rises gradually until it reaches the throat and then gives the patient a sensation as if she had a pellet there which prevents her from breathing properly and in fact seems to threaten actual suffocation The patient now generally becomes insensible and faints the body is thrown about in all directions froth issues from the mouth incoherent expressions are uttered and fits of laughter crying or screaming take place When the fit is going off the patient mostly cries bitterly sometimes knowing all and at others nothing of what has taken place and feeling general soreness all over the body Treatment during the fit Place the body in the same position as for simple fainting and treat in other respects as directed in the article on Epilepsy Always well loosen the patient s stays and when she is recovering and able to swallow give twenty drops of sal volatile in a little water The after treatment of these cases is very various If the patient is of a strong constitution she should live on plain diet take plenty of exercise and take occasional doses of castor oil or an aperient mixture such as that described as No one in previous numbers If as is mostly the case the patient is weak and delicate she will require a different mode of treatment altogether Good nourishing diet gentle exercise cold baths occasionally a dose of No three myrrh and aloes pills at night and a dose of compound iron pills twice a day As to the myrrh and aloes pills No three ten grains made into two pills are a dose for a full grown person Of the compound iron pills No four the dose for a full grown person is also ten grains made into two pills In every case amusing the mind and avoiding all causes of over excitement are of great service in bringing about a permanent cure twenty six forty four LIVER COMPLAINT AND SPASMS A very obliging correspondent recommends the following from personal experience Take four oz of dried dandelion root one oz of the best ginger one four oz of Columba root braise and boil all together in three pints of water till it is reduced to a quart strain and take a wine glassful every four hours Our correspondent says it is a safe and simple medicine for both liver complaint and spasms twenty six forty five LUMBAGO A new and successful mode of treating lumbago advocated by doctor Day is a form of counter irritation said to have been introduced into this country by the late Sir Anthony Carlisle and which consists in the instantaneous application of a flat iron button gently heated in a spirit lamp to the skin doctor Corrigan published about three years ago an account of some cases very successfully treated by nearly similar means doctor Corrigan s plan was however to touch the surface of the part affected at intervals of half an inch as lightly and rapidly as possible doctor Day has found greater advantages to result from drawing the flat surface of the heated button lightly over the affected part so as to act on a greater extent of surface The doctor speaks so enthusiastically of the benefit to be derived from this practice that it is evidently highly deserving attention twenty six forty six PALPITATION OF THE HEART Where palpitation occurs as symptomatic of indigestion the treatment must be directed to remedy that disorder when it is consequent on a plethoric state purgatives will be effectual In this case the patient should abstain from every kind of diet likely to produce a plethoric condition of body Animal food and fermented liquor must be particularly avoided Too much indulgence in sleep will also prove injurious When the attacks arise from nervous irritability the excitement must be allayed by change of air and a tonic diet Should the palpitation originate from organic derangement it must be of course beyond domestic management Luxurious living indolence and tight lacing often produce this affection such cases are to be conquered with a little resolution twenty six forty seven Poisons shall be the next subject for remark and we anticipate more detailed instructions for the treatment of persons poisoned by giving a simple LIST OF THE PRINCIPAL POISONS with their ANTIDOTES OR REMEDIES Oil of Vitriol \ Aquafortis Magnesia Chalk Soap and Water Spirit of Salt Emetic Tartar Oily Drinks Solution of Oak bark Salt of Lemons or Chalk Whiting Lime or Magnesia and Acid of Sugar Water Sometimes an Emetic Draught Pump on back Smelling Salts to nose Prussic Acid Artificial Breathing Chloride of Lime to nose Pearlash \ Soap Lees \ Smelling Salts \ Nitre Lemon Juice and Vinegar and Water Hartshorn Sal Volatile Arsenic \ Fly Powder or Emetics Lime Water Soap and Water White Arsenic Sugar and Water Oily Drinks Kings Yellow or Yellow Arsenic Mercury \ Corrosive Sublimate Whites of Eggs Soap and Water Calomel Opium Emetic Draught Vinegar and Water Laudanum dashing Cold Water on chest and face walking up and down two or three hours Lead \ White Lead Epsom Salts Castor Oil Emetics Sugar of Lead Goulard s Extract Copper Blue stone Whites of Eggs Sugar and Water Verdigris Castor Oil Gruel Zinc Lime Water Chalk and Water Soap and Water Iron Magnesia Warm Water Henbane \ Hemlock Emetics and Castor Oil Nightshade Brandy and Water if necessary Foxglove Poisonous Food Emetics and Castor Oil twenty six forty eight The symptoms of poisoning may be known for the most part from those of some diseases which they are very like from the fact of their coming on immediately after eating or drinking something whereas those of disease come on in most cases at least by degrees and with warnings In most cases where poison is known or suspected to have been taken the first thing to be done is to empty the stomach well and immediately by means of mustard mixed in warm water or plain warm salt and water or better this draught which we call No one Twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water This draught to be repeated in a quarter of an hour if vomiting does not ensue The back part of the throat should be well tickled with a feather or two of the fingers thrust down it to induce vomiting The cases where vomiting must not be used are those where the skin has been taken off and the parts touched irritated and inflamed by the poison taken and where the action of vomiting would increase the evil Full instructions are given in the article on each particular poison as to where emetics are or are not to be given The best and safest way of emptying the stomach is by means of the stomach pump as in certain cases the action of vomiting is likely to increase the danger arising from the swollen and congested condition of the blood vessels of the head which often takes place In the hands however of any one else than a surgeon it would be not only useless but harmful as a great deal of dexterity caution and experience are required to use it properly After having made these brief introductory remarks we shall now proceed to particulars twenty six forty nine Sulphuric Acid or Oil of Vitriol a clear colourless liquid of an oily appearance Symptoms in those who have swallowed it When much is taken these come on immediately There is great burning pain extending from the mouth to the stomach vomiting of a liquid of a dark coffee colour often mixed with shreds of flesh and streaks of blood the skin inside the mouth is taken off and the exposed surface is at first white and after a time becomes brownish There are sometimes spots of a brown colour round the lips and on the neck caused by drops of the acid falling on these parts There is great difficulty of breathing owing to the swelling at the back part of the mouth After a time there is much depression of strength with a quick weak pulse and cold clammy skin The face is pale and has a very anxious look When the acid swallowed has been greatly diluted in water the same kind of symptoms occur only in a milder degree Treatment Give a mixture of magnesia in milk and water or if this cannot be obtained of finely powdered chalk or whiting or even of the plaster torn down from the walls or ceiling in milk and water The mixture should be nearly as thick as cream and plenty of it given As well as this simple gruel milk or thick flour and water are very useful and should be given in large quantities Violent inflammation of the parts touched by the acid is most likely to take place in the coarse of a little time and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon but if one cannot be obtained leeches the fever mixtures the recipe for which appears repeatedly in previous paragraphs thick drinks such as barley water gruel arrowroot c must be had recourse to according to the symptoms of each particular case and the means at hand The inflamed condition of the back part of the mouth requires particular attention When the breathing is very laboured and difficult in consequence from fifteen to twenty leeches are to be immediately applied to the outside of the throat and when they drop off warm poppy fomentations constantly kept to the part When the pain over the stomach is very great the same local treatment is necessary but if it is only slight a good mustard poultice will be sufficient without the leeches In all these cases two tablespoonfuls of the fever mixture should be given every four hours and only gruel or arrowroot allowed to be eaten for some days twenty six fifty Nitric Acid commonly known as Aqua Fortis or Red Spirit of Nitre a straw coloured fluid of the consistence of water and which gives off dense white fumes on exposure to the air Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it Much the same as in the case of sulphuric acid In this case however the surface touched by the acid becomes yellowish The tongue is mostly much swollen Treatment The same as for sulphuric acid twenty six fifty one Muriatic Acid Spirit of Salt a thin yellow fluid emitting dense white fumes on exposure to the air This is not often taken as a poison The symptoms and treatment are much the same as those of nitric acid N B In no case of poisoning by these three acids should emetics ever be given twenty six fifty two Oxalic Acid commonly called Salt of Lemons This poison may be taken by mistake for Epsom salts which it is a good deal like It may be distinguished from them by its very acid taste and its shape which is that of needle formed crystals each of which if put into a drop of ink will turn it to a reddish brown whereas Epsom salts will not change its colour at all When a large dose of this poison has been taken death takes place very quickly indeed Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it A hot burning acid taste is felt in the act of swallowing and vomiting of a greenish brown fluid is produced sooner or later according to the quantity and strength of the poison taken There is great tenderness felt over the stomach followed by clammy perspirations and convulsions the legs are often drawn up and there is generally stupor from which the patient however can easily be roused and always great prostration of strength The pulse is small and weak and the breathing faint Treatment Chalk or magnesia made into a cream with water should be given in large quantities and afterwards the emetic draught above prescribed or some mustard and water if the draught cannot be got The back part of the throat to be tickled with a feather to induce vomiting Arrowroot gruel and the like drinks are to be taken When the prostration of strength is very great and the body cold warmth is to be applied to it and a little brandy and water or sal volatile and water given twenty six fifty three Prussic Acid a thin transparent and colourless liquid with a peculiar smell which greatly resembles that of bitter almonds Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it These come on immediately after the poison has been taken and may be produced by merely smelling it The patient becomes perfectly insensible and falls down in convulsions his eyes are fixed and staring the pupils being bigger than natural the skin is cold and clammy the pulse scarcely perceptible and the breathing slow and gasping Treatment Very little can be done in these cases as death takes place so quickly after the poison has been swallowed when it takes place at all The best treatment which should always be adopted in all cases even though the patient appears quite dead is to dash quantities of cold water on the back from the top of the neck downwards Placing the patient under a pump and pumping on him is the best way of doing this Smelling salts are also to be applied to the nose and the chest well rubbed with a camphor liniment twenty six fifty four ALKALIS Potash Soda and Ammonia or common Smelling Salts with their principal preparations Pearlash Soap Lees Liquor Potassae Nitre Sal Prunella Hartshorn and Sal Volatile Alkalis are seldom taken or given with the view of destroying life They may however be swallowed by mistake Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed them There is at first a burning acrid taste in and a sensation of tightness round the throat like that of strangling the skin touched is destroyed retching mostly followed by actual vomiting then sets in the vomited matters often containing blood of a dark brown colour with little shreds of flesh here and there and always changing vegetable blue colours green There is now great tenderness over the whole of the belly After a little while great weakness with cold clammy sweats a quick weak pulse and purging of bloody matters takes place The brain too mostly becomes affected Treatment Give two tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon juice in a glassful of water every few minutes until the burning sensation is relieved Any kind of oil or milk may also be given and will form soap when mixed with the poison in the stomach Barley water gruel arrowroot linseed tea c are also very useful and should be taken constantly and in large quantities If inflammation should take place it is to be treated by applying leeches and warm poppy fomentations to the part where the pain is most felt and giving two tablespoonfuls of the fever mixture every four hours The diet in all these cases should only consist of arrowroot or gruel for the first few days and then of weak broth or beef tea for some time after twenty six fifty five When very strong fumes of smelling salts have in any way been inhaled there is great difficulty of breathing and alarming pain in the mouth and nostrils In this case let the patient inhale the steam of warm vinegar and treat the feverish symptoms as before twenty six fifty six Arsenic Mostly seen under the form of white arsenic or fly powder and yellow arsenic or king s yellow Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it These vary very much according to the form and dose in which the poison has been taken There is faintness depression and sickness with an intense burning pain in the region of the stomach which gets worse and worse and is increased by pressure There is also vomiting of dark brown matter sometimes mixed with blood and mostly great thirst with a feeling of tightness round and of burning in the throat Purging also takes place the matters brought away being mixed with blood The pulse is small and irregular and the skin sometimes cold and clammy and at others hot The breathing is painful Convulsions and spasms often occur Treatment Give a couple of teaspoonfuls of mustard in a glass of water to bring on or assist vomiting and also use the other means elsewhere recommended for the purpose A solution half of lime water and half of linseed oil well mixed may be given as well as plenty of arrowroot gruel or linseed tea Simple milk is also useful A little castor oil should be given to cleanse the intestines of all the poison and the after symptoms treated on general principles twenty six fifty seven Corrosive Sublimate Mostly seen in the form of little heavy crystalline masses which melt in water and have a metallic taste It is sometimes seen in powder This is a most powerful poison Symptoms These mostly come on immediately after the poison has been taken There is a coppery taste experienced in the act of swallowing with a burning heat extending from the top of the throat down to the stomach and also a feeling of great tightness round the throat In a few minutes great pain is felt over the region of the stomach and frequent vomiting of long stringy white masses mixed with blood takes place There is also mostly great purging The countenance is generally pale and anxious the pulse always small and frequent the skin cold and clammy and the breathing difficult Convulsions and insensibility often occur and are very bad symptoms indeed The inside of the mouth is more or less swollen Treatment Mix the whites of a dozen eggs in two pints of cold water and give a glassful of the mixture every three or four minutes until the stomach can contain no more If vomiting does not now come on naturally and supposing the mouth is not very sore or much swollen an emetic draught No one may be given and vomiting induced The No one draught we remind our readers is thus made Twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water the draught to be repeated if vomiting does not take place in a quarter of an hour After the stomach has been well cleaned out milk flour and water linseed tea or barley water should be taken in large quantities If eggs cannot be obtained milk or flour and water should be given as a substitute for them at once When the depression of strength is very great indeed a little warm brandy and water must be given In the course of an hour or two the patient should take two tablespoonfuls of castor oil and if inflammation comes on it is to be treated as directed in the article on acids and alkalis The diet should also be the same If the patient recovers great soreness of the gums is almost certain to take place The simplest and at the same time one of the best modes of treatment is to wash them well three or four times a day with brandy and water twenty six fifty eight Calomel A heavy white powder without taste and insoluble in water It has been occasionally known to destroy life Symptoms Much the same as in the case of corrosive sublimate Treatment The same as for corrosive sublimate If the gums are sore wash them as recommended in the case of corrosive sublimate with brandy and water three or four times a day and keep the patient on fluids such as arrowroot gruel broth or beef tea according to the other symptoms Eating hard substances would make the gums more sore and tender twenty six fifty nine Copper The preparations of this metal which are most likely to be the ones producing poisonous symptoms are blue stone and verdigris People are often taken ill after eating food that has been cooked in copper saucepans When anything has been cooked in one of these vessels it should never be allowed to cool in it Symptoms Headache pain in the stomach and purging vomiting of green or blue matters convulsions and spasms Treatment Give whites of eggs sugar and water castor oil and drinks such as arrowroot and gruel twenty six sixty Emetic Tartar Seen in the form of a white powder or crystals with a slightly metallic taste It has not often been known to destroy life Symptoms A strong metallic taste in the act of swallowing followed by a burning pain in the region of the stomach vomiting and great purging The pulse is small and rapid the skin cold and clammy the breathing difficult and painful and the limbs often much cramped There is also great prostration of strength Treatment Promote the vomiting by giving plenty of warm water or warm arrowroot and water Strong tea in large quantities should be drunk or if it can be obtained a decoction of oak bark The after treatment is the same as that for acids and alkalis the principal object in all these cases being to keep down the inflammation of the parts touched by the poison by means of leeches warm poppy fomentations fever mixtures and very low diet twenty six sixty one Lead and its preparations Sugar of Lead Goulard s Extract White Lead Lead is by no means an active poison although it is popularly considered to be so It mostly affects people by being taken into the system slowly as in the case of painters and glaziers A newly painted house too often affects those living in it Symptoms produced when taken in a large dose There is at first a burning pricking sensation in the throat to which thirst giddiness and vomiting follow The belly is tight swollen and painful the pain being relieved by pressure The bowels are mostly bound There is great depression of strength and a cold skin Treatment Give an emetic draught No one see above at once and shortly afterwards a solution of Epsom salts in large quantities A little brandy and water must be taken if the depression of strength is very great indeed Milk whites of eggs and arrowroot are also useful After two or three hours cleanse the stomach and intestines well out with two tablespoonfuls of castor oil and treat the symptoms which follow according to the rules laid down in other parts of these articles Symptoms when it is taken into the body slowly Headache pain about the navel loss of appetite and flesh offensive breath a blueness of the edges of the gums the belly is tight hard and knotty and the pulse slow and languid There is also sometimes a difficulty in swallowing Treatment Give five grains of calomel and half a grain of opium directly in the form of a pill and half an ounce of Epsom salts in two hours and repeat this treatment until the bowels are well opened Put the patient into a warm bath and throw up a clyster of warmish water when he is in it Fomentations of warm oil of turpentine if they can be obtained should be put over the whole of the belly The great object is to open the bowels as freely and as quickly as possible When this has been done a grain of pure opium may be given Arrowroot or gruel should be taken in good large quantities The after treatment must depend altogether upon the symptoms of each particular case twenty six sixty two Opium and its preparations Laudanum c Solid opium is mostly seen in the form of rich brown flattish cakes with little pieces of leaves sticking on them here and there and a bitter and slightly warm taste The most common form in which it is taken as a poison is that of laudanum Symptoms These consist at first in giddiness and stupor followed by insensibility the patient however being roused to consciousness by a great noise so as to be able to answer a question but becoming insensible again almost immediately The pulse is now quick and small the breathing hurried and the skin warm and covered with perspiration After a little time these symptoms change the person becomes perfectly insensible the breathing slow and snoring as in apoplexy the skin cold and the pulse slow and full The pupil of the eye is mostly smaller than natural On applying his nose to the patient s mouth a person may smell the poison very distinctly Treatment Give an emetic draught No one see above directly with large quantities of warm mustard and water warm salt and water or simple warm water Tickle the top of the throat with a feather or put two fingers down it to bring on vomiting which rarely takes place of itself Dash cold water on the head chest and spine and flap these parts well with the ends of wet towels Give strong coffee or tea Walk the patient up and down in the open air for two or three hours the great thing being to keep him from sleeping Electricity is of much service When the patient is recovering mustard poultices should be applied to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs The head should be kept cool and raised twenty six sixty three The following preparations which are constantly given to children by their nurses and mothers for the purpose of making them sleep often prove fatal Syrup of Poppies and Godfrey s Cordial The author would most earnestly urge all people caring for their children s lives never to allow any of these preparations to be given unless ordered by a surgeon twenty six sixty four The treatment in the case of poisoning by Henbane Hemlock Nightshade and Foxglove is much the same as that for opium Vomiting should be brought on in all of them twenty six sixty five Poisonous Food It sometimes happens that things which are in daily use and mostly perfectly harmless give rise under certain unknown circumstances and in certain individuals to the symptoms of poisoning The most common articles of food of this description are Mussels Salmon and certain kinds of Cheese and Bacon The general symptoms are thirst weight about the stomach difficulty of breathing vomiting purging spasms prostration of strength and in the case of mussels more particularly an eruption on the body like that of nettle rash Treatment Empty the stomach well with No one draught and warm water and give two tablespoonfuls of castor oil immediately after Let the patient take plenty of arrowroot gruel and the like drinks and if there is much depression of strength give a little warm brandy and water Should symptoms of fever or inflammation follow they must be treated as directed in the articles on other kinds of poisoning twenty six sixty six Mushrooms and similar kinds of vegetables often produce poisonous effects The symptoms are various sometimes giddiness and stupor and at others pain in and swelling of the belly with vomiting and purging being the leading ones When the symptoms come on quickly after taking the poison it is generally the head that is affected The treatment consists in bringing on vomiting in the usual manner as quickly and as freely as possible The other symptoms are to be treated on general principles if they are those of depression by brandy and water or sal volatile if those of inflammation by leeches fomentations fever mixtures c c twenty six sixty seven FOR CURE OF RINGWORM Take of subcarbonate of soda one drachm which dissolve in one two pint of vinegar Wash the head every morning with soft soap and apply the lotion night and morning One teaspoonful of sulphur and treacle should also be given occasionally night and morning The hair should be cut close and round the spot it should be shaved off and the part night and morning bathed with a lotion made by dissolving a drachm of white vitriol in eight oz of water A small piece of either of the two subjoined ointments rubbed into the part when the lotion has dried in No one Take of citron ointment one drachm sulphur and tar ointment of each one two oz mix thoroughly and apply twice a day No two Take of simple cerate one oz creosote one drachm calomel thirty grains mix and use in the same manner as the first Concurrent with these external remedies the child should take an alterative powder every morning or if they act too much on the bowels only every second day The following will be found to answer all the intentions desired twenty six sixty eight Alterative Powders for Ringworm Take of Sulphuret of antimony precipitated twenty four grains Grey powder twelve grains Calomel six grains Jalap powder thirty six grains Mix carefully and divide into twelve powders for a child from one to two years old into nine powders for a child from two to four years and into six powders for a child from four to six years Where the patient is older the strength may be increased by enlarging the quantities of the drugs ordered or by giving one and a half or two powders for one dose The ointment is to be well washed off every morning with soap and water and the part bathed with the lotion before re applying the ointment An imperative fact must be remembered by mother or nurse never to use the same comb employed for the child with ringworm for the healthy children or let the affected little one sleep with those free from the disease and for fear of any contact by hands or otherwise to keep the child s head enveloped in a nightcap till this eruption is completely cured twenty six sixty nine SCRATCHES Trifling as scratches often seem they ought never to be neglected but should be covered and protected and kept clean and dry until they have completely healed If there is the least appearance of inflammation no time should be lost in applying a large bread and water poultice or hot flannels repeatedly applied or even leeches in good numbers may be put on at some distance from each other twenty six seventy FOR SHORTNESS OF BREATH OR DIFFICULT BREATHING Vitriolated spirits of ether one oz camphor twelve grains make a solution of which take a teaspoonful during the paroxysm This is found to afford instantaneous relief in difficulty of breathing depending on internal diseases and other causes where the patient from a very quick and laborious breathing is obliged to be in an erect posture twenty six seventy one SPRAINS A sprain is a stretching of the leaders or ligaments of a part through some violence such as slipping falling on the hands pulling a limb c c The most common are those of the ankle and wrist These accidents are more serious than people generally suppose and often more difficult to cure than a broken log or arm The first thing to be done is to place the sprained part in the straight position and to raise it a little as well Some recommend the application of cold lotions at first The editress however is quite convinced that warm applications are in most cases the best for for the first three or four days These fomentations are to be applied in the following manner Dip a good sized piece of flannel into a pail or basin full of hot water or hot poppy fomentation six poppy heads boiled in one quart of water for about a quarter of an hour wring it almost dry and apply it as hot as the patient can bear right round the sprained part Then place another piece of flannel quite dry over it in order that the steam and warmth may not escape This process should be repeated as often as the patient feels that the flannel next to his skin is getting cold the oftener the better The bowels should be opened with a black draught and the patient kept on low diet If he has been a great drinker he may be allowed to take a little beer but it is better not to do so A little of the cream of tartar drink ordered in the case of burns may be taken occasionally if there is much thirst When the swelling and tenderness about the joint are very great from eight to twelve leeches may be applied When the knee is the joint affected the greatest pain is felt at the inside and therefore the greater quantity of the leeches should be applied to that part When the shoulder is sprained the arm should be kept close to the body by means of a linen roller which is to be taken four or five times round the whole of the chest It should also be brought two or three times underneath the elbow in order to raise the shoulder This is the best treatment for these accidents during the first three or four days After that time supposing that no unfavourable symptoms have taken place a cold lotion composed of a tablespoonful of sal ammoniac to a quart of water or vinegar and water should be constantly applied This lotion will strengthen the part and also help in taking away any thickening that may have formed about the joint In the course of two or three weeks according to circumstances the joint is to be rubbed twice a day with flannel dipped in opodeldoc a flannel bandage rolled tightly round the joint the pressure being greatest at the lowest part and the patient allowed to walk about with the assistance of a crutch or stick He should also occasionally when sitting or lying down quietly bend the joint backwards and forwards to cause its natural motion to return and to prevent stiffness from taking place When the swelling is very great immediately after the accident has occurred from the breaking of the blood vessels it is best to apply cold applications at first If it can be procured oil silk may be put over the warm fomentation flannel instead of the dry piece of flannel Old flannel is better than new twenty six seventy two CURE FOR STAMMERING Where there is no malformation of the organs of articulation stammering may be remedied by reading aloud with the teeth closed This should be practised for two hours a day for three or four months The advocate of this simple remedy says I can speak with certainty of its utility twenty six seventy three STAMMERING At a recent meeting of the Boston Society of Natural History doctor Warren stated A simple easy and effectual cure of stammering It is simply at every syllable pronounced to tap at the same time with the finger by so doing the most inveterate stammerer will be surprised to find that he can pronounce quite fluently and by long and constant practice he will pronounce perfectly well twenty six seventy four SUFFOCATION APPARENT Suffocation may arise from many different causes Anything which prevents the air getting into the lungs will produce it We shall give the principal causes and the treatment to be followed in each case twenty six seventy five one Carbonic Acid Gas Choke Damp of Mines This poisonous gas is met with in rooms where charcoal is burnt and where there is not sufficient draught to allow it to escape in coalpits near limekilns in breweries and in rooms and houses where a great many people live huddled together in wretchedness and filth and where the air in consequence becomes poisoned This gas gives out no smell so that we cannot know of its presence A candle will not burn in a room which contains much of it Effects At first there is giddiness and a great wish to sleep after a little time or where there is much of it present a person feels great weight in the head and stupid gets by degrees quite unable to move and snores as if in a deep sleep The limbs may or may not be stiff The heat of the body remains much the same at first Treatment Remove the person affected into the open air and even though it is cold weather take off his clothes Then lay him on his back with his head slightly raised Having done this dash vinegar and water over the whole of the body and rub it hard especially the face and chest with towels dipped in the same mixture The hands and feet also should be rubbed with a hard brush Apply smelling salts to the nose which may be tickled with a feather Dashing cold water down the middle of the back is of great service If the person can swallow give him a little lemon water or vinegar and water to drink The principal means however to be employed in this as in fact in most cases of apparent suffocation is what is called artificial breathing This operation should be performed by three persons and in the following manner The first person should put the nozzle of a common pair of bellows into one of the patient s nostrils the second should push down and then thrust back that part of the throat called Adam s apple and the third should first raise and then depress the chest one hand being placed over each side of the ribs These three actions should be performed in the following order First of all the throat should be drawn down and thrust back then the chest should be raised and the bellows gently blown into the nostril Directly this is done the chest should be depressed so as to imitate common breathing This process should be repeated about eighteen times a minute The mouth and the other nostril should be closed while the bellows are being blown Persevere if necessary with this treatment for seven or eight hours in fact till absolute signs of death are visible Many lives are lost by giving it up too quickly When the patient becomes roused he is to be put into a warm bed and a little brandy and water or twenty drops of sal volatile given cautiously now and then This treatment is to be adopted in all cases where people are affected from breathing bad air smells c c twenty six seventy six two Drowning This is one of the most frequent causes of death by suffocation Treatment Many methods have been adopted and as some of them are not only useless but hurtful we will mention them here merely in order that they may be avoided In the first place then never hang a person up by his heels as it is an error to suppose that water gets into the lungs Hanging a person up by his heels would be quite as bad as hanging him up by his neck It is also a mistake to suppose that rubbing the body with salt and water is of service Proper Treatment Directly a person has been taken out of the water he should be wiped dry and wrapped in blankets but if these cannot be obtained the clothes of the bystanders must be used for the purpose His head being slightly raised and any water weeds or froth that may happen to be in his mouth having been removed he should be carried as quickly as possible to the nearest house He should now be put into a warm bath about as hot as the hand can pleasantly bear and kept there for about ten minutes artificial breathing being had recourse to while he is in it Having been taken out of the bath he should be placed flat on his back with his head slightly raised upon a warm bed in a warm room wiped perfectly dry and then rubbed constantly all over the body with warm flannels At the same time mustard poultices should be put to the soles of the feet the palms of the hands and the inner surface of the thighs and legs Warm bricks or bottles filled with warm water should be placed under the armpits The nose should be tickled with a feather and smelling salts applied to it This treatment should be adopted while the bath is being got ready as well as when the body has been taken out of it The bath is not absolutely necessary constantly rubbing the body with flannels in a warm room having been found sufficient for resuscitation Sir B Brodie says that warm air is quite as good as warm water When symptoms of returning consciousness begin to show themselves give a little wine brandy or twenty drops of sal volatile and water In some cases it is necessary in about twelve or twenty four hours after the patient has revived to bleed him for peculiar head symptoms which now and then occur Bleeding however even in the hands of professional men themselves should be very cautiously used non professional ones should never think of it The best thing to do in these cases is to keep the head well raised and cool with a lotion such as that recommended above for sprains to administer an aperient draught and to abstain from giving anything that stimulates such as wine brandy sal volatile c c As a general rule a person dies in three minutes and a half after he has been under water It is difficult however to tell how long he has actually been under it although we may know well exactly how long he has been in it This being the case always persevere in your attempts at resuscitation until actual signs of death have shown themselves even for six eight or ten hours doctor Douglas of Glasgow resuscitated a person who had been under water for fourteen minutes by simply rubbing the whole of his body with warm flannels in a warm room for eight hours and a half at the end of which time the person began to show the first symptoms of returning animation Should the accident occur at a great distance from any house this treatment should be adopted as closely as the circumstances will permit of Breathing through any tube such as a piece of card or paper rolled into the form of a pipe will do as a substitute for the bellows To recapitulate Rub the body dry take matters out of mouth cover with blankets or clothes slightly raise the head and place the body in a warm bath or on a bed in a warm room apply smelling salts to nose employ artificial breathing rub well with warm flannels put mustard poultices to feet hands and insides of thighs and legs with warm bricks or bottles to armpits Don t bleed Give wine brandy or sal volatile when recovering and persevere till actual signs of death are seen twenty six seventy seven Briefly to conclude what we have to say of suffocation let us treat of Lightning When a person has been struck by lightning there is a general paleness of the whole body with the exception of the part struck which is often blackened or even scorched Treatment Same as for drowning It is not however of much use for when death takes place at all it is generally instantaneous twenty six seventy eight CURE FOR THE TOOTHACHE Take a piece of sheet zinc about the size of a sixpence and a piece of silver say a shilling place them together and hold the defective tooth between them or contiguous to them in a few minutes the pain will be gone as if by magic The zinc and silver acting as a galvanic battery will produce on the nerves of the tooth sufficient electricity to establish a current and consequently to relieve the pain Or smoke a pipe of tobacco and caraway seeds Again twenty six seventy nine A small piece of the pellitory root will by the flow of saliva it causes afford relief Creosote or a few drops of tincture of myrrh or friar s balsam on cotton put on the tooth will often subdue the pain A small piece of camphor however retained in the mouth is the most reliable and likely means of conquering the paroxysms of this dreaded enemy twenty six eighty WARTS Eisenberg says in his Advice on the Hand that the hydrochlorate of lime is the most certain means of destroying warts the process however is very slow and demands perseverance for if discontinued before the proper time no advantage is gained The following is a simple cure On breaking the stalk of the crowfoot plant in two a drop of milky juice will be observed to hang on the upper part of the stem if this be allowed to drop on a wart so that it be well saturated with the juice in about three or four dressings the warts will die and may be taken off with the fingers They may be removed by the above means from the teats of cows where they are sometimes very troublesome and prevent them standing quiet to be milked The wart touched lightly every second day with lunar caustic or rubbed every night with blue stone for a few weeks will destroy the largest wart wherever situated twenty six eighty one To CURE A WHITLOW As soon as the whitlow has risen distinctly a pretty large piece should be snipped out so that the watery matter may readily escape and continue to flow out as fast as produced A bread and water poultice should be put on for a few days when the wound should be bound up lightly with some mild ointment when a cure will be speedily completed Constant poulticing both before and after the opening of the whitlow is the only practice needed but as the matter lies deep when it is necessary to open the abscess the incision must be made deep to reach the suppuration twenty six eighty two WOUNDS There are several kinds of wounds which are called by different names according to their appearance or the manner in which they are produced As however it would be useless and even hurtful to bother the reader s head with too many nice professional distinctions we shall content ourselves with dividing wounds into three classes twenty six eighty three one Incised wounds or cuts those produced by a knife or some sharp instrument twenty six eighty four two Lacerated or torn wounds those produced by the claws of an animal the bite of a dog running quickly against some projecting blunt object such as a nail c twenty six eighty five three Punctured or penetrating wounds those produced by anything running deeply into the flesh such as a sword a sharp nail a spike the point of a bayonet c twenty six eighty six Class one Incised wounds or cuts The danger arising from these accidents is owing more to their position than to their extent Thus a cut of half an inch long which goes through an artery is more serious than a cut of two inches long which is not near one Again a small cut on the head is more often followed by dangerous symptoms than a much larger one on the legs Treatment If the cut is not a very large one and no artery or vein is wounded this is very simple If there are any foreign substances left in the wound they must be taken out and the bleeding must be quite stopped before the wound is strapped up If the bleeding is not very great it may easily be stopped by raising the cut part and applying rags dipped in cold water to it All clots of blood must be carefully removed for if they are left behind they prevent the wound from healing When the bleeding has been stopped and the wound perfectly cleaned its two edges are to be brought closely together by thin straps of common adhesive plaster which should remain on if there is not great pain or heat about the part for two or three days without being removed The cut part should be kept raised and cool When the strips of plaster are to be taken off they should first be well bathed with lukewarm water This will cause them to come away easily and without opening the lips of the wound which accident is very likely to take place if they are pulled off without having been first moistened with the warm water If the wound is not healed when the strips of plaster are taken off fresh ones must be applied Great care is required in treating cuts of the head as they are often followed by erysipelas taking place round them They should be strapped with isinglass plaster which is much less irritating than the ordinary adhesive plaster Only use as many strips as are actually requisite to keep the two edges of the wound together keep the patient quite quiet on low diet for a week or so according to his symptoms Purge him well with the No two pills five grains of blue pill mixed with the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth make into two pills the dose for an adult If the patient is feverish give him two tablespoonfuls of the fever mixture three times a day The fever mixture we remind our readers is thus made Mix a drachm of powdered nitre two drachms of carbonate of potash two teaspoonfuls of antimonial wine and a tablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitre in half a pint of water A person should be very careful of himself for a month or two after having had a bad cut on the head His bowels should be kept constantly open and all excitement and excess avoided When a vein or artery is wounded the danger is of course much greater Those accidents therefore should always be attended to by a surgeon if he can possibly be procured Before he arrives however or in case his assistance cannot be obtained at all the following treatment should be adopted Raise the cut part and press rags dipped in cold water firmly against it This will often be sufficient to stop the bleeding if the divided artery or vein is not dangerous When an artery is divided the blood is of a bright red colour and comes away in jets In this case and supposing the leg or arm to be the cut part a handkerchief is to be tied tightly round the limb above the cut and if possible the two bleeding ends of the artery should each be tied with a piece of silk If the bleeding is from a vein the blood is much darker and does not come away in jets In this case the handkerchief is to be tied below the cut and a pad of lint or linen pressed firmly against the divided ends of the vein Let every bad cut especially where there is much bleeding and even although it may to all appearance have been stopped be attended to by a surgeon if one can by any means be obtained twenty six eighty seven Class two Lacerated or torn wounds There is not so much bleeding in these cases as in clean cuts because the blood vessels are torn across in a zigzag manner and not divided straight across In other respects however they are more serious than ordinary cuts being often followed by inflammation mortification fever and in some cases by locked jaw Foreign substances are also more likely to remain in them Treatment Stop the bleeding if there is any in the manner directed for cuts remove all substances that may be in the wound keep the patient quite quiet and on low diet gruel arrowroot and the like purge with the No one pills and the No one mixture The No one pill Mix five grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little bread crumb and make into two pills which is the dose for an adult The No one mixture Dissolve an ounce of Epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea A quarter of the mixture is a dose If there are feverish symptoms give two tablespoonfuls of fever mixture see above every four hours If possible bring the two edges of the wound together but do not strain the parts to do this If they cannot be brought together on account of a piece of flesh being taken clean out or the raggedness of their edges put lint dipped in cold water over the wound and cover it with oiled silk It will then fill up from the bottom If the wound after being well washed should still contain any sand or grit of any kind or if it should get red and hot from inflammation a large warm bread poultice will be the best thing to apply until it becomes quite clean or the inflammation goes down When the wound is a very large one the application of warm poppy fomentations is better than that of the lint dipped in cold water If the redness and pain about the part and the general feverish symptoms are great from eight to twelve leeches are to be applied round the wound and a warm poppy fomentation or warm bread poultice applied after they drop off twenty six eighty eight Class three Punctured or penetrating wounds These for many reasons are the most serious of all kinds of wounds Treatment The same as that for lacerated wounds Pus matter often forms at the bottom of these wounds which should therefore be kept open at the top by separating their edges every morning with a bodkin and applying a warm bread poultice immediately afterwards They will then in all probability heal up from the bottom and any matter which may form will find its own way out into the poultice Sometimes however in spite of all precautions collections of matter abscesses will form at the bottom or sides of the wound Those are to be opened with a lancet and the matter thus let out When matter is forming the patient has cold shiverings throbbing pain in the part and flushes on the face which come and go A swelling of the part is also often seen The matter in the abscesses may be felt to move backwards and forwards when pressure is made from one side of the swelling to the other with the first and second fingers the middle and that next the thumb of each hand MEDICAL MEMORANDA twenty six eighty nine ADVANTAGES OF CLEANLINESS Health and strength cannot be long continued unless the skin all the skin is washed frequently with a sponge or other means Every morning is best after which the skin should be rubbed very well with a rough cloth This is the most certain way of preventing cold and a little substitute for exercise as it brings blood to the surface and causes it to circulate well through the fine capillary vessels Labour produces this circulation naturally The insensible perspiration cannot escape well if the skin is not clean as the pores get choked up It is said that in health about half the aliment we take passes out through the skin twenty six ninety THE TOMATO MEDICINAL To many persons there is something unpleasant not to say offensive in the flavour of this excellent fruit It has however long been used for culinary purposes in various countries of Europe doctor Bennett a professor of some celebrity considers it an invaluable article of diet and ascribes to it very important medicinal properties He declares one That the tomato is one of the most powerful deobstruents of the materia medica and that in all those affections of the liver and other organs where calomel is indicated it is probably the most effective and least harmful remedial agent known in the profession two That a chemical extract can be obtained from it which will altogether supersede the use of calomel in the cure of diseases three That he has successfully treated diarrhoea with this article alone four That when used as an article of diet it is almost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion twenty six ninety one WARM WATER Warm water is preferable to cold water as a drink to persons who are subject to dyspeptic and bilious complaints and it may be taken more freely than cold water and consequently answers better as a diluent for carrying off bile and removing obstructions in the urinary secretion in cases of stone and gravel When water of a temperature equal to that of the human body is used for drink it proves considerably stimulant and is particularly suited to dyspeptic bilious gouty and chlorotic subjects twenty six ninety two CAUTIONS IN VISITING SICK ROOMS Never venture into a sick room if you are in a violent perspiration if circumstances require your continuance there for the moment your body becomes cold it is in a state likely to absorb the infection and give you the disease Nor visit a sick person especially if the complaint be of a contagious nature with an empty stomach as this disposes the system more readily to receive the contagion In attending a sick person place yourself where the air passes from the door or window to the bed of the diseased not betwixt the diseased person and any fire that is in the room as the heat of the fire will draw the infectious vapour in that direction and you would run much danger from breathing it twenty six ninety three NECESSITY OF GOOD VENTILATION IN ROOMS LIGHTED WITH GAS In dwelling houses lighted by gas the frequent renewal of the air is of great importance A single gas burner will consume more oxygen and produce more carbonic acid to deteriorate the atmosphere of a room than six or eight candles If therefore when several burners are used no provision is made for the escape of the corrupted air and for the introduction of pure air from without the health will necessarily suffer LEGAL MEMORANDA CHAPTER XLIV twenty six ninety four Humorists tell us there is no act of our lives which can be performed without breaking through some one of the many meshes of the law by which our rights are so carefully guarded and those learned in the law when they do give advice without the usual fee and in the confidence of friendship generally say Pay pay anything rather than go to law while those having experience in the courts of Themis have a wholesome dread of its pitfalls There are a few exceptions however to this fear of the law s uncertainties and we hear of those to whom a lawsuit is on agreeable relaxation a gentle excitement One of this class when remonstrated with retorted that while one friend kept dogs and another horses he as he had a right to do kept a lawyer and no one had a right to dispute his taste We cannot pretend in these few pages to lay down even the principles of law not to speak of its contrary exposition in different courts but there are a few acts of legal import which all men and women too must perform and to these acts we may be useful in giving a right direction There is a house to be leased or purchased servants to be engaged a will to be made or property settled in all families and much of the welfare of its members depends on these things being done in proper legal form twenty six ninety five PURCHASING A HOUSE Few men will venture to purchase a freehold or even a leasehold property by private contract without making themselves acquainted with the locality and employing a solicitor to examine the titles but many do walk into an auction room and bid for a property upon the representations of the auctioneer The conditions whatever they are will bind him for by one of the legal fictions of which we have still so many the auctioneer who is in reality the agent for the vendor becomes also the agent for the buyer and by putting down the names of bidders and the biddings he binds him to whom the lot is knocked down to the sale and the conditions the falling of the auctioneer s hammer is the acceptance of the offer which completes the agreement to purchase In any such transaction you can only look at the written or printed particulars any verbal statement of the auctioneer made at the time of the sale cannot contradict them and they are implemented by the agreement which the auctioneer calls on the purchaser to sign after the sale You should sign no such contract without having a duplicate of it signed by the auctioneer and delivered to you It is perhaps unnecessary to add that no trustee or assignee can purchase property for himself included in the trust even at auction nor is it safe to pay the purchase money to an agent of the vendor unless he give a written authority to the agent to receive it besides handing over the requisite deeds and receipts twenty six ninety six The laws of purchase and sale of property are so complicated that Lord saint Leonards devotes five chapters of his book on Property Law to the subject The only circumstances strong enough to vitiate a purchase which has been reduced to a written contract is proof of fraudulent representation as to an encumbrance of which the buyer was ignorant or a defect in title but every circumstance which the purchaser might have learned by careful investigation the law presumes that he did know Thus in buying a leasehold estate or house all the covenants of the original lease are presumed to be known It is not unusual says Lord saint Leonards to stipulate in conditions of sale of leasehold property that the production of a receipt for the last year s rent shall be accepted as proof that all the lessor s covenants were performed up to that period Never bid for one clogged with such a condition There are some acts against which no relief can be obtained for example the tenant s right to insure or his insuring in an office or in names not authorized in the lease And you should not rely upon the mere fact of the insurance being correct at the time of sale there may have been a prior breach of covenant and the landlord may not have waived his right of entry for the forfeiture And where any doubt of this kind exists the landlord should be appealed to twenty six ninety seven Interest on a purchase is due from the day fixed upon for completing where it cannot be completed the loss rests with the party with whom the delay rests but it appears when the delay rests with the seller and the money is lying idle notice of that is to be given to the seller to make him liable to the loss of interest In law the property belongs to the purchaser from the date of the contract he is entitled to any benefit and must bear any loss the seller may suffer the insurance to drop without giving notice and should a fire take place the loss falls on the buyer In agreeing to buy a house therefore provide at the same time for its insurance Common fixtures pass with the house where nothing is said about them twenty six ninety eight There are some well recognized laws of what may be called good neighbourhood which affect all properties If you purchase a field or house the seller retaining another field between yours and the highway he must of necessity grant you a right of way Where the owner of more than one house sells one of them the purchaser is entitled to benefit by all drains leading from his house into other drains and will be subject to all necessary drains for the adjoining houses although there is no express reservation as to drains Thus if his happens to be a leading drain other necessary drains may be opened into it In purchasing land for building on you should expressly reserve a right to make an opening into any sewer or watercourse on the vendor s land for drainage purposes twenty six ninety nine CONSTRUCTIONS Among the cautions which purchasers of houses land or leaseholds should keep in view is a not inconsiderable array of constructive notices which are equally binding with actual ones Notice to your attorney or agent is notice to you and when the same attorney is employed by both parties and he is aware of an encumbrance of which you are ignorant you are bound by it even where the vendor is guilty of a fraud to which your agent is privy you are responsible and cannot be released from the consequences twenty seven hundred THE RELATIONS OF LANDLORD AND TENANT are most important to both parties and each should clearly understand his position The proprietor of a house or house and land agrees to let it either to a tenant at will a yearly tenancy or under lease A tenancy at will may be created by parol or by agreement and as the tenant may be turned out when his landlord pleases so he may leave when he himself thinks proper but this kind of tenancy is extremely inconvenient to both parties Where an annual rent is attached to the tenancy in construction of law a lease or agreement without limitation to any certain period is a lease from year to year and both landlord and tenant are entitled to notice before the tenancy can be determined by the other This notice must be given at least six months before the expiration of the current year of the tenancy and it can only terminate at the end of any whole year from the time at which it began so that the tenant entering into possession at Midsummer the notice must be given to or by him so as to terminate at the same term When once he is in possession he has a right to remain for a whole year and if no notice be given at the end of the first half year of his tenancy he will have to remain two years and so on for any number of years twenty seven oh one TENANCY BY SUFFERANCE This is a tenancy not very uncommon arising out of the unwillingness of either party to take the initiative in a more decided course at the expiry of a lease or agreement The tenant remains in possession and continues to pay rent as before and becomes from sufferance a tenant from year to year which can only be terminated by one party or the other giving the necessary six months notice to quit at the term corresponding with the commencement of the original tenancy This tenancy at sufferance applies also to an under tenant who remains in possession and pays rent to the reversioner or head landlord A six months notice will be insufficient for this tenancy A notice was given in Right v Darby I T R one hundred fifty nine to quit a house held by plaintiff as tenant from year to year on the seventeenth June eighteen forty requiring him to quit the premises on the eleventh October following or such other day as his said tenancy might expire The tenancy had commenced on the eleventh October in a former year but it was held that this was not a good notice for the year ending October eleven eighteen forty one A tenant from year to year gave his landlord notice to quit ending the tenancy at a time within the half year the landlord acquiesced at first but afterwards refused to accept the notice The tenant quitted the premises the landlord entered and even made some repairs but it was afterwards held that the tenancy was not determined A notice to quit must be such as the tenant may safely act on at the time of receiving it therefore it can only be given by an agent properly authorized at the time and cannot be made good by the landlord adopting it afterwards An unqualified notice given at the proper time should conclude with On failure whereof I shall require you to pay me double the former rent for so long as you retain possession twenty seven oh two LEASES A lease is an instrument in writing by which one person grants to another the occupation and use of lands or tenements for a term of years for a consideration the lessor granting the lease and the lessee accepting it with all its conditions A lessor may grant the lease for any term less than his own interest A tenant for life in an estate can only grant a lease for his own life A tenant for life having power to grant a lease should grant it only in the terms of the power otherwise the lease is void and his estate may be made to pay heavy penalties under the covenant usually the only one onerous on the lessor for quiet enjoyment The proprietor of a freehold that is of the possession in perpetuity of lands or tenements may grant a lease for nine hundred ninety nine years for ninety nine years or for three years In the latter case the lease may be either verbal or in writing no particular form and no stamps being necessary except the usual stamp on agreements so long as the intention of the parties is clearly expressed and the covenants definite and well understood by each party the agreement is complete and the law satisfied In the case of settled estates the court of Chancery is empowered to authorize leases under the nineteen twenty Vict c one hundred twenty and twenty one twenty two Vict c seventy seven as follows twenty one years for agriculture or occupation forty years for water power ninety nine years for building leases sixty years for repairing leases twenty seven oh three A lessor may also grant an under lease for a term less than his own to grant the whole of his term would be an assignment Leases are frequently burdened with a covenant not to underlet without the consent of the landlord this is a covenant sometimes very onerous and to be avoided where it is possible by a prudent lessee twenty seven oh four A lease for any term beyond three years whether an actual lease or an agreement for one must be in the form of a deed that is it must be under seal and all assignments and surrenders of leases must be in the same form or they are void at law Thus an agreement made by letter or by a memorandum of agreement which would be binding in most cases would be valueless when it was for a lease unless witnessed and given under hand and seal The last statute eight nine Vict c one hundred six under which these precautions became necessary has led to serious difficulties The judges says Lord saint Leonards feel the difficulty of holding a lease in writing but not by deed to be altogether void and consequently decided that although such a lease is void under the statute yet it so far regulates the holding that it creates a tenancy from year to year terminable by half a year s notice and if the tenure endure for the term attempted to be created by the void lease the tenant may be evicted at the end of the term without any notice to quit An agreement for a lease not by deed has been construed to be a lease for a term of years and consequently void under the statute and yet says Lord saint Leonards a court of equity has held that it may be specifically enforced as an agreement upon the terms stated The law on this point is one of glorious uncertainty in making any such agreement therefore we should be careful to express that it is an agreement and not a lease and that it is witnessed and under seal twenty seven oh five AGREEMENTS It is usual where the lease is a repairing one to agree for a lease to be granted on completion of repairs according to specification This agreement should contain the names and designation of the parties a description of the property and the term of the intended lease and all the covenants which are to be inserted as no verbal agreement can be made to a written agreement It should also declare that the instrument is an agreement for a lease and not the lease itself The points to be settled in such an agreement are the rent term and especially covenants for insuring and rebuilding in the event of a fire and if it is intended that the lessor s consent is to be obtained before assigning or underleasing a covenant to that effect is required in the agreement In building leases usually granted for ninety nine years the tenant is to insure the property and even where the agreement is silent on that point the law decides it so It is otherwise with ordinary tenements when the tenant pays a full or what the law terms rack rent the landlord is then to insure unless it is otherwise arranged by the agreement twenty seven oh six It is important for lessee and lessor also that the latter does not exceed his powers A lease granted by a tenant for life before he is properly in possession is void in law for although a court of equity according to Lord saint Leonards will by force of its own jurisdiction support a bona fide lease granted under a power which is merely erroneous in form or ceremonies and the twelve thirteen Vict c twenty six and thirteen fourteen Vict c nineteen compel a new lease to be granted with the necessary variations while the lessor has no power to compel him to accept such a lease except when the person in remainder is competent and willing to confirm the original lease without variations yet all these difficulties involve both delay costs and anxieties twenty seven oh seven In husbandry leases a covenant to cultivate the land in a husbandlike manner and according to the custom of the district is always implied but it is more usual to prescribe the course of tillage which is to be pursued In the case of houses for occupation the tenant would have to keep the house in a tenantable state of repair during the term and deliver it up in like condition This is not the case with the tenant at will or from year to year where the landlord has to keep the house in tenantable repair and the tenant is only liable for waste beyond reasonable wear and tear twenty seven oh eight INSURANCE Every lease or agreement for a lease should covenant not only who is to pay insurance but how the tenement is to be rebuilt in the event of a fire for if the house were burnt down and no provision made for insurance the tenant supposing there was the ordinary covenant to repair in the lease would not only have to rebuild but to pay rent while it was being rebuilt More than this supposing under the same lease the landlord had taken the precaution of insuring he is not compelled to lay out the money recovered in rebuilding the premises Sir John Leach lays it down that the tenant s situation could not be changed by a precaution on the part of the landlord with which he had nothing to do This decision Lord Campbell confirmed in a more recent case in which an action was brought against a lessee who was not bound to repair and neither he nor the landlord bound to insure admitting an equitable defence the court affirmed Sir John Leach s decision holding that the tenant was bound to pay the rent and could not require the landlord to lay out the insurance money in rebuilding This is opposed to the opinion of Lord saint Leonards who admits however that the decision of the court must overrule his dictum Such being the state of the law it is very important that insurance should be provided for and that the payment of rent should be made to depend upon rebuilding the house in the event of a fire Care must be taken however that this is made a covenant of the lease as well as in the agreement otherwise the tenant must rebuild the house twenty seven oh nine The law declares that a tenant is not bound to repair damages by tempest lightning or other natural casualty unless there is a special covenant to that effect in the lease but if there is a general covenant to repair the repair will fall upon the tenant Lord Kenyon lays it down in the case of a bridge destroyed by a flood the tenant being under a general covenant to repair that where a party by his own contract creates a duty or charge upon himself he is bound to make it good because he might have guarded against it in the contract The same principle of law has been applied to a house destroyed by lightning It is therefore important to have this settled in the insurance clause twenty seven ten Lord saint Leonards asserts that his policies against fire are not so framed as to render the company legally liable Generally the property is inaccurately described with reference to the conditions under which you insure They are framed by companies who probably are not unwilling to have a legal defence against any claim as they intend to pay what they deem just claim without taking advantage of any technical objection and intending to make use of their defence only against what they believe to be a fraud although they may not be able to prove it But says his lordship do not rely upon the moral feelings of the directors Ascertain that your house falls strictly within the conditions Even having the surveyor of the company to look over your house before the insurance will not save you unless your policy is correct This is true but probably his lordship s legal jealousy overshoots the mark here Assurance companies only require an honest statement of the facts and that no concealment is practised with their surveyor and the case of his own which he quotes in which a glass door led into a conservatory rendering it according to the view of the company hazardous and consequently voiding the policy when a fire did occur the company paid rather than try the question but even after the fire they demurred when called upon to make the description correct and indorse on the policy the fact that the drawing room opened through a glass door into conservatories One of two inferences is obvious here either his lordship has overcoloured the statement or the company could not be the respectable one represented The practice with all reputable offices is to survey the premises before insurance and to describe them as they appear but no concealment of stoves or other dangerous accessories or inflammable goods should be practised This certainly binds the office so long as no change takes place but the addition of any stove opening or door through a party wall the introduction of gunpowder saltpetre or other inflammable articles into the premises without notice very properly voids the policy The usual course is to give notice of all alterations and have them indorse on the policy as additions to the description of the property there is little fear where this is honestly done that any company would adopt the sharp practice hinted at in Lord saint Leonards excellent handy book twenty seven eleven BREAKS IN THE LEASE Where a lease is for seven fourteen or twenty one years the option to determine it at the end of the first term is in the tenant unless it is distinctly agreed that the option shall be mutual according to Lord saint Leonards twenty seven twelve NOXIOUS TRADES A clause is usually introduced prohibiting the carrying on of any trade in some houses and of noxious or particular trades in others This clause should be jealously inspected otherwise great annoyance may be produced It has been held that a general clause of this description prohibited a tenant from keeping a school for which he had taken it although a lunatic asylum and public house have been found admissible the keeping an asylum not being deemed a trade which is defined as conducted by buying and selling It is better to have the trades or class of trades objected to defined in the lease twenty seven thirteen FIXTURES In houses held under lease it has been the practice with landlords to lease the bare walls of the tenement only leaving the lessee to put in the stoves cupboards and such other conveniences as he requires at his own option Those except under particular circumstances are the property of the lessee and may either be sold to an incoming tenant or removed at the end of his term The articles which may not be removed are subject to considerable doubt and are a fruitful source of dispute mister Commissioner Fonblanque has defined as tenants property all goods and chattels secondly all articles slightly connected one with another and with the freehold but capable of being separated without materially injuring the freehold thirdly articles fixed to the freehold by nails and screws bolts or pegs are also tenants goods and chattels but when sunk in the soil or built on it they are integral parts of the freehold and cannot be removed Thus a greenhouse or conservatory attached to the house by the tenant is not removable but the furnace and hot water pipes by which it is heated may be removed or sold to the in coming tenant A brick flue does not come under the same category but remains Window blinds grates stoves coffee mills and in a general sense everything he has placed which can be removed without injury to the freehold he may remove if they are separated from the tenement during his term and the place made good It is not unusual to leave the fixtures in their place with an undertaking from the landlord that when again let the in coming tenant shall pay for them or permit their removal In a recent case however a tenant having held over beyond his term and not removed his fixtures the landlord let the premises to a new tenant who entered into possession and would not allow the fixtures to be removed it was held by the courts on trial that he was justified A similar case occurred to the writer he left his fixtures in the house taking a letter from the landlord undertaking that the in coming tenant should pay for them by valuation or permit their removal The house was let the landlord died His executors on being applied to pleaded ignorance as did the tenant and on being furnished with a copy of the letter the executors told applicant that if he was aggrieved he knew his remedy namely an action at law He thought the first loss the least and has not altered his opinion twenty seven fourteen TAXES Land tax sewers rate and property tax are landlord s taxes but by thirty Geo II c two the occupier is required to pay all rates levied and deduct from the rent such taxes as belong to the landlord Many landlords now insert a covenant stipulating that land tax and sewers rate are to be paid by the tenants and not deducted this does not apply to the property tax All other taxes and rates are payable by the occupier twenty seven fifteen WATER RATE of course is paid by the tenant The water companies as well as gas companies have the power of cutting off the supply and most of them have also the right of distraining in the same manner as landlords have for rent twenty seven sixteen NOTICE TO QUIT In the case of leasing for a term no notice is necessary the tenant quits as a matter of course at its termination or if by tacit consent he remains paying rent as heretofore he becomes a tenant at sufferance or from year to year Half a year s notice now becomes necessary as we have already seen to terminate the tenancy except in London and the rent is under forty shillings when a quarter s notice is sufficient Either of these notices may be given verbally if it can be proved that the notice was definite and given at the right time Form of notice is quite immaterial provided it is definite and clear in its purport twenty seven seventeen Tenancy for less than a year may be terminated according to the taking Thus when taken for three months a three months notice is required when monthly a month s notice and when weekly a week s notice but weekly tenancy is changed to a quarterly tenure if the rent is allowed to stand over for three months When taken for a definite time as a month a week or a quarter no notice is necessary on either side twenty seven eighteen DILAPIDATIONS At the termination of a lease supposing he has not done so before a landlord can and usually does send a surveyor to report upon the condition of the tenement and it becomes his duty to ferret out every defect A litigious landlord may drag the outgoing tenant into an expensive lawsuit which he has no power to prevent He may even compel him to pay for repairing improvements which he has effected in the tenement itself if dilapidations exist When the lessor covenants to do all repairs and fails to do so the lessee may repair and deduct the cost from the rent twenty seven nineteen RECOVERY OF RENT The remedies placed in the hands of landlords are very stringent The day after rent falls due he may proceed to recover it by action at law by distress on the premises or by action of ejectment if the rent is half a year in arrear Distress is the remedy usually applied the landlord being authorized to enter the premises seize the goods and chattels of his tenant and sell them on the fifth day to reimburse himself for all arrears of rent and the charges of the distress There are a few exceptions but generally all goods found on the premises may be seized The exceptions are dogs rabbits poultry fish tools and implements of a man s trade actually in use the books of a scholar the axe of a carpenter wearing apparel on the person a horse at the plough or a horse he may be riding a watch in the pocket loose money deeds writings the cattle at a smithy forge corn sent to a mill for grinding cattle and goods of a guest at an inn but curiously enough carriages and horses standing at livery at the same inn may be taken Distress can only be levied in the daytime and if made after the tender of arrears it is illegal If tender is made after the distress but before it is impounded the landlord must abandon the distress and bear the cost himself Nothing of a perishable nature which cannot be restored in the same condition as milk fruit and the like must be taken twenty seven twenty The law does not regard a day as consisting of portions The popular notion that a notice to quit should be served before noon is an error Although distraint is one of the remedies it is seldom advisable in a landlord to resort to distraining for the recovery of rent If a tenant cannot pay his rent the sooner he leaves the premises the better If he be a rogue and won t pay he will probably know that nine out of ten distresses are illegal through the carelessness ignorance or extortion of the brokers who execute them Many if not most of the respectable brokers will not execute distresses and the business falls into the hands of persons whom it is by no means desirable to employ twenty seven twenty one Powers to relieve landlords of premises by giving them legal possession are given by nineteen twenty Vict cap one hundred eight to the county courts in cases where the rent does not exceed Lfifty per annum and under the circumstances hereinafter mentioned i e one Where the term has expired or been determined by notice to quit two Where there is one half year s rent in arrear and the landlord shall have right by law to enter for the nonpayment thereof As proof of this power is required the importance of including such a power in the agreement for tenancy will be obvious In the county courts the amount of rent due may be claimed as well as the possession of the premises in one summons twenty seven twenty two When a tenant deserts premises leaving one half year s rent in arrear possession may be recovered by means of the police court The rent must not exceed Ltwenty per annum and must be at least three fourths of the value of the premises In cases in which the tenant has not deserted the premises and where notice to quit has been given and has expired the landlord must give notice to the tenant of his intended application The annual rent in this case also must not exceed Ltwenty twenty seven twenty three THE I O U The law is not particular as to orthography in fact it distinctly refuses to recognize the existence of that delightful science You may bring your action against mister Jacob Phillips under the fanciful denomination of Jaycobb Fillipse if you like and the law won t care because the law goes by ear and although it insists upon having everything written things written are only supposed in law to have any meaning when read which is after all a common sense rule enough So instead of I owe you persons of a cheerful disposition so frequently found connected with debt used to write facetiously I O U and the law approved of their so doing An I O U is nothing more than a written admission of a debt and may run thus fifteenth October eighteen sixty To mister W BROWN I O U ten pounds for coals Lten JOHN JONES If to this you add the time of payment as payable in one month from this date your I O U is worthless and illegal for it thus ceases to be a mere acknowledgment and becomes a promissory note Now a promissory note requires a stamp which an I O U does not Many persons nevertheless stick penny stamps upon them probably for ornamental effect or to make them look serious and authoritative If for the former purpose the postage stamp looks better than the receipt stamp upon blue paper If you are W Brown and you didn t see the I O U signed and can t find anybody who knows Jones s autograph and Jones won t pay the I O U will be of no use to you in the county court except to make the judge laugh He will however allow you to prove the consideration and as of course you won t be prepared to do anything of the sort he will if you ask him politely adjourn the hearing for a week when you can produce the coalheavers who delivered the article and thus gain a glorious victory twenty seven twenty four APPRENTICES By the statute five Eliz cap four it is enacted that in cases of ill usage by masters towards apprentices or of neglect of duty by apprentices the complaining party may apply to a justice of the peace who may make such order as equity may require If for want of conformity on the part of the master this cannot be done then the master may be bound to appear at the next sessions Authority is given by the act to the justices in sessions to discharge the apprentice from his indentures They are also empowered on proof of misbehaviour of the apprentice to order him to be corrected or imprisoned with hard labour twenty seven twenty five HUSBAND AND WIFE Contrary to the vulgar opinion second cousins as well as first may legally marry When married a husband is liable for his wife s debts contracted before marriage A creditor desirous of suing for such a claim should proceed against both It will however be sufficient if the husband be served with process the names of both appearing therein thus John Jones and Ann his wife A married woman if sued alone may plead her marriage or as it is called in law coverture The husband is liable for debts of his wife contracted for necessaries while living with him If she voluntarily leaves his protection this liability ceases He is also liable for any debts contracted by her with his authority If the husband have abjured the realm or been transported by a sentence of law the wife is liable during his absence as if she were a single woman for debts contracted by her twenty seven twenty six In civil cases a wife may now give evidence on behalf of her husband in criminal cases she can neither be a witness for or against her husband The case of assault by him upon her forms an exception to this rule twenty seven twenty seven The law does not at this day admit the ancient principle of allowing moderate correction by a husband upon the person of his wife Although this is said to have been anciently limited to the use of a stick not bigger than the thumb this barbarity is now altogether exploded He may notwithstanding as has been recently shown in the famous Agapemone case keep her under restraint to prevent her leaving him provided this be effected without cruelty twenty seven twenty eight By the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act eighteen fifty seven a wife deserted by her husband may apply to a magistrate or to the petty sessions for an order to protect her lawful earnings or property acquired by her after such desertion from her husband and his creditors In this case it is indispensable that such order shall within ten days be entered at the county court of the district within which she resides It will be seen that the basis of an application for such an order is desertion Consequently where the parties have separated by common consent such an order cannot be obtained any previous cruelty or misconduct on the husband s part notwithstanding twenty seven twenty nine When a husband allows his wife to invest money in her own name in a savings bank and he survives her it is sometimes the rule of such establishments to compel him to take out administration in order to receive such money although it is questionable whether such rule is legally justifiable Widows and widowers pay no legacy duty for property coming to them through their deceased partners twenty seven thirty RECEIPTS for sums above Ltwo should now be given upon penny stamps A bill of exchange may nevertheless be discharged by an indorsement stating that it has been paid and this will not be liable to the stamp A receipt is not as commonly supposed conclusive evidence as to a payment It is only what the law terms prima facie evidence that is good until contradicted or explained Thus if A sends wares or merchandise to B with a receipt as a hint that the transaction is intended to be for ready money and B detain the receipt without paying the cash A will be at liberty to prove the circumstances and to recover his claim The evidence to rebut the receipt must however be clear and indubitable as after all written evidence is of a stronger nature than oral testimony twenty seven thirty one BOOKS OF ACCOUNT A tradesman s books of account cannot be received as evidence in his own behalf unless the entries therein be proved to have been brought under the notice of and admitted to be correct by the other party as is commonly the case with the pass books employed backwards and forwards between bakers butchers and the like domestic traders and their customers The defendant may however compel the tradesman to produce his books to show entries adverse to his own claim twenty seven thirty two WILLS The last proof of affection which we can give to those left behind is to leave their worldly affairs in such a state as to excite neither jealousy nor anger nor heartrendings of any kind at least for the immediate future This can only be done by a just clear and intelligible disposal of whatever there is to leave Without being advocates for every man being his own lawyer it is not to be denied that the most elaborately prepared wills have been the most fruitful sources of litigation and it has even happened that learned judges left wills behind them which could not be carried out Except in cases where the property is in land or in leases of complicated tenure very elaborate details are unnecessary and we counsel no man to use words in making his will of which he does not perfectly understand the meaning and import twenty seven thirty three All men over twenty one years of age and of sound mind and all unmarried women of like age and sanity may by will bequeath their property to whom they please Infants that is all persons under twenty one years of age and married women except where they have an estate to their own separate use are incapacitated without the concurrence of the husband the law taking the disposal of any property they die possessed of A person born deaf and dumb cannot make a will unless there is evidence that he could read and comprehend its contents A person convicted of felony cannot make a will unless subsequently pardoned neither can persons outlawed but the wife of a felon transported for life may make a will and act in all respects as if she were unmarried A suicide may bequeath real estate but personal property is forfeited to the crown twenty seven thirty four Except in the case of soldiers on actual service and sailors at sea every will must be made in writing It must be signed by the testator or by some other person in his presence and at his request and the signature must be made or acknowledged in the presence of two or more witnesses who are required to be present at the same time who declare by signing that the will was signed by the testator or acknowledged in their presence and that they signed as witnesses in testator s presence twenty seven thirty five By the act of eighteen fifty two it was enacted that no will shall be valid unless signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator or by some person in his presence and by his direction but a subsequent act proceeds to say that every will shall as far only as regards the position of the signature of the testator or of the person signing for him be deemed valid if the signature shall be so placed at or after or following or under or beside or opposite to the end of the will that it shall be apparent on the face of it that the testator intended to give it effect by such signature Under this clause a will of several sheets all of which were duly signed except the last one has been refused probate while on the other hand a similar document has been admitted to probate where the last sheet only and none of the other sheets was signed In order to be perfectly formal however each separate sheet should be numbered signed and witnessed and attested on the last sheet This witnessing is an important act the witnesses must subscribe it in the presence of the testator and of each other and by their signature they testify to having witnessed the signature of the testator he being in sound mind at the time Wills made under any kind of coercion or even importunity may become void being contrary to the wishes of the testator Fraud or imposition also renders a will void and where two wills made by the same person happen to exist neither of them dated the maker of the wills is declared to have died intestate twenty seven thirty six A will may always be revoked and annulled but only by burning or entirely destroying the writing or by adding a codicil or making a subsequent will duly attested but as the alteration of a will is only a revocation to the extent of the alteration if it is intended to revoke the original will entirely such intention should be declared no merely verbal directions can revoke a written will and the act of running the pen through the signatures or down the page is not sufficient to cancel it without a written declaration to that effect signed and witnessed twenty seven thirty seven A will made before marriage is revoked thereby twenty seven thirty eight A codicil is a supplement or addition to a will either explaining or altering former dispositions it may be written on the same or separate paper and is to be witnessed and attested in the same manner as the original document twenty seven thirty nine WITNESSES Any persons are qualified to witness a will who can write their names but such witness cannot be benefitted by the will If a legacy is granted to the persons witnessing it is void The same rule applies to the husband or wife of a witness a bequest made to either of these is void twenty seven forty FORM OF WILLS Form is unimportant provided the testator s intention is clear It should commence with his designation that is his name and surname place of abode profession or occupation The legatees should also be clearly described In leaving a legacy to a married woman if no trustees are appointed over it and no specific directions given that it is for her sole and separate use free from the control debts and incumbrances of her husband the husband will be entitled to the legacy In the same manner a legacy to an unmarried woman will vest in her husband after marriage unless a settlement of it is made on her before marriage twenty seven forty one In sudden emergencies a form may be useful and the following has been considered a good one for a death bed will where the assistance of a solicitor could not be obtained indeed few solicitors can prepare a will on the spur of the moment they require time and legal forms which are by no means necessary before they can act I A B of No ten Street in the city of gentleman builder or grocer as the case may be being of sound mind thus publish and declare my last will and testament Revoking and annulling all former dispositions of my property I give and bequeath as follows to my son J B of I give and bequeath the sum of to my daughter M the wife of J of I give and bequeath the sum of if intended for her own use add to her sole and separate use free from the control debts and incumbrances of her husband both in addition to any sum or sums of money or other property they have before had from me All the remaining property I die possessed of I leave to my dear wife M B for her sole and separate use during her natural life together with my house and furniture situate at No ten Street aforesaid At her death I desire that the said house shall be sold with all the goods and chattels therein or I give and bequeath the said house with all the goods and chattels therein to and the money realized from the sale together with that in which my said wife had a life interest I give and bequeath in equal moieties to my son and daughter before named I appoint my dear friend T S of and T B of together with my wife M B as executors to this my last will and testament Signed by A B this tenth day of October eighteen sixty one in our presence both being present together and both having signed as witnesses in the presence of the testator A B T S Witness F M Witness It is to be observed that the signature of the testator after this attestation has been signed by the witnesses is not a compliance with the act he must sign first twenty seven forty two STAMP DUTIES In the case of persons dying intestate when their effects are administered to by their family the stamp duty is half as much more as it would have been under a will Freehold and copyhold estates are now subject to a special impost on passing by the Stamp Act of eighteen fifty seven twenty seven forty three The legacy duty only commences when it amounts to Ltwenty and upwards and where it is not directed otherwise the duty is deducted from the legacy twenty seven forty four You cannot compound for past absence of charity by bequeathing land or tenements or money to purchase such to any charitable use by your last will and testament but you may devise them to the British Museum to either of the two universities of Oxford and Cambridge to Eton Winchester and Westminster and you may if so inclined leave it for the augmentation of Queen Anne s bounty You may however order your executors to sell land and hand over the money received to any charitable institution twenty seven forty five In making provision for a wife state whether it is in lieu of or in addition to dower twenty seven forty six If you have advanced money to any child and taken an acknowledgment for it or entered it in any book of account you should declare whether any legacy left by will is in addition to such advance or whether it is to be deducted from the legacy twenty seven forty seven A legacy left by will to any one would be cancelled by your leaving another legacy by a codicil to the same person unless it is stated to be in addition to the former bequest twenty seven forty eight Your entire estate is chargeable with your debts except where the real estate is settled Let it be distinctly stated out of which property the real or personal they are paid where it consists of both twenty seven forty nine Whatever is devised let the intention be clearly expressed and without any condition if you intend it to take effect twenty seven fifty Attestation is not necessary to a will as the act of witnessing is all the law requires and the will itself declares the testator to be of sound mind in his own estimation but wherever there are erasures or interlineations one becomes necessary No particular form is prescribed but it should state that the testator either signed it himself or that another signed it by his request or that he acknowledged the signature to be his in their presence both being present together and signed as witnesses in his presence When there are erasures the attestation must declare that The words interlined in the third line of page four and the erasure in the fifth line of page six having been first made These are the acts necessary to make a properly executed will and being simple in themselves and easily performed they should be strictly complied with and always attested twenty seven fifty one A witness may on being requested sign for testator and he may also sign for his fellow witness supposing he can only make his mark declaring that he does so but a husband cannot sign for his wife either as testator or witness nor can a wife
