thumping the cannon ball Edams and the millstone Goudas with their bare red knuckles plugging in with a hollow steel tool for samples In Holland the business of judging a crumb of cheese has been taken with great seriousness for centuries The abracadabra is comparable to that of the wine taster or tea taster These Edamers have the trained ear of music masters and merely by knuckle rapping can tell down to an air pocket left by a gas bubble just how mature the interior is The connoisseurs use gingerbread as a mouth freshener and I too that sunny day among the Edams kept my gingerbread handy and made my way from one fine cheese to another trying out generous plugs from the heaped cannon balls that looked like the ammunition dump at Antietam I remember another market day this time in Lucerne All morning I stocked up on good Schweizerkaese and better Gruyere For lunch I had cheese salad All around me the farmers were rolling two hundred pound Emmentalers bigger than oxcart wheels I sat in a little cafe absorbing cheese and cheese lore in equal quantities I learned that a prize cheese must be chock full of equal sized eyes the gas holes produced during fermentation They must glisten like polished bar glass The cheese itself must be of a light lemonish yellow Its flavor must be nutlike Nuts and Swiss cheese complement each other as subtly as Gorgonzola and a ripe banana There are I learned blind Swiss cheeses as well but the million eyed ones are better But I don t have to hark back to Switzerland and Holland for cheese memories Here at home we have increasingly taken over the cheeses of all nations first importing them then imitating them from Swiss Engadine to what we call Genuine Sprinz We ve naturalized Scandinavian Blues and smoked browns and baptized our own Saaland Pfarr in native whiskey Of fifty popular Italian types we duplicate more than half some fairly well others badly We have our own legitimate offspring too beginning with the Pineapple supposed to have been first made about eighteen forty five in Litchfield County Connecticut We have our own creamy Neufchatel New York Coon Vermont Sage the delicious Liederkranz California Jack Nuworld and dozens of others not all quite so original And true to the American way we ve organized cheese eating There s an annual cheese week and a cheese month October We even boast a mail order Cheese of the Month Club We haven t yet reached the point of sophistication however attained by a Paris cheese club that meets regularly To qualify for membership you have to identify two hundred basic cheeses and you have to do it blindfolded This is a test I d prefer not to submit to but in my amateur way I have during the past year or two been sharpening my cheese perception with whatever varieties I could encounter around New York I ve run into briny Caucasian Cossack Corsican Gricotta and exotics like Rarush Durmar Travnik and Karaghi La la Cheese hunting is one of the greatest and least competitively crowded of sports I hope this book may lead others to give it a try Illustration Chapter Two The Big Cheese One of the world s first outsize cheeses officially weighed in at four tons in a fair at Toronto Canada seventy years ago Another monstrous Cheddar tipped the scales at six tons in the New York State Fair at Syracuse in nineteen thirty seven Before this a one thousand pounder was fetched all the way from New Zealand to London to star in the Wembley Exposition of nineteen twenty four But compared to the outsize Syracusan it looked like a Baby Gouda As a matter of fact neither England nor any of her great dairying colonies have gone in for mammoth jobs except Canada with that four tonner shown at Toronto We should mention two historic king size Chesters You can find out all about them in Cheddar Gorge edited by Sir John Squire The first of them weighed one hundred forty nine pounds and was the largest made up to the year eighteen twenty five It was proudly presented to H R H the Duke of York Its heft almost tied the one hundred forty seven pound Green County wheel of Wisconsin Swiss presented by the makers to President Coolidge in nineteen twenty eight in appreciation of his raising the protective tariff against genuine Swiss to fifty percent While the cheese itself weighed a mite under one hundred fifty His Royal Highness ruff belly knee breeches doffed high hat and all was a hundred weight heavier and thus almost dwarfed it It was almost a century later that the second record breaking Chester weighed in at only two hundred pounds Yet it won a Gold Medal and a Challenge Cup and was presented to the King who graciously accepted it This was more than Queen Victoria had done with a bridal gift cheese that tipped the scales at eleven hundred pounds It took a whole day s yield from seven hundred eighty contented cows and stood a foot and eight inches high measuring nine feet four inches around the middle The assembled donors of the cheese were so proud of it that they asked royal permission to exhibit it on a round of country fairs The Queen assented to this ambitious request perhaps prompted by the exhibition minded Albert The publicity seeking cheesemongers assured Her Majesty that the gift would be returned to her just as soon as it had been exhibited But the Queen didn t want it back after it was show worn The donors began to quarrel among themselves about what to do with the remains until finally it got into Chancery where so many lost causes end their days The cheese was never heard of again While it is generally true that the bigger the cheese the better much the same as a magnum bottle of champagne is better than a pint there is a limit to the obesity of a block ball or brick of almost any kinds of cheese When they pass a certain limit they lack homogeneity and are not nearly so good as the smaller ones Today a good magnum size for an exhibition Cheddar is five hundred sixty pounds for a prize Provolone two hundred eighty pounds while a Swiss wheel of only two hundred ten will draw crowds to any food shop window Yet by and large it s the monsters that get into the Cheese Hall of Fame and come down to us in song and story For example that four ton Toronto affair inspired a cheese poet James McIntyre who doubled as the local undertaker We have thee mammoth cheese Lying quietly at your ease Gently fanned by evening breeze Thy fair form no flies dare seize All gaily dressed soon you ll go To the greatest provincial show To be admired by many a beau In the city of Toronto May you not receive a scar as We have heard that mister Harris Intends to send you off as far as The great world s show at Paris Of the youth beware of these For some of them might rudely squeeze And bite your cheek then song or glees We could not sing oh Queen of Cheese An ode to a one hundred percent American mammoth was inspired by The Ultra Democratic Anti Federalist Cheese of Cheshire This was in the summer of eighteen oh one when the patriotic people of Cheshire Massachusetts turned out en masse to concoct a mammoth cheese on the village green for presentation to their beloved President Jefferson The unique demonstration occurred spontaneously in jubilant commemoration of the greatest political triumph of a new country in a new century the victory of the Democrats over the Federalists Its collective making was heralded in Boston s Mercury and New England Palladium September eight eighteen oh one The Mammoth Cheese AN EPICO LYRICO BALLAD From meadows rich with clover red A thousand heifers come The tinkling bells the tidings spread The milkmaid muffles up her head And wakes the village hum In shining pans the snowy flood Through whitened canvas pours The dyeing pots of otter good And rennet tinged with madder blood Are sought among their stores The quivering curd in panniers stowed Is loaded on the jade The stumbling beast supports the load While trickling whey bedews the road Along the dusty glade As Cairo s slaves to bondage bred The arid deserts roam Through trackless sands undaunted tread With skins of water on their head To cheer their masters home So here full many a sturdy swain His precious baggage bore Old misers e en forgot their gain And bed rid cripples free from pain Now took the road before The widow with her dripping mite Upon her saddle horn Rode up in haste to see the sight And aid a charity so right A pauper so forlorn The circling throng an opening drew Upon the verdant grass To let the vast procession through To spread their rich repast in view And Elder J L pass Then Elder J with lifted eyes In musing posture stood Invoked a blessing from the skies To save from vermin mites and flies And keep the bounty good Now mellow strokes the yielding pile From polished steel receives And shining nymphs stand still a while Or mix the mass with salt and oil With sage and savory leaves Then sextonlike the patriot troop With naked arms and crown Embraced with hardy hands the scoop And filled the vast expanded hoop While beetles smacked it down Next girding screws the ponderous beam With heft immense drew down The gushing whey from every seam Flowed through the streets a rapid stream And shad came up to town This spirited achievement of early democracy is commemorated today by a sign set up at the ancient and honorable town of Cheshire located between Pittsfield and North Adams on Route eight Jefferson s speech of thanks to the democratic people of Cheshire rings out in history I look upon this cheese as a token of fidelity from the very heart of the people of this land to the great cause of equal rights to all men This popular presentation started a tradition When Van Buren succeeded to the Presidency he received a similar mammoth cheese in token of the high esteem in which he was held A monstrous one bigger than the Jeffersonian was made by New Englanders to show their loyalty to President Jackson For weeks this stood in state in the hall of the White House At last the floor was a foot deep in the fragments remaining after the enthusiastic Democrats had eaten their fill Illustration Chapter Three Foreign Greats Ode to Cheese God of the country bless today Thy cheese For which we give Thee thanks on bended knees Let them be fat or light with onions blent Shallots brine pepper honey whether scent Of sheep or fields is in them in the yard Let them good Lord at dawn be beaten hard And let their edges take on silvery shades Under the moist red hands of dairymaids And round and greenish let them go to town Weighing the shepherd s folding mantle down Whether from Parma or from Jura heights Kneaded by august hands of Carmelites Stamped with the mitre of a proud abbess Flowered with the perfumes of the grass of Bresse From hollow Holland from the Vosges from Brie From Roquefort Gorgonzola Italy Bless them good Lord Bless Stilton s royal fare Red Cheshire and the tearful cream Gruyere FROM JETHRO BITHELL S TRANSLATION OF A POEM BY M Thomas Braun Symphonie des Fromages A giant Cantal seeming to have been chopped open with an ax stood aside of a golden hued Chester and a Swiss Gruyere resembling the wheel of a Roman chariot There were Dutch Edams round and blood red and Port Saluts lined up like soldiers on parade Three Bries side by side suggested phases of the moon two of them very dry were amber colored and full and the third in its second quarter was runny and creamy with a milky way which no human barrier seemed able to restrain And all the while majestic Roqueforts looked down with princely contempt upon the other through the glass of their crystal covers Emile Zola In nineteen fifty three the United States Department of Agriculture published Handbook No fifty four entitled Cheese Varieties and Descriptions with this comment There probably are only about eighteen distinct types or kinds of natural cheese All the rest more than four hundred names are of local origin usually named after towns or communities A list of the best known names applied to each of these distinct varieties or groups is given Brick Gouda Romano Camembert Hand Roquefort Cheddar Limburger Sapsago Cottage Neufchatel Swiss Cream Parmesan Trappist Edam Provolone Whey cheeses Mysost and Ricotta May we nominate another dozen to form our own Cheese Hall of Fame We begin our list with a partial roll call of the big Blues family and end it with members of the monastic order of Port Salut Trappist that includes Canadian Oka and our own Kentucky thoroughbred The Blues that Are Green Stilton Roquefort and Gorgonzola form the triumvirate that rules a world of lesser Blues They are actually green as green as the mythical cheese the moon is made of In almost every land where cheese is made you can sample a handful of lesser Blues and imitations of the invincible three and try to classify them until you re blue in the face The best we can do in this slight summary is to mention a few of the most notable aside from our own Blues of Minnesota Wisconsin Oregon and other states that major in cheese Danish Blues are popular and splendidly made such as Flower of Denmark The Argentine competes with a pampas grass Blue all its own But

goat and sheep Septmoncel is the leader of these made in the Jura mountains and considered by many French caseophiles to outrank Roquefort This class of Blue or marbled cheese is called fromage persille as well as fromage bleu and pate bleue Similar mountain cheeses are made in Auvergne and Aubrac and have distinct qualities that have brought them fame such as Cantal bleu d Auvergne Guiole or Laguiole bleu de Salers and saint Flour Olivet and Queville come within the color scheme and sundry others such as Champoleon Journiac Queyras and Sarraz Of English Blues there are several celebrities beside Stilton and Cheshire Stilton Wensleydale was one in the early days and still is together with Blue Dorset the deepest green of them all and esoteric Blue Vinny a choosey cheese not liked by everybody the favorite of Thomas Hardy Brie Sheila Hibben once wrote in The New Yorker I can t imagine any difference of opinion about Brie s being the queen of all cheeses and if there is any such difference I shall certainly ignore it The very shape of Brie so uncheese like and so charmingly fragile is exciting Nine times out of ten a Brie will let you down will be all caked into layers which shows it is too young or at the over runny stage which means it is too old but when you come on the tenth Brie coulant to just the right delicate creaminess and the color of fresh sweet butter no other cheese can compare with it The season of Brie like that of oysters is simple to remember only months with an R beginning with September which is the best bar none Caciocavallo From Bulgaria to Turkey the Italian horse cheese as Caciocavallo translates is as universally popular as it is at home and in all the Little Italics throughout the rest of the world Flattering imitations are made and named after it as follows BULGARIA Kascaval GREECE Kashcavallo and Caskcaval HUNGARY Parenica RUMANIA Pentele and Kascaval SERBIA Katschkawalj SYRIA Cashkavallo TRANSYLVANIA Kascaval as in Rumania TURKEY Cascaval Penir YUGOSLAVIA Kackavalj A horse s head printed on the cheese gave rise to its popular name and to the myth that it is made of mare s milk It is however curded from cow s milk whole or partly skimmed and sometimes from water buffalo hard yellow and so buttery that the best of it which comes from Sorrento is called Cacio burro butter cheese Slightly salty with a spicy tang it is eaten sliced when young and mild and used for grating and seasoning when old not only on the usual Italian pastes but on sweets Different from the many grating cheeses made from little balls of curd called grana Caciocavallo is a pasta fileta or drawn curd product Because of this it is sometimes drawn out in long thick threads and braided It is a cheese for skilled artists to make sculptures with sometimes horses heads again bunches of grapes and other fruits even as Provolone is shaped like apples and pears and often worked into elaborate bas relief designs But ordinarily the horse s head is a plain tenpin in shape or a squat bottle with a knob on the side by which it has been tied up two cheeses at a time on opposite sides of a rafter while being smoked lightly golden and rubbed with olive oil and butter to make it all the more buttery In Calabria and Sicily it is very popular and although the best comes from Sorrento there is keen competition from Abruzzi Apulian Province and Molise It keeps well and doesn t spoil when shipped overseas In his Little Book of Cheese Osbert Burdett recommends the high horsy strength of this smoked Cacio over tobacco smoke after dinner Only monsters smoke at meals but a monster assured me that Gorgonzola best survives this malpractice Clearly some pungency is necessary and confidence suggests rather Cacio which would survive anything the monster said Camembert Camembert is called mold matured and all that is genuine is labeled Syndicat du Vrai Camembert The name in full is Syndicat des Fabricants du Veritable Camembert de Normandie and we agree that this is a most useful association for the defense of one of the best cheeses of France Its extremely delicate piquance cannot be matched except perhaps by Brie Napoleon is said to have named it and to have kissed the waitress who first served it to him in the tiny town of Camembert And there a statue stands today in the market place to honor Marie Harel who made the first Camembert Camembert is equally good on thin slices of apple pineapple pear French flute or pumpernickel As with Brie and with oysters Camembert should be eaten only in the R months and of these September is the best Since Camembert rhymes with beware if you can t get the veritable don t fall for a domestic imitation or any West German abomination such as one dressed like a valentine in a heart shaped box and labeled Camembert Cheese Exquisite They are equally tasteless chalky with youth or choking with ammoniacal gas when old and decrepit Cheddar The English Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery says Cheddar cheese is one of the kings of cheese it is pale coloured mellow salvy and when good resembling a hazelnut in flavour The Cheddar principle pervades the whole cheesemaking districts of America Canada and New Zealand but no cheese imported into England can equal the Cheddars of Somerset and the West of Scotland Named for a village near Bristol where farmer Joseph Harding first manufactured it the best is still called Farmhouse Cheddar but in America we have practically none of this Farmhouse Cheddar must be ripened at least nine months to a mellowness and little of our American cheese gets as much as that Back in sixteen ninety five John Houghton wrote that it contended in goodness if kept from two to five years according to magnitude with any cheese in England Today it is called England s second best cheese second after Stilton of course In early days a large cheese sufficed for a year or two of family feeding according to this old note A big Cheddar can be kept for two years in excellent condition if kept in a cool room and turned over every other day But in old England some were harder to preserve In Bath I asked one lady of the larder how she kept Cheddar cheese Her eyes twinkled We don t keep cheese we eats it Cheshire A Cheshireman sailed into Spain To trade for merchandise When he arrived from the main A Spaniard him espies Who said You English rogue look here What fruits and spices fine Our land produces twice a year Thou has not such in thine The Cheshireman ran to his hold And fetched a Cheshire cheese And said Look here you dog behold We have such fruits as these Your fruits are ripe but twice a year As you yourself do say But such as I present you here Our land brings twice a day Anonymous Let us pass on to cheese We have some glorious cheeses and far too few people glorying in them The Cheddar of the inn of the chophouse of the average English home is a libel on a thing which when authentic is worthy of great honor Cheshire divinely commanded into existence as to three parts to precede and as to one part to accompany certain Tawny Ports and some Late Bottled Ports can be a thing for which the British Navy ought to fire a salute on the principle on which Colonel Brisson made his regiment salute when passing the great Burgundian vineyard T Earle Welby IN THE DINNER KNELL Cheshire is not only the most literary cheese in England but the oldest It was already manufactured when Caesar conquered Britain and tradition is that the Romans built the walled city of Chester to control the district where the precious cheese was made Chester on the River Dee was a stronghold against the Roman invasion It came to fame with The Old Cheshire Cheese in Elizabethan times and waxed great with Samuel Johnson presiding at the Fleet Street Inn where White Cheshire was served with radishes or watercress or celery when in season and Red Cheshire was served toasted or stewed in a sort of Welsh Rabbit See Chapter five The Blue variety is called Cheshire Stilton and Vyvyan Holland in Cheddar Gorge suggests that it was no doubt a cheese of this sort discovered and filched from the larder of the Queen of Hearts that accounted for the contented grin on the face of the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland All very English as recorded in Victor Meusy s couplet Dans le Chester sec et rose A longues dents l Anglais mord In the Chester dry and pink The long teeth of the English sink Edam and Gouda Edam in Peace and War There also coming into the river two Dutchmen we sent a couple of men on board and brought three Holland cheeses cost fourd a piece excellent cheeses Pepys Diary March twenty one thousand six hundred sixty three Commodore Coe of the Montevidian Navy defeated Admiral Brown of the Buenos Ayrean Navy in a naval battle when he used Holland cheese for cannon balls The Harbinger Vermont December eleven eighteen forty seven The crimson cannon balls of Holland have been heard around the world Known as red balls in England and katzenkopf cat s head in Germany they differ from Gouda chiefly in the shape Gouda being round but flattish and now chiefly imported as one pound Baby Goudas Edam when it is good is very very good but when it is bad it is horrid Sophisticated ones are sent over already scalloped for the ultimate consumer to add port and there are crocks of Holland cheese potted with sauterne Both Edam and Gouda should be well aged to develop full bodied quality two years being the accepted standard for Edam The best Edams result from a perfect combination of Breed black and white Dutch Friesian and Feed the rich pasturage of Friesland and Noord Holland The Goudas shaped like English Derby and Belgian Delft and Leyden come from South Holland Some are specially made for the Jewish trade and called Kosher Gouda Both Edam and Gouda are eaten at mealtimes thrice daily in Holland A Dutch breakfast without one or the other on black bread with butter and black coffee would be unthinkable They re also boon companions to plum bread and Dutch cocoa Eclair Edams are those with soft insides Emmentaler Gruyere and Swiss When the working woman Takes her midday lunch It is a piece of Gruyere Which for her takes the place of roast Victor Meusy Whether an Emmentaler is eminently Schweizerkaese grand Gruyere from France or lesser Swiss of the United States the shape size and glisten of the eyes indicate the stage of ripeness skill of making and quality of flavor They must be uniform roundish about the size of a big cherry and most important of all must glisten like the eye of a lass in love dry but with the suggestion of a tear Gruyere does not see eye to eye with the big holed Swiss Saanen cartwheel or American imitation It has tiny holes and many of them let us say it is freckled with pinholes rather than pock marked This variety is technically called a niszler while one without any holes at all is blind Eyes or holes are also called vesicles Gruyere Trauben Grape Gruyere is aged in Neuchatel wine in Switzerland although most Gruyere has been made in France since its introduction there in seventeen twenty two The most famous is made in the Jura and another is called Comte from its origin in Franche Comte A blind Emmentaler was made in Switzerland for export to Italy where it was hardened in caves to become a grating cheese called Raper and now it is largely imitated there Emmentaler in fact because of its piquant pecan nut flavor and inimitable quality is simulated everywhere even in Switzerland Besides phonies from Argentina and countries as far off as Finland we get a flood of imported and domestic Swisses of all sad sorts with all possible faults from too many holes that make a flabby wobbly cheese to too few cracked dried up collapsed or utterly ruined by molding inside So it will pay you to buy only the kind already marked genuine in Switzerland For there cheese such as Saanen takes six years to ripen improves with age and keeps forever Cartwheels well over a hundred years old are still kept in cheese cellars as common in Switzerland as wine cellars are in France and it is said that the rank of a family is determined by the age and quality of the cheese in its larder Feta and Casere The Greeks have a name for it Feta Their neighbors call it Greek cheese Feta is to cheese what Hymettus is to honey The two together make ambrosial manna Feta is soft and as blinding white as a plate of fresh Ricotta smothered with sour cream The whiteness is preserved by shipping the cheese all the way from Greece in kegs sloshing full of milk the milk being renewed from time to time Having been cured in brine this great sheep milk curd is slightly salty and somewhat sharp but superbly spicy When first we tasted it fresh from the keg with salty milk dripping through our fingers we gave it full marks This was at the Staikos Brothers Greek import store on West twenty third Street in Manhattan We then compared Feta with thin wisps of its grown up brother Casere This gray and greasy hard and brittle palate tickler of sheep s milk made us bleat for more Feta Gorgonzola Gorgonzola least pretentious of the Blues triumvirate including Roquefort and Stilton is nonetheless by common consent monarch of all other Blues from Argentina to Denmark In England indeed many epicures consider Gorgonzola greater than Stilton which is the highest praise any cheese can get there Like all great cheeses it has been widely imitated but never equaled Imported Gorgonzola when fruity ripe is still firm but creamy and golden inside with rich green veins running through Very pungent and highly flavored it is eaten sliced or crumbled to flavor salad dressings like Roquefort Hable Creme Chantilly The name Hable Creme Chantilly sounds French but the cheese is Swedish and actually lives up to the blurb in the imported package The overall characteristic is indescribable and delightful freshness This exclusive product of the Walk Gaerd Creamery was hailed by Sheila Hibben in The New Yorker of May six nineteen fifty as enthusiastically as Brillat Savarin would have greeted a new dish or the Planetarium a new star Endeavoring to be as restrained as I can I shall merely suggest that the arrival of Creme Chantilly is a historic event and that in reporting on it I feel something of the responsibility that the contemporaries of Madame Harel the famous cheese making lady of Normandy must have felt when they were passing judgment on the first Camembert Miss Hibben goes on to say that only a fromage a la creme made in Quebec had come anywhere near her impression of the new Swedish triumph She quotes the last word from the makers themselves This is a very special product that has never been made on this earth before and speaks of the elusive flavor of mushrooms before summing up the exquisitely textured curd and the unexpectedly fresh flavor combine to make it one of the most subtly enjoyable foods that have come my way in a long time And so say we all of us Hand Cheese Hand cheese has this niche in our Cheese Hall of Fame not because we consider it great but because it is usually included among the eighteen varieties on which the hundreds of others are based It is named from having been molded into its final shape by hand Universally popular with Germanic races it is too strong for the others To our mind Hand cheese never had anything that Allgaeuer or Limburger hasn t improved upon It is the only cheese that is commonly melted into steins of beer and drunk instead of eaten It is usually studded with caraway seeds the most natural spice for curds Limburger Limburger has always been popular in America ever since it was brought over by German American immigrants but England never took to it This is eloquently expressed in the following entry in the English Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery Limburger cheese is chiefly famous for its pungently offensive odor It is made from skimmed milk and allowed to partially decompose before pressing It is very little known in this country and might be less so with advantage to consumers But this is libel Butter soft and sapid Limburger has brought gustatory pleasure to millions of hardy gastronomes since it came to light in the province of Luettich in Belgium It has been Americanized for almost a century and is by now one of the very few cheeses successfully imitated here chiefly in New York and Wisconsin Early Wisconsiners will never forget the Limburger Rebellion in Green County when the people rose in protest against the Limburger caravan that was accustomed to park in the little town of Monroe where it was marketed They threatened to stage a modern Boston Tea Party and dump the odoriferous bricks in the river when five or six wagonloads were left ripening in the sun in front of the town bank The Limburger was finally stored safely underground Livarot Livarot has been described as decadent The very Verlaine of them all and Victor Meusy personifies it in a poem dedicated to all the great French cheeses of which we give a free translation In the dog days In its overflowing dish Livarot gesticulates Or weeps like a child Muenster At the diplomatic banquet One must choose his piece All is politics A cheese and a flag You annoy the Russians If you take Chester You irritate the Prussians In choosing Muenster Victor Meusy Like Limburger this male cheese often caraway flavored does not fare well in England Although over here we consider Muenster far milder than Limburger the English writer Eric Weir in When Madame Cooks will have none of it I cannot think why this cheese was not thrown from the aeroplanes during the war to spread panic amongst enemy troops It would have proved far more efficacious than those nasty deadly gases that kill people permanently Neufchatel If the cream cheese be white Far fairer the hands that made them Arthur Hugh Clough Although originally from Normandy Neufchatel like Limburger was so long ago welcomed to America and made so splendidly at home here that we may consider it our very own All we have against it is that it has served as the model for too many processed abominations Parmesan Romano Pecorino Pecorino Romano Parmesan when young soft and slightly crumbly is eaten on bread But when well aged let us say up to a century it becomes Rock of Gibraltar of cheeses and really suited for grating It is easy to believe that the so called Spanish cheese used as a barricade by Americans in Nicaragua almost a century ago was none other than the almost indestructible Grana as Parmesan is called in Italy The association between cheese and battling began in B C days with the Jews and Romans who fed cheese to their soldiers not only for its energy value but as a convenient form of rations since every army travels on its stomach and can t go faster than its impedimenta The last notable mention of cheese in war was the name of the Monitor A cheese box on a raft Romano is not as expensive as Parmesan although it is as friable sharp and tangy for flavoring especially for soups such as onion and minestrone It is brittle and just off white when well aged Although made of sheep s milk Pecorino is classed with both Parmesan and Romano All three are excellently imitated in Argentina Romano and Pecorino Romano are interchangeable names for the strong medium sharp and piquant Parmesan types that sell for considerably less Most of it is now shipped from Sardinia There are several different kinds Pecorino Dolce sweet Sardo Tuscano and Pecorino Romano Cacio which relates it to Caciocavallo Kibitzers complain that some of the cheaper types of Pecorino are soapy but fans give it high praise Gillian F in her Letter from Italy in Osbert Burdett s delectable Little Book of Cheese writes Out in the orchard my companion I don t remember how had provided the miracle a flask of wine a loaf of bread and a slab of fresh Pecorino cheese there wasn t any thou for either But that cheese was Paradise and the flask was emptied and a wood dove cooing made you think that the flask s contents were in a crystal goblet instead of an enamel cup one only and the cheese broken with the fingers a cheese of cheeses Pont L Eveque This semisoft medium strong golden tinted French classic made since the thirteenth century is definitely a dessert cheese whose excellence is brought out best by a sound claret or tawny port Port Salut See Trappist Provolone Within recent years Provolone has taken America by storm as Camembert Roquefort Swiss Limburger Neufchatel and such great ones did long before But it has not been successfully imitated here because the original is made of rich water buffalo milk unattainable in the Americas With Caciocavallo this mellow smoky flavorsome delight is put up in all sorts of artistic forms red cellophaned apples pears bells a regular zoo of animals and in all sorts of sizes up to a monumental hundred pound bas relief imported for exhibition purposes by Phil Alpert Roquefort Homage to this fromage Long hailed as le roi Roquefort it has filled books and booklets beyond count By the miracle of Penicillium Roqueforti a new cheese was made It is placed historically back around the eighth century when Charlemagne was found picking out the green spots of Persille with the point of his knife thinking them decay But the monks of Saint Gall who were his hosts recorded in their annals that when they regaled him with Roquefort because it was Friday and they had no fish they also made bold to tell him he was wasting the best part of the cheese So he tasted again found the advice excellent and liked it so well he ordered two caisses of it sent every year to his palace at Aix la Chapelle He also suggested that it be cut in half first to make sure it was well veined with blue and then bound up with a wooden fastening Perhaps he hoped the wood would protect the cheeses from mice and rats for the good monks of Saint Gall couldn t be expected to send an escort of cats from their chalky caves to guard them even for Charlemagne There is no telling how many cats were mustered out in the caves in those early days but a recent census put the number at five hundred We can readily imagine the head handler in the caves leading a night inspection with a candle followed by his chief taster and a regiment of cats While the Dutch and other makers of cheese also employ cats to patrol their storage caves Roquefort holds the record for number An interesting point in this connection is that as rats and mice pick only the prime cheeses a gnawed one is not thrown away but greatly prized Sapsago Schabziger or Swiss Green Cheese The name Sapsago is a corruption of Schabziger German for whey cheese It s a hay cheese flavored heavily with melilot a kind of clover that s also grown for hay It comes from Switzerland in a hard truncated cone wrapped in a piece of paper that says To be used grated only Genuine Swiss Green Cheese Made of skimmed milk and herbs To the housewives Do you want a change in your meals Try the contents of this wrapper Delicious as spreading mixed with butter excellent for flavoring eggs macaroni spaghetti potatoes soup et cetera Can be used in place of any other cheese Do not take too much you might spoil the flavor We put this wrapper among our papers sealed it tight in an envelope and to this day six months later the scent of Sapsago clings round it still Stilton Honor for Cheeses Literary and munching circles in London are putting quite a lot of thought into a proposed memorial to Stilton cheese There is a Stilton Memorial Committee with Sir John Squire at the head and already the boys are fighting One side led by Sir John is all for a monument This presumably would not be a replica of Stilton itself although mister Epstein could probably hack out a pretty effective cheese shaped figure and call it Dolorosa The monument boosters plan a figure of missus Paulet who first introduced Stilton to England Possibly a group showing missus Paulet holding a young Stilton by the hand and introducing it while the Stilton curtsies T S Eliot does not think that anyone would look at a monument but wants to establish a Foundation for the Preservation of Ancient Cheeses The practicability of this plan would depend largely on the site selected for the treasure house and the cost of obtaining a curator who could or would give his whole time to the work mister J A Symonds who is secretary of the committee agrees with mister Eliot that a simple statue is not the best form I should like he says something irrelevant gargoyles perhaps I think that mister Symonds has hit on something there I would suggest if we Americans can pitch into this great movement some gargoyles designed by mister Rube Goldberg If the memorial could be devised so as to take on an international scope an exchange fellowship might be established between England and America although the exchange in the case of Stilton would have to be all on England s side We might be allowed to furnish the money however while England furnishes the cheese There is a very good precedent for such a bargain between the two countries Robert Benchley in After nineteen oh three What When all seems lost in England there is still Stilton an endless after dinner conversation piece to which England points with pride For a sound appreciation of this cheese see Clifton Fadiman s introduction to this book Taleggio and Bel Paese When the great Italian cheese maker Galbini first exported Bel Paese some years ago it was an eloquent ambassador to America But as the years went on and imitations were made in many lands Galbini deemed it wise to set up his own factory in our beautiful country However the domestic Bel Paese and a minute one pounder called Bel Paesino just didn t have that old Alpine zest They were no better than the German copy called Schoenland after the original or the French Fleur des Alpes Mel Fino was a blend of Bel Paese and Gorgonzola It perked up the market for a full fruity cheese with snap Then Galbini hit the jackpot with his Taleggio that fills the need for the sharpest most sophisticated pungence of them all Trappist Port Salut or Port du Salut and Oka In spite of its name Trappist is no rat trap commoner Always of the elect and better known as Port Salut or Port du Salut from the original home of the Trappist monks in their chief French abbey it is also set apart from the ordinary Canadians under the name of Oka from the Trappist monastery there It is made by Trappist monks all over the world according to the original secret formula and by Trappist Cistercian monks at the Abbey of Gethsemani Trappist in Kentucky This is a soft cheese creamy and of superb flavor You can t go wrong if you look for the monastery name stamped on such as Harze in Belgium Mont des Cats in Flanders Sainte Anne d Auray in Brittany and so forth Last but not least a commercial Port Salut entirely without benefit of clergy or monastery is made in Milwaukee under the Lion Brand It is one of the finest American cheeses in which we have ever sunk a fang Illustration

4156-12351-0001	train-other-500	but a live cow to continue the supply Proof of our ability to manufacture Cheddar of our own lies in the fact that by seventeen ninety we were exporting it back to England
4156-12351-0002	train-other-500	It was called Cheddar after the English original named for the village of Cheddar near Bristol More than a century ago it made a new name for itself Herkimer County cheese

none	none	 An account of New York s cheese business in the pioneer Wooden Nutmeg Era is found in Ernest Elmo Calkins interesting book They Broke the Prairies A Yankee named Silvanus Ferris the most successful dairyman of Herkimer County in the first decades of the eighteen hundred s teamed up with Robert Nesbit the old Quaker Cheese Buyer They bought from farmers in the region and sold in New York City 
4156-12351-0007	train-other-500	And according to the business ethics of the times Nesbit went ahead to cheapen the cheese offered by deprecating its quality hinting at a bad market and departing without buying Later when Ferris arrived in a more optimistic mood offering a slightly better price
4156-12351-0008	train-other-500	the seller unaware they were partners and ignorant of the market price snapped up the offer Similar sharp trade tactics put too much green cheese on the market so those honestly aged from a minimum of eight months up to two years fetched higher prices
4156-12351-0009	train-other-500	They were called old such as Old Herkimer Old Wisconsin Longhorn and Old California Jack Although the established Cheddar ages are three fresh medium cured and cured or aged
4156-12351-0010	train-other-500	commercially they are divided into two and described as mild and sharp The most popular are named for their states Colorado Illinois Kentucky New York Ohio Vermont and Wisconsin

4156-12351-0014	train-other-500	Its texture is elastic but not rubbery its taste sweetish and it is full of little round holes or eyes All this has inspired enthusiasts to liken it to Emmentaler

4156-12351-0017	train-other-500	It is this double use of bricks for shaping and for pressing that has led to the confusion about which came first in originating the name The formed bricks of cheese are rubbed with salt for three days and they ripen slowly taking up to two months

4156-12351-0019	train-other-500	It is called Blackie from the black waxed rind and it resembles Vermont State cheese although it is flatter This is a proud new American product proving that although Papa Cheddar was born in England his American kinfolk have developed independent and valuable characters all on their own
4156-12351-0020	train-other-500	Coon Cheese Coon cheese is full of flavor from being aged on shelves at a higher temperature than cold storage Its rind is darker from the growth of mold and this shade is sometimes painted on more ordinary Cheddars to make them look like Coon

none	none	 Jack was first known as Monterey cheese from the California county where it originated 
4156-12351-0028	train-other-500	Then it was called Jack for short and only now takes its full name after sixty years of popularity on the West Coast Because it is little known in the East and has to be shipped so far it commands the top Cheddar price
4156-12351-0029	train-other-500	Monterey Jack is a stirred curd Cheddar without any annatto coloring It is sweeter than most and milder when young but it gets sharper with age and more expensive because of storage costs Liederkranz

4156-12351-0039	train-other-500	Mash the soft creams together with the Roquefort butter and flour using a silver fork Put the mix into an enameled pan for anything with a metal surface will turn the cheese black in cooking Stir in the cream and keep stirring until you have a smooth
4156-12351-0040	train-other-500	creamy sauce Strain through sieve or cheesecloth and mix in the olives and pimiento thoroughly Sprinkle well with cayenne and put into a pot to mellow for a few days or much longer The name Schnitzelbank comes from school bench a game

4156-12351-0042	train-other-500	Like the trinity of cheeses that make it the mixture is eaten best at room temperature when its flavor is fullest If kept in the refrigerator it should be taken out a couple of hours before serving Since it is a natural cheese mixture which has gone through no process or doping with preservative
4156-12351-0043	train-other-500	it will not keep more than two weeks This mellow sharp mix is the sort of ideal the factory processors shoot at with their olive pimiento abominations Once you ve potted your own you ll find it gives the same thrill as garnishing your own Liptauer
4156-12351-0044	train-other-500	Minnesota Blue The discovery of sandstone caves in the bluffs along the Mississippi in and near the Twin Cities of Minnesota has established a distinctive type of Blue cheese named for the state
4156-12351-0045	train-other-500	Although the Roquefort process of France is followed and the cheese is inoculated in the same way by mold from bread it can never equal the genuine imported marked with its red sheep brand
4156-12351-0046	train-other-500	because the milk used in Minnesota Blue is cow s milk and the caves are sandstone instead of limestone Yet this is an excellent Blue cheese in its own right
none	none	 Pineapple Pineapple cheese is named after its shape rather than its flavor although there are rumors that some pineapple flavor is noticeable near the oiled rind This flavor does not penetrate through to the Cheddar center Many makers of processed cheese have tampered with the original so today you can t be sure of anything except getting a smaller size every year or two at a higher price Originally six pounds the Pineapple has shrunk to nearly six ounces The proper bright orange oiled and shellacked surface is more apt to be a sickly lemon Always an ornamental cheese it once stood in state on the side board under a silver bell also made to represent a pineapple You cut a top slice off the cheese just as you would off the fruit and there was a rose colored fine tasting mellow hard cheese to spoon out with a special silver cheese spoon or scoop Between meals the silver top was put on the silver holder and the oiled and shellacked rind kept the cheese moist Even when the Pineapple was eaten down to the rind the shell served as a dunking bowl to fill with some salubrious cold Fondue or salad Made in the same manner as Cheddar with the curd cooked harder Pineapple s distinction lies in being hung in a net that makes diamond shaped corrugations on the surface simulating the sections of the fruit It is a pioneer American product with almost a century and a half of service since Lewis M Norton conceived it in eighteen oh eight in Litchfield County Connecticut There in eighteen forty five he built a factory and made a deserved fortune out of his decorative ingenuity with what before had been plain unromantic yellow or store cheese Perhaps his inspiration came from cone shaped Cheshire in old England also called Pineapple cheese combined with the hanging up of Provolones in Italy that leaves the looser pattern of the four sustaining strings Sage Vermont Sage and Vermont State The story of Sage cheese or green cheese as it was called originally shows the several phases most cheeses have gone through from their simple honest beginnings to commercialization and sometimes back to the real thing The English Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery has an early Sage recipe This is a species of cream cheese made by adding sage leaves and greening to the milk A very good receipt for it is given thus Bruise the tops of fresh young red sage leaves with an equal quantity of spinach leaves and squeeze out the juice Add this to the extract of rennet and stir into the milk as much as your taste may deem sufficient Break the curd when it comes salt it fill the vat high with it press for a few hours and then turn the cheese every day Fancy Cheese in America lay Charles A Publow records the commercialization of the cheese mentioned above a century or two later in nineteen ten Sage cheese is another modified form of the Cheddar variety Its distinguishing features are a mottled green color and a sage flavor The usual method of manufacture is as follows One third of the total amount of milk is placed in a vat by itself and colored green by the addition of eight to twelve ounces of commercial sage color to each one thousand pounds of milk If green corn leaves unavailable in England or other substances are used for coloring the amounts will vary accordingly The milk is then made up by the regular Cheddar method as is also the remaining two thirds in a separate vat At the time of removing the whey the green and white curds are mixed Some prefer however to mix the curds at the time of milling as a more distinct color is secured After milling the sage extract flavoring is sprayed over the curd with an atomizer The curd is then salted and pressed into the regular Cheddar shapes and sizes A very satisfactory Sage cheese is made at the New York State College of Agriculture by simply dropping green coloring made from the leaves of corn and spinach upon the curd after milling An even green mottling is thus easily secured without additional labor Sage flavoring extract is sprayed over the curd by an atomizer One half ounce of flavoring is usually sufficient for a hundred pounds of curd and can be secured from dairy supply houses A modern cheese authority reported on the current nineteen fifty three method Instead of sage leaves or tea prepared from them at present the cheese is flavored with oil of Dalmatian wild sage because it has the sharpest flavor This piny oil thujone is diluted with water two hundred fifty parts to one and either added to the milk or sprayed over the curds one eighth ounce for five hundred quarts of milk In scouting around for a possible maker of the real thing today we wrote to Vrest Orton of Vermont and got this reply Sage cheese is one of the really indigenous and best native Vermont products So far as I know there is only one factory making it and that is my friend George Crowley s He makes a limited amount for my Vermont Country Store It is the fine old time full cream cheese flavored with real sage On this hangs a tale Some years ago I couldn t get enough sage cheese we never can so I asked a Wisconsin cheesemaker if he would make some Said he would but couldn t at that time because the alfalfa wasn t ripe I said What in hell has alfalfa got to do with sage cheese He said Well we flavor the sage cheese with a synthetic sage flavor and then throw in some pieces of chopped up alfalfa to make it look green So I said to hell with that and the next time I saw George Crowley I told him the story and George said We don t use synthetic flavor alfalfa or anything like that Then what do you use George I inquired We use real sage Why Well because it s cheaper than that synthetic stuff The genuine Vermont Sage arrived Here are our notes on it Oh wilderness were Paradise enow My taste buds come to full flower with the Sage There s a slight burned savor recalling smoked cheese although not related in any way Mildly resinous like that Near East one packed in pine suggesting the well saged dressing of a turkey A round mouthful of luscious mellowness with a bouquet a snapping reminder to the nose And there s just a soupcon of new mown hay above the green freckles of herb to delight the eye and set the fancy free So this is the veritable vert green cheese the moon is made of it Vert veritable A general favorite with everybody who ever tasted it for generations of lusty crumblers Old Fashioned Vermont State Store Cheese We received from savant Vrest Orton another letter together with some Vermont store cheese and some crackers This cheese is our regular old fashioned store cheese it s been in old country stores for generations and we have been pioneers in spreading the word about it It is of course a natural aged cheese no processing no fussing no fooling with it It s made the same way it was back in eighteen seventy by the old time Colby method which makes a cheese which is not so dry as Cheddar and also has holes in it something like Swiss Also it ages faster Did you know that during the last part of the nineteenth century and part of the twentieth Vermont was the leading cheesemaking state in the Union When I was a lad every town in Vermont had one or more cheese factories Now there are only two left not counting any that make process Process isn t cheese The crackers are the old time store cracker every Vermonter used to buy a big barrel once a year to set in the buttery and eat A classic dish is crackers broken up in a bowl of cold milk with a hunk of Vermont cheese like this on the side Grand snack grand midnight supper grand anything These crackers are not sweet not salt and as such make a good base for anything swell with clam chowder also with toasted cheese Tillamook It takes two pocket sized but thick yellow volumes to record the story of Oregon s great Tillamook The Cheddar Box by Dean Collins comes neatly boxed and bound in golden cloth stamped with a purple title like the rind of a real Tillamook Volume I is entitled Cheese Cheddar and Volume II is a two pound Cheddar cheese labeled Tillamook and molded to fit inside its book jacket We borrowed Volume I from a noted litterateur and never could get him to come across with Volume II We guessed its fate however from a note on the flyleaf of the only tome available This is an excellent cheese full cream and medium sharp and a unique set of books in which Volume II suggests Bacon s Some books are to be tasted others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested Wisconsin Longhorn Since we began this chapter with all American Cheddars it is only fitting to end with Wisconsin Longhorn a sort of national standard even though it s not nearly so fancy or high priced as some of the regional natives that can t approach its enormous output It s one of those all purpose round cheeses that even taste round in your mouth We are specially partial to it Most Cheddars are named after their states Yet putting all of these thirty seven states together they produce only about half as much as Wisconsin alone Besides Longhorn in Wisconsin there are a dozen regional competitors ranging from White Twin Cheddar to which no annatto coloring has been added through Green Bay cheese to Wisconsin Redskin and Martha Washington Aged proudly set forth by P H Kasper of Bear Creek who is said to have won more prizes in forty years than any ten cheesemakers put together To help guarantee a market for all this excellent apple pie cheese the Wisconsin State Legislature made a law about it recognizing the truth of Eugene Field s jingle Apple pie without cheese Is like a kiss without a squeeze Small matter in the Badger State when the affinity is made legal and the couple lawfully wedded in Statute No one hundred sixty thousand sixty five It s still in force Butter and cheese to be served Every person firm or corporation duly licensed to operate a hotel or restaurant shall serve with each meal for which a charge of twenty five cents or more is made at least two thirds of an ounce of Wisconsin butter and two thirds of an ounce of Wisconsin cheese Besides Longhorn Wisconsin leads in Limburger It produces so much Swiss that the state is sometimes called Swissconsin Illustration Chapter Five Sixty five Sizzling Rabbits That nice little smoky room at the Salutation which is even now continually presenting itself to my recollection with all its associated train of pipes egg hot welsh rabbits metaphysics and poetry Charles Lamb IN A LETTER TO COLERIDGE Unlike the beginning of the classical Jugged Hare recipe First catch your hare we modern Rabbit hunters start off with First catch your Cheddar And some of us go so far as to smuggle in formerly forbidden fromages such as Gruyere Neufchatel Parmesan and mixtures thereof We run the gamut of personal preferences in selecting the Rabbit cheese itself from old time American yellow or store cheese to Coon and Canadian smoked though all of it is still Cheddar no matter how you slice it Then too guests are made to run the gauntlet of all American trimmings from pin money pickles to peanut butter succotash and maybe marshmallows we add mustard chill curry tabasco and sundry bottled red devils from the grocery store to add pep and piquance to the traditional cayenne and black pepper This results in Rabbits that are out of focus out of order and out of this world Among modern sins of omission the Worcestershire sauce is left out by braggarts who aver that they can take it or leave it And in these degenerate days when it comes to substitutions for the original beer or stale pale ale we find the gratings of great Cheddars wet down with mere California sherry or even ginger ale yet so far thank goodness no Cokes And there s tomato juice out of a can into the Rum Turn Tiddy and sometimes celery soup in place of milk or cream In view of all this we can only look to the standard cookbooks for salvation These are mostly compiled by women our thoughtful mothers wives and sweethearts who have saved the twin Basic Rabbits for us If it weren t for these Fanny Farmers the making of a real aboriginal Welsh Rabbit would be a lost art lost in sporting male attempts to improve upon the original The girls are still polite about the whole thing and protectively pervert the original spelling of Rabbit to Rarebit in their culinary guides We have heard that once a club of ladies in high society tried to high pressure the publishers of mister Webster s dictionary to change the old spelling in their favor Yet there is a lot to be said for this more genteel and appetizing rendering of the word for the Welsh masterpiece is after all a very rare bit of cheesemongery male or female Yet in dealing with Rarebits the distaff side seldom sets down more than the basic Adam and Eve in a whole Paradise of Rabbits No one the wild male type made with beer and No two the mild female made with milk Yet now that the chafing dish has come back to stay there s a flurry in the Rabbit warren and the new cooking encyclopedias give up to a dozen variants Actually there are easily half a gross of valid ones in current esteem The two basic recipes are differentiated by the liquid ingredient but both the beer and the milk are used only one way warm or anyway at room temperature And again for the two there is but one traditional cheese Cheddar ripe old or merely aged from six months onward This is also called American store sharp Rabbit yellow beer Wisconsin Longhorn mouse and even rat The seasoned sapid Cheddar type so indispensable includes dozens of varieties under different names regional or commercial These are easily identified as sisters under the rinds by all five senses sight Golden yellow and mellow to the eye It s one of those round cheeses that also tastes round in the mouth hearing By thumping a cheese fancier like a melon picker can tell if a Cheddar is rich ripe and ready for the Rabbit When you hear your dealer say It s six months old or more enough said smell A scent as fresh as that of the daisies and herbs the mother milk cow munched will hang round it still Also a slight beery savor touch Crumbly a caress to the fingers taste The quintessence of this fivefold test Just cuddle a crumb with your tongue and if it tickles the taste buds it s prime When it melts in your mouth that s proof it will melt in the pan Beyond all this and in spite of the school that plumps for the No two temperance alternative we must point out that beer has a special affinity for Cheddar The French have clearly established this in their names for Welsh Rabbit Fromage Fondue a la Biere and Fondue a l Anglaise To prepare such a cheese for the pan each Rabbit hound may have a preference all his own for here the question comes up of how it melts best Do you shave slice dice shred mince chop cut scrape or crumble it in the fingers This will vary according to one s temperament and the condition of the cheese Generally for best results it is coarsely grated When it comes to making all this into a rare bit of Rabbit there is The One and Only Method Use a double boiler or preferably a chafing dish avoiding aluminum and other soft metals Heat the upper pan by simmering water in the lower one but don t let the water boil up or touch the top pan Most but not all Rabbits are begun by heating a bit of butter or margarine in the pan in which one cup of roughly grated cheese usually sharp Cheddar is melted and mixed with one half cup of liquid added gradually The butter isn t necessary for a cheese that should melt by itself The two principal ingredients are melted smoothly together and kept from curdling by stirring steadily in one direction only over an even heat The spoon used should be of hard wood sterling silver or porcelain Never use tin aluminum or soft metal the taste may come off to taint the job Be sure the liquid is at room temperature or warmer and add it gradually without interrupting the stirring Do not let it come to the bubbling point and never let it boil Add seasonings only when the cheese is melted which will take two or three minutes Then continue to stir in the same direction without an instant s letup for maybe ten minutes or more until the Rabbit is smooth The consistency and velvety smoothness depend a good deal on whether or not an egg or a beaten yolk is added The hotter the Rabbit is served the better You can sizzle the top with a salamander or other branding iron but in any case set it forth as nearly sizzling as possible on toast hellishly hot whether it s browned or buttered on one side or both Give a thought to the sad case of the little dog whose name was Rover and when he was dead he was dead all over Something very similar happens with a Rabbit that s allowed to cool down when it s cold it s cold all over and you can t resuscitate it by heating BASIC WELSH RABBIT No one with beer two tablespoons butter three cups grated old Cheddar one two teaspoon English dry mustard one two teaspoon salt A dash of cayenne one teaspoon Worcestershire sauce two egg yolks lightly beaten with one two cup light beer or ale four slices hot buttered toast Over boiling water melt butter and cheese together stirring steadily with a wooden or other tasteless spoon in one direction only Add seasonings and do not interrupt your rhythmic stirring as you pour in a bit at a time of the beer and egg mixture until it s all used up It may take many minutes of constant stirring to achieve the essential creamy thickness and then some more to slick it out as smooth as velvet Keep it piping hot but don t let it bubble for a boiled Rabbit is a spoiled Rabbit Only unremitting stirring and the best of cheese will keep it from curdling getting stringy or rubbery Pour the Rabbit generously over crisp freshly buttered toast and serve instantly on hot plates Usually crusts are cut off the bread before toasting and some aesthetes toast one side only spreading the toasted side with cold butter for taste contrast Lay the toast on the hot plate buttered side down and pour the Rabbit over the porous untoasted side so it can soak in This is recommended in Lady Llanover s recipe which appears on page fifty two of this book Although the original bread for Rabbit toast was white there is now no limit in choice among whole wheat graham rolls muffins buns croutons and crackers to infinity No two with milk For a rich milk Rabbit use one two cup thin cream evaporated milk whole milk or buttermilk instead of beer as in No one Then to keep everything bland cut down the mustard by half or leave it out and use paprika in place of cayenne As in No one the use of Worcestershire sauce is optional although our feeling is that any spirited Rabbit would resent its being left out Either of these basic recipes can be made without eggs and more cheaply although the beaten egg is a guarantee against stringiness When the egg is missing we are sad to record that a teaspoon or so of cornstarch generally takes its place Rabbiteers are of two minds about fast and slow heating and stirring so you ll have to adjust that to your own experience and rhythm As a rule the heat is reduced when the cheese is almost melted and speed of stirring slows when the eggs and last ingredients go in Many moderns who have found that monosodium glutamate steps up the flavor of natural cheese put it in at the start using one half teaspoon for each cup of grated Cheddar When it comes to pepper you are fancy free As both black and white pepper are now held in almost equal esteem you might equip your hutch with twin hand mills to do the grinding fresh for this is always worth the trouble Tabasco sauce is little used and needs a cautious hand but some addicts can t leave it out any more than they can swear off the Worcestershire The school that plumps for malty Rabbits and the other that goes for milky ones are equally emphatic in their choice So let us consider the compromise of our old friend Frederick Philip Stieff the Baltimore homme de bouche as he set it forth for us years ago in ten thousand Snacks The idea of cooking a Rabbit with beer is an exploded and dangerous theory Tap your keg or open your case of ale or beer and serve with not in your Rabbit The Stieff Recipe BASIC MILK RABBIT completely surrounded by a lake of malt beverages two cups grated sharp cheese three heaping tablespoons butter one one two cups milk four eggs one heaping tablespoon mustard two teaspoons Worcestershire sauce Pepper salt and paprika to taste then add more of each Grease well with butter the interior of your double boiler so that no hard particles of cheese will form in the mixture later and contribute undesirable lumps Put cheese well grated into the double boiler and add butter and milk From this point vigorous stirring should be indulged in until Rabbit is ready for serving Prepare a mixture of Worcestershire sauce mustard pepper salt and paprika These should be beaten until light and then slowly poured into the double boiler Nothing now remains to be done except to stir and cook down to proper consistency over a fairly slow flame The finale has not arrived until you can drip the rabbit from the spoon and spell the word finis on the surface Pour over two pieces of toast per plate and send anyone home who does not attack it at once This is sufficient for six gourmets or four gourmands Nota bene A Welsh Rabbit to be a success should never be of the consistency whereby it may be used to tie up bundles nor yet should it bounce if inadvertently dropped on the kitchen floor Lady Llanover s Toasted Welsh Rabbit Cut a slice of the real Welsh cheese made of sheep s and cow s milk toast it at the fire on both sides but not so much as to drop melt Toast on one side a piece of bread less than one four inch thick to be quite crisp and spread it very thinly with fresh cold butter on the toasted side It must not be saturated Lay the toasted cheese upon the untoasted bread side and serve immediately on a very hot plate The butter on the toast can of course be omitted It is more frequently eaten without butter From this original toasting of the cheese many Englishmen still call Welsh Rabbit Toasted Cheese but Lady Llanover goes on to point out that the Toasted Rabbit of her Wales and the Melted or Stewed Buck Rabbit of England which has become our American standard are as different in the making as the regional cheeses used in them and she says that while doctors prescribed the toasted Welsh as salubrious for invalids the stewed cheese of Olde England was only adapted to strong digestions English literature rings with praise for the toasted cheese of Wales and England There is Christopher North s eloquent threads of unbeaten gold shining like gossamer filaments that may be pulled from its tough and tenacious substance Yet not all of the references are complimentary Thus Shakespeare in King Lear Look look a mouse Peace peace this piece of toasted cheese will do it And Sydney Smith s Old friendships are destroyed by toasted cheese and hard salted meat has led to suicide But Khys Davis in My Wales makes up for such rudenesses The Welsh Enter Heaven The Lord had been complaining to saint Peter of the dearth of good singers in Heaven Yet He said testily I hear excellent singing outside the walls Why are not those singers here with me saint Peter said They are the Welsh They refuse to come in they say they are happy enough outside playing with a ball and boxing and singing such songs as Suspan Fach The Lord said I wish them to come in here to sing Bach and Mendelssohn See that they are in before sundown saint Peter went to the Welsh and gave them the commands of the Lord But still they shook their heads Harassed saint Peter went to consult with saint David who with a smile was reading the works of Caradoc Evans saint David said Try toasted cheese Build a fire just inside the gates and get a few angels to toast cheese in front of it This saint Peter did The heavenly aroma of the sizzling browning cheese was wafted over the walls and with loud shouts a great concourse of the Welsh came sprinting in When sufficient were inside to make up a male voice choir of a hundred saint Peter slammed the gates However it is said that these are the only Welsh in Heaven And lest we forget the wonderful drink that made Alice grow and grow to the ceiling of Wonderland contained not only strawberry jam but toasted cheese Then there s the frightening nursery rhyme The Irishman loved usquebaugh The Scot loved ale called Bluecap The Welshman he loved toasted cheese And made his mouth like a mousetrap The Irishman was drowned in usquebaugh The Scot was drowned in ale The Welshman he near swallowed a mouse But he pulled it out by the tail And perhaps worst of all Shakespeare no cheese lover this tune in Merry Wives of Windsor Tis time I were choked by a bit of toasted cheese An elaboration of the simple Welsh original went English with doctor William Maginn the London journalist whose facile pen enlivened the Blackwoods Magazine era with Ten Tales Illustration doctor Maginn s Rabbit Much is to be said in favor of toasted cheese for supper It is the cant to say that Welsh rabbit is heavy eating I like it best in the genuine Welsh way however that is the toasted bread buttered on both sides profusely then a layer of cold roast beef with mustard and horseradish and then on the top of all the superstratum of Cheshire thoroughly saturated while in the process of toasting with genuine porter black pepper and shallot vinegar I peril myself upon the assertion that this is not a heavy supper for a man who has been busy all day till dinner in reading writing walking or riding who has occupied himself between dinner and supper in the discussion of a bottle or two of sound wine or any equivalent and who proposes to swallow at least three tumblers of something hot ere he resigns himself to the embrace of Somnus With these provisos I recommend toasted cheese for supper The popularity of this has come down to us in the succinct summing up Toasted cheese hath no master The Welsh original became simple after doctor Maginn s supper sandwich was served a century and a half ago for it was served as a savory to sum up and help digest a dinner in this form After Dinner Rabbit Remove all crusts from bread slices toast on both sides and soak to saturation in hot beer Melt thin slices of sharp old cheese in butter in an iron skillet with an added spot of beer and dry English mustard Stir steadily with a wooden spoon and when velvety serve a sizzle on piping hot beer soaked toast While toasted cheese undoubtedly was the Number One dairy dish of Anglo Saxons stewed cheese came along to rival it in Elizabethan London This sophisticated big city dish also called a Buck Rabbit was the making of Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese on Fleet Street where doctor Johnson later presided And it must have been the pick of the town back in the days when barrooms still had sawdust on the floor for the learned Doctor endorsed old Omar Khayyam s love of the pub with There is nothing which has been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern Yet he was no gourmet as may be judged by his likening of a succulent golden fried oyster to a baby s ear dropped in sawdust Perhaps it is just as well that no description of the world s first Golden Buck has come down from him But we don t have to look far for on the spot pen pictures by other men of letters at The Cheese as it was affectionately called To a man they sang praises for that piping hot dish of preserved and beatified milk Inspired by stewed cheese Mark Lemon the leading rhymester of Punch wrote the following poem and dedicated it to the memory of Lovelace Champagne will not a dinner make Nor caviar a meal Men gluttonous and rich may take Those till they make them ill If I ve potatoes to my chop And after chop have cheese Angels in Pond and Spiers s shop Know no such luxuries All that s necessary is an old time cheese stewer or a reasonable substitute The base of this is what was once quaintly called a hot water bath This was a sort of miniature wash boiler just big enough to fit in snugly half a dozen individual tins made squarish and standing high enough above the bath water to keep any of it from getting into the stew In these tins the cheese is melted But since such a tinsmith s contraption is hard to come by in these days of fireproof cooking glass we suggest muffin tins ramekins or even small cups to crowd into the bottom of your double boiler or chafing dish But beyond this we plump for a revival of the cheese stewer in stainless steel silver or glass In the ritual at The Cheese these dishes brimming over bubbling and blistering with the stew followed a pudding that s still famous Although down the centuries the recipe has been kept secret the identifiable ingredients have been itemized as follows Tender steak savory oyster seductive kidney fascinating lark rich gravy ardent pepper and delicate paste not to mention mushrooms And after the second or third helping of pudding with a pint of stout bitter or the mildest and mellowest brown October Ale in a dented pewter pot the stewed Cheshire cheese Cheese was the one and only other course prescribed by tradition and appetite from the time when Charles II aled and regaled Nell Gwyn at The Cheese where Shakespeare is said to have sampled this kind of a glorified Welsh Rarebit served piping hot in the square shallow tins in which it is cooked and garnished with sippets of delicately colored toast Among early records is this report of Addison s in The Spectator of September two hundred fifty one thousand seven hundred eleven They yawn for a Cheshire cheese and begin about midnight when the whole company is disposed to be drowsy He that yawns widest and at the same time so naturally as to produce the most yawns amongst his spectators carries home the cheese Only a short time later in seventeen twenty five the proprietor of Simpson s in the Strand inaugurated a daily guessing contest that drew crowds to his fashionable eating and drinking place He would set forth a huge portion of cheese and wager champagne and cigars for the house that no one present could correctly estimate the weight height and girth of it As late as seventeen ninety five when Boswell was accompanying doctor Johnson to The Cheese records of saint Dunstan s Club which also met there showed that the current price of a Buck Rabbit was tuppence and that this was also the amount of the usual tip Ye Original Recipe one one two ounces butter one cup cream one one two cups grated Cheshire cheese more pungent snappier richer and more brightly colored than its first cousin Cheddar Heat butter and cream together then stir in the cheese and let it stew You dunk fingers of toast directly into your individual tin or pour the Stewed Rabbit over toast and brown the top under a blistering salamander The salamander is worth modernizing too so you can brand your own Rabbits with your monogram or the design of your own Rabbitry Such a branding iron might be square like the stew tin and about the size of a piece of toast It is notable that there is no beer or ale in this recipe but not lamentable since all aboriginal cheese toasts were washed down in tossing seas of ale beer porter stout and arf and arf This creamy Stewed Buck on which the literary greats of Johnson s time supped while they smoked their church wardens received its highest praise from an American newspaper woman who rhapsodized in eighteen ninety one Then came stewed cheese on the thin shaving of crisp golden toast in hot silver saucers so hot that the cheese was the substance of thick cream the flavor of purple pansies and red raspberries commingled This may seem a bit flowery but in truth many fine cheeses hold a trace of the bouquet of the flowers that have enriched the milk Alpine blooms and herbs haunt the Gruyere Parmesan wafts the scent of Parma violets the Flower Cheese of England is perfumed with the petals of rose violet marigold and jasmine Oven Rabbit FROM AN OLD RECIPE Chop small one two pound of cooking cheese Put it with a piece of butter the size of a walnut in a little saucepan and as the butter melts and the cheese gets warm mash them together When softened add two yolks of eggs one two teacupful of ale a little cayenne pepper and salt Stir with a wooden spoon one way only until it is creamy but do not let it boil for that would spoil it Place some slices of buttered toast on a dish pour the Rarebit upon them and set inside the oven about two minutes before serving Yorkshire Rabbit originally called Gherkin Buck from a pioneer recipe Put into a saucepan one two pound of cheese sprinkle with pepper black of course to taste pour over one two teacup of ale and convert the whole into a smooth creamy mass over the fire stirring continually for about ten minutes In two more minutes it should be done ten minutes altogether is the minimum Pour it over slices of hot toast place a piece of broiled bacon on the top of each and serve as hot as possible Golden Buck A Golden Buck is simply the Basic Welsh Rabbit with beer No one plus a poached egg on top The egg sunny side up gave it its shining name a couple of centuries ago Nowadays some chafing dish show offs try to gild the Golden Buck with dashes of ginger and spice Golden Buck II This is only a Golden Buck with the addition of bacon strips The Venerable Yorkshire Buck Spread one two inch slices of bread with mustard and brown in hot oven Then moisten each slice with one two glass of ale lay on top a slice of cheese one four inch thick and two slices of bacon on top of that Put back in oven cook till cheese is melted and the bacon crisp and serve piping hot with tankards of cold ale Bacon is the thing that identifies any Yorkshire Rabbit Yale College Welsh Rabbit MORIARTY S one jigger of beer one

the cheese and stir unremittingly moistening from time to time with more beer a pony or two at a time When creamy pour over buttered toast two slices for this amount and serve with still more beer There are two schools of postgraduate Rabbit hunters Yale as above with beer both in the Rabbit and with it and the other featured in the Stieff Recipe which prefers leaving it out of the Rabbit but taps a keg to drink with it The ancient age of Moriarty s campus classic is registered by the use of pioneer black pepper in place of white which is often used today and is thought more sophisticated by some than the red cayenne of Rector s Naughty Nineties Chafing Dish Rabbit which is precisely the same as our Basic Recipe No one Border hopping Bunny or Frijole Rabbit one one two tablespoons butter one one two tablespoons chopped onion two tablespoons chopped pepper green or red or both one one two teaspoon chili powder one small can kidney beans drained one one two tablespoons catsup one

Bunny peppery hot on tortillas or crackers toasted and buttered In the whole hutch of kitchen Rabbitry the most popular modern ones are made with tomato a little or lots They hop in from everywhere from Mexico to South Africa and call for all kinds of quirks down to mixing in some dried beef and there is even a skimpy Tomato Rabbit for reducers made with farmer cheese and skimmed milk Although the quaintly named Rum Tum Tiddy was doubtless the great grandpappy of all Tomato Rabbits a richer more buttery and more eggy one has taken its place as the standard today The following is a typical recipe for this tried and true since it has had a successful run through a score of the best modern cookbooks with only slight personal changes to keep its juice a flowing blood red Tomato Rabbit two tablespoons butter two tablespoons flour three four cup thin cream or evaporated milk three four cup canned tomato pulp rubbed through a sieve to remove seeds A pinch of soda three cups grated cheese Pinches of dry mustard salt and cayenne two eggs lightly beaten Blend flour in melted butter add cream slowly and when this white sauce is a little thick stir in tomato sprinkled with soda Keep stirring steadily while adding cheese and seasonings and when cooked enough stir in the eggs to make a creamy texture smooth as silk Serve on buttered whole wheat or graham bread for a change Instead of soda some antiquated recipes call for a tablespoon of bicarbonate of potash South African Tomato Rabbit This is the same as above except that one two teaspoon of sugar is used in place of the soda and the Rabbit is poured over baked pastry cut into squares and sprinkled with parsley chopped fine put in the oven and served immediately Rum Tum Tiddy Rink Tum Ditty et cetera OLD BOSTON STYLE one

and the paprika cooked in from the start of course Blushing Bunny is one of those playful English names for dishes like Pink Poodle Scotch Woodcock given below Bubble and Squeak Bubblum Squeakum and Toad in the Hole Scotch Woodcock Another variant of Rum Tum Tiddy Make your Rum Tum Tiddy but before finishing up with the beaten egg stir in two heaping tablespoons of anchovy paste and prepare the

Heat the tomato and stir in the cheese When partly melted stir in the egg and when almost cooked add seasonings without ever interrupting the stirring Pour over hot toasted crackers or bread No doubt

and pepper Make a white sauce of milk butter and flour and stir in cheese steadily and gradually until melted Add corn and season to taste Serve on hot buttered toast Kansas has plenty of the makings for this yet the dish must have been easier to make on Baron Muenchhausen s Island of Cheese where the cornstalks produced loaves of bread ready made instead of ears and were no doubt crossed with long eared jacks to produce Corn Rabbits quite as miraculous After tomatoes in popularity come onions and then green peppers or canned pimientos as vegetable ingredients in modern Americanized Rabbits And after that corn as in the following recipe which appeals to all Latin Americans from Mexico to Chile because it has everything Latin American Corn Rabbit two tablespoons butter one green pepper chopped one large onion chopped one two cup condensed tomato soup three cups grated cheese one teaspoon salt one four teaspoon black pepper one two teaspoon Worcestershire sauce one cup canned corn

Rabbit with horseradish or a dollop of sherry for a change Bouquet of the Sea Rabbit The seafaring Portuguese set the style for this lush bouquet of as many different kinds of cooked fish tuna cod salmon et cetera as can be sardined together in the whirlpool of melted cheese in the chafing dish They also accent it with tidbits of sea food as above Other Fish Rabbit Fresh or Dried Any cooked fresh fish flaked or shredded from the alewife to the whale or cooked dried herring finnan haddie mackerel cod and so on can be stirred in to make a basic Rabbit more tasty Happy combinations are hit upon in mixing leftovers of several kinds by the cupful So the odd old cookbook direction Add a cup of fish takes on new meaning Grilled Sardine Rabbit Make a Basic Rabbit and pour it over sardines skinned boned halved and grilled on buttered toast Similarly cooked fillets of any small fish will make as succulent a grilled Rabbit Roe Rabbits Slice cooked roe of shad or toothsome eggs of other

imported East Indian chutney with the egg yolks and beer at the finish spread toast thickly with anchovy paste and butter and pour the Rabbit over Smoked sturgeon whiting eel smoked salmon and the like Lay cold slices or flakes of any fine smoked fish and all of them are fine on hot buttered toast and pour a Basic Rabbit over the fish The best combination we ever tasted is made by laying a thin slice of smoked salmon over a thick one of smoked sturgeon Smoked Cheddar Rabbit With or without smoked fish Rabbit hunters whose palates crave the savor of a wisp of smoke go for a Basic Rabbit made with smoked Cheddar in place of the usual aged but unsmoked Cheddar We use a two year old that Phil Alpert mister Cheese himself brings down from Canada and has specially smoked in the same savory room where sturgeon is getting the works So his Cheddar absorbs the de luxe flavor of six dollar per pound sturgeon and is sold for a fraction of that And just in case you are fishing around for something extra special serve this smoky Rabbit on oven browned Bombay ducks those crunchy flat toasts of East Indian fish Or go Oriental by accompanying this with cups of smoky Lapsang Soochong China

the soaked crumbs and seasonings When cooked smooth and creamy stir in the egg to thicken the mixture and serve on toasted crackers dry or buttered for contrast with the bread Some Rabbiteers monkey with this lacing it with half a cup of catsup making a sort of pink baboon out of what should be a white monkey There is a cult for Crumby Rabbits variations on which extend all the way to a deep casserole dish called Baked Rabbit and consisting of alternate layers of stale bread crumbs and grated cheese crumbs This illegitimate three layer Rabbit is moistened with eggs beaten up with milk and seasoned with salt and paprika Crumby Tomato Rabbit two teaspoons butter two cups grated cheese one two cup soft bread crumbs one cup tomato soup Salt and pepper one egg lightly beaten Melt cheese in

tablespoons butter two cups grated cheese one two cup milk or beer A dash of vinegar one two teaspoon mustard Salt and pepper one two cup chopped gherkin pickles Melt cheese in butter steadily stir in liquid and seasonings Keep stirring until smooth then add the pickles and serve This may have been called Irish after the green of the pickle Dutch Rabbit Melt thin slices of any good cooking cheese in a heavy skillet with a little butter prepared mustard and a splash of beer Have ready some slices of toast soaked in hot beer or ale and pour the Rabbit over them The temperance version of this substitutes milk for beer and delicately soaks the toast in hot water instead Proof that there is no Anglo Saxon influence here lies in the use of prepared mustard The English who still do a lot of things the hard way mix their biting dry mustard fresh with water before every meal while the Germans and French bottle theirs as we do Pumpernickel Rabbit This German deviation is made exactly the same as the Dutch Rabbit above but its ingredients are the opposite in color Black bread pumpernickel slices are soaked in heated dark beer porter or stout and the yellow cheese melted in the skillet is also stirred up with brunette beer Since beer is a kind of liquid bread it is natural for the two to commingle in Rabbits whether they are blond Dutch or black pumpernickel And since cheese is only solid milk and the Cheddar is noted for its beery smell there is further affinity here An old English proverb sums it up neatly Bread and cheese are the two targets against death By the way the word pumpernickel is said to have been coined when Napoleon tasted his first black bread in Germany Contemptuously he spat it out with This would be good for my horse Nicole Bon pour Nicole in French Gruyere Welsh Rabbit au gratin Cut crusts from a half dozen slices of bread Toast them lightly lay in a roasting pan and top each with a matching slice of imported Gruyere three eight inch thick Pepper to taste and cover with bread crumbs Put in oven ten minutes and rush to the ultimate consumer To our American ears anything au gratin suggests with cheese so this Rabbit au gratin may sound redundant To a Frenchman however it means a dish covered with bread crumbs Swiss Cheese Rabbit one two cup white wine preferably Neufchatel one two cup grated Gruyere one teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

finish off by thickening with the egg and stirring until smooth and velvety Serve on crisp buttered toast with a dry red wine Although wine Rabbits red or white are as unusual as Swiss ones with Gruyere in place of Cheddar wine is commonly drunk with anything from a Golden Buck to a Blushing Bunny But for most of us a deep draught of beer or ale goes best with an even deeper draught of the mellow scent of a Cheddar golden yellow Savory Eggy Dry Rabbit one eight pound butter two cups grated Gruyere four eggs well beaten Salt Pepper Mustard Melt butter and cheese together with the beaten

Julien to make a Fondue or eggs cooked with cheese This dish a novelty to the Americans became so much the rage that he Julien felt himself obliged by way of thanks to send me to New York the rump of one of those pretty little roebucks that are brought from Canada in winter and which was declared exquisite by the chosen committee whom I convoked for the occasion As the great French gourmet Savarin was born on the Swiss border at Belley in the fertile Province of Bugey where Gertrude Stein later had a summer home he no doubt ate Gruyere three times a day as is the custom in Switzerland and adjacent parts He sets down the recipe just as he got it from its Swiss source the papers of Monsieur Trolliet in the neighboring Canton of Berne Take as many eggs as you wish to use according to the number of your guests Then take a lump of good Gruyere cheese weighing about a third of the eggs and a nut of butter about half the weight of the cheese Since today s eggs in America weigh about one one two ounces apiece if you start the Fondue with eight your lump of good Gruyere would come to one four pound and your butter to one eight pound Break and beat the eggs well in a flat pan then add the butter and the cheese grated or cut in small pieces Place the pan on a good fire and stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture is fairly thick and soft put in a little or no salt according to the age of the cheese and a good deal of pepper for this is one of the special attributes of this ancient dish Let it be placed on the table in a hot dish and if some of the best wines be produced and the bottle passed quite freely a marvelous effect will be beheld This has long been quoted as the proper way to make the national dish of Switzerland Savarin tells of hearing oldsters in his district laugh over the Bishop of Belley eating his Fondue with a spoon instead of the traditional fork in the first decade of the seventeen hundred s He tells too of a Fondue party he threw for a couple of his septuagenarian cousins in Paris about the year eighteen oh one The party was the result of much friendly taunting of the master By Jove Jean you have been bragging for such a long time about your Fondues you have continually made our mouths water It is high time to put a stop to all this We will come and breakfast with you some day and see what sort of thing this dish is Savarin invited them for ten o clock next day started them off with the table laid on a snow white cloth and in each one s place two dozen oysters with a bright golden lemon At each end of the table stood a bottle of sauterne carefully wiped excepting the cork which showed distinctly that it had been in the cellar for a long while After the oysters which were quite fresh came some broiled kidneys a terrine of foie gras a pie with truffles and finally the Fondue The different ingredients had all been assembled in a stewpan which was placed on the table over a chafing dish heated with spirits of wine Then Savarin is quoted I commenced operations on the field of battle and my cousins did not lose a single one of my movements They were loud in the praise of this preparation and asked me to let them have the receipt which I promised them This Fondue breakfast party that gave the nineteenth century such a good start was polished off with fruits in season and sweets a cup of genuine mocha and finally two sorts of liqueurs one a spirit for cleansing and the other an oil for softening This primitive Swiss Cheese Fondue is now prepared more elaborately in what is called Neufchatel Style two one two cups grated imported Swiss one one two tablespoons flour one clove of garlic one cup dry white wine Crusty French flute or hard rolls cut into big mouthfuls handy for dunking one jigger kirsch Salt Pepper Nutmeg The cheese should be shredded or grated coarsely and mixed well with the flour Use a chafing dish for cooking and a small heated casserole for serving Hub the bottom and sides of the blazer well with garlic pour in the wine and heat to bubbling just under boiling Add cheese slowly half a cup at a time and stir steadily in one direction only as in making Welsh Rabbit Use a silver fork Season with very little salt always depending on how salty the cheese is but use plenty of black pepper freshly ground and a touch of nutmeg Then pour in the kirsch stir steadily and invite guests to dunk their forked bread in the dish or in a smaller preheated casserole over a low electric or alcohol burner on the dining table The trick is to keep the bubbling melted cheese in rhythmic motion with the fork both up and down and around and around The dunkers stab the hunks of crusty French bread through the soft part to secure a firm hold in the crust for if your bread comes off in dunking you pay a forfeit often a bottle of wine The dunking is done as rhythmically as the stirring guests taking regular turns at twirling the fork to keep the cheese swirling When this chafing dish cheese custard as it has been called in England is ready for eating each in turn thrusts in his fork sops up a mouthful with the bread for a sponge and gives the Fondue a final stir to keep it always moving in the same direction All the while the heat beneath the dish keeps it gently bubbling Such a Neufchatel party was a favorite of King Edward VII especially when he was stepping out as the Prince of Wales He was as fond of Fondue as most of the great gourmets of his day and preferred it to Welsh Rabbit perhaps because of the wine and kirsch that went into it At such a party a little heated wine is added if the Fondue gets too thick When finally it has cooked down to a crust in the bottom of the dish this is forked out by the host and divided among the guests as a very special dividend Any dry white wine will serve in a pinch and the Switzerland Cheese Association in broadcasting this classical recipe points out that any dry rum slivovitz or brandy including applejack will be a valid substitute for the kirsch To us applejack seems specially suited when we stop to consider our native taste that has married apple pie to cheese since pioneer times In culinary usage fondue means melting to an edible consistency and this of course doesn t refer to cheese alone although we use it chiefly for that In France Fondue is also the common name for a simple dish of eggs scrambled with grated cheese and butter and served very hot on toasted bread or filled into fancy paper cases quickly browned on top and served at once The reason for this is that all baked Fondues fall as easily and as far as Souffles although the latter are more noted for this failing There is a similarity in the soft fluffiness of both although the Fondues are always more moist For there is a stiff stuffed shirt buildup around any Souffle suggesting a dressy dinner while Fondue started as a self service dunking bowl Our modern tendency is to try to make over the original French Fondue on the Welsh Rabbit model to turn it into a sort of French Rabbit Although we know that both Gruyere and Emmentaler are what we call Swiss and that it is impossible in America to duplicate the rich Alpine flavor given by the mountain herbs we are inclined to try all sorts of domestic cheeses and mixtures thereof But it s best to stick to Savarin s lump of Gruyere just as the neighboring French and Italians do It is interesting to note that this Swiss Alpine cooking has become so international that it is credited to Italy in the following description we reprint from When Madame Cooks by an Englishman Eric Weir Fondue a l Italienne This is one of those egg dishes that makes one feel really grateful to hens From its name it originated probably in Italy but it has crossed the Alps I have often met it in France but only once in Italy First of all make a very stiff white sauce with butter flour and milk The sauce should be stiff enough to allow the wooden spoon to stand upright or almost Off the fire add yolks of eggs and four ounces of grated Gruyere cheese Mix this in well with the white sauce and season with salt pepper and some grated nutmeg Beat whites of egg firm Add the whites to the preparation stir in and pour into a pudding basin Take a large saucepan and fill half full of water Bring to a boil and then place the pudding basin so that the top of the basin is well out of the water Allow to boil gently for one one two to two hours Renew the boiling water from time to time as it evaporates and take care that the water in boiling does not bubble over the mixture Test with a knife as for a cake to see if it is cooked When the knife comes out clean take the basin out of the water and turn the Fondue out on a dish It should be fairly firm and keep the shape of the basin Sprinkle with some finely chopped ham and serve hot The imported Swiss sometimes is cubed instead of grated then marinated for four or five hours in dry white wine before being melted and liquored with the schnapps This can be pleasantly adopted here in All American Fondue one pound imported Swiss cheese cubed three four cup scuppernong or other American white wine one one two jiggers applejack After marinating the Swiss cubes in the wine simply melt together over hot water stir until soft and creamy add the applejack and dunk with fingers of toast or your own to a chorus of All Bound Round with a Woolen String Of course this can be treated as a mere vinous Welsh Rabbit and poured over toast to be accompanied by beer But wine is the thing for the French Fondue is to dry wine what the Rabbit is to stale ale or fresh beer We say French instead of Swiss because the French took over the dish so eagerly together with the great Gruyere that makes it distinctive They internationalized it sent it around the world with bouillabaisse and onion soup that celestial soupe a l oignon on which snowy showers of grated Gruyere descend To put the Welsh Rabbit in its place they called it Fondue a l Anglaise which also points up the twinlike relationship of the world s two favorite dishes of melted cheese But to differentiate and show they are not identical twins the No one dish remained Fromage Fondue while the second was baptized Fromage Fondue a la Biere Beginning with Savarin the French whisked up more rapturous rhapsodic writing about Gruyere and its offspring the Fondue together with the puffed Souffle than about any other imported cheese except Parmesan Parmesan and Gruyere were praised as the two greatest culinary cheeses A variant Fondue was made of the Italian cheese Parmesan Fondue three tablespoons butter one cup grated Parmesan cheese four eggs lightly beaten Salt Pepper Over boiling water melt butter and cheese slowly stir in the eggs season to taste and stir steadily in one direction only until smooth Pour over fingers of buttered toast Or spoon it up as the ancients did before there were any forks It s beaten with a fork but eaten catch as catch can like chicken in the rough Sapsago Swiss Fondue two tablespoons butter two tablespoons flour one two teaspoon salt one one two cups milk two one two cups shredded Swiss cheese two one two tablespoons grated Sapsago one two cup dry white wine Pepper black and red freshly ground Fingers of toast Over boiling water stir the first four ingredients into a smooth fairly thick cream sauce Then stir in Swiss cheese until well melted After that add the Sapsago finely grated and wine in small splashes Stir steadily in one direction only until velvety Season sharply with the contrasting peppers and serve over fingers of toast This is also nice when served bubbling in individual preheated pastry shells casseroles or ramekins although this way most of the fun of the dunking party is left out To make up for it however cooked slices of mushrooms are sometimes added At the Cheese Cellar in the New York World s Fair Swiss Pavilion where a continual dunking party was in progress thousands of amateurs learned such basic things as not to overcook the Fondue lest it become stringy and the protocol of dunking in turn and keeping the mass in continual motion until the next on the Fondue line dips in his cube of bread The success of the dish depends on making it quickly keeping it gently a bubble and never letting it stand still for a split second The Swiss who consume three or four times as much cheese per capita as we and almost twice as much as the French are willing to share Fondue honors with the French Alpine province of Savoy a natural cheese cellar with almost two dozen distinctive types of its very own such as Fat cheese also called Death s Head La Grande Bornand a luscious half dried sheep s milker Chevrotins small dry goat milk cheeses and Le Vacherin The latter made in both Savoy and Switzerland boasts two interesting variants one Vacherin Fondue or Spiced Fondue Made about the same as Emmentaler ripened to sharp age and then melted spices added and the cheese re formed It is also called Spiced Fondue and sells for about two dollars a pound Named Fondue from being melted though it s really recooked two Vacherin a la Main This is a curiosity in cheeses resembling a cold uncooked Fondue Made of cow s milk it is round a foot in diameter and half a foot high It is salted and aged until the rind is hard and the inside more runny than the ripest Camembert so it can be eaten with a spoon like the cooked Fondue as well as spread on bread The local name for it is Tome de Montagne Here is a good assortment of Fondues Vacherin Fribourg Fondue two tablespoons butter one clove garlic crushed two cups shredded Vacherin cheese two tablespoons hot water This authentic quickie is started by cooking the garlic in butter until the butter is melted Then remove garlic and reduce heat Add the soft cheese and stir with silver fork until smooth and velvety Add the water in little splashes stirring constantly in one direction Dunk In this melted Swiss a little water takes the place of a lot of wine La Fondue Comtois This regional specialty of Franche Comte is made with white wine Sauterne Chablis Riesling or any Rhenish type will serve splendidly Also use butter grated Gruyere beaten eggs and that touch of garlic Chives Fondue three cups grated Swiss cheese three tablespoons flour two tablespoons butter one garlic clove crushed three tablespoons finely chopped chives one cup dry white wine Salt Freshly ground pepper A pinch of nutmeg one four cup kirsch Mix cheese and flour Melt butter in chafing dish blazer rubbed with garlic Cook chives in butter one minute Add wine and heat just under boiling Keep simmering as you add cheese and flour mix gradually stirring always in one direction Salt according to age and sharpness of cheese add plenty of freshly ground pepper and the pinch of nutmeg When everything is stirred smooth and bubbling toss in the kirsch without missing a stroke of the fork and get to dunking Large crisp hot potato chips make a pleasant change for dunking purposes Or try assorted crackers alternating with the absorbent bread or hard rolls Tomato Fondue two tomatoes skinned seeded and chopped one two teaspoon dried sweet basil one clove garlic two tablespoons butter one two cup dry white wine two cups grated Cheddar cheese Paprika Mix basil with chopped tomatoes Rub chafing dish with garlic melt butter add tomatoes and much paprika Cook five to six minutes add wine stir steadily to boiling point Then add cheese half a cup at a time and keep stirring until everything is smooth Serve on hot toast like Welsh Rabbit Here the two most popular melted cheese dishes tangle but they re held together with the common ingredient tomato Fondue also appears as a sauce to pour over baked tomatoes Stale bread crumbs are soaked in tomato juice to make Tomato Baked Fondue one cup tomato juice one cup stale bread crumbs one cup grated sharp American cheese one tablespoon melted butter Salt four eggs separated and well beaten Soak crumbs in tomato juice stir cheese in butter until melted season with a little or no salt depending on saltiness of the cheese Mix in the beaten yolks fold in the white and bake about fifty minutes in moderate oven BAKED FONDUES Although Savarin s dunking Fondue was first to make a sensation on these shores and is still in highest esteem among epicures the Fondue America took to its bosom was baked The original recipe came from the super caseous province of Savoy under the explicit title La Fondue au Fromage La Fondue au Fromage Make the usual creamy mixture of butter flour milk yolks of eggs and Gruyere in thin slices for a change Use red pepper instead of black splash in a jigger of kirsch but no white wine Finally fold in the egg whites and bake in a mold for forty five minutes We adapted this to our national taste which had already based the whole business of melted cheese on the Welsh Rabbit with stale ale or milk instead of white wine and Worcestershire mustard and hot peppers Today we have come up with this one hundred American Fondue two cups scalded milk two cups stale bread crumbs one two teaspoon dry English mustard Salt Dash of nutmeg Dash of pepper two cups American cheese Cheddar two egg yolks well beaten two egg whites beaten stiff Soak crumbs in milk season and stir in the cheese until melted Add the beaten egg yolks and stir until you have a smooth mixture Let this cool while beating the whites stiff leaving them slightly moist Fold the whites into the cool custardy mix and bake in a buttered dish until firm About fifty minutes in a moderate oven This is more of a baked cheese job than a true Fondue to our way of thinking and the scalded milk doesn t exactly take the place of the wine or kirsch It is characteristic of our bland cookery OTHER FONDUES PLAIN AND FANCY BAKED AND NOT Quickie Catsup Tummy Fondiddy three four pound sharp cheese diced one can condensed tomato soup one two cup catsup one two teaspoon mustard one egg lightly beaten In double boiler melt cheese in soup Blend thoroughly by constant stirring Remove from heat lightly whip or fold in the catsup and mustard mixed with egg Serve on Melba toast or rusks This might be suggested as a novel midnight snack with a cup of cocoa for a change Cheese and Rice Fondue one cup cooked rice two cups milk four eggs separated and well beaten one two cup grated cheese one two teaspoon salt Cayenne Worcestershire sauce or tabasco sauce or all three Heat rice instead of bread crumbs in milk stir in cheese until melted add egg yolks beaten lemon yellow season fold in stiff egg whites Serve hot on toast Corn and Cheese Fondue one cup bread crumbs one large can creamed corn one small onion chopped one two green pepper chopped two cups cottage cheese one two teaspoon salt one two cup milk two eggs well beaten Mix all ingredients together and bake in buttered casserole set in pan of hot water Bake about one hour in moderate oven or until set Cheese Fondue one cup grated Cheddar one two cup crumbled Roquefort one cup pimento cheese three tablespoons cream three tablespoons butter one teaspoon Worcestershire Stir everything together over hot water until smooth and creamy Then whisk until fluffy moistening with more cream or mayonnaise if too stiff Serve on Melba toast or assorted thin toasted crackers Brick Fondue one two cup butter two cups grated Brick cheese one two cup warm milk one two teaspoon salt two eggs Melt butter and cheese together use wire whisk to whip in the warm milk Season Take from fire and beat in the eggs one at a time Please note that Fondue protocol calls for each egg to be beaten separately in cases like this Serve over hot toast or crackers Cheddar Dunk Bowl three four pound sharp Cheddar cheese three tablespoons cream two three teaspoon dry mustard one one two teaspoons Worcestershire Grate the cheese powdery fine and mash it together with the cream until fluffy Season and serve in a beautiful bowl for dunking in the original style of Savarin although this is a static imitation of the real thing All kinds of crackers and colorful dips can be used from celery stalks and potato chips to thin paddles cut from Bombay duck Illustration Chapter Seven Souffles Puffs and Ramekins There isn t much difference between Cheese Souffles Puffs and Ramekins The English Encyclopedia of Practical Cookery the oldest biggest and best of such works in English lumps Cheese Puffs and Ramekins together giving the same recipes for both although it treats each extensively under its own name when not made with cheese Cheese was the basis of the original French Ramequin cheese and bread crumbs or puff paste baked in a mold with puff again the principal factor in Souffle from the French souffler puff up Basic Souffle three tablespoons butter or margarine four tablespoons flour one one four cups hot milk scalded one teaspoon salt A dash of cayenne one two cup grated Cheddar cheese sharp two egg yolks beaten lemon yellow two egg whites beaten stiff Melt butter stir in flour and milk gradually until thick and smooth Season and add the cheese continuing the cooking and slow stirring until velvety Remove from heat and let cool somewhat then stir in the egg yolks with a light hand and an upward motion Fold in the stiff whites and when evenly mixed pour into a big round baking dish Some butter it and some don t To make sure the top will be even when baked run a spoon or knife around the surface about one inch from the edge of the dish before baking slowly in a moderate oven until puffed high and beautifully browned Serve instantly for fear the Souffle may fall The baking takes up to an hour and the egg whites shouldn t be beaten so stiff they are hard to fold in and contain no air to expand and puff up the dish To perk up the seasonings mustard Worcestershire sauce lemon juice nutmeg and even garlic are often used to taste especially in England While Cheddar is the preferred cheese Parmesan runs it a close second Then comes Swiss You may use any two or all three of these together Sometimes Roquefort is added as in the Ramekin recipes below Parmesan Souffle Make the same as Basic Souffle with these small modifications in the ingredients one full cup of grated Parmesan one extra egg in place of the one two cup of Cheddar cheese A little more butter Black pepper not cayenne Swiss Souffle Make the same as Basic Souffle with these slight changes one one four cups grated Swiss cheese instead of the Cheddar cheese Nutmeg in place of the cayenne Parmesan Swiss Souffle Make the same as Basic Souffle with these little differences one two cup grated Swiss cheese and one two cup grated Parmesan in place of the Cheddar cheese one four teaspoon each of sugar and black pepper for seasoning Any of these makes a light lovely luncheon or a proper climax to a grand dinner Cheese Corn Souffle Make as Basic Souffle substituting for the scalded milk one cup of sieved and strained juice from cream style canned corn Cheese Spinach Souffle Saute one one two cups of finely chopped drained spinach in butter with one teaspoon finely grated onion and then whip it until light and fluffy Mix well into the white sauce of the Basic Souffle before adding the cheese and following the rest of the recipe Cheese Tomato Souffle Substitute hot tomato juice for the scalded milk Cheese Sea food Souffle Add one one two cups finely chopped or ground lobster crab shrimp other sea food or mixture thereof with any preferred seasoning added Cheese Mushroom Souffle one one two cups grated sharp Cheddar one cup cream of mushroom soup Paprika to taste Salt two egg yolks well beaten two egg whites beaten stiff two tablespoons chopped cooked bacon two tablespoons sliced blanched almonds Heat cheese with soup and paprika adding the cheese gradually and stirring until smooth Add salt and thicken the sauce with egg yolks still stirring steadily and finally fold in the whites Sprinkle with bacon and almonds and bake until golden brown and puffed high about one hour Cheese Potato Souffle Potato Puff six potatoes two onions one tablespoon butter or margarine one cup hot milk three four cup grated Cheddar cheese one teaspoon salt A dash of pepper two egg yolks well beaten two egg whites beaten stiff one four cup grated Cheddar cheese Cook potatoes and onions together until tender and put through a ricer Mix with all the other ingredients except the egg whites and the Cheddar Fold in the egg whites mix thoroughly and pour into a buttered baking dish Sprinkle the one four cup of Cheddar on top and bake in moderate oven about one two hour until golden brown and well puffed Serve instantly Variations of this popular Souffle leave out the onion and simplify matters by using two cups of mashed potatoes Sometimes one tablespoon of catsup and another of minced parsley is added to the mixture Or onion juice alone to take the place of the cooked onions about a tablespoon full or scant The English in concocting such a Potato Puff or Souffle are inclined to make it extra peppery as they do most of their Cheese Souffles with not only a dust of black pepper but as much cayenne as may be stood on the face of a sixpence Cheese Fritter Souffles These combine ham with Parmesan cheese and are even more delicately handled in the making than crepes suzette PUFFS Three in One Puffs one cup grated Swiss one cup grated Parmesan one cup cream cheese five eggs lightly beaten salt and pepper Mix the cheeses into one mass moistened with the beaten eggs splashed on at intervals When thoroughly incorporated put in ramekins tiny tins cups or any sort of little mold of any shape Bake in hot oven about ten minutes until richly browned Such miniature Souffles serve as liaison officers for this entire section since they are baked in ramekins or ramequins from the French word for the small baking dish that holds only one portion These may be paper boxes usually round earthenware china Pyrex of any attractive shape in which to bake or serve the Puffs More commonly in America at least Puffs are made without ramekin dishes as follows Fried Puffs two egg whites beaten stiff one two cup grated cheese one tablespoon flour Salt Paprika Into the stiff egg whites fold the cheese flour and seasonings When thoroughly mixed pat into shape desired roll in crumbs and fry Roquefort Puffs one eight pound genuine French Roquefort one egg white beaten stiff eight crackers or two inch bread rounds Cream the Roquefort fold in the egg white pile on crackers and bake fifteen minutes in slow oven The constant repetition of beaten stiff in these recipes may give the impression that the whites are badly beaten up but such is not the case They are simply whipped to peaks and left moist and glistening as a teardrop with a slight sad droop to them that shows there is still room for the air to expand and puff things up in cooking Parmesan Puffs Make a spread of mayonnaise or other salad dressing with equal parts of imported Parmesan grated fine Spread on a score or more of crackers in a roomy pan and broil a couple of minutes till they puff up golden brown Use only the best Parmesan imported from Italy or second best from Argentina where the rich pampas grass and Italian settlers get together on excellent Parmesan and Romano Never buy Parmesan already grated it quickly loses its flavor Breakfast Puffs one cup flour one cup milk one four cup finely grated cheese one egg lightly beaten one two teaspoon salt Mix all together to a smooth light batter and fill ramekins or cups half full then bake in quick oven until they are puffing over the top and golden brown Danish Fondue Puffs one stale roll one two cup boiling hot milk Salt Pepper two cups freshly grated Cheddar cheese four egg yolks beaten lemon yellow four egg whites beaten stiff Soak roll in boiling milk and beat to a paste Mix with cheese and egg yolks When smooth and thickened fold in the egg whites and fill ramekins tins cups or paper forms and slowly bake until puffed up and golden brown New England Cheese Puffs one cup sifted flour one teaspoon baking powder one two teaspoon salt one two teaspoon Hungarian paprika one four teaspoon dry mustard two egg yolks beaten lemon yellow one two cup milk one cup freshly grated Cheddar cheese two egg whites beaten stiff but not dry Sift dry ingredients together mix yolks with milk and stir in Add cheese and when thoroughly incorporated fold in the egg whites to make a smooth batter Drop from a big spoon into hot deep fat and cook until well browned Caraway seeds are sometimes added Poppy seeds are also used and either of these makes a snappier puff especially tasty when served with soup A few drops of tabasco give this an extra tang Cream Cheese Puffs one two pound cream cheese one cup milk four eggs lightly beaten one two teaspoon salt one two teaspoon dry mustard Soften cheese by heating over hot water Remove from heat and add milk eggs and seasoning Beat until well blended then pour into custard cups ramekins or any other individual baking dishes that are attractive enough to serve the puffs in RAMEKINS OR RAMEQUINS Some Ramekin dishes are made so exquisitely that they may be collected like snuff bottles Ramekins are utterly French both the cooked Puffs and the individual dishes in which they are baked Essentially a Cheese Puff this is also au gratin when topped with both cheese and browned bread crumbs By a sort of poetic cook s license the name is also applied to any kind of cake containing cheese and cooked in the identifying one portion ramekin It is used chiefly in the plural however together with the name of the chief ingredient such as Chicken Ramekins and Cheese Ramekins I two eggs two tablespoons flour one eight pound butter melted one eight pound grated cheese Mix well and bake in individual molds for fifteen minutes Cheese Ramekins II three tablespoons melted butter one two teaspoon each salt and pepper three four cup bread crumbs one two cup grated cheese two eggs lightly beaten one one two cups milk Mix the first four dry ingredients together stir eggs into the milk and add Stir to a smooth batter and bake in buttered ramekins standing in water in moderate oven Serve piping hot for like Souffles and all associated Puffs the hot air will puff out of them quickly then they will sink and be inedible TWO ANCIENT ENGLISH RECIPES STILL GOING STRONG Cheese Ramekins III Grate one two pound of any dry rich cheese Butter a dozen small paper cases or little boxes of stiff writing paper like Souffle cases Put a saucepan containing one two pint of water over the fire add two tablespoons of butter and when the water boils stir in one heaping tablespoonful of flour Beat the mixture until it shrinks away from the sides of the saucepan then stir in the grated cheese Remove the paste thus made from the fire and let it partly cool In the meantime separate the yolks from the whites of three eggs and beat them until the yolks foam and the whites make a stiff froth Put the mixture at once into the buttered paper cases only half filling them since they rise very high while being baked with small slices of cheese and bake in a moderate oven for about fifteen minutes As soon as the Puffs are done put the cases on a hot dish covered with a folded napkin and serve very hot The most popular cheese for Ramekins has always been and still is Gruyere But because the early English also adopted Italian Parmesan that followed as a close second and remains there today Sharp Cheddar makes tangy Ramekins as will be seen in this second oldster for though it prescribes Gloucester and Cheshire arf and arf both are essentially Cheddars Gloucester has been called a glorified Cheshire and the latter has long been known as a peculiarly rich and colorful elder brother of Cheddar described in Kenelme Digby s Closet Open d as a quick fat rich well tasted cheese Cheese Ramekins IV Scrape fine one four pound of Gloucester cheese and one four pound of Cheshire cheese Beat this scraped cheese in a mortar with the yolks of four eggs one four pound of fresh butter and the crumbs of a French roll boiled in cream until soft When all this is well mixed and pounded to a paste add the beaten whites of four eggs Should the paste seem too stiff one or two tablespoons of sherry may be added Put the paste into paper cases and bake in a Dutch oven till nicely browned The Ramekins should be served very hot Since both Gloucester cheese and Cheshire cheese are not easily come by even in London today it would be hard to reproduce this in the States So the best we can suggest is to use half and half of two of our own great Cheddars say half Coon and half Wisconsin Longhorn or half Tillamook and half Herkimer County For there s no doubt about it contrasting cheeses tickle the taste buds and as many as three different kinds put together make Puffs all the more perfect Ramequins a la Parisienne two cups milk one cup cream one ounce salt butter one tablespoon flour one two cup grated Gruyere Coarsely ground pepper An atom of nutmeg A soupcon of garlic A light touch of powdered sugar eight eggs separated Boil milk and cream together Melt butter mix in the flour and stir over heat five minutes adding the milk and cream mixture a little at a time When thoroughly cooked remove from heat and stir in cheese seasonings and the yolks of all eight eggs well beaten and the whites of two even better beaten When well mixed fold in the remaining egg whites stiffly beaten until you have a batter as smooth and thick as cream Pour this into ramekins of paper porcelain or earthenware filling each about two three full to allow for them to puff up as they bake in a very slow oven until golden brown or a little less than twenty minutes Le Ramequin Morezien This celebrated specialty of Franche Comte is described as a porridge of water butter seasoning chopped garlic and toast thickened with minced Gruyere and served very hot Several French provinces are known for distinctive individual Puffs usually served in the dainty fluted forms they are cooked in In Jeanne d Arc s Lorraine for instance there are the simply named Les Ramequins made of flour Gruyere and eggs Swiss Roquefort Ramekins one four pound Swiss cheese one four pound Roquefort cheese one two pound butter eight eggs separated four breakfast rolls crusts removed one two cup cream The batter is made in the usual way with the soft insides of the rolls simmered in the cream and stirred in The egg whites are folded in last as always the batter poured into ramekins part full and baked to a golden brown Then they are served instantaneously lest they fall Puff Paste Ramekins Puff or other pastry is rolled out fiat and sprinkled with fine tasty cheese or any cheese mixture such as Parmesan with Gruyere and or Swiss Sapsago for a piquant change but in lesser quantity than the other cheeses used Parmesan cheese has long been the favorite for these Fold paste into three layers roll out again and dust with more cheese Fold once more and roll this out and cut in small fancy shapes to bake ten to fifteen minutes in a hot oven Brushing with egg yolk before baking makes these Ramekins shine Frying Pan Ramekins Melt two ounces of butter let it cool a little and then mix with one two pound of cheese Fold in the whites of three eggs beaten stiff but not dry Cover frying pan with buttered papers put slices of bread on this and cover with the cheese mixture Cook about five minutes take it off and brown it with a salamander There are two schools of salamandering among turophiles One holds that it toughens the cheese and makes it less digestible the other that it s simply swell Some of the latter addicts have special cheese branding irons made with their monograms to identify their creations whether they be burned on the skins of Welsh Rabbits or Frying Pan Ramekins Salamandering with an iron that has a gay carnivalesque design can make a sort of harlequin Ramekin Casserole Ramekin Here is the Americanization of a French original In a deep casserole lay alternate slices of white bread and Swiss cheese with the cheese slices a bit bigger all around Beat two eggs with two cups of milk season with salt and of all things nutmeg Proceed to bake like individual Ramekins Illustration Chapter Eight Pizzas Blintzes Pastes Cheese Cakes et cetera No matter how big or hungry your family you can always appease them with pizza Pizza The Tomato

With these meat mixtures you can make four different flavored fillings Ham and Mozzarella Chicken and Mozzarella Ham and Ricotta Chicken and Ricotta Fill the little hats alternately so you ll have the same number of each different kind Pinch edges tight together to keep the stuffings in while boiling fast for five minutes in chicken broth or salted water if you must Since these Cappelletti are only a pleasing form and shape of ravioli they are served in the same way on hot plates with plain tomato sauce and Parmesan or reasonable substitute If we count this final seasoning as an ingredient this makes three cheeses so that each of half a dozen taste buds can be getting individual sensations without letting the others know what it s doing Dauphiny Ravioli This French variant of the famous Italian pockets of pastry follows the Cappelletti pattern with any fresh goat cheese and Gruyere melted with butter and minced parsley and boiled in chicken broth Italian Fritters one four cup flour two tablespoons sugar one four pound fresh Ricotta two eggs beaten one two cup shredded Mozzarella Rind of one two lemon grated three tablespoons brandy Salt Stir and mix well together in the order given and let stand one hour or more to thicken the batter so it will hold its shape while cooking Shape batter like walnuts and hold one at a time in the bowl of a long handled spoon dipped for ten seconds in boiling hot oil Fritter the walnuts so and serve at once with powdered sugar To make fascinating cheese croquettes mix several contrasting cheeses in this batter Italian Asparagus and Cheese This gives great scope for contrasting cheeses in one and the same dish In a shallow baking pan put a foundation layer of grated Cheddar and a little butter Cover with a layer of tender parts of asparagus lightly salted next a layer of grated Gruyere with a bit of butter and another of asparagus From here you can go as far as you like with varied layers of melting cheeses alternating with asparagus until you come to the top where you add two more kinds of cheese a mixture of powdered Parmesan with Sapsago to give the new mown hay scent Garlic on Cheese For one sandwich prepare thirty or forty garlic cloves by removing skins and frying out the fierce pungence in smoking olive oil They skip in the hot pan like Mexican jumping beans Toast one side of a thickish slice of bread put this side down on a grilling pan cover it with a slice of imported Swiss Emmentaler or Gruyere of about the same size shape and thickness Stick the cooked garlic cloves while still blistering hot in a close pattern into the cheese and brown for a minute under the grill Salt lightly and dash with paprika for the color Recipe by Bob Brown in Merle Armitage s collection Fit for a King Spaniards call garlic cloves teeth Englishmen call them toes It was cheese and garlic together that inspired Shakespeare to Hotspur s declaration in King Henry IV I had rather live With cheese and garlic in a windmill far Than feed on cates and have him talk to me In any summer house in Christendom Some people can take a mere soupcon of the stuff while others can down it by the soup spoon so we feel it necessary in reprinting our recipe to point to the warning of another early English writer Garlic is very dangerous to young children fine women and hot young men Blintzes This snow white member of

Vatroushki Russia seems to have been the cradle of all sorts of blinis and blintzes and perhaps the first of them to be made was vatroushki a variant of the blintzes above The chief difference is that rounds of puff paste dough are used instead of the hot cakes one teaspoon of sugar is added to the cottage cheese filling and the sour cream one two cup is mixed into this instead of being served with it Little cups filled with this mix are made by pinching the edges of the dough together The tops are brushed with egg yolk and baked in a brisk oven Cottage Cheese Pancakes one cup prepared pancake

Hungarian potato and other succulent dumplings and may be served with goulash or as a meal in itself BUTTER AND CHEESE Where fish is scant And fruit of trees Supply that want With butter and cheese Thomas Tusser in The Last Remedy Butter and cheese are mixed together in equal parts for cheese butter Serbia has a cheese called Butter that more or less matches Turkey s Durak of which butter is an indispensable ingredient and French Cancoillote is based on sour milk simmered with butter The English have a cheese called Margarine made with the butter substitute In Westphalia there are no two schools of thought about whether tis better to eat butter with cheese or not for in Westphalia sour milk cheese butter is mixed in as part of the process of making The Arabs press curds and butter together to store in vats and the Scots have Crowdie or Cruddy Butter BUTTERMILK CHEESE The value of buttermilk is stressed in an extravagant old Hindu proverb A man may live without bread but without buttermilk he dies Cheese was made before butter being the earliest form of dairy manufacturing so buttermilk cheese came well after plain milk cheese even after whey cheese It is very tasty and a natural with potato salad The curd is salted after draining and sold in small parchment packages German leather cheese has buttermilk mixed with the plain The Danes make their Appetitost with sour buttermilk Ricotta Romano for a novelty is made of sheep buttermilk COTTAGE CHEESE In America cottage cheese is also called pot Dutch and smearcase It is the easiest and quickest to make of all cheeses by simply letting milk sour or adding buttermilk to curdle it then stand a while on the back of the kitchen stove since it is homemade as a rule It is drained in a bag of cheesecloth and may be eaten the same day usually salted The Pilgrims brought along the following two tried and true recipes from olde England and both are still in use and good repute Cottage Cheese No one Let milk sour until clotted Pour boiling water over and it will immediately curd Stir well and pour into a colander Pour a little cold water on the curd salt it and break it up attractively for serving Cottage Cheese No two A very rich and tasty variety is made of equal parts whole milk and buttermilk heated together to just under the boiling point Pour into a linen bag and let drain until next day Then remove salt to taste and add a bit of butter or cream to make a smooth creamy consistency and pat into balls the size of a Seville orange CREAM CHEESE In England there are three distinct manners of making cream cheese one Fresh milk strained and lightly drained two Scalded cream dried and drained dry like Devonshire three Rennet curd ripened with thin edible rind or none packaged in small blocks or miniature bricks by dairy companies as in the U S Philadelphia Cream cheese American cream cheeses follow the English pattern being named from then region or established brands owned by Breakstone Borden Kraft Shefford et cetera Cream cheese such as the first listed above is easier to make than cottage cheese or any other Technically in fact it is not a cheese but the dried curd of milk and is often called virginal Fresh milk is simply strained through muslin in a perforated box through which the whey and extra moisture drains away for three or four days leaving a residue as firm as fresh butter In America where we mix cream cheese with everything a popular assortment of twelve sold in New York bears these ingredients and names Chives Cherry Garden Caviar Lachs Pimiento Olive and Pimiento Pineapple Relish Scallion Strawberry and Triple Decker of Relish Pimiento and Cream in layers In Italy there is Stracchino Cream in Sweden Chantilly Finally to come to France la Foncee or Fromage de Pau a cream also known around the world as Creme d Isigny Double Creme Fromage a la Creme de Gien Pots de Creme saint Gervais et cetera et cetera The French go even farther by eating thick fresh cream with Chevretons du Beaujolais and Fromage Blanc in the style that adds a la creme to their already glorified names The English came along with Snow Cream Cheese that is more of a dessert similar to Italian Cream Cheese We d like to have a cheese ice cream to contrast with too sweet ones Attempts at this have been made both here and in England Scottish Caledonian cream came closest We have frozen cheese with fruit to be sure but no true cheese ice cream as yet though some cream cheeses seem especially suitable The farmer s daughter hath soft brown hair Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese And I met with a ballad I can t say where That wholly consisted of lines like these Butter and eggs and a pound of cheese In this parody by Calverly The Farmer s Daughter the ingredients suggest cheese cake dating back to thirteen eighty one In England From that year Kettner in his Book of the Table quotes this recipe Take cream of almonds or of cow milk and beat them well together and make small coffins that is cases of pastry and do it put it therein and do put thereto sugar and good powders Or take good fat cheese and eggs and make them of divers colours green red or yellow and bake them or serve them forth This primitive receipt grew up into Richmond maids of honor that caused Kettner to wax poetic with At Richmond we are permitted to touch with our lips a countless number of these maids light and airy as the airy fairy Lilian What more can the finest poetry achieve in quickening the things of earth into tokens and foretastes of heaven with glimpses of higher life and ethereal worlds CHEESECAKES Coronation Cheese Cake The Oxford Dictionary defines cheese cake as a tartlet filled with sweet curds et cetera This shows that the cheese is the main thing and the and so forth just a matter of taste We are delighted to record that the Lord Mayor of London picked traditional cheese tarts the maids of honor mentioned earlier in this section as the Coronation dessert with which to regale the second Queen Elizabeth at the city luncheon in Guildhall This is most fitting since these tarts were named after the maids of honor at the court of the first Queen Elizabeth The original recipe is said to have sold for a thousand pounds These Richmond maids of honor had the usual cheese cake ingredients butter and eggs and pounds of cheese but what made the subtle flavor nutmeg brandy lemon orange flower water or all four More than two thousand years before this land of Coronation cheese cake the Greeks had a word for it several in fact Apician Cheese Cake Aristoxenean and Philoxenean among them Then the Romans took it over and we read from an epistle of the period Thirty times in this one year Charinus while you have been arranging to make your will have I sent you cheese cakes dripping with Hyblaean Thyme Celestial honey such as that of Mount Hymettus we still get from Greece Plato mentioned cheese cake and a town near Thebes was named for it before Christ was born at a time when cheese cakes were widely known as dainty food for mortal man Today cheese cakes come in a half dozen popular styles of which the ones flavored with fresh pineapple are the most popular in New York But buyers delight in every sort including the one hundred percent American type called cheese pies Indeed there seems to be no dividing line between cheese cakes and cheese pies While most of them are sweet some are made piquant with pimientos and olives We offer a favorite of ours made from popcorn style pot cheese put through a sieve Pineapple Cheese Cake two one two pounds sieved pot cheese one inch piece vanilla bean one four pound sweet butter melted one two small box graham crackers crushed fine four eggs two cups sugar one small can crushed pineapple drained two cups milk one three cup flour In a big bowl mix everything except the graham crackers and pineapple in the order given above Butter a square Pyrex pan and put in the graham cracker dust to make a crust Cover this evenly with the pineapple and pour in the cheese custard mixture Bake I hour in a quiet oven as the English used to say for a moderate one and when done set aside for twelve hours before eating Because of the time and labor involved maybe you had better buy your cheese cakes even though some of the truly fine ones cost a dime a bite especially the pedigreed Jewish American ones in Manhattan Reuben s and Lindy s are two leaders at about five dollars a cake Some are fruited with cherries or strawberries Cheese Custard four eggs slightly beaten one two teaspoon salt one cup milk A dash of pepper or paprika three tablespoons melted butter A few drops of onion juice if desired four tablespoons grated Swiss imported Mix all together set in molds in pan of hot water and bake until brown Open faced Cheese Pie three eggs one cup sugar two pounds soft smearcase Whip everything together and fill two pie crusts Bake without any upper crust The Apple pie Affinity Hot apple pie was always accompanied with cheese in New England even as every slice of apple pie in Wisconsin has cheese for a sidekick according to law Pioneer hot pies were baked in brick ovens and flavored with nutmeg cinnamon and rose geranium The cheese was Cheddar but today all sorts of pie and cheese combinations are common such as banana pie and Gorgonzola mince with Danish Blue pumpkin with cream cheese peach pie with Hable and even a green dusting of Sapsago over raisin pie Apple pie au gratin thickly grated over with Parmesan Caciocavallo or Sapsago is something special when served with black coffee Cider too or applejack is a natural accompaniment to any dessert of apple with its cheese Apple Pie Adorned Apple pie is adorned with cream and cheese by pressing cream cheese through a ricer and folding in plenty of double cream beaten thick and salted a little Put the mixture in a pastry tube and decorate top of pie in fanciful fashion Apple Pie a la Cheese Lay a slice of melting cheese on top of apple or any fruit or berry pie and melt under broiler two to three minutes Cheese crusty Apple Pie In making an apple pie roll out the top crust and sprinkle with sharp Cheddar grated dot with butter and bake golden brown Flan au Fromage To make this Franche Comte tart of crisp paste simply mix coarsely grated Gruyere with beaten egg fill the tart cases and bake For any cheese pastry or fruit and custard pie crusts work in tasty shredded sharp Cheddar in the ratio of one to four parts of flour Christmas Cake Sandwiches A traditional Christmas carol begs for A little bit of spice cake A little bit of cheese A glass of cold water A penny if you please For a festive handout cut the spice cake or fruit cake in slices and sandwich them with slices of tasty cheese between To maintain traditional Christmas cheer for the elders serve apple pie with cheese and applejack Angelic Camembert one ripe Camembert imported one cup Anjou dry white wine one two pound sweet butter softened two tablespoons finely grated toast crumbs Lightly scrape all crusty skin from the Camembert and when its creamy interior stands revealed put it in a small round covered dish pour in the wine cover tightly so no bouquet or aroma can possibly escape and let stand overnight When ready to serve drain off and discard any wine left dry the cheese and mash with the sweet butter into an angelic paste Reshape in original Camembert form dust thickly with the crumbs and there you are Such a delicate dessert is a favorite with the ladies since some of them find a prime Camembert a bit too strong if taken straight Although A W Fulton s observation in For Men Only is going out of date it is none the less amusing In the course of a somewhat varied career I have only met one woman who appreciated cheese This quality in her seemed to me so deserving of reward that I did not hesitate to acquire her hand in marriage Another writer has said that only gourmets among women seem to like cheese except farm women and foreigners The association between gourmets and farm women is borne out by the following urgent plea from early Italian landowners Ai contadini non far sapere Quanta e buono it cacio con le pere Don t let the peasants know How good are cheese and pears Having found out for ourselves we suggest a golden slice of Taleggio Stracchino or pale gold Bel Paese to polish off a good dinner with a juicy Lombardy pear or its American equivalent a Bartlett let us say This celestial association of cheese and pears is further accented by the French Entre la poire et le fromage Between the pear and the cheese This places the cheese after the fruit as the last course in accordance with early English usage set down by John Clarke in his Paroemiologia After cheese comes nothing But in his Epigrams Ben Jonson serves them together Digestive cheese and fruit there sure will be That brings us back to cheese and pippins I will make an end of my dinner there s pippins and cheese to come Shakespeare s Merry Wives of Windsor When should the cheese be served In England it is served before or after the fruit with or without the port Following The Book of Keruynge in modern spelling we note when it was published in fourteen thirty one the proper thing after meat was pears nuts strawberries whortleberries American huckleberries and hard cheese In modern practice we serve some suitable cheese like Camembert directly on slices of apple and pears Gorgonzola on sliced banana Hable spread on pineapple and a cheese dessert tray to match the Lazy Lou with everything crunchy down to Crackerjacks Good too are figs both fresh and preserved stuffed with cream cheese kumquats avocados fruity dunking mixtures of Pineapple cheese

Salads and Sauces He who says au gratin says Parmesan Thomas Gray the English poet saluted it two centuries ago with Parma the happy country where huge cheeses grow On September four sixteen sixty six Pepys recorded the burying of his pet Parmesan as well as my wine and some other things in a pit in Sir W Batten s garden And on the selfsame fourth of September more than a century later in seventeen eighty four Woodforde in his Diary of a Country Parson wrote I sent mister Custance about three doz more of apricots and he sent me back another large piece of fine Parmesan cheese It was very kind of him The second most popular cheese for au gratin is Italian Romano and for an entirely different flavor Swiss Sapsago The French who gave us this cookery term use it in its original meaning for any dish with a browned topping usually of bread crumbs or crumbs and cheese In America we think of au gratin as grated cheese only although Webster says with a browned covering often mixed with butter or cheese as potatoes au gratin So let us begin with that Potatoes au Gratin two cups diced cooked potatoes two tablespoons grated onion one two cup grated American Cheddar cheese two tablespoons butter one two cup milk one egg Salt Pepper More grated cheese for covering In a buttered baking dish put a layer of diced potatoes sprinkle with onion and bits of butter Next scatter on a thin layer of cheese and alternate with potatoes onions and butter Stir milk egg salt and pepper together and pour it on the mixture Top everything with plenty of grated cheese to make it authentically American au gratin Bake until firm in moderate oven about one two hour Eggs au Gratin Make a white sauce flavored with minced onion to pour over any desired number of eggs broken into a buttered baking dish Begin by using half of the sauce and sprinkling on a lot of grated cheese After the eggs are in pour on the rest of the sauce cover it with grated cheese and bread crumbs drop in bits of butter and cook until brown in oven or about twelve minutes Tomatoes au Gratin Cover bottom of shallow baking pan with slices of tomato and sprinkle liberally with bread crumbs and grated cheese season with salt pepper and dots of butter add another layer of tomato slices season as before and continue this alternating with cheese until pan is full Add a generous topping of crumbs cheese and butter Bake fifty minutes in moderate oven Onion Soup au Gratin four or five onions sliced four or five tablespoons butter one quart stock or canned consomme one quart bouillon made from dissolving four or five cubes Rounds of toasted French bread one one two cups grated Parmesan cheese Saute onions in butter in a roomy saucepan until light golden and pour the stock over When heated put in a larger casserole add the bouillon season to taste and heat to boiling point Let simmer fifteen minutes and serve in deep well heated soup plates the bottoms covered with rounds of toasted French bread which have been heaped with freshly grated Parmesan and browned under the broiler More cheese is served for guests to sprinkle on as desired At gala parties where wine flows a couple of glasses of champagne are often added to the bouillon In the famed onion soup au gratin at Les Halles in Paris grated Gruyere is used in place of Parmesan They are interchangeable in this recipe AMERICAN CHEESE SOUPS In this era of fine canned soups a quick cheese soup is made by heating cream of tomato soup ready made and adding finely grated Swiss or Parmesan to taste French bread toasted and topped with more cheese and broiled golden makes the best base to pour this over as is done with the French onion soup above The same cheese toasts are the basis of a simple milk cheese soup with heated milk poured over and a seasoning of salt pepper chopped chives or a dash of nutmeg Chicken Cheese Soup Heat together one cup milk one cup water in which two chicken bouillon cubes have been dissolved and one can of condensed cream of chicken soup Stir in one four cup grated American Cheddar cheese and season with salt pepper and plenty of paprika until cheese melts Other popular American recipes simply add grated cheese to lima bean or split bean soup peanut butter soup or plain cheese soup with rice Imported French marmites are de rigueur for a real onion soup au gratin and an imported Parmesan grinder might be used for freshly ground cheese In preparing it is well to remember that they are basically only melted cheese melted from the top down CHEESE SALADS When a Frenchman reaches the salad he is resting and in no hurry He eats the salad to prepare himself for the cheese Henri Charpentier Life la Henri Green Cheese Salad Julienne Take endive water cress and as many different kinds of crisp

from the Swiss Tyrol to thrill the writers and artists colony of Ridgefield New Jersey in her brother Emil s White House Inn First Rosie cut a thick slice of prime imported Emmentaler into half inch cubes Then she mixed imported French olive oil German mustard and Swiss white wine vinegar with salt and freshly ground pepper in a deep soup plate sprinkled on a few drops of pepper sauce scattered in the chunks of Schweizer and stirred the cubes with a light hand using a wooden fork and spoon to prevent bruising The salad was ready to eat only when each and every tiny shiny cell of the Swiss from the homeland had been washed oiled and polished with the soothing mixture Drink down the juice too when you have finished mine Breakfast Cheese Salad Rosie advised the customers It is the best cure in the world for the worst hangover Gorgonzola and Banana Salad Slice bananas lengthwise as for a banana split Sprinkle with lemon juice and spread with creamy Gorgonzola Sluice with French

radishes Apple and Cheese Salad one two cup cream cheese one cup chopped pecans Salt and pepper Apples sliced one two inch thick Lettuce leaves Creamy salad dressing Make tiny seasoned cheese balls center on the apple slices standing on lettuce leaves and sluice with creamy salad dressing Roquefort Cheese Salad Dressing No cheese sauce is easier to make than the American favorite of Roquefort cheese mashed with a fork and mixed with French dressing It is often made in a pint Mason jar and kept in the refrigerator to shake up on occasion and toss over lettuce or other salads Unfortunately even when the Roquefort is the French import complete with the picture of the sheep in red and garanti veritable the dressing is often ruined by bad vinegar and cottonseed oil of all things When bottled to sell in stores all sorts of extraneous spice oils and mustard flour are used where nothing more is necessary than the manipulation of a fork fine olive oil and good vinegar white wine tarragon or malt Some ardent amateurs must have their splash of Worcestershire sauce or lemon juice with salt and pepper This Roquefort dressing is good on all green salads but on endive it s something special SAUCE MORNAY Sauce Mornay has been hailed internationally as the greatest culinary achievement in cheese Nothing is simpler to make All you do is prepare a white sauce the French Sauce Bechamel and add grated Parmesan to your liking stirring it in until melted and the sauce is creamy This can be snapped up with cayenne or minced parsley and when used with fish a little of the cooking broth is added PLAIN CHEESE SAUCE one part of any grated cheese to four parts of white sauce This is a mild sauce that is nice with creamed or hard cooked eggs When the cheese content is doubled two parts of cheese to four of white sauce it is delicious on boiled cauliflower baked potatoes macaroni and crackers soaked in milk The sauce may be made richer by mixing melted butter with the flour in making the white sauce or by beating egg yolk in with the cheese From thin to medium to thick it serves divers purposes Thin it may be used instead of milk to make a tasty milk toast sometimes spiced with curry Medium for baking by pouring over crackers soaked in milk Thick serves as a sort of Welsh Rabbit when poured generously over bread toasted on one side only with the untoasted side up to let the sauce sink in PARSLEYED CHEESE SAUCE This makes a mild pleasantly pungent sauce to enliven the cabbage family hot cauliflower broccoli cabbage and Brussels sprouts

taste Bake for several minutes until crisp Supa Shetgia B Footnote B from Cheese Cookery by Helmut Ripperger This is the famous cheese soup of the Engadine and little known in this country One of its seasonings is nutmeg and until one has used it in cheese dishes it is hard to describe how perfectly it gives that extra something The recipe as given is for each plate but there is no reason why the old fashioned tureen could not be used and the quantities simply increased Put a slice of stale French bread toasted or not into a soup plate and cover it with four tablespoons of grated or shredded Swiss cheese Place another slice of bread on top of this and pour over it some boiling milk Cover the plate and let it stand for several minutes Season with salt pepper and nutmeg Serve topped with browned hot butter Use whole nutmeg and grate it freshly WITH A CHEESE SHAKER ON THE TABLE Italians are so dependent on cheese to enrich all their dishes from soups to spaghetti and indeed any vegetable that a shaker of grated Parmesan Romano or reasonable substitute stands ready at every table or is served freshly grated on a side dish Thus any Italian soup might be called a cheese soup but we know of only one the great minestrone in which cheese is listed as an indispensable ingredient along with the pasta peas onion tomatoes kidney beans celery olive oil garlic oregano potatoes carrots and so forth Likewise a chunk of melting or toasting cheese is essential in the Fritto Misto the finest mixed grill we know and it s served up as a separate tidbit with the meats Italians grate on more cheese for seasoning than any other people as the French are wont to use more wine in cooking Pfeffernuesse and Caraway The gingery little pepper nuts pfeffernuesse imported from Germany in barrels at Christmastime make one of the best accompaniments to almost any kind of cheese For contrast try a dish of caraway Diablotins Small rounds of buttered bread or toast heaped with a mound of grated cheese and browned in the oven is a French contribution CHEESE OMELETS Cheddar Omelet Make a plain omelet your own way When the mixture has just begun to cook dust over it evenly one two cup grated Cheddar a Use young Cheddar if you want a mild bland omelet b Use sharp aged Cheddar for a full flavored one c Sprinkle b with Worcestershire sauce to make what might be called a Wild Omelet Cook as usual Fold and serve Parmesan Omelet mild Cook as above but use one four cup only of Parmesan grated fine in place of the one two cup Cheddar Parmesan Omelet full flavored As above but use one two cup Parmesan finely grated as follows Sift one four cup of the Parmesan into your egg mixture at the beginning and dust on the second one four cup evenly just as the omelet begins to set A Meal in One Omelet Fry one two dozen bacon slices crisp and keep hot while frying a cup of diced boiled potatoes in the bacon fat to equal crispness Meanwhile make your omelet mixture of three eggs beaten and one one two tablespoons of shredded Emmentaler or domestic Swiss with one tablespoon of chopped chives and salt and pepper to taste Tomato and Make plain omelet cover with thin rounds of fresh tomato and dust well with any grated cheese you like Put under broiler until cheese melts to a golden brown Omelet with Cheese Sauce Make a plain French fluffy or puffy omelet and when finished cover with a hot seasoned reinforced white sauce in which one four pound of shredded cheese has been melted and mixed well with one two cup cooked diced celery and one tablespoon of pimiento minced The French use grated Gruyere for this with all sorts of sauces such as the Savoyar de Savoie with potatoes chervil tarragon and cream A delicious appearance and added flavor can be had by browning with a salamander Spanish Flan Quesillo FOR THE CARAMEL one two cup sugar four tablespoons water FOR THE FLAN four eggs beaten separately two cups hot milk one two cup sugar Salt Brown sugar and mix with water to make the caramel Pour it into a baking mold Make Flan by mixing together all the ingredients Add to carameled mold and bake in pan of water in moderate oven about three four hour Italian Fritto Misto The

steadily thirty minutes lowering the heat so the pockets won t burst open Drain and serve on a piping hot platter with melted butter and a sprinkling of bread crumbs This is a cross between ravioli and blintzes Cheesed Mashed Potatoes Whip into a steaming hot dish of creamily mashed potatoes some old Cheddar with melted butter and a crumbling of crisp cooked bacon If there s a chafing dish handy a first rate nightcap can be made via a Sauteed Swiss Sandwich Tuck a slice of Swiss cheese between two pieces of thickly buttered bread trim crusts cut sandwich in two surround it with one well beaten egg slide it into sizzling butter and fry on both sides A chef at the New York Athletic Club once improved on this by first sandwiching the Swiss between a slice of ham and a slice of chicken breast then beating up a brace of eggs with a jigger of heavy sweet cream and soaking his sandwich in this until it sopped up every drop A final frying in sweet butter made strong men cry for it Illustration Chapter Ten Appetizers Crackers Sandwiches Savories Snacks Spreads and Toasts In America cheese got its start in country stores in our cracker barrel days when every man felt free to saunter in pick up the cheese knife and cut himself a wedge from the big bellied rattrap cheese standing under its glass bell or wire mesh hood that kept the flies off but not the free lunchers Cheese by itself being none too palatable the taster would saunter over to the cracker barrel shoo the cat off and help himself to the old time crackers that can t be beat today At that time Wisconsin still belonged to the Indians and Vermont was our leading cheese state with its Sage and Cheddar and Vermont Country Store Crackers as Vrest Orton of Weston Vermont calls them When Orton heard we were writing this book he sent samples from the store his father started in eighteen ninety seven which is still going strong Together with the Vermont Good Old fashioned Natural Cheese and the Sage came a handy handmade Cracker Basket all wicker ten crackers long and just one double cracker wide A snug little casket for those puffy old time two in one soda biscuits that have no salt to spoil the taste of the accompanying cheese Each does double duty because it s made to split in the middle so you can try one kind of cheese on one half and another on t other or sandwich them between Some Pied Piper took the country cheese and crackers to the corner saloon and led a free lunch procession that never faltered till Prohibition came The same old store cheese was soon pepped up as saloon cheese with a saucer of caraway seeds bowls of pickles peppers pickled peppers and rye bread with plenty of mustard pretzels or cheese straws smearcase and schwarzbrot Beer and cheese forever together as in the free lunch ditty of that great day I am an Irish hunter I am I ain t I do not hunt for deer But beer Oh Otto wring the bar rag I do not hunt for fleas But cheese Oh Adolph bring the free lunch It was there and then that cheese came of age from coast to coast In every bar there was a choice of Swiss Cottage Limburger manly cheeses walkie talkie oldsters that could sit up and beg golden yellow tangy mellow always cut in cubes Cheese takes the cube form as naturally as eggs take the oval and honeycombs the hexagon On the more elegant handout buffets besides the shapely cubes free Welsh Rabbit started at four every afternoon to lead the tired businessman in by the nose or a smear of Canadian Snappy out of a pure white porcelain pot in the classy places on a Bent s water biscuit SANDWICHES AND SAVORY SNACKS Next to nibbling cheese with crackers and appetizers of which there is no end in sight cheese sandwiches help us consume most of our country s enormous output of Brick Cheddar and Swiss To attempt to classify and describe all of these would be impossible so we will content ourselves by picking a few of the cold and hot the plain and the fancy the familiar and the exotic Let s use the alphabet to sum up the situation A Alpine Club Sandwich Spread toasts with mayonnaise and fill with a thick slice of imported Emmentaler well mustarded and seasoned and the usual club sandwich toppings of thin slices of chicken or turkey tomato bacon and a lettuce leaf B Boston Beany Open face Lightly butter a slice of Boston brown bread cover it generously with hot baked beans and a thick layer of shredded Cheddar Top with bacon and put under a slow broiler until cheese melts and the bacon crisps C Cheeseburgers Pat out some small seasoned hamburgers exceedingly thin and using them instead of slices of bread sandwich in a nice slice of American Cheddar well covered with mustard Crimp edges of the hamburgers all around to hold in the cheese when it melts and begins to run Toast under a brisk boiler and serve on soft toasted sandwich buns D Deviled Rye Butter flat Swedish rye bread and heat quickly in hot oven Cool until crisp again Then spread thickly with cream cheese bedeviled with catsup paprika or pimiento E Egg Open faced Saute minced small onion and small green pepper in two tablespoons of butter and make a sauce by cooking with a cup of canned tomatoes Season and reduce to about half Fry four eggs and put one in the center of each of four pieces of hot toast spread with the red sauce Sprinkle each generously with grated Cheddar broil until melted and serve with crisp bacon F French fried Swiss Simply make a sandwich with a noble slice of imported Gruyere soak it in beaten egg and milk and fry slowly till cheese melts and the sandwich is nicely browned This is a specialty of Franche Comte G Grilled Chicken Ham Cheddar Cut crusts from two slices of white bread and butter them on both sides Make a sandwich of these with one slice cooked chicken one two slice sharp Cheddar cheese and a sprinkling of minced ham Fasten tight with toothpicks cut in half and dip thoroughly in a mixture of egg and milk Grill golden on both sides and serve with lengthwise slices of dill pickle H He man Sandwich Open faced Butter a thick slice of dark rye bread cover with a layer of mashed cold baked beans and a slice of ham then one of Swiss cheese and a wheel of Bermuda onion topped with mustard and a sowing of capers I International Sandwich Split English muffins and toast on the hard outsides cover soft untoasted insides with Swiss cheese spread lightly with mustard top that with a wheel of Bermuda onion and one or two slices of Italian type tomato Season with cayenne and salt dot with butter cover with Brazil nuts and brown under the broiler J Jurassiennes or Croutes Comtoises Soak slices of stale buns in milk cover with a mixture of onion browned in chopped lean bacon and mixed with grated Gruyere Simmer until cheese melts and serve K Kuemmelkaese If you like caraway flavor this is your sandwich On well buttered but lightly mustarded rye lay a thickish slab of Milwaukee Kuemmelkaese which translates caraway cheese For good measure sprinkle caraway seeds on top or serve them in a saucer on the side Then dash on a splash of kuemmel the caraway liqueur that s best when imported L Limburger Onion or Limburger Catsup Marinate slices of Bermuda onion in a peppery French dressing for one two hour Then butter slices of rye spread well with soft Limburger top with onion and you will have something super duper if you like Limburger When catsup is substituted for marinated onion the sandwich has quite another character and flavor so true Limburger addicts make one of each and take alternate bites for the thrill of contrast M Meringue Open faced from the Browns ten thousand Snacks Allow one egg and four tablespoons of grated cheese to one slice of bread Toast bread on one side only spread butter on untoasted side put two tablespoons grated cheese over butter and the yolk of an egg in the center Beat egg white stiff with a few grains of salt and pile lightly on top Sprinkle the other two tablespoons of grated cheese over that and bake in moderate oven until the egg white is firm and the cheese has melted to a golden brown N Neufchatel and Honey We know no sandwich more ethereal than one made with thin decrusted white bread spread with sweet butter then with Neufchatel topped with some fine honey Mount Hymettus if possible Any creamy Petit Suisse will do as well as the Neufchatel but nothing will take the place of the honey to make this heavenly sandwich that must have been the original ambrosia O Oskar s Ham Cam Oskar Davidsen of Copenhagen whose five foot menu lists one hundred eighty six superb sandwiches and snacks each with a character all its own perfected the Ham Cam base for a flock of fancy ham sandwiches open faced on rye or white soft or crisp sweet or sour almost any one way slice you desire He uses as many contrasting kinds of bread as possible and his butter varies from salt to fresh and whipped The Ham Cam base involves a juicy tender slice of freshly boiled mild cured ham with imported Camembert spread on the ham as thick as velvet The Ham Cam is built up with such splendors as goose liver paste and Madeira wine jelly fried calves kidney and remoulade Bombay curry salad bird s liver and fried egg a slice of red roast beef and more of that red Madeira jelly with anything else you say just so long as it does credit to Camembert on ham P Pickled Camembert Butter a thin slice of rye or pumpernickel and spread with ripe imported Camembert when in season which isn t summer Make a mixture of sweet sour and dill pickles finely chopped and spread it on Top this with a thin slice of white bread for pleasing contrast with the black Q Queijo da Serra Sandwich On generous rounds of French flute or other crunchy crusty white bread place thick portions of any good Portuguese cheese made of sheep s milk in the mountains This last translates back into Queijo da Serra the fattest finest cheese in the world on a par with fine Greek Feta Bead the open faced creamy cheese lightly with imported capers and you ll say it s scrumptious R Roquefort Nut Butter hot toast and cover with a thickish slice of genuine Roquefort cheese Sprinkle thickly with genuine Hungarian paprika Put in moderate oven for about six minutes Finish it off with chopped pine nuts almonds or a mixture thereof S Smoky Sandwich and Sturgeon smoked Sandwich Skin some juicy little jolly little sprats lay on thin rye or a slice of miniature loaf rye studded with caraway spread with sweet butter and cover with a slice of smoked cheese Hickory is preferred for most of the smoking in America In New York the best smoked cheese whether from Canada or nearer home is usually cured in the same room with sturgeon Since this king of smoked fish imparts some of its regal savor to the Cheddar there is a natural affinity peculiarly suited to sandwiching as above Smoked salmon eel whitefish or any other is also good with cheese smoked with hickory or anything with a salubrious savor while a sandwich of smoked turkey with smoked cheese is out of this world We accompany it with a cup of smoky Lapsang Soochong China tea T Tangy Sandwich On buttered rye spread cream cheese and on this bed lay thinly sliced dried beef In place of mustard dot the beef with horseradish and pearl onions or those reliable old chopped chives And by the way if you must use mustard on every cheese sandwich try different kinds for a change sharp English freshly mixed by your own hand out of the tin of powder or Dijon for a French touch U Unusual Sandwich of Flowers Hay and Clover On a sweet buttered slice of French white bread lay a layer of equally sweet English Flower cheese made with petals of rose marigold violet et cetera and top that with French Fromage de foin This French hay cheese gets its name from being ripened on hay and holds its new mown scent Sprinkle on a few imported capers the smaller they are the better with a little of the luscious juice and dust lightly with Sapsago V Vegetarian Sandwich Roll your own of alternate leaves of lettuce slices of store cheese avocados cream cheese sprinkled heavily with chopped chives and anything else in the Vegetable or Caseous Kingdoms that suits your fancy W Witch s Sandwich Butter two slices of sandwich bread cover one with a thin slice of imported Emmentaler dash with cayenne and a drop or two of tabasco Slap on a sizzling hot slice of grilled ham and press it together with the cheese between the two bread slices put in a hot oven and serve piping hot with a handful of moonstones those outsize pearl onions X Xochomilco Sandwich In spite of the milco in Xochomilco there isn t a drop to be had that s native to the festive floating gardens near Mexico City For there instead of the cow a sort of century plant gives milky white pulque the fermented juice of this cactuslike desert plant With this goes a vegetable cheese curded by its own vegetable rennet It s called tuna cheese made from the milky juice of the prickly pear that grows on yet another cactuslike plant of the dry lands This tuna cheese sometimes teams up in arid lands with the juicy thick cactus leaf sliced into a tortilla sandwich The milky pulque of Xochomilco goes as well with it as beer with a Swiss cheese sandwich Y Yolk Picnic Sandwich Hard cooked egg yolk worked into a yellow paste with cream cheese mustard olive oil lemon juice celery salt and a touch of tabasco spread on thick slices of whole wheat bread Z Zebra Take a tip from Oskar over in Copenhagen and design your own Zebra sandwich as decoratively as one of those oft photoed skins in El Morocco Just alternate stripes of black bread with various white cheeses in between to follow the black and white zebra pattern For good measure we will toss in a couple of toasted cheese sandwiches Toasted Cheese Sandwich Butter both sides of two thick slices of white bread and sandwich between them a seasoned mixture of shredded sharp cheese egg yolk mustard and chopped chives together with stiffly beaten egg white folded in last to make a light filling Fry the buttered sandwich in more butter until well melted and nicely gilded This toasted cheeser is so good it s positively sinful The French who outdo us in both cooking and sin make one of their own in the form of fried fingers of stale bread doused in an arf and arf Welsh Rabbit and Fondue melting of Gruyere that serves as a liaison to further sandwich the two Garlic is often used in place of chopped chives and in contrast to this wild one there s a mild one made of Dutch cream cheese by the equally Dutch Pennsylvanians England of course together with Wales holds all time honors with such celebrated regional toasting cheeses as Devonshire and Dunlop Even British Newfoundland is known for its simple version that s quite as pleasing as its rich Prince Edward Island Oyster Stew Newfoundland Toasted Cheese Sandwich one pound grated Cheddar one egg well beaten one two cup milk one tablespoon butter Heat together and pour over well buttered toast Illustration Chapter Eleven Fit for Drink

less than vintage wines as is the case with Stilton Illustration Chapter Twelve Lazy Lou Once so goes the sad story there was a cheesemonger unworthy of his heritage He exported a shipload of inferior Swiss made somewhere in the U S A Bad to begin with it had worsened on the voyage Rejected by the health authorities on the other side it was shipped back reaching home in the unhappy condition known as cracked To cut his losses the rascally cheesemonger had his cargo ground up and its flavor disguised with hot peppers and chili sauce Thus there came into being the abortion known as the cheese spread The cheese spread or food and its cousin the processed cheese are handy cheap and nasty They are available everywhere and some people even like them So any cheese book is bound to take formal notice of their existence I have done so and now an unfond farewell to them My academic cheese education began at the University of Wisconsin in nineteen oh four I grew up with our great Midwest industry I have read with profit hundreds of pamphlets put out by the learned Aggies of my Alma Mater Mostly they treat of honest natural cheeses the making keeping and enjoying of authentic Longhorn

finger and the bottle is before you Gently pull it down and hold your glass to the spout True imported wines and cheeses are expensive But native American products and reasonably edible imitations of the real thing are available as substitutes Anyway protein for protein a cheese party will cost less than a steak barbecue And it can be more fun Encourage your guests to contribute their own latest discoveries One may bring along as his ticket of admission a Primavera from Brazil another some cubes of an Andean specialty just flown in from Colombia s mountain city Merida and still wrapped in its aromatic leaves of Frailejon Lanudo another a few wedges of savory sweet English Flower cheese some flavored with rose petals others with marigolds another a tube of South American Kraeuterkaese Provide your own assortment of breads and try to include some of those fat flaky old fashioned crackers that country stores in New England can still supply Mustard Sure if you like it If you want to

assorted nutmeats Some years ago when I was collaborating with my mother Cora and my wife Rose in writing ten thousand Snacks which by the way devotes nearly forty pages to cheeses we staged a rather elaborate tasting party just for the three of us It took a two tiered Lazy Lou to twirl the load The eight wedges on the top round were English and French samples and the lower one carried the rest as follows ENGLISH CHEDDAR CHESHIRE ENGLISH STILTON CANADIAN CHEDDAR rum flavored FRENCH MUeNSTER FRENCH BRIE FRENCH FRENCH CAMEMBERT ROQUEFORT SWISS SAPSAGO SWISS GRUYERE SWISS EDAM DUTCH GOUDA ITALIAN CZECH ITALIAN NORWEGIAN PROVOLONE OSTIEPKI GORGONZOLA GJETOST HUNGARIAN LIPTAUER The tasting began with familiar English Cheddars Cheshires and Stiltons from the top row We had cheese knives scoops graters scrapers and a regulation wire saw but for this line of crumbly Britishers fingers were best The Cheddar was a light lemony yellow almost white like our best domestic bar cheese of old The Cheshire was moldy and milky with a slightly fermented flavor that brought up the musty dining room of Fleet Street s Cheshire cheese and called for draughts of beer The Stilton was strong but mellow as high in flavor as in price Only the rum flavored Canadian Cheddar from Montreal by courtesy English let us down It was done up as fancy as a bridegroom in waxed white paper and looked as smooth and glossy as a gardenia But there its beauty ended Either the rum that flavored it wasn t up to much or the mixture hadn t been allowed to ripen naturally The French Muenster however was hearty cheery and better made than most German Muenster which at that time wasn t being exported much by the Nazis The Brie was melting prime the Camembert was so perfectly matured we ate every scrap of the crust which can t be done with many American Camemberts or indeed with the dead dry French ones sold out of season Then came the Roquefort a regal cheese we voted the best buy of the lot even though it was the most expensive A plump piece pleasantly unctuous but not greasy sharp in scent stimulatingly bittersweet in taste unbeatable There is no American pretender to the Roquefort throne Ours is invariably chalky and tasteless That doesn t mean we have no good Blues We have But they are not Roquefort The Sapsago or Kraeuterkaese from Switzerland it has been made in the Canton of Glarus for over five hundred years was the least expensive of the lot Well cured and dry it lent itself to grating and tasted fine on an old fashioned buttered soda cracker Sapsago has its own seduction derived from the clover leaf powder with which the curd is mixed and which gives it its haunting flavor and spring like sage green color Next came some truly great Swiss Gruyere delicately rich and nutty enough to make us think of the sharp white wines to be drunk with it at the source As for the Provolone notable for the water buffalo milk that makes it there s an example of really grown up milk Perfumed as spring flowers drenched with a shower of Anjou having a bouquet all its own and a trace of a winelike kick it made us vow never to taste another American imitation Only a smooth cheeked thick slab cut from a pedigreed Italian Provolone of medium girth all in one piece and with no sign of a crack satisfy the gourmet The second Italian classic was Gorgonzola gorgeous Gorgonzola as fruity as apples peaches and pears sliced together It smells so much like a ripe banana we often eat them together plain or with the crumbly formaggio lightly forked into the fruit split lengthwise After that the Edam tasted too lipsticky like the red paint job on its rind and the Gouda seemed only half hearted Both too obviously ready made for commerce with nothing individual or custom made about them rolled or bounced over from Holland by the boat load The Ostiepki from Czechoslovakia might have been a link of smoked ostrich sausage put up in the skin of its own red neck In spite of its pleasing lemon yellow interior we couldn t think of any use for it except maybe crumbling thirty or forty cents worth into a ten cent bowl of bean soup But that seemed like a waste of money so we set it aside to try in tiny chunks on crackers as an appetizer some other day when it might be more appetizing We felt much the same about the chocolate brown Norwegian Gjetost that looked like a slab of boarding school fudge and which had the same cloying cling to the tongue We were told by a native that our piece was entirely too young That s what made it so insipid undeveloped in texture and flavor But the next piece we got turned out to be too old and decrepit and so strong it would have taken a Paul Bunyan to stand up under it When we complained to our expert about the shock to our palates he only laughed pointing to the nail on his little finger You should take just a little bit like that A pill no bigger than a couple of aspirins or an Alka Seltzer It s only in the morning you take it when it s old and strong like this for a pick me up a cure for a hangover you know like a prairie oyster well soused in Worcestershire That made us think we might use it up to flavor a Welsh Rabbit instead of the Worcestershire sauce but we couldn t melt it with anything less than a blowtorch To bring the party to a happy end we went to town on the Hungarian Liptauer garnishing that fine granulating buttery base after mixing it well with some cream cheese We mixed the mixed cheese with sardine and tuna mashed together in a little of the oil from the can We juiced it with lemon sluiced it with bottled sauces worked in the leftovers some tarragon mint spicy seeds parsley capers and chives We peppered and paprikaed it salted and spiced it then spread it thicker than butter on pumpernickel and went to it That s Liptauer Garniert Illustration No four Cheese Inc Appendix The A B Z of Cheese Each cheese is listed by its name and country of origin with any further information

cheese of Alemtejo in the same way that so many French cheeses carry along the fromage title Soft sheep and sometimes goat or cow in cylinders of three sizes weighing respectively about two ounces one pound and four pounds The smaller sizes are the ones most often made with mixed goat and sheep milk The method of curdling without the usual animal rennet is interesting and unusual The milk is warmed and curdled with vegetable rennet made from the flowers of a local thistle or cardoon which is used in two other Portuguese cheeses Queijo da Cardiga and Queijo da Serra da Estrella and probably in many others not known beyond their locale In France la Caillebotte is distinguished for being clabbered with chardonnette wild artichoke seed In Portugal where there isn t so much separating of the sheep from the goats it takes several weeks for Alemtejos to ripen depending on the lactic content and difference in sizes Alfalfa see Sage Alise Saint Reine France Soft summer made Allgaeuer Bergkaese Allgaeuer Rundkaese or Allgaeuer Emmentaler Bavaria Hard Emmentaler type The small district of Allgaeu names a mountain of cheeses almost as fabulous as our Rock candy Mountain There are two principal kinds vintage Allgaeuer Bergkaese and soft Allgaeuer Rahmkaese described below This celebrated cheese section runs through rich pasture lands right down and into the Swiss Valley of the Emme that gives the name Emmentaler to one of the world s greatest So it is no wonder that Allgaeuer Bergkaese can compete with the best Swiss Before the Russian revolution in fact all vintage cheeses of Allgaeu were bought up by wealthy Russian noblemen and kept in their home caves in separate compartments for each year as far back as the early nineteen hundred s As with fine vintage wines the price of the great years went up steadily Such cheeses were shipped to their Russian owners only when the chief cheese pluggers of Allgaeu found they had reached their prime Allgaeuer Rahmkaese Bavaria Full cream similar to Romadur and Limburger but milder than both This sets a high grade for similar cheeses made in the Bavarian mountains in monasteries such as Andechs It goes exquisitely with the rich dark Bavarian beer Some of it is as slippery as the stronger smellier Bierkaese or the old time Slipcote of England Like so many North Europeans it is often flavored with caraway Although entirely different from its big brother vintage Bergkaese Rahmkaese can stand proudly at its side as one of the finest cheeses in Germany Alpe see Fiore di Alpe Al Pepe Italy Hard and peppery like its name

in Chicago he was graduated from Oak Park High School and entered the University of Wisconsin at the exact moment when a number of imported Swiss professors in this great dairy state began teaching their students how to hole an Emmentaler After majoring in beer and free lunch from Milwaukee to Munich Bob celebrated the end of Prohibition with a book called Let There Be Beer and then decided to write another about Beer s best friend Cheese But first he collaborated with his mother Cora and wife Rose on The Wine Cookbook still in print after nearly twenty five years This first manual on the subject in America paced a baker s dozen food and drink books including America Cooks ten thousand Snacks Fish and Seafood and The South American Cookbook For ten years he published his own weekly magazines in Rio de Janeiro Mexico City and London In the decade before that from nineteen oh seven to nineteen seventeen he wrote more than a thousand short stories and serials under his full name Robert Carlton Brown One of his first books What Happened to Mary became a best seller and was the first five reel movie This put him in Who s Who in his early twenties In nineteen twenty eight he retired to write and travel After a couple of years spent in collecting books and bibelots throughout the Orient he settled down in Paris with the expatriate group of Americans and invented the Reading Machine for their delectation Nancy Cunard published his Words and Harry Crosby printed fourteen fifty nineteen fifty at the Black Sun Press while in Cagnes sur Mer Bob had his own imprint Roving Eye Press that turned out Demonics Gems a Censored Anthology Globe gliding and Readies for Bob Brown s Machine with contributions by Gertrude Stein Ezra Pound Kay Boyle James T Farrell et al The depression drove him back to New York but a decade later he returned to Brazil that had long been his home away from home There he wrote The Amazing Amazon with his wife Rose making a total of thirty books bearing his name After the death of his wife and mother Bob Brown closed their mountain home in Petropolis Brazil and returned to New York where he remarried and now lives in the
