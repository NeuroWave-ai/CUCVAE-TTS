beginning of this affair which involved me before I was aware of it in as much villainy and wickedness as ever man heard of was of course that spring evening now ten years ago whereon I looked out of my mother s front parlour window in the main street of Berwick upon Tweed and saw standing right before the house a man who had a black patch over his left eye an old plaid thrown loosely round his shoulders and in his right hand a stout stick and an old fashioned carpet bag He caught sight of me as I caught sight of him and he stirred and made at once for our door If I had possessed the power of seeing more than the obvious I should have seen robbery and murder and the very devil himself coming in close attendance upon him as he crossed the pavement But as it was I saw nothing but a stranger and I threw open the window and asked the man what he might be wanting Lodgings he answered jerking a thickly made thumb at a paper which my mother had that day set in the transom above the door Lodgings You ve lodgings to let for a single gentleman I m a single gentleman and I want lodgings For a month maybe more Money no object Thorough respectability on my part Few needs and modest requirements Not likely to give trouble Open the door I went into the passage and opened the door to him He strode in without as much as a word and not waiting for my invitation lurched heavily he was a big heavy moving fellow into the parlour where he set down his bag his plaid and his stick and dropping into an easy chair gave a sort of groan as he looked at me And what s your name he demanded as if he had all the right in the world to walk into folks houses and ask his questions Whatever it is you re a likely looking youngster My name s Hugh Moneylaws I answered thinking it no harm to humour him If you want to know about lodgings you must wait till my mother comes in Just now she s away up the street she ll be back presently No hurry my lad he replied None whatever This is a comfortable anchorage Quiet Your mother ll be a widow woman now Yes said I shortly Any more of you brothers and sisters he asked Any aye of course any young children in the house Because young children is what I cannot abide except at a distance There s nobody but me and my mother and a servant lass I said This is a quiet enough house if that s what you mean Quiet is the word said he Nice quiet respectable lodgings In this town of Berwick For a month If not more As I say a comfortable anchorage And time too when you ve seen as many queer places as I have in my day young fellow you ll know that peace and quiet is meat and drink to an ageing man It struck me as I looked at him that he was just the sort of man that you would expect to hear of as having been in queer places a sort of gnarled and stubbly man with a wealth of seams and wrinkles about his face and what could be seen of his neck and much grizzled hair and an eye only one being visible that looked as if it had been on the watch ever since he was born He was a fellow of evident great strength and stout muscle and his hands which he had clasped in front of him as he sat talking to me were big enough to go round another man s throat or to fell a bullock And as for the rest of his appearance he had gold rings in his ears and he wore a great heavy gold chain across his waistcoat and was dressed in a new suit of blue serge somewhat large for him that he had evidently purchased at a ready made clothing shop not so long before My mother came quietly in upon us before I could reply to the stranger s last remark and I saw at once that he was a man of some politeness and manners for he got himself up out of his chair and made her a sort of bow in an old fashioned way And without waiting for me he let his tongue loose on her Servant ma am said he You ll be the lady of the house missus Moneylaws I m seeking lodgings missus Moneylaws and seeing your paper at the door light and your son s face at the window I came in Nice quiet lodgings for a few weeks is what I m wanting a bit of plain cooking no fal lals And as for money no object Charge me what you like and I ll pay beforehand any hand whatever s convenient My mother a shrewd little woman who had had a good deal to do since my father died smiled at the corners of her mouth as she looked the would be lodger up and down Why sir said she I like to know who I m taking in You re a stranger in the place I m thinking Fifty years since I last clapped eyes on it ma am he answered And I was then a youngster of no more than twelve years or so But as to who and what I am name of James Gilverthwaite Late master of as good a ship as ever a man sailed A quiet respectable man No swearer No drinker saving in reason and sobriety And as I say money no object and cash down whenever it s wanted Look here He plunged one of the big hands into a trousers pocket and pulled it out again running over with gold And opening his fingers he extended the gold laden palm towards us We were poor folk at that time and it was a strange sight to us all that money lying in the man s hand and he apparently thinking no more of it than if it had been a heap of six penny pieces Help yourself to whatever ll pay you for a month he exclaimed And don t be afraid there s a lot more where that came from But my mother laughed and motioned him to put up his money Nay nay sir said she There s no need And all I m asking at you is just to know who it is I m taking in You ll be having business in the town for a while Not business in the ordinary sense ma am he answered But there s kin of mine lying in more than one graveyard just by and it s a fancy of my own to take a look at their resting places d ye see and to wander round the old quarters where they lived And while I m doing that it s a quiet and respectable and a comfortable lodging I m wanting I could see that the sentiment in his speech touched my mother who was fond of visiting graveyards herself and she turned to mister James Gilverthwaite with a nod of acquiescence Well now what might you be wanting in the way of accommodation she asked and she began to tell him that he could have that parlour in which they were talking and the bedchamber immediately above it I left them arranging their affairs and went into another room to attend to some of my own and after a while my mother came there to me I ve let him the rooms Hugh she said with a note of satisfaction in her voice which told me that the big man was going to pay well for them He s a great bear of a man to look at she went on but he seems quiet and civil spoken And here s a ticket for a chest of his that he s left up at the railway station and as he s tired maybe you ll get somebody yourself to fetch it down for him I went out to a man who lived close by and had a light cart and sent him up to the station with the ticket for the chest he was back with it before long and I had to help him carry it up to mister Gilverthwaite s room And never had I felt or seen a chest like that before nor had the man who had fetched it either It was made of some very hard and dark wood and clamped at all the corners with brass and underneath it there were a couple of bars of iron and though it was no more than two and a half feet square it took us all our time to lift it And when under mister Gilverthwaite s orders we set it down on a stout stand at the side of his bed there it remained until but to say until when would be anticipating Now that he was established in our house the new lodger proved himself all that he had said He was a quiet respectable sober sort of man giving no trouble and paying down his money without question or murmur every Saturday morning at his breakfast time All his days were passed in pretty much the same fashion After breakfast he would go out you might see him on the pier or on the old town walls or taking a walk across the Border Bridge now and then we heard of his longer excursions into the country one side or other of the Tweed He took his dinner in the evenings having made a special arrangement with my mother to that effect and a very hearty eater he was and fond of good things which he provided generously for himself and when that episode of the day s events was over he would spend an hour or two over the newspapers of which he was a great reader in company with his cigar and his glass And I ll say for him that from first to last he never put anything out and was always civil and polite and there was never a Saturday that he did not give the servant maid a half crown to buy herself a present All the same we said it to ourselves afterwards though not at the time there was an atmosphere of mystery about mister Gilverthwaite He made no acquaintance in the town He was never seen in even brief conversation with any of the men that hung about the pier on the walls or by the shipping He never visited the inns nor brought anybody in to drink and smoke with him And until the last days of his lodging with us he never received a letter A letter and the end of things came all at once His stay had lengthened beyond the month he had first spoken of It was in the seventh week of his coming that he came home to his dinner one June evening complaining to my mother of having got a great wetting in a sudden storm that had come on that afternoon while he was away out in the country and next morning he was in bed with a bad pain in his chest and not over well able to talk My mother kept him in his bed and began to doctor him that day about noon came for him the first and only letter he ever had while he was with us a letter that came in a registered envelope The servant maid took it up to him when it was delivered and she said later that he started a bit when he saw it But he said nothing about it to my mother during that afternoon nor indeed to me specifically when later on he sent for me to go up to his room All the same having heard of what he had got I felt sure that it was because of it that when I went in to him he beckoned me first to close the door on us and then to come close to his side as he lay propped on his pillow Private my lad he whispered hoarsely There s a word I have for you in private CHAPTER II THE MIDNIGHT MISSION Before he said a word more I knew that mister Gilverthwaite was very ill much worse I fancied than my mother had any notion of It was evidently hard work for him to get his breath and the veins in his temples and forehead swelled out big and black with the effort of talking He motioned to me to hand him a bottle of some stuff which he had sent for from the chemist and he took a swig of its contents from the bottle neck before he spoke again Then he pointed to a chair at the bed head close to his pillow My lungs he said a bit more easily Mortal bad Queer thing a great man like me but I was always delicate in that way ever since I was a nipper strong as a bull in all else But this word is private Look here you re a lawyer s clerk He had known that of course for some time known that I was clerk to a solicitor of the town and hoping to get my articles and in due course become a solicitor myself So there was no need for me to do more than nod in silence And being so he went on you ll be a good hand at keeping a secret very well Can you keep one for me now He had put out one of his big hands as he spoke and had gripped my wrist with it ill as he was the grip of his fingers was like steel and yet I could see that he had no idea that he was doing more than laying his hand on me with the appeal of a sick man It depends what it is mister Gilverthwaite I answered I should like to do anything I can for you You wouldn t do it for nothing he put in sharply I ll make it well worth your while See here He took his hand away from my wrist put it under his pillow and drew out a bank note which he unfolded before me Ten pound he said It s yours if you ll do a bit of a job for me in private Ten pound ll be useful to you What do you say now That it depends on what it is said I I d be as glad of ten pounds as anybody but I must know first what I m expected to do for it It s an easy enough thing to do he replied Only it s got to be done this very night and I m laid here and can t do it You can do it without danger and at little trouble only it must be done private You want me to do something that nobody s to know about I asked Precisely said he Nobody Not even your mother for even the best of women have tongues I hesitated a little something warned me that there was more in all this than I saw or understood at the moment I ll promise this mister Gilverthwaite I said presently If you ll tell me now what it is you want I ll keep that a dead secret from anybody for ever Whether I ll do it or not ll depend on the nature of your communication Well spoken lad he answered with a feeble laugh You ve the makings of a good lawyer anyway Well now it s this do you know this neighbourhood well I ve never known any other said I Do you know where Till meets Tweed he asked As well as I know my own mother s door I answered You know where that old what do they call it chapel cell something of that nature is he asked again Aye well enough mister Gilverthwaite I answered him Ever since I was in breeches Well said he if I was my own man I ought to meet another man near there this very night And here I am You want me to meet this other man I asked I m offering you ten pound if you will he answered with a quick look Aye that is what I m wanting To do what I inquired Simple enough he said Nothing to do but to meet him to give him a word that ll establish what they term your bony fides and a message from me that I ll have you learn by heart before you go No more There s no danger in it I asked Not a spice of danger he asserted Not half as much as you d find in serving a writ You seem inclined to pay very handsomely for it all the same I remarked still feeling a bit suspicious And for a simple reason he retorted I must have some one to do the job aye if it costs twenty pound Somebody must meet this friend o mine and tonight and why shouldn t you have ten pound as well as another There s nothing to do but what you say I asked Nothing not a thing he affirmed And the time I said And the word for surety Eleven o clock is the time he answered Eleven an hour before midnight And as for the word get you to the place and wait about a bit and if you see nobody there say out loud From James Gilverthwaite as is sick and can t come himself and when the man appears as he will say aye say Panama my lad and he ll understand in a jiffy Eleven o clock Panama said I And the message Aye he answered the message Just this then James Gilverthwaite is laid by for a day or two and you ll bide quiet in the place you know of till you hear from him That s all And how will you get out there now it s a goodish way I have a bicycle I answered and at his question a thought struck me How did you intend to get out there yourself mister Gilverthwaite I asked That far and at that time of night Aye he said Just so but I d ha done it easy enough my lad if I hadn t been laid here I d ha gone out by the last train to the nighest station and it being summer I d ha shifted for myself somehow during the rest of the night I m used to night work But that s neither here nor there You ll go And private I ll go and privately I answered him Make yourself easy And not a word to your mother he asked anxiously Just so I replied Leave it to me He looked vastly relieved at that and after assuring him that I had the message by heart I left his chamber and went downstairs After all it was no great task that he had put on me I had often stayed until very late at the office where I had the privilege of reading law books at nights and it was an easy business to mention to my mother that I wouldn t be in that night so very early That part of my contract with the sick man upstairs I could keep well enough in letter and spirit all the same I was not going out along Tweed side at that hour of the night without some safeguard and though I would tell no one of what my business for mister Gilverthwaite precisely amounted to I would tell one person where it would take me in case anything untoward happened and I had to be looked for That person was the proper one for a lad to go to under the circumstances my sweetheart Maisie Dunlop And here I ll take you into confidence and say that at that time Maisie and I had been sweethearting a good two years and were as certain of each other as if the two had been twelve I doubt if there was such another old fashioned couple as we were anywhere else in the British Islands for already we were as much bound up in each other as if we had been married half a lifetime and there was not an affair of mine that I did not tell her of nor had she a secret that she did not share with me But then to be sure we had been neighbours all our lives for her father Andrew Dunlop kept a grocer s shop not fifty yards from our house and she and I had been playmates ever since our school days and had fallen to sober and serious love as soon as we arrived at what we at any rate called years of discretion which means that I was nineteen and she seventeen when we first spoke definitely about getting married And two years had gone by since then and one reason why I had no objection to earning mister Gilverthwaite s ten pounds was that Maisie and I meant to wed as soon as my salary was lifted to three pounds a week as it soon was to be and we were saving money for our furnishing and ten pounds of course would be a nice help So presently I went along the street to Dunlop s and called Maisie out and we went down to the walls by the river mouth which was a regular evening performance of ours And in a quiet corner where there was a seat on which we often sat whispering together of our future I told her that I had to do a piece of business for our lodger that night and that the precise nature of it was a secret which I must not let out even to her But here s this much in it Maisie I went on taking care that there was no one near us that could catch a word of what I was saying I can tell you where the spot is that I m to do the business at for a fine lonely spot it is to be in at the time of night I m to be there an hour before midnight and the place is that old ruin that s close by where Till meets Tweed you know it well enough yourself I felt her shiver a bit at that and I knew what it was that was in her mind for Maisie was a girl of imagination and the mention of a lonely place like that to be visited at such an hour set it working Yon s a queer man that lodger of your mother s Hughie she said And it s a strange time and place you re talking of I hope nothing ll come to you in the way of mischance Oh it s nothing nothing at all I hastened to say If you knew it all you d see it s a very ordinary business that this man can t do himself being kept to his bed But all the same there s naught like taking precautions beforehand and so I ll tell you what we ll do I should be back in town soon after twelve and I ll give a tap at your window as I pass it and then you ll know all s right That would be an easy enough thing to manage for Maisie s room where she slept with a younger sister was on the ground floor of her father s house in a wing that butted on to the street and I could knock at the pane as I passed by Yet still she seemed uneasy and I hastened to say what not even then knowing her quite as well as I did later I thought would comfort her in any fears she had It s a very easy job Maisie I said and the ten pounds ll go a long way in buying that furniture we re always talking about She started worse than before when I said that and gripped the hand that I had round her waist Hughie she exclaimed He ll not be giving you ten pounds for a bit of a ride like that Oh now I m sure there s danger in it What would a man be paying ten pounds for to anybody just to take a message Don t go Hughie What do you know of yon man except that he s a stranger that never speaks to a soul in the place and wanders about like he was spying things And I would liefer go without chair or table pot or pan than that you should be running risks in a lonesome place like that and at that time with nobody near if you should be needing help Don t go You re misunderstanding said I It s a plain and easy thing I ve nothing to do but ride there and back And as for the ten pounds it s just this way yon mister Gilverthwaite has more money than he knows what to do with He carries sovereigns in his pockets like they were sixpenny pieces Ten pounds is no more to him that ten pennies to us And we ve had the man in our house seven weeks now and there s nobody could say an ill word of him It s not so much him she answered It s what you may meet there For you ve got to meet somebody You re going then I ve given my word Maisie I said And you ll see there ll be no harm and I ll give you a tap at the window as I pass your house coming back And we ll do grand things with that ten pounds too I ll never close my eyes till I hear you then she replied And I ll not be satisfied with any tap neither If you give one I ll draw the blind an inch and make sure it s yourself Hughie We settled it at that with a kiss that was meant on my part to be one of reassurance and presently we parted and I went off to get my bicycle in readiness for the ride CHAPTER III THE RED STAIN It was just half past nine by the town clocks when I rode out across the old Border Bridge and turned up the first climb of the road that runs alongside the railway in the direction of Tillmouth Park which was of course my first objective A hot close night it was there had been thunder hanging about all day and folk had expected it to break at any minute but up to this it had not come and the air was thick and oppressive I was running with sweat before I had ridden two miles along the road and my head ached with the heaviness of the air that seemed to press on me till I was like to be stifled Under ordinary circumstances nothing would have taken me out on such a night But the circumstances were not ordinary for it was the first time I had ever had the chance of earning ten pounds by doing what appeared to be a very simple errand and though I was well enough inclined to be neighbourly to mister Gilverthwaite it was certainly his money that was my chief inducement in going on his business at a time when all decent folk should be in their beds And for this first part of my journey my thoughts ran on that money and on what Maisie and I would do with it when it was safely in my pocket We had already bought the beginnings of our furnishing and had them stored in an unused warehouse at the back of her father s premises with mister Gilverthwaite s bank note lying there snugly in waiting for me we should be able to make considerable additions to our stock and the wedding day would come nearer But from these anticipations I presently began to think about the undertaking on which I was now fairly engaged When I came to consider it it seemed a queer affair As I understood it it amounted to this Here was mister Gilverthwaite a man that was a stranger in Berwick and who appeared to have plenty of money and no business suddenly getting a letter which asked him to meet a man near midnight and in about as lonely a spot as you could select out of the whole district Why at such a place and at such an hour And why was this meeting of so much importance that mister Gilverthwaite being unable to keep the appointment himself must pay as much as ten pounds to another person to keep it for him What I had said to Maisie about mister Gilverthwaite having so much money that ten pounds was no more to him than ten pence to me was of course all nonsense said just to quieten her fears and suspicions I knew well enough having seen a bit of the world in a solicitor s office for the past six years that even millionaires don t throw their money about as if pounds were empty peascods No mister Gilverthwaite was giving me that money because he thought that I as a lawyer s clerk would see the thing in its right light as a secret and an important business and hold my tongue about it And see it as a secret business I did for what else could it be that would make two men meet near an old ruin at midnight when in a town where at any rate one of them was a stranger and the other probably just as much so they could have met by broad day at a more convenient trysting place without anybody having the least concern in their doings There was strange and subtle mystery in all this and the thinking and pondering it over led me before long to wondering about its first natural consequence who and what was the man I was now on my way to meet and where on earth could he be coming from to keep a tryst at a place like that and at that hour However before I had covered three parts of that outward journey I was to meet another man who all unknown to me was to come into this truly extraordinary series of events in which I with no will of my own was just beginning all unawares to be mixed up Taking it roughly and as the crow flies it is a distance of some nine or ten miles from Berwick town to Twizel Bridge on the Till whereat I was to turn off from the main road and take another a by lane that would lead me down by the old ruin close by which Till and Tweed meet Hot as the night was and unpleasant for riding I had plenty and to spare of time in hand and when I came to the cross ways between Norham and Grindon I got off my machine and sat down on the bank at the roadside to rest a bit before going further It was a quiet and a very lonely spot that for three miles or more I had not met a soul along the road and there being next to nothing in the way of village or farmstead between me and Cornhill I did not expect to meet one in the next stages of my journey But as I sat there on the bank under a thick hedge my bicycle lying at my side I heard steps coming along the road in the gloom swift sure steps as of a man who walks fast and puts his feet firmly down as with determination to get somewhere as soon as he may And hearing that and to this day I have often wondered what made me do it I off with my cap and laid it over the bicycle lamp and myself sat as still as any of the wee creatures that were doubtless lying behind me in the hedge The steps came from the direction in which I was bound There was a bit of a dip in the road just there they came steadily strongly up it And presently for this was the height of June when the nights are never really dark the figure of a man came over the ridge of the dip and showed itself plain against a piece of grey sky that was framed by the fingers of the pines and firs on either side of the way A strongly built figure it was and as I said before the man put his feet evidently well shod firmly and swiftly down and with this alternate sound came the steady and equally swift tapping of an iron shod stick Whoever this night traveller was it was certain he was making his way somewhere without losing any time in the business The man came close by me and my cover seeing nothing and at a few yards distance stopped dead I knew why He had come to the cross roads and it was evident from his movements that he was puzzled and uncertain He went to the corners of each way it seemed to me that he was seeking for a guide post But as I knew very well there was no guide post at any corner and presently he came to the middle of the roads again and stood looking this way and that as if still in a dubious mood And then I heard a crackling and rustling as of stiff paper he was never more than a dozen yards from me all the time and in another minute there was a spurt up of bluish flame and I saw that the man had turned on the light of an electric pocket torch and was shining it on a map which he had unfolded and shaken out and was holding in his right hand At this point I profited by a lesson which had been dinned into my ears a good many times since boyhood Andrew Dunlop Maisie s father was one of those men who are uncommonly fond of lecturing young folk in season and out of season He would get a lot of us boys and girls together in his parlour at such times as he was not behind the counter and give us admonitions on what he called the practical things of life And one of his favourite precepts especially addressed to us boys was Cultivate your powers of observation This advice fitted in very well with the affairs of the career I had mapped out for myself a solicitor should naturally be an observant man and I had made steady effort to do as Andrew Dunlop counselled Therefore it was with a keenly observant eye that I all unseen watched the man with his electric torch and his map and it did not escape my notice that the hand which held the map was short of the two middle fingers But of the rest of him except that he was a tallish well made man dressed in as far as I could see things a gentlemanlike fashion in grey tweeds I could see nothing I never caught one glimpse of his face for all the time that he stood there it was in shadow He did not stay there long either The light of the electric torch was suddenly switched off I heard the crackling of the map again as he folded it up and pocketed it And just as suddenly he was once more on the move taking the by way up to the north which as I knew well led to Norham and if he was going far over the Tweed to Ladykirk He went away at the same quick pace but the surface in that by way was not as hard and ringing as that of the main road and before long the sound of his steps died away into silence and the hot oppressive night became as still as ever I presently mounted my bicycle again and rode forward on my last stage and having crossed Twizel Bridge turned down the lane to the old ruin close by where Till runs into Tweed It was now as dark as ever it would be that night and the thunderclouds which hung all over the valley deepened the gloom Gloomy and dark the spot indeed was where I was to meet the man of whom mister Gilverthwaite had spoken By the light of my bicycle lamp I saw that it was just turned eleven when I reached the spot but so far as I could judge there was no man there to meet anybody And remembering what I had been bidden to do I spoke out loud From James Gilverthwaite who is sick and can t come himself I repeated And then getting no immediate response I spoke the password in just as loud a voice But there was no response to that either and for the instant I thought how ridiculous it was to stand there and say Panama to nobody I made it out that the man had not yet come and I was wheeling my bicycle to the side of the lane there to place it against the hedge and to sit down myself when the glancing light of the lamp fell on a great red stain that had spread itself and was still spreading over the sandy ground in front of me And I knew on the instant that this was the stain of blood and I do not think I was surprised when advancing a step or two further I saw lying in the roadside grass at my feet the still figure and white face of a man who I knew with a sure and certain instinct was not only dead but had been cruelly murdered CHAPTER IV THE MURDERED MAN There may be folk in the world to whom the finding of a dead man lying grim and stark by the roadside with the blood freshly run from it and making ugly patches of crimson on the grass and the gravel would be an ordinary thing but to me that had never seen blood let in violence except in such matters as a bout of fisticuffs at school it was the biggest thing that had ever happened and I stood staring down at the white face as if I should never look at anything else as long as I lived I remember all about that scene and that moment as freshly now as if the affair had happened last night The dead man lying in the crushed grass his arms thrown out helplessly on either side of him the gloom of the trees all around the murmuring of the waters where Till was pouring its sluggish flood into the more active swirl and rush of the Tweed the hot oppressive air of the night and the blood on the dry road all that was what at mister Gilverthwaite s bidding I had ridden out from Berwick to find in that lonely spot But I knew of course that James Gilverthwaite himself had not foreseen this affair nor thought that I should find a murdered man And as I at last drew breath and lifted myself up a little from staring at the corpse a great many thoughts rushed into my head and began to tumble about over each other 
589_139200_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Was this the man mister Gilverthwaite meant me to meet 
none	none	Would mister Gilverthwaite have been murdered too if he had come there in person And had the man been murdered for the sake of robbery But I answered that last question as soon as I asked it and in the negative for the light of my lamp showed a fine heavy gold watch chain festooned across the man s waistcoat if murderously inclined thieves had been at him they were not like to have left that 
589_139200_000003_000005	train-clean-360	Then I wondered if I had disturbed the murderers it was fixed in me from the beginning that there must have been more than one in at this dreadful game and if they were still lurking about and watching me from the brushwood and I made an effort and bent down and touched one of the nerveless hands 
none	none	It was stiffened already and I knew then that the man had been dead some time And I knew another thing in that moment poor Maisie lying awake to listen for the tap at her window so that she might get up and peep round the corner of her blind to assure herself that her Hughie was alive and safe would have to lie quaking and speculating through the dark hours of that night for here was work that was going to keep me busied till day broke I set to it there and then leaving the man just as I had found him and hastening back in the direction of the main road As luck would have it I heard voices of men on Twizel Bridge and ran right on the local police sergeant and a constable who had met there in the course of their night rounds I knew them both the sergeant being one Chisholm and the constable a man named Turndale and they knew me well enough from having seen me in the court at Berwick and it was with open mouthed surprise that they listened to what I had to tell them Presently we were all three round the dead man and this time there was the light of three lamps on his face and on the gouts of blood that were all about him and Chisholm clicked his tongue sharply at what he saw Here s a sore sight for honest folk he said in a low voice as he bent down and touched one of the hands Aye and he s been dead a good hour I should say by the feel of him You heard nothing as you came down yon lane mister Hugh
589_139200_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Not a sound I answered 
none	none	And saw nothing he questioned
589_139200_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing and nobody I said 
none	none	Well said he we ll have to get him away from this 
589_139200_000009_000001	train-clean-360	You ll have to get help he went on turning to the constable 
none	none	Fetch some men to help us carry him He ll have to be taken to the nearest inn for the inquest that s how the law is I wasn t going to ask it while yon man was about mister Hugh he continued when Turndale had gone hurrying towards the village but you ll not mind me asking it now what were you doing here yourself at this hour You ve a good right Chisholm said I and I ll tell you for by all I can see there ll be no way of keeping it back and it s no concern of mine to keep it back and I don t care who knows all about it not me The truth is we ve a lodger at our house one mister James Gilverthwaite that s a mysterious sort of man and he s at present in his bed with a chill or something that s like to keep him there and tonight he got me to ride out here to meet a man whom he ought to have met himself and that s why I m here and all that I have to do with it You don t mean to say that that he exclaimed jerking his thumb at the dead man that that s the man you were to meet Who else said I Can you think of any other that it would be 
589_139200_000012_000001	train-clean-360	And I m wondering if whoever killed this fellow whoever he may be wouldn t have killed mister Gilverthwaite too if he d come 
none	none	This is no by chance murder Chisholm as you ll be finding out
589_139200_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Well well I never knew its like he remarked staring from me to the body and from it to me 
589_139200_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 You saw nobody about close by nor in the neighbourhood no strangers on the road 
none	none	I was ready for that question 
589_139200_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Ever since finding the body I had been wondering what I should say when authority either in the shape of a coroner or a policeman asked me about my own adventures that night 
none	none	To be sure I had seen a stranger and I had observed that he had lost a couple of fingers the first and second of his right hand and it was certainly a queer thing that he should be in that immediate neighbourhood about the time when this unfortunate man met his death But it had been borne in on my mind pretty strongly that the man I had seen looking at his map was some gentleman tourist who was walking the district and had as like as not been tramping it over Plodden Field and that historic corner of the country and had become benighted ere he could reach wherever his headquarters were And I was not going to bring suspicion on what was in all probability an innocent stranger so I answered Chisholm s question as I meant to answer any similar one unless indeed I had reason to alter my mind I saw nobody and heard nothing about here said I It s not likely there d be strangers in this spot at midnight For that matter the poor fellow is a stranger himself said he once more turning his lamp on the dead face
589_139200_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 Anyway he s not known to me and I ve been in these parts twenty years 
none	none	And altogether it s a fine mystery you ve hit on mister Hugh and there ll be strange doings before we re at the bottom of it I m thinking That there was mystery in this affair was surer than ever when having got the man to the nearest inn and brought more help including a doctor they began to examine him and his clothing And now that I saw him in a stronger light I found that he was a strongly built well made man of about mister Gilverthwaite s age say just over sixty years or so dressed in a gentlemanlike fashion and wearing good boots and linen and a tweed suit of the sort affected by tourists There was a good deal of money in his pockets bank notes gold and silver and an expensive watch and chain and other such things that a gentleman would carry and it seemed very evident that robbery had not been the motive of the murderers But of papers that could identify the man there was nothing in the shape of paper or its like there was not one scrap in all the clothing except the return half of a railway ticket between Peebles and Coldstream and a bit of a torn bill head giving the name and address of a tradesman in Dundee There s something to go on anyway remarked Chisholm as he carefully put these things aside after pointing out to us that the ticket was dated on what was now the previous day for it was already well past midnight and the time was creeping on to morning and that the dead man must accordingly have come to Coldstream not many hours before his death and we ll likely find something about him from either Dundee or Peebles But I m inclined to think mister Hugh he continued drawing me aside that even though they didn t rob the man of his money and valuables they took something else from him that may have been of much more value than either
589_139200_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 What I asked 
589_139200_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Papers said he 
none	none	Look at the general appearance of the man He s no common or ordinary sort Is it likely now such a man would be without letters and that sort of thing in his pockets Like as not he d carry his pocket book and it may have been this pocket book with what was in it they were after and not troubling about his purse at all They made sure of him anyway said I and went out of the room where they had laid the body not caring to stay longer For I had heard what the doctor said that the man had been killed on the spot by a single blow from a knife or dagger which had been thrust into his heart from behind with tremendous force and the thought of it was sickening me What are you going to do now I asked of Chisholm who had followed me And do you want me any more sergeant for if not I m anxious to get back to Berwick
589_139200_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 That s just where I m coming with you he answered 
589_139200_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve my bicycle close by and we ll ride into the town together at once 
none	none	For do you see mister Hugh there s just one man hereabouts that can give us some light on this affair straightaway if he will and that the lodger you were telling me of And I must get in and see the superintendent and we must get speech with this mister Gilverthwaite of yours for if he knows no more he ll know who yon man is I made no answer to that I had no certain answer to make I was already wondering about a lot of conjectures Would mister Gilverthwaite know who the man was 
589_139200_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Was he the man I ought to have met 
589_139200_000023_000005	train-clean-360	Or had that man been there witnessed the murder and gone away frightened to stop where the murder had been done 
589_139200_000023_000006	train-clean-360	Or yet again was this some man who had come upon mister Gilverthwaite s correspondent and for some reason been murdered by him 
none	none	It was however all beyond me just then and presently the sergeant and I were on our machines and making for Berwick But we had not been set out half an hour and were only just where we could see the town s lights before us in the night when two folk came riding bicycles through the mist that lay thick in a dip of the road and calling to me let me know that they were Maisie Dunlop and her brother Tom that she had made to come with her and in another minute Maisie and I were whispering together It s all right now that I know you re safe Hugh she said breathlessly
589_139200_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 But you must get back with me quickly 
589_139200_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Yon lodger of yours is dead and your mother in a fine way wondering where you are 
none	none	CHAPTER V THE BRASS BOUND CHEST The police sergeant had got off his bicycle at the same time that I jumped from mine and he was close behind me when Maisie and I met and I heard him give a sharp whistle at her news And as for me I was dumbfounded for though I had seen well enough that mister Gilverthwaite was very ill when I left him I was certainly a long way from thinking him like to die Indeed I was so astonished that all I could do was to stand staring at Maisie in the grey light which was just coming between the midnight and the morning But the sergeant found his tongue more readily I suppose he died in his bed miss he asked softly mister Hugh here said he was ill it would be a turn for the worse no doubt after mister Hugh left him He died suddenly just after eleven o clock answered Maisie and your mother sought you at mister Lindsey s office Hugh and when she found you weren t there she came down to our house and I had to tell her that you d come out this way on an errand for mister Gilverthwaite And I told her too what I wasn t so sure of myself that there d no harm come to you of it and that you d be back soon after twelve and I went down to your house and waited with her and when you didn t come and didn t come why I got Tom here to get our bicycles out and we came to seek you And let s be getting back for your mother s anxious about you and the man s death has upset her he went all at once she said while she was with him We all got on our bicycles again and set off homewards and Chisholm wheeled alongside me and we dropped behind a little This is a strange affair said he in a low voice and it s like to be made stranger by this man s sudden death I d been looking to him to get news of this other man What do you know of mister Gilverthwaite now Nothing said I But he s lodged with you seven weeks said he If you d known him sergeant I answered you d know that he was this sort of man you d know no more of him at the end of seven months than you would at the end of seven weeks and no more at the end of seven years than at the end of seven months We knew nothing my mother and I except that he was a decent well spoken man free with his money and having plenty of it and that his name was what he called it and that he said he d been a master mariner But who he was or where he came from I know no more than you do Well he ll have papers letters something or other that ll throw some light on matters no doubt he suggested Can you say as to that I can tell you that he s got a chest in his chamber that s nigh as heavy as if it were made of solid lead I answered And doubtless he ll have a key on him or about him that ll unlock it But what might be in it I can t say never having seen him open it at any time Well he said I ll have to bring the superintendent down and we must trouble your mother to let us take a look at this mister Gilverthwaite s effects Had he a doctor to him since he was taken ill doctor Watson this I mean yesterday afternoon I answered Then there ll be no inquest in his case said the sergeant for the doctor ll be able to certify But there ll be a searching inquiry in this murder affair and as Gilverthwaite sent you to meet the man that s been murdered Wait a bit said I You don t know and I don t that the man who s been murdered is the man I was sent to meet The man I was to meet may have been the murderer you don t know who the murdered man is So you d better put it this way since Gilverthwaite sent me to meet some man at the place where this murder s been committed well That ll be one of your lawyer s quibbles said he calmly My meaning s plain enough we ll want to find out if we can who it was that Gilverthwaite sent you to meet And for what reason And where it was that the man was to wait for him And I ll get the superintendent to come down presently Make it in say half an hour said I This is a queer business altogether sergeant and I m so much in it that I m not going to do things on my own responsibility I ll call mister Lindsey up from his bed and get him to come down to talk over what s to be done Aye you re in the right of it there he said mister Lindsey ll know all the law on such matters Half an hour or so then He made off to the county police station and Maisie and Tom and I went on to our house and were presently inside My mother was so relieved at the sight of me that she forbore to scold me at that time for going off on such an errand without telling her of my business but she grew white as her cap when I told her of what I had chanced on and she glanced at the stair and shook her head And indeed I wish that poor man had never come here if it s this sort of dreadfulness follows him she said And though I was slow to say it Hugh I always had a feeling of mystery about him However he s gone now and died that suddenly and quietly and we ve laid him out in his bed and and what s to be done now she exclaimed We don t know who he is Don t trouble yourself mother said I You ve done your duty by him And now that you ve seen I m safe I m away to bring mister Lindsey down and he ll tell us all that should be done I left Maisie and Tom Dunlop keeping my mother company and made haste to mister Lindsey s house and after a little trouble roused him out of his bed and got him down to me It was nearly daylight by that time and the grey morning was breaking over the sea and the river as he and I walked back through the empty streets I telling him of all the events of the night and he listening with an occasional word of surprise He was not a native of our parts but a Yorkshireman that had bought a practice in the town some years before and had gained a great character for shrewdness and ability and I knew that he was the very man to turn to in an affair of this sort There s a lot more in this than s on the surface Hugh my lad he remarked when I had made an end of my tale And it ll be a nice job to find out all the meaning of it and if the man that s been murdered was the man Gilverthwaite sent you to meet or if he s some other that got there before you and was got rid of for some extraordinary reason that we know nothing about But one thing s certain we ve got to get some light on your late lodger That s step number one and a most important one The superintendent of police mister Murray a big bustling man was outside our house with Chisholm when we got there and after a word or two between us we went in and were presently upstairs in Gilverthwaite s room He lay there in his bed the sheet drawn about him and a napkin over his face and though the police took a look at him I kept away being too much upset by the doings of the night to stand any more just then What I was anxious about was to get some inkling of what all this meant and I waited impatiently to see what mister Lindsey would do He was looking about the room and when the others turned away from the dead man he pointed to Gilverthwaite s clothes that were laid tidily folded on a chair The first thing to do is to search for his papers and his keys he said Go carefully through his pockets sergeant and let s see what there is But there was as little in the way of papers there as there had been in the case of the murdered man There were no letters There was a map of the district and under the names of several of the villages and places on either side of the Tweed between Berwick and Kelso heavy marks in blue pencil had been made I who knew something of Gilverthwaite s habits took it that these were the places he had visited during his seven weeks stay with us And folded in the map were scraps of newspaper cuttings every one of them about some antiquity or other in the neighbourhood as if such things had an interest for him And in another pocket was a guide book much thumbed and between two of the leaves slipped as if to mark a place was a registered envelope That ll be what he got yesterday afternoon I exclaimed I m certain it was whatever there was in it that made him send me out last night and maybe the letter in it ll tell us something However there was no letter in the envelope there was nothing But on the envelope itself was a postmark at which Chisholm instantly pointed Peebles said he Yon man that you found murdered his half ticket s for Peebles There s something of a clue anyway They went on searching the clothing only to find money plenty of it notes in an old pocket book and gold in a wash leather bag and the man s watch and chain and his pocket knife and the like and a bunch of keys And with the keys in his hand mister Lindsey turned to the chest If we re going to find anything that ll throw any light on the question of this man s identity it ll be in this box he said I ll take the responsibility of opening it in missus Moneylaws interest anyway Lift it on to that table and let s see if one of these keys ll fit the lock There was no difficulty about finding the key there were but a few on the bunch and he hit on the right one straightaway and we all crowded round him as he threw back the heavy lid There was a curious aromatic smell came from within a sort of mingling of cedar and camphor and spices a smell that made you think of foreign parts and queer far off places And it was indeed a strange collection of things and objects that mister Lindsey took out of the chest and set down on the table There was an old cigar box tied about with twine full to the brim with money over two thousand pounds in bank notes and gold as we found on counting it up later on and there were others filled with cigars and yet others in which the man had packed all manner of curiosities such as three of us at any rate had never seen in our lives before But mister Lindsey who was something of a curiosity collector himself nodded his head at the sight of some of them Wherever else this man may have been in his roving life he said here s one thing certain he s spent a lot of time in Mexico and Central America And what was the name he told you to use as a password once you met his man Hugh wasn t it Panama Panama I answered Just that Panama Well and he s picked up lots of these things in those parts Panama Nicaragua Mexico he said And very interesting matters they are But you see superintendent there s not a paper nor anything in this chest to tell us who this man is nor where he came from when he came here nor where his relations are to be found if he has any There s literally nothing whatever of that sort The police officials nodded in silence And so there s where things are concluded mister Lindsey You ve two dead men on your hands and you know nothing whatever about either of them CHAPTER VI mister JOHN PHILLIPS He began to put back the various boxes and parcels into the chest as he spoke and we all looked at each other as men might look who taking a way unknown to them come up against a blank wall But Chisholm who was a sharp fellow with a good headpiece on him suddenly spoke There s the fact that the murdered man sent that letter from Peebles said he and that he himself appears to have travelled from Peebles but yesterday We might be hearing something of him at Peebles and from what we might hear there or elsewhere we might get some connection between the two of them You re right in all that sergeant said mister Lindsey and it s to Peebles some of you ll have to go For the thing s plain that man has been murdered by somebody and the first way to get at the somebody is to find out who the murdered man is and why he came into these parts As for him he continued pointing significantly to the bed his secret whatever it is has gone with him And our question now is Can we get at it in any other way We had more talk downstairs and it was settled that Chisholm and I should go on to Peebles by the first train that morning find out what we could there and work back to the Cornhill station where according to the half ticket which had been found on him the murdered man appeared to have come on the evening of his death Meanwhile Murray would have the scene of the murder thoroughly and strictly searched the daylight might reveal things which we had not been able to discover by the light of the lamps And there s another thing you can do suggested Lindsey That scrap of a bill head with a name and address in Dundee on it that you found on him you might wire there and see if anything is known of the man Any bit of information you can get in that way You re forgetting mister Lindsey that we don t know any name by which we can call the man objected Chisholm We ll have to find a name for him before we can wire to Dundee or anywhere else But if we can trace a name to him in Peebles Aye that ll be the way of it said Murray Let s be getting all the information we can during the day and I ll settle with the coroner s officer for the inquest at yon inn where you ve taken him it can t be held before tomorrow morning mister Lindsey he went on what are you going to do as regards this man that s lying dead upstairs missus Moneylaws says the doctor had been twice with him and ll be able to give a certificate so there ll be no inquest about him but what s to be done about his friends and relations It s likely there ll be somebody somewhere And all that money on him and in his chest mister Lindsey shook his head and smiled If you think all this ll be done in hole and corner fashion superintendent he said you re not the wise man I take you for Lord bless you man the news ll be all over the country within forty eight hours If this Gilverthwaite has folk of his own they ll be here fast as crows hurry to a new sown field Let the news of it once out and you ll wish that such men as newspaper reporters had never been born You can t keep these things quiet and if we re going to get to the bottom of all this then publicity s the very thing that s needed All this was said in the presence of my mother who being by nature as quiet a body as ever lived was by no means pleased to know that her house was as it were to be made a centre of attraction And when mister Lindsey and the police had gone away and she began getting some breakfast ready for me before my going to meet Chisholm at the station she set on to bewail our misfortune in ever taking Gilverthwaite into the house and so getting mixed up with such awful things as murder She should have had references with the man she said before taking him in and so have known who she was dealing with And nothing that either I or Maisie who was still there staying to be of help Tom Dunlop having gone home to tell his father the great news could say would drive out of her head the idea that Gilverthwaite somehow or other had something to do with the killing of the strange man And womanlike and not being over amenable to reason she saw no cause for a great fuss about the affair in her own house at any rate The man was dead she said and let them get him put decently away and hold his money till somebody came forward to claim it all quietly and without the pieces in the paper that mister Lindsey talked about And how are we to let people know anything about him if there isn t news in the papers I asked It s only that way that we can let his relatives know he s dead mother You re forgetting that we don t even know where the man s from Maybe I ve a better idea of where he was from when he came here than any lawyer folk or police folk either my man she retorted giving me and Maisie a sharp look I ve eyes in my head anyway and it doesn t take me long to see a thing that s put plain before them Well said I seeing quick enough that she d some notion in her mind You ve found something out Without answering the question in words she went out of the kitchen and up the stairs and presently came back to us carrying in one hand a man s collar and in the other Gilverthwaite s blue serge jacket And she turned the inside of the collar to us pointing her finger to some words stamped in black on the linen Take heed of that she said He d a dozen of those collars brand new when he came and this you see is where he bought them and where he bought them there too he bought his ready made suit of clothes that was brand new as well here s the name on a tab inside the coat Brown Brothers Gentlemen s Outfitters Exchange Street Liverpool What does all that prove but that it was from Liverpool he came Aye I said And it proves too that he was wanting an outfit when he came to Liverpool from where A long way further afield I m thinking But it s something to know as much as that and you ve no doubt hit on a clue that might be useful mother And if we can find out that the other man came from Liverpool too why then But I stopped short there having a sudden vision of a very wide world of which Liverpool was but an outlet Where had Gilverthwaite last come from when he struck Liverpool and set himself up with new clothes and linen And had this mysterious man who had met such a terrible fate come also from some far off part to join him in whatever it was that had brought Gilverthwaite to Berwick And a far more important thing mysterious as these two men were what about the equally mysterious man that was somewhere in the background the murderer Chisholm and I had no great difficulty indeed we had nothing that you might call a difficulty in finding out something about the murdered man at Peebles We had the half ticket with us and we soon got hold of the booking clerk who had issued it on the previous afternoon He remembered the looks of the man to whom he had sold it and described him to us well enough Moreover he found us a ticket collector who remembered that same man arriving in Peebles two days before and giving up a ticket from Glasgow He had a reason for remembering him for the man had asked him to recommend him to a good hotel and had given him a two shilling piece for his trouble So far then we had plain sailing and it continued plain and easy during the short time we stayed in Peebles And it came to this the man we were asking about came to the town early in the afternoon of the day before the murder he put himself up at the best hotel in the place he was in and out of it all the afternoon and evening he stayed there until the middle of the afternoon of the next day when he paid his bill and left And there was the name he had written in the register book mister John Phillips Glasgow Chisholm drew me out of the hotel where we had heard all this and pulled the scrap of bill head from his pocket book Now that we ve got the name to go on said he we ll send a wire to this address in Dundee asking if anything s known there of mister John Phillips And we ll have the reply sent to Berwick it ll be waiting us when we get back this morning The name and address in Dundee was of one Gavin Smeaton Agent one hundred thirty oneA Bank Street And the question which Chisholm sent him over the wire was plain and direct enough Could he give the Berwick police any information about a man named John Phillips found dead on whose body mister Smeaton s name and address had been discovered We may get something out of that said Chisholm as we left the post office and we may get nothing And now that we do know that this man left here for Coldstream let s get back there and go on with our tracing of his movements last night But when we had got back to our own district we were quickly at a dead loss The folk at Cornhill station remembered the man well enough He had arrived there about half past eight the previous evening He had been seen to go down the road to the bridge which leads over the Tweed to Coldstream We could not find out that he had asked the way of anybody he appeared to have just walked that way as if he were well acquainted with the place But we got news of him at an inn just across the bridge Such a man a gentleman the inn folk called him had walked in there asked for a glass of whisky lingered for a few minutes while he drank it and had gone out again And from that point we lost all trace of him We were now of course within a few miles of the place where the man had been murdered and the people on both sides of the river were all in a high state of excitement about it but we could learn nothing more From the moment of the man s leaving the inn on the Coldstream side of the bridge nobody seemed to have seen him until I myself found his body There was another back set for us when we reached Berwick in the reply from Dundee It was brief and decisive enough Have no knowledge whatever of any person named John Phillips Gavin Smeaton So for the moment there was nothing to be gained from that quarter mister Lindsey and I were at the inn where the body had been taken and where the inquest was to be held early next morning in company with the police and amidst a crowd that had gathered from all parts of the country As we hung about waiting the coroner s arrival a gentleman rode up on a fine bay horse a good looking elderly man whose coming attracted much attention He dismounted and came towards the inn door and as he drew the glove off his right hand I saw that the first and second fingers of that hand were missing Here without doubt was the man whom I had seen at the cross roads just before my discovery of the murder CHAPTER VII 
1179-139203-0000	train-other-500	THE INQUEST ON JOHN PHILLIPS Several of the notabilities of the neighbourhood had ridden or driven to the inn attracted of course by curiosity
1179-139203-0001	train-other-500	and the man with the maimed hand immediately joined them as they stood talking apart from the rest of us Now I knew all such people of our parts well enough by sight but I did not know this man who certainly belonged to their class
1179-139203-0002	train-other-500	and I turned to mister Lindsey asking him who was this gentleman that had just ridden up He glanced at me with evident surprise at my question What said he You don t know him

1179-139203-0007	train-other-500	and though he had three children it was little company that he seemed to have ever got out of them for his elder son mister Michael Carstairs had long since gone away to foreign parts and had died there

1179-139203-0010	train-other-500	And he had died suddenly not so very long before James Gilverthwaite came to lodge with us and mister Michael being dead unmarried and therefore without family the title and estate had passed to mister Gilbert

1179-139203-0013	train-other-500	that he was the man whom I had seen on the road the night of the murder I was close enough to him now to look more particularly at his hand and I saw that the two first fingers had completely disappeared
1179-139203-0014	train-other-500	and that the rest of it was no more than a claw It was not likely there could be two men in our neighbourhood thus disfigured Moreover the general build of the man the tweed suit of grey that he was wearing
1179-139203-0015	train-other-500	the attitude in which he stood all convinced me that this was the person I had seen at the cross roads holding his electric torch to the face of his map
1179-139203-0016	train-other-500	And I made up my mind there and then to say nothing in my evidence about that meeting for I had no reason to connect such a great gentleman as Sir Gilbert Carstairs with the murder
1179-139203-0017	train-other-500	and it seemed to me that his presence at those cross roads was easily enough explained He was a big athletic man and was likely fond of a walk
none	none	 and had been taking one that evening and 
1179-139203-0018	train-other-500	not as yet being over familiar with the neighbourhood having lived so long away from it had got somewhat out of his way in returning home No I would say nothing
1179-139203-0019	train-other-500	I had been brought up to have a firm belief in the old proverb which tells you that the least said
none	none	 is soonest mended 
1179-139203-0020	train-other-500	We were all packed pretty tightly in the big room of the inn when the coroner opened his inquiry And at the very onset of the proceedings he made a remark which was expected by all of us that knew how these things are done
1179-139203-0021	train-other-500	and are likely to go We could not do much that day there would have to be an adjournment
none	none	 after taking what he might call the surface evidence 
1179-139203-0022	train-other-500	He understood he remarked with a significant glance at the police officials and at one or two solicitors that were there that there was some extraordinary mystery at the back of this matter and that a good many things would have to be brought to light
1179-139203-0023	train-other-500	before the jury could get even an idea as to who it was that had killed the man whose body had been found and as to the reason for his murder And all they could do that day he went on was to hear such evidence not much
1179-139203-0024	train-other-500	as had already been collected and then to adjourn mister Lindsey had said to me as we drove along to the inn that I should find myself the principal witness and that Gilverthwaite would come into the matter more prominently than anybody fancied
1179-139203-0025	train-other-500	And this of course was soon made evident What there was to tell of the dead man up to that time was little There was the medical evidence that he had been stabbed to death by a blow from a very formidable knife or dagger
1179-139203-0026	train-other-500	which had been driven into his heart from behind There was the evidence which Chisholm and I had collected in Peebles and at Cornhill station and at the inn across the Coldstream Bridge
1179-139203-0027	train-other-500	There was the telegram which had been sent by mister Gavin Smeaton whoever he might be from Dundee And that was about all and it came to this that here was a man who in registering at a Peebles hotel
1179-139203-0028	train-other-500	called himself John Phillips and wrote down that he came from Glasgow where up to that moment the police had failed to trace anything relating to such a person and this man had travelled to Cornhill station from Peebles
1179-139203-0029	train-other-500	been seen in an adjacent inn had then disappeared and had been found about two hours later murdered in a lonely place And the question comes to this observed the coroner
1179-139203-0030	train-other-500	what was this man doing at that place and who was he likely to meet there We have some evidence on that point and he added with one shrewd glance at the legal folk in front of him
1179-139203-0031	train-other-500	and another at the jurymen at his side I think you ll find gentlemen of the jury that it s just enough to whet your appetite for more They had kept my evidence to the last
none	none	 and if there had been a good deal of suppressed excitement in the crowded room while Chisholm and the doctor and the landlord of the inn on the other side of Coldstream Bridge gave their testimonies 
1179-139203-0032	train-other-500	there was much more when I got up to tell my tale and to answer any questions that anybody liked to put to me Mine of course was a straight enough story
1179-139203-0033	train-other-500	told in a few sentences and I did not see what great amount of questioning could arise out of it But whether it was that he fancied I was keeping something back or that he wanted even at that initial stage of the proceedings
1179-139203-0034	train-other-500	to make matters as plain as possible a solicitor that was representing the county police began to ask me questions
none	none	 There was no one else with you in the room 
1179-139203-0035	train-other-500	when this man Gilverthwaite gave you his orders he asked No one I answered And you ve told me everything that he said to you As near as I can recollect it
1179-139203-0036	train-other-500	every word He didn t describe the man you were to meet He didn t in any way
none	none	 Nor tell you his name 
1179-139203-0037	train-other-500	Nor tell me his name So that you d no idea whatever as to who it was that you were to meet nor for what purpose he was coming to meet Gilverthwaite if Gilverthwaite had been able to meet him
1179-139203-0038	train-other-500	I d no idea said I I knew nothing but that I was to meet a man and give him a message He seemed to consider matters a little keeping silence and then he went off on another tack
none	none	 What do you know of the movements of this man Gilverthwaite 
1179-139203-0039	train-other-500	while he was lodging with your mother he asked Next to nothing I replied
none	none	 But how much he inquired You d know something 
1179-139203-0040	train-other-500	Of my own knowledge next to nothing I repeated I ve seen him in the streets and on the pier and taking his walks on the walls and over the Border Bridge and I ve heard him say that he d been out in the country
1179-139203-0041	train-other-500	And that s all Was he always alone he asked I never saw him with anybody never heard of his talking to anybody nor of his going to see a soul in the place I answered
1179-139203-0042	train-other-500	and first and last he never brought any one into our house nor had anybody asked at the door for him And with the exception of that registered letter we ve heard of
none	none	 he never had a letter delivered to him all the time he lodged with you 
1179-139203-0043	train-other-500	he said Not one said I From first to last not one He was silent again for a time and all the folk staring at him and me and for the life of me
1179-139203-0044	train-other-500	I could not think what other questions he could get out of his brain to throw at me But he found one and put it with a sharp cast of his eye Now did this man ever give you while he was in your house
none	none	 any reason at all for his coming to Berwick 
1179-139203-0045	train-other-500	he asked Yes I answered he did that when he came asking for lodgings He said he had folk of his own buried in the neighbourhood and he was minded to take a look at their graves and at the old places where they d lived
1179-139203-0046	train-other-500	Giving you in fact an impression that he was either a native of these parts or had lived here at some time or had kindred that had he asked Just that I replied
1179-139203-0047	train-other-500	Did he tell you the names of such folk or where they were buried or anything of that sort he suggested No never said I He never mentioned the matter again
none	none	 And you don t know that he ever went to any particular place 
1179-139203-0048	train-other-500	to look at any particular grave or house he inquired No I replied but we knew that he took his walks into the country on both sides Tweed He hesitated a bit
1179-139203-0049	train-other-500	looked at me and back at his papers and then with a glance at the coroner sat down And the coroner nodding at him as if there was some understanding between them turned to the jury
1179-139203-0050	train-other-500	It may seem without the scope of this inquiry gentlemen he said but the presence of this man Gilverthwaite in the neighbourhood has evidently so much to do with the death of the other man
1179-139203-0051	train-other-500	whom we know as John Phillips that we must not neglect any pertinent evidence
none	none	 There is a gentleman present that can tell us something Call the Reverend Septimus Ridley CHAPTER VIII THE PARISH REGISTERS I had noticed the Reverend mister Ridley sitting in the room with some other gentlemen of the neighbourhood and had wondered what had brought him a clergyman there I knew him well enough by sight He was a vicar of a lonely parish away up in the hills a tall thin student looking man that you might occasionally see in the Berwick streets walking very fast with his eyes on the ground as if as the youngsters say he was seeking sixpences and I should not have thought him likely to be attracted to an affair of that sort by mere curiosity And whatever he might be in his pulpit he looked very nervous and shy as he stood up between the coroner and the jury to give his evidence Whatever are we going to hear now whispered mister Lindsey in my ear Didn t I tell you there d be revelations about Gilverthwaite Hugh my lad Well there s something coming out But what can this parson know As it soon appeared mister Ridley knew a good deal After a bit of preliminary questioning making things right in the proper legal fashion as to who he was and so on the coroner put a plain inquiry to him mister Ridley you have had some recent dealings with this man James Gilverthwaite who has just been mentioned in connection with this inquiry he asked Some dealings recently yes answered the clergyman Just tell us in your own way what they were said the coroner And of course when they took place Gilverthwaite said mister Ridley came to me at my vicarage about a month or five weeks ago I had previously seen him about the church and churchyard He told me he was interested in parish registers and in antiquities generally and asked if he could see our registers offering to pay whatever fee was charged I allowed him to look at the registers but I soon discovered that his interest was confined to a particular period The fact was he wished to examine the various entries made between eighteen seventy and eighteen eighty That became very plain but as he did not express his wish in so many words I humoured him Still as I was with him during the whole of the time he was looking at the books I saw what it was that he examined Here mister Ridley paused glancing at the coroner That is really about all that I can tell he said He only came to me on that one occasion Perhaps I can get a little more out of you mister Ridley remarked the coroner with a smile A question or two now What particular registers did this man examine Births deaths marriages which All three between the dates I have mentioned eighteen seventy to eighteen eighty replied mister Ridley Did you think that he was searching for some particular entry I certainly did think so Did he seem to find it asked the coroner with a shrewd glance If he did find such an entry replied mister Ridley slowly he gave no sign of it he did not copy or make a note of it and he did not ask any copy of it from me My impression whatever it is worth is that he did not find what he wanted in our registers I am all the more convinced of that because Here mister Ridley paused as if uncertain whether to proceed or not but at an encouraging nod from the coroner he went on I was merely going to say and I don t suppose it is evidence he added that I understand this man visited several of my brother clergymen in the neighbourhood on the same errand It was talked of at the last meeting of our rural deanery Ah remarked the coroner significantly He appears then to have been going round examining the parish registers we must get more evidence of that later for I m convinced it has a bearing on the subject of this present inquiry But a question or two more mister Ridley There are stipulated fees for searching the registers I believe Did Gilverthwaite pay them in your case mister Ridley smiled He not only paid the fees he answered but he forced me to accept something for the poor box He struck me as being a man who was inclined to be free with his money The coroner looked at the solicitor who was representing the police I don t know if you want to ask this witness any questions he inquired Yes said the solicitor He turned to mister Ridley You heard what the witness Hugh Moneylaws said that Gilverthwaite mentioned on his coming to Berwick that he had kinsfolk buried in the neighbourhood You did Well mister Ridley do you know if there are people of that name buried in your churchyard There are not replied mister Ridley promptly What is more the name Gilverthwaite does not occur in our parish registers I have a complete index of the registers from fifteen eighty when they began to be kept and there is no such name in it I can also tell you this he added I am I think I may say something of an authority on the parish registers of this district I have prepared and edited several of them for publication and I am familiar with most of them I do not think that name Gilverthwaite occurs in any of them What do you deduce from that now asked the solicitor That whatever it was that the man was searching for and I am sure he was searching it was not for particulars of his father s family answered mister Ridley That is of course if his name really was what he gave it out to be Gilverthwaite Precisely said the coroner It may have been an assumed name The man may have been searching for particulars of his mother s family remarked the solicitor That line of thought would carry us too far afield just now said the coroner He turned to the jury I ve allowed this evidence about the man Gilverthwaite gentlemen he said because it s very evident that Gilverthwaite came to this neighbourhood for some special purpose and wanted to get some particular information and it s more than probable that the man into the circumstances of whose death we re inquiring was concerned with him in his purpose But we cannot go any further today he concluded and I shall adjourn the inquiry for a fortnight when no doubt there ll be more evidence to put before you I think that the folk who had crowded into that room all agog to hear whatever could be told went out of it more puzzled than when they came in They split up into groups outside the inn and began to discuss matters amongst themselves And presently two sharp looking young fellows whom I had seen taking notes at the end of the big table whereat the coroner and the officials sat came up to me and telling me that they were reporters specially sent over one from Edinburgh the other from Newcastle begged me to give them a faithful and detailed account of my doings and experiences on the night of the murder there was already vast interest in this affair all over the country they affirmed and whatever I could or would tell them would make splendid reading and be printed in big type in their journals But mister Lindsey who was close by seized my arm and steered me away from these persistent seekers after copy Not just now my lads said he good humouredly You ve got plenty enough to go on with you ve heard plenty in there this morning to keep your readers going for a bit Not a word Hugh And as for you gentlemen if you want to do something towards clearing up this mystery and assisting justice there s something you can do and nobody can do it better What s that asked one of them eagerly Ask through your columns for the relations friends acquaintances anybody who knows them or aught about them of these two men James Gilverthwaite and John Phillips replied mister Lindsey Noise it abroad as much as you like and can If they ve folk belonging to them let them come forward For he went on giving them a knowing look there s a bigger mystery in this affair than any one of us has any conception of and the more we can find out the sooner it ll be solved And I ll say this to you young fellows the press can do more than the police There s a hint for you Then he led me off and we got into the trap in which he and I had driven out from Berwick and as soon as we had started homeward he fell into a brown study and continued in it until we were in sight of the town Hugh my lad he suddenly exclaimed at last starting out of his reverie I d give a good deal if I could see daylight in this affair I ve had two and twenty years experience of the law and I ve known some queer matters and some dark matters and some ugly matters in my time but hang me if I ever knew one that promises to be as ugly and as dark and as queer as this does that s a fact You re thinking it s all that mister Lindsey I asked knowing him as I did to be an uncommonly sharp man I m thinking there s more than meets the eye he answered Bloody murder we know there is maybe there ll be more or maybe there has been more already What was that deep old fish Gilverthwaite after What took place between Phillips s walking out of that inn at Coldstream Bridge and your finding of his body Who met Phillips Who did him to his death And what were the two of em after in this corner of the country Black mystery my lad on all hands I made no answer just then I was thinking wondering if I should tell him about my meeting with Sir Gilbert Carstairs at the cross roads mister Lindsey was just the man you could and would tell anything to and it would maybe have been best if I had told him of that matter there and then But there s a curious run of caution and reserve in our family I got it from both father and mother and deepened it on my own account and I could not bring myself to be incriminating and suspicioning a man whose presence so near the place of the murder might be innocent enough So I held my tongue I wonder will all the stuff in the newspapers bring any one forward he said presently It ought to if there is anybody Nothing however was heard by the police or by ourselves for the next three or four days and then I think it was the fourth day after the inquest I looked up from my desk in mister Lindsey s outer office one afternoon to see Maisie Dunlop coming in at the door followed by an elderly woman poorly but respectably dressed a stranger Hugh said Maisie coming up to my side your mother asked me to bring this woman up to see mister Lindsey She s just come in from the south and she says she s yon James Gilverthwaite s sister CHAPTER IX THE MARINE STORE DEALER mister Lindsey was standing just within his own room when Maisie and the strange woman came into the office and hearing what was said he called us all three to go into him And like myself he looked at the woman with a good deal of curiosity wanting as I did 
684-139205-0001	train-other-500	to see some likeness to the dead man But there was no likeness to be seen for whereas Gilverthwaite was a big and stalwart fellow this was a small and spare woman
684-139205-0002	train-other-500	whose rusty black clothes made her look thinner and more meagre than she really was All the same
none	none	 when she spoke I knew there was a likeness between them 
684-139205-0003	train-other-500	for her speech was like his
none	none	 different altogether from ours of the Border 
684-139205-0004	train-other-500	So you believe you re the sister of this man James Gilverthwaite ma am began mister Lindsey motioning the visitor to sit down and beckoning Maisie to stop with us What might your name be now
none	none	 I believe this man that s talked about in the newspapers is my brother sir answered the woman 
684-139205-0005	train-other-500	Else I shouldn t have taken the trouble to come all this way My name s Hanson missus Hanson I come from Garston near Liverpool Aye just so a Lancashire woman said mister Lindsey nodding
684-139205-0006	train-other-500	Your name would be Gilverthwaite then before you were married To be sure sir same as James s she replied Him and me was the only two there was I ve brought papers with me that ll prove what I say
684-139205-0007	train-other-500	I went to a lawyer before ever I came and he told me to come at once and to bring my marriage lines and a copy of James s birth certificate and one or two other things of that sort
none	none	 There s no doubt that this man we ve read about in the newspapers was my brother 
684-139205-0008	train-other-500	and of course I would like to put in my claim to what he s left if he s left it to nobody else Just so agreed mister Lindsey Aye and how long is it since you last saw your brother now
684-139205-0009	train-other-500	The woman shook her head as if this question presented difficulties
none	none	 I couldn t rightly say to a year or two no not even to a few years 
684-139205-0010	train-other-500	she answered And to the best of my belief sir
none	none	 it ll be a good thirty years at the least 
684-139205-0011	train-other-500	It was just after I was married to Hanson and that was when I was about three and twenty and I was fifty six last birthday James came once to see me and Hanson soon after we was settled down
684-139205-0012	train-other-500	and I ve never set eyes on him from that day to this But I should know him now He was buried yesterday remarked mister Lindsey It s a pity you didn t telegraph to some of us
684-139205-0013	train-other-500	The lawyer I went to sir said Go yourself replied missus Hanson So I set off first thing this morning Let me have a look at those papers said mister Lindsey
none	none	 He motioned me to his side and together we looked through two or three documents which the woman produced The most important was a certified copy of James Gilverthwaite s birth certificate 
684-139205-0014	train-other-500	which went to prove that this man had been born in Liverpool about sixty two years previously that as mister Lindsey was quick to point out fitted in with what Gilverthwaite had told my mother and myself about his age Well
684-139205-0015	train-other-500	he said turning to missus Hanson you can answer some questions no doubt about your brother and about matters in relation to him First of all do you know if any of your folks hailed from this part
684-139205-0016	train-other-500	Not that I ever heard of sir she replied No I m sure they wouldn t They were all Lancashire folks on both sides
none	none	 I know all about them as far back as my great grandfather s and great grandmother s 
684-139205-0017	train-other-500	Do you know if your brother ever came to Berwick as a lad asked mister Lindsey with a glance at me
none	none	 He might ha done that sir 
684-139205-0018	train-other-500	said missus Hanson He was a great masterful strong lad and he d run off to sea by the time he was ten years old
none	none	 there d been no doing aught with him for a couple of years before that I knew that when he was about twelve or thirteen he was on a coasting steamer that used to go in and out of Sunderland and Newcastle and he might have put in here To be sure said mister Lindsey But what s more important is to get on to his later history 
684-139205-0019	train-other-500	You say you ve never seen him for thirty years or more But have you never heard of him She nodded her head with decision at that question Yes she replied I have heard of him just once
684-139205-0020	train-other-500	There was a man a neighbour of ours came home from Central America maybe five years ago and he told us he d seen our James out there and that he was working as a sub contractor or something of that sort on that Panama Canal there was so much talk about in them days
684-139205-0021	train-other-500	mister Lindsey and I looked at each other Panama that was the password which James Gilverthwaite had given me So here at any rate was something however little that had the makings of a clue in it
684-139205-0022	train-other-500	Aye he said Panama now He was there And that s the last you ever heard That s the very last we ever heard sir she answered Till of course we saw these pieces in the papers this last day or two
none	none	 mister Lindsey twisted round on her with a sharp look 
684-139205-0023	train-other-500	Do you know aught of that man John Phillips whose name s in the papers too he asked No sir nothing she replied promptly Never heard tell of him
684-139205-0024	train-other-500	And you ve never heard of your brother s having been seen in Liverpool of late he went on Never heard that he called to see any old friends at all
none	none	 For we know as you have seen in the papers missus Hanson 
684-139205-0025	train-other-500	that he was certainly in Liverpool
none	none	 and bought clothes and linen there within this last three months 
684-139205-0026	train-other-500	He never came near me sir she said And I never heard word of his being there from anybody
none	none	 There was a bit of a silence then 
684-139205-0027	train-other-500	and at last the woman put the question which it was evident she was anxious to have answered definitely
none	none	 Do you think there s a will mister she asked For if not the lawyer I went to said what there was would come to me and I could do with it We ve seen nothing of any will answered mister Lindsey And I should say there is none and on satisfactory proof of your being next of kin you ll get all he left I ve no doubt you re his sister and I ll take the responsibility of going through his effects with you You ll be stopping in the town a day or two 
684-139205-0028	train-other-500	Maybe your mother Hugh can find missus Hanson a lodging I answered that my mother would no doubt do what she could to look after missus Hanson and presently the woman went away with Maisie leaving her papers with mister Lindsey
684-139205-0029	train-other-500	He turned to me when we were alone Some folks would think that was a bit of help to me in solving the mystery Hugh said he but hang me if I don t think it makes the whole thing more mysterious than ever
none	none	 And do you know my lad where in my opinion the very beginning of it may have to be sought for I can t put a word to that mister Lindsey 
684-139205-0030	train-other-500	I answered Where sir Panama he exclaimed with a jerk of his head Panama just that It began a long way off Panama as far as I see it And what did begin and what was going on
none	none	 The two men that knew and could have told are dead as door nails and both buried for that matter So in spite of missus Hanson s coming and her revelations as to some at any rate of James Gilverthwaite s history we were just as wise as ever at the end of the first week 
684-139205-0031	train-other-500	after the murder of John Phillips And it was just the eighth night after my finding of the body that I got into the hands of Abel Crone Abel Crone was a man that had come to Berwick about three years before this
none	none	 from heaven only knows where and had set himself up in business as a marine store dealer in a back street which ran down to the shore of the Tweed He was a little red haired pale eyed rat of a man with ferrety eyes and a goatee beard 
684-139205-0032	train-other-500	quiet and peaceable in his ways and inoffensive enough but a rare hand at gossiping about the beach and the walls you might find him at all odd hours either in these public places or in the door of his shop
none	none	 talking away with any idler like himself And how I came to get into talk with him on that particular night was here Tom Dunlop Maisie s young brother was for keeping tame rabbits just then 
684-139205-0033	train-other-500	and I was helping him to build hutches for the beasts in his father s back yard and we were wanting some bits of stuff iron and wire and the like and knowing I would pick it up for a few pence at Crone s shop I went round there alone
684-139205-0034	train-other-500	Before I knew how it came about Crone was deep into the murder business They ll not have found much out by this time yon police fellows no doubt mister Moneylaws he said
684-139205-0035	train-other-500	eyeing me inquisitively in the light of the one naphtha lamp that was spurting and jumping in his untidy shop They re a slow unoriginal lot the police
none	none	 there s no imagination in their brains and no ingenuity in their minds 
684-139205-0036	train-other-500	What s wanted in an affair like this is one of those geniuses you read about in the storybooks the men that can trace a murder from the way a man turns out his toes
none	none	 or by the fashion he s bitten into a bit of bread that he s left on his plate 
684-139205-0037	train-other-500	or the like of that something more than by ordinary you ll understand me to mean mister Moneylaws
none	none	 Maybe you ll be for taking a hand in this game yourself mister Crone said I thinking to joke with him You seem to have the right instinct for it anyway Aye well he answered and I might be doing as well as anybody else and no worse 
684-139205-0038	train-other-500	You haven t thought of following anything up yourself mister Moneylaws I suppose Me I exclaimed What should I be following up man I know no more than the mere surface facts of the affair
none	none	 He gave a sharp glance at his open door when I thus answered him 
684-139205-0039	train-other-500	and the next instant he was close to me in the gloom and looking sharply in my face Are you so sure of that now he whispered cunningly

none	none	 Come this way he said I ll have a word with you in private CHAPTER X THE OTHER WITNESS It was with a thumping heart and nerves all a tingle that I followed Abel Crone out of his front shop into a sort of office that he had at the back of it a little dirty hole of a place in which there was a ramshackle table a chair or two a stand up desk a cupboard and a variety of odds and ends that he had picked up in his trade The man s sudden revelation of knowledge had knocked all the confidence out of me It had never crossed my mind that any living soul had a notion of my secret for secret of course it was and one that I would not have trusted to Crone of all men in the world knowing him as I did to be such a one for gossip And he had let this challenge out on me so sharply catching me unawares that I was alone with him and as it were at his mercy before I could pull my wits together Everything in me was confused I was thinking several things all at a time How did he come to know Had I been watched Had some person followed me out of Berwick that night Was this part of the general mystery And what was going to come of it now that Abel Crone was aware that I knew something which up to then I had kept back I stood helplessly staring at him as he turned up the wick of an oil lamp that stood on a mantelpiece littered with a mess of small things and he caught a sight of my face when there was more light and as he shut the door on us he laughed laughed as if he knew that he had me in a trap And before he spoke again he went over to the cupboard and took out a bottle and glasses Will you taste he asked leering at me A wee drop now It ll do you good No said I Then I ll drink for the two of us he responded and poured out a half tumblerful of whisky to which he added precious little water Here s to you my lad and may you have grace to take advantage of your chances He winked over the rim of his glass as he took a big pull at its contents and there was something so villainous in the look of him that it did me good in the way of steeling my nerves again For I now saw that here was an uncommonly bad man to deal with and that I had best be on my guard mister Crone said I gazing straight at him what s this you have to say to me Sit you down he answered pointing at a chair that was shoved under one side of the little table Pull that out and sit you down What we shall have to say to each other ll not be said in five minutes Let s confer in the proper and comfortable fashion I did what he asked and he took another chair himself and sat down opposite me propping his elbow on the table and leaning across it so that the table being but narrow his sharp eyes and questioning lips were closer to mine than I cared for And while he leaned forward in his chair I sat back in mine keeping as far from him as I could and just staring at him perhaps as if I had been some trapped animal that couldn t get itself away from the eyes of another that meant presently to kill it Once again I asked him what he wanted You didn t answer my question he said I ll put it again and you needn t be afraid that anybody ll overhear us in this place it s safe I say once more what for did you not tell in your evidence at that inquest that you saw Sir Gilbert Carstairs at the cross roads on the night of the murder Um That s my business said I Just so said he And I ll agree with you in that It is your business But if by that you mean that it s yours alone and nobody else s then I don t agree Neither would the police We stared at each other across the table for a minute of silence and then I put the question directly to him that I had been wanting to put ever since he had first spoken And I put it crudely enough How did you know I asked He laughed at that sneeringly of course Aye that s plain enough said he No fencing about that How did I know Because when you saw Sir Gilbert I wasn t five feet away from you and what you saw I saw I saw you both You were there I exclaimed Snug behind the hedge in front of which you planted yourself he answered And if you want to know what I was doing there I ll tell you I was doing or had been doing a bit of poaching And as I say what you saw I saw Then I ll ask you a question mister Crone I said Why haven t you told yourself Aye he said You may well ask me that But I wasn t called as a witness at yon inquest You could have come forward I suggested I didn t choose he retorted We both looked at each other again and while we looked he swigged off his drink and helped himself just as generously to more And as I was getting bolder by that time I set to work at questioning him You ll be attaching some importance to what you saw said I Well he replied slowly it s not a pleasant thing for a man s safety to be as near as what he was to a place where another man s just been done to his death You and I were near enough anyway I remarked We know what we were there for he flung back at me We don t know what he was there for Put your tongue to it mister Crone I said boldly The fact is you suspicion him I suspicion a good deal maybe he admitted After all even a man of that degree s only a man when all s said and done and there might be reasons that you and me knows nothing about Let me ask you a question he went on edging nearer at me across the table Have you mentioned it to a soul I made a mistake at that but he was on me so sharp and his manner was so insistent that I had the word out of my lips before I thought No I replied I haven t Nor me he said Nor me So you and me are the only two folk that know Well I asked He took another pull at his liquor and for a moment or two sat silent tapping his finger nails against the rim of the glass It s a queer business Moneylaws he said at last Look at it anyway you like it s a queer business Here s one man yon lodger of your mother s comes into the town and goes round the neighbourhood reading the old parish registers and asking questions at the parson s aye and he was at it both sides of the Tweed I ve found that much out for myself For what purpose Is there money at the back of it property something of that sort dependent on this Gilverthwaite unearthing some facts or other out of those old books And then comes another man a stranger that s as mysterious in his movements as Gilverthwaite was and he s to meet Gilverthwaite at a certain lonely spot and at a very strange hour and Gilverthwaite can t go and he gets you to go and you find the man murdered And close by you ve seen this other man who between you and me though it s no secret is as much a stranger to the neighbourhood as ever Gilverthwaite was or Phillips was I don t follow you at that I said No said he Then I ll make it plainer to you Do you know that until yon Sir Gilbert Carstairs came here not so long since to take up his title and his house and the estate he d never set foot in the place never been near the place this thirty year Man his own father old Sir Alec and his own sister missus Ralston of Craig had never clapped eyes on him since he went away from Hathercleugh a youngster of one and twenty Do you tell me that mister Crone I exclaimed much surprised at his words I didn t know so much Where had he been then God knows said he And himself It was said he was a doctor in London and in foreign parts Him and his brother elder brother you re aware mister Michael they both quarrelled with the old baronet when they were little more than lads and out they cleared going their own ways And news of Michael s death and the proofs of it came home not so long before old Sir Alec died and as Michael had never married of course the younger brother succeeded when his father came to his end last winter And as I say who knows anything about his past doings when he was away more than thirty years nor what company he kept nor what secrets he has Do you follow me Aye I m following you mister Crone I answered It comes to this you suspect Sir Gilbert What I say he answered is this he may have had something to do with the affair You cannot tell But you and me knows he was near the place coming from its direction at the time the murder would be in the doing And there is nobody knows but you and me What are you going to do about it I asked He had another period of reflection before he replied and when he spoke it was to the accompaniment of a warning look It s an ill advised thing to talk about rich men said he Yon man not only has money of his own in what you might call considerable quantity but his wife he brought with him is a woman of vast wealth they tell me It would be no very wise action on your part to set rumours going Moneylaws unless you could substantiate them What about yourself I asked You know as much as I do Aye and there s one word that sums all up said he And it s a short one Wait There ll be more coming out Keep your counsel a bit And when the moment comes and if the moment comes why you know there s me behind you to corroborate And that s all He got up then with a nod as if to show that the interview was over and I was that glad to get away from him that I walked off without another word CHAPTER XI SIGNATURES TO THE WILL I was so knocked out of the usual run of things by this conversation with Crone that I went away forgetting the bits of stuff I had bought for Tom Dunlop s rabbit hutches and Tom himself and for that matter Maisie as well and instead of going back to Dunlop s I turned down the riverside thinking It was beyond me at that moment to get a clear understanding of the new situation I could not make out what Crone was at Clearly he had strong suspicions that Sir Gilbert Carstairs had something to do with or some knowledge of the murder of Phillips and he knew now that there were two of us to bear out each other s testimony that Sir Gilbert was near the scene of the murder at the time it was committed Why then should he counsel waiting Why should not the two of us go to the police and tell what we knew What was it that Crone advised we should wait for Was something going on some inquiry being made in the background of things of which he knew and would not tell me And this I think was what was chiefly in my thoughts was Crone playing some game of his own and designing to use me as a puppet in it For there was a general atmosphere of subtlety and slyness about the man that forced itself upon me young as I was and the way he kept eyeing me as we talked made me feel that I had to do with one that would be hard to circumvent if it came to a matter of craftiness And at last after a lot of thinking as I walked about in the dusk it struck me that Crone might be for taking a hand in the game of which I had heard but had never seen played blackmail The more I thought over that idea the more I felt certain of it His hints about Sir Gilbert s money and his wealthy wife his advice to wait until we knew more all seemed to point to this that evidence might come out which would but require our joint testimony Crone s and mine to make it complete If that were so then of course Crone or I or as he probably designed the two of us would be in a position to go to Sir Gilbert Carstairs and tell him what we knew and ask him how much he would give us to hold our tongues I saw all the theory of it at last clear enough and it was just what I would have expected of Abel Crone knowing him even as little as I did Wait until we were sure and then strike That was his game And I was not going to have anything to do with it I went home to my bed resolved on that I had heard of blackmailing and had a good notion of its wickedness and of its danger and I was not taking shares with Crone in any venture of that sort But there Crone was an actual concrete fact that I had got to deal with and to come to some terms with simply because he knew that I was in possession of knowledge which to be sure I ought to have communicated to the police at once And I was awake much during the night thinking matters over and by the time I rose in the morning I had come to a decision I would see Crone at once and give him a sort of an ultimatum Let him come there and then with me to mister Murray and let the two of us tell what we knew and be done with it if not then I myself would go straight to mister Lindsey and tell him I set out for the office earlier than usual that morning and went round by way of the back street at the bottom of which Crone s store stood facing the river I sometimes walked round that way of a morning and I knew that Crone was as a rule at his place very early amongst his old rubbish or at his favourite game of gossiping with the fishermen that had their boats drawn up there But when I reached it the shop was still shut and though I waited as long as I could Crone did not come I knew where he lived at the top end of the town and I thought to meet him as I walked up to mister Lindsey s but I had seen nothing of him by the time I reached our office door so I laid the matter aside until noon meaning to get a word with him when I went home to my dinner And though I could have done so there and then I determined not to say anything to mister Lindsey until I had given Crone the chance of saying it with me to him or to the police I expected of course that Crone would fly into a rage at my suggestion if so then I would tell him straight out that I would just take my own way and take it at once But before noon there was another development in this affair In the course of the morning mister Lindsey bade me go with him down to my mother s house where missus Hanson had been lodged for the night we would go through Gilverthwaite s effects with her he said with a view to doing what we could to put her in possession It might probably would be a lengthy and a difficult business that he remarked seeing that there was so much that was dark about her brother s recent movements and as the woman was obviously poor we had best be stirring on her behalf So down we went and in my mother s front parlour the same that Gilverthwaite had taken as his sitting room mister Lindsey opened the heavy box for the second time in missus Hanson s presence and I began to make a list of its contents At the sight of the money it contained the woman began to tremble Eh mister she exclaimed almost tearfully but that s a sight of money to be lying there doing naught I hope there ll be some way of bringing it to me and mine we could do with it I promise you We ll do our best ma am said mister Lindsey As you re next of kin there oughtn t to be much difficulty and I ll hurry matters up for you as quickly as possible What I want this morning is for you to see all there is in this chest he seems to have had no other belongings than this and his clothes here at missus Moneylaws at any rate And as you see beyond the money there s little else in the chest but cigars and box after box of curiosities that he s evidently picked up in his travels coins shells ornaments all sorts of queer things some of em no doubt of value But no papers no letters no documents of any sort A notion suddenly occurred to me mister Lindsey said I you never turned out the contents of any of these smaller boxes the other night There might be papers in one or other of them Good notion Hugh my lad he exclaimed True there might Here goes then we ll look through them systematically In addition to the half dozen boxes full of prime Havana cigars which lay at the top of the chest there were quite a dozen of similar boxes emptied of cigars and literally packed full of the curiosities of which mister Lindsey had just spoken He had turned out and carefully replaced the contents of three or four of these when at the bottom of one filled with old coins which he said were Mexican and Peruvian and probably of great interest to collectors he came across a paper folded and endorsed in bold letters And he let out an exclamation as he took this paper out and pointed us to the endorsement Do you see that said he It s the man s will The endorsement was plain enough My will James Gilverthwaite And beneath it was a date twenty seven eight nineteen oh four There was a dead silence amongst the four of us my mother had been with us all the time as mister Lindsey unfolded the paper a thick half sheet of foolscap and read what was written on it This is the last will and testament of me James Gilverthwaite a British subject born at Liverpool and formerly of Garston in Lancashire England now residing temporarily at Colon in the Republic of Panama I devise and bequeath all my estate and effects real and personal which I may be possessed of or entitled to unto my sister Sarah Ellen Hanson the wife of Matthew Hanson of thirty seven Preston Street Garston Lancashire England absolutely and failing her to any children she may have had by her marriage with Matthew Hanson in equal shares And I appoint the said Sarah Ellen Hanson or in the case of her death her eldest child the executor of this my will and I revoke all former wills Dated this twenty seventh day of August nineteen oh four James Gilverthwaite Signed by the testator in the presence of us mister Lindsey suddenly broke off And I looking at him saw his eyes screw themselves up with sheer wonder at something he saw Without another word he folded up the paper put it in his pocket and turning to missus Hanson clapped her on the shoulder That s all right ma am he said heartily That s a good will duly signed and attested and there ll be no difficulty about getting it admitted to probate leave it to me and I ll see to it and get it through for you as soon as ever I can And we must do what s possible to find out if this brother of yours has left any other property and meanwhile we ll just lock everything up again that we ve taken out of this chest It was close on my dinner hour when we had finished but mister Lindsey at his going motioned me out into the street with him In a quiet corner he turned to me and pulled the will from his pocket Hugh he said Do you know who s one of the witnesses to this will Aye who are the two witnesses Man you could have knocked me down with a feather when I saw the names Look for yourself He handed me the paper and pointed to the attestation clause with which it ended And I saw the two names at once John Phillips Michael Carstairs and I let out a cry of astonishment Aye you may well exclaim said he taking the will back John Phillips that s the man was murdered the other night Michael Carstairs that s the elder brother of Sir Gilbert yonder at Hathercleugh the man that would have succeeded to the title and estates if he hadn t predeceased old Sir Alexander What would he be doing now a friend of Gilverthwaite s I ve heard that this mister Michael Carstairs went abroad as a young man mister Lindsey and never came home again I remarked Likely he foregathered with Gilverthwaite out yonder Just that he agreed That would be the way of it no doubt To be sure He s set down in this attestation clause as Michael Carstairs engineer American Quarter Colon and John Phillips is described as sub contractor of the same address The three of em ll have been working in connection with the Panama Canal But God bless us there s some queer facts coming out my lad Michael Carstairs knows Gilverthwaite and Phillips in yon corner of the world Phillips and Gilverthwaite when Michael Carstairs is dead come home to the corner of the world that Michael Carstairs sprang from And Phillips is murdered as soon as he gets here and Gilverthwaite dies that suddenly that he can t tell us a word of what it s all about What is it all about and who s going to piece it all together Man there s more than murder at the bottom of all this It s a wonder that I didn t let out everything that I knew at that minute And it may have been on the tip of my tongue but just then he gave me a push towards our door I heard your mother say your dinner was waiting you he said Go in now we ll talk more this afternoon He strode off up the street and I turned back and made haste with my dinner I wanted to drop in at Crone s before I went again to the office what had just happened had made me resolved that Crone and I should speak out and if he wouldn t then I would And presently I was hurrying away to his place and as I turned into the back lane that led to it I ran up against Sergeant Chisholm Here s another fine to do mister Moneylaws said he You ll know yon Abel Crone the marine store dealer Aye well he s been found drowned not an hour ago and by this and that there s queer marks that looks like violence on him CHAPTER XII THE SALMON GAFF I gave such a jump on hearing this that Chisholm himself started and he stared at me with a question in his eyes But I was quick enough to let him know that he was giving me news that I hadn t heard until he opened his lips You don t tell me that I exclaimed What more of it Aye he said You ll be thinking that this is all of a piece with the other affair And to be sure they found Crone s body close by where you found yon other man Phillips Where then I asked And when I tell you not an hour ago he replied The news just came in I was going down here to see if any of the neighbours at the shop saw Crone in any strange company last night I hesitated for a second or two and then spoke out I saw him myself last night said I I went to his shop maybe it was nine o clock to buy some bits of stuff to make Tom Dunlop a door to his rabbit hutch and I was there talking to him ten minutes or so He was all right then and I saw nobody else with him Aye well he never went home to his house last night observed Chisholm I called in there on my way down he lived you know in a cottage by the police station and I dropped in and asked the woman that keeps house for him had she seen him this morning and she said he never came home last night at all And no wonder as things are But you were saying where it happened I said Where he was found said he Well and it was where Till runs into Tweed leastways a bit up the Till Do you know John McIlwraith s lad yon youngster that they ve had such a bother with about the school always running away to his play and stopping out at nights and the like there was the question of sending him to a reformatory you ll remember Aye well it turns out the young waster was out last night in those woods below Twizel and early this morning though he didn t let on at it till some time after he saw the body of a man lying in one of them deep pools in Till And when he himself was caught by Turndale who was on the look out for him he told of what he d seen and Turndale and some other men went there and they found Crone You were saying there were marks of violence said I I haven t seen them myself he answered But by Turndale s account it was him brought in the news there is queer marks on the body Like as if as near as Turndale could describe it as if the man had been struck down before he was drowned Bruises you understand Where is he I asked He s where they took Phillips replied Chisholm Dod that s two of em that s been taken there within aye nearly within the week What are you going to do now I inquired I was just going as I said to ask a question or two down here did anybody hear Crone say anything last night about going out that way he answered But there I don t see the good of it Between you and me Crone was a bit of a night bird I ve suspected him of poaching time and again Well he ll do no more of that You ll be on your way to the office likely Straight there said I I ll tell mister Lindsey of this But when I reached the office mister Lindsey who had been out to get his lunch knew all about it He was standing outside the door talking to mister Murray and as I went up the superintendent turned away to the police station and mister Lindsey took a step or two towards me Have you heard this about that man Crone he asked I ve heard just now I answered Chisholm told me He looked at me and I at him there were questions in the eyes of both of us But between parting from the police sergeant and meeting mister Lindsey I had made up my mind by a bit of sharp thinking and reflection on what my own plan of action was going to be about all this once and for all and I spoke before he could ask anything Chisholm said I was down that way wondering could he hear word of Crone s being seen with anybody last night I saw Crone last night I went to his shop buying some bits of old stuff He was all right then I saw nothing Chisholm he says Crone was a poacher That would account likely for his being out there Aye said mister Lindsey But they say there s marks of violence on the body And the long and short of it is my lad he went on first interrupting himself and then giving me an odd look the long and short of it is it s a queer thing that Crone should have come by his death close to the spot where you found yon man Phillips There may be nothing but coincidence in it but there s no denying it s a queer thing Go and order a conveyance and we ll drive out yonder In pursuance of the determination I had come to I said no more about Crone to mister Lindsey I had made up my mind on a certain course and until it was taken I could not let out a word of what was by that time nobody s secret but mine to him nor to any one not even to Maisie Dunlop to whom purposely I had not as yet said anything about my seeing Sir Gilbert Carstairs on the night of Phillips s murder And all the way out to the inn there was silence between mister Lindsey and me and the event of the morning about Gilverthwaite s will and the odd circumstance of its attestation by Michael Carstairs was not once mentioned We kept silence indeed until we were in the place to which they had carried Crone s dead body mister Murray and Sergeant Chisholm had got there before us and with them was a doctor the same that had been fetched to Phillips and they were all talking together quietly when we went in The superintendent came up to mister Lindsey According to what the doctor here says he whispered jerking his head at the body which lay on a table with a sheet thrown over it there s a question as to whether the man met his death by drowning Look here He led us up to the table drew back the sheet from the head and face and motioning the doctor to come up pointed to a mark that was just between the left temple and the top of the ear where the hair was wearing thin D ye see that now he murmured You ll notice there s some sort of a weapon penetrated there penetrated But the doctor can say more than I can on that point The man was struck felled by some sort of a weapon said the doctor It s penetrated I should say from mere superficial examination to the brain You ll observe there s a bruise outwardly aye but this has been a sharp weapon as well something with a point and there s the puncture how far it may extend I can t tell yet But on the surface of things mister Lindsey I should incline to the opinion that the poor fellow was dead or dying when he was thrown into yon pool Anyway after a blow like that he d be unconscious But I m thinking he was dead before the water closed on him mister Lindsey looked closer at the mark and at the hole in the centre of it Has it struck any of you how that could be caused he asked suddenly It hasn t Then I ll suggest something to you There s an implement in pretty constant use hereabouts that would do just that a salmon gaff The two police officials started the doctor nodded his head Aye and that s a sensible remark said he A salmon gaff would just do it He turned to Chisholm with a sharp look You were saying this man was suspected of poaching he asked Likely it ll have been some poaching affair he was after last night him and others And they may have quarrelled and come to blows and there you are Were there any signs of an affray close by or near on the bank asked mister Lindsey We re going down there now ourselves to have a look round answered mister Murray But according to Turndale the body was lying in a deep pool in the Till under the trees on the bank it might have lain there for many a month if it hadn t been for yon young McIlwraith that has a turn for prying into dark and out of the way corners Well here s more matter for the coroner mister Lindsey and I went back to Berwick after that And once more he said little on the journey except that it would be well if it came out that this was but a poaching affair in which Crone had got across with some companion of his and for the rest of the afternoon he made no further remark to me about the matter nor about the discovery of the morning But as I was leaving the office at night he gave me a word Say nothing about that will to anybody said he I ll think that matter over to night and see what ll come of my thinking It s as I said before Hugh to get at the bottom of all this we ll have to go back maybe a far way I said nothing and went home For now I had work of my own I was going to what I had resolved on after Chisholm told me the news about Crone I would not tell my secret to mister Lindsey nor to the police nor even to Maisie I would go straight and tell it to the one man whom it concerned Sir Gilbert Carstairs I would speak plainly to him and be done with it And as soon as I had eaten my supper I mounted my bicycle and as the dusk was coming on rode off to Hathercleugh House CHAPTER XIII SIR GILBERT CARSTAIRS It was probably with a notion of justifying my present course of procedure to myself that during that ride I went over the reasons which had kept my tongue quiet up to that time and now led me to go to Sir Gilbert Carstairs Why I had not told the police nor mister Lindsey of what I had seen I have already explained my own natural caution and reserve made me afraid of saying anything that might cast suspicion on an innocent man and also I wanted to await developments I was not concerned much with that feature of the matter But I had undergone some qualms because I had not told Maisie Dunlop for ever since the time at which she and I had come to a serious and sober understanding it had been a settled thing between us that we would never have any secrets from each other Why then had I not told her of this That took a lot of explaining afterwards when things so turned out that it would have been the best thing ever I did in my life if I only had confided in her but this explanation was after all to my credit I did not tell Maisie because I knew that taking all the circumstances into consideration she would fill herself with doubts and fears for me and would for ever be living in an atmosphere of dread lest I like Phillips should be found with a knife thrust in me So much for that it was in Maisie s own interest And why after keeping silence to everybody did I decide to break it to Sir Gilbert Carstairs There Andrew Dunlop came in of course unawares to himself For in those lecturings that he was so fond of giving us young folk there was a moral precept of his kept cropping up which he seemed to set great store by If you ve anything against a man or reason to mistrust him he would say don t keep it to yourself or hint it to other people behind his back but go straight to him and tell him to his face and have it out with him He was a wise man Andrew Dunlop as all his acquaintance knew and I felt that I could do no better than take a lesson from him in this matter So I would go straight to Sir Gilbert Carstairs and tell him what was in my mind let the consequences be what they might It was well after sunset and the gloaming was over the hills and the river when I turned into the grounds of Hathercleugh and looked round me at a place which though I had lived close to it ever since I was born I had never set foot in before The house stood on a plateau of ground high above Tweed with a deep shawl of wood behind it and a fringe of plantations on either side house and pleasure grounds were enclosed by a high ivied wall on all sides you could see little of either until you were within the gates It looked in that evening light a romantic and picturesque old spot and one in which you might well expect to see ghosts or fairies or the like The house itself was something between an eighteenth century mansion and an old Border fortress its centre part was very high in the roof and had turrets with outer stairs to them at the corners the parapets were embattled and in the turrets were arrow slits But romantic as the place was there was nothing gloomy about it and as I passed to the front between the grey walls and a sunk balustered garden that lay at the foot of a terrace I heard through the open windows of one brilliantly lighted room the click of billiard balls and the sound of men s light hearted laughter and through another the notes of a piano There was a grand butler man met me at the hall door and looked sourly at me as I leaned my bicycle against one of the pillars and made up to him He was sourer still when I asked to see his master and he shook his head at me looking me up and down as if I were some undesirable You can t see Sir Gilbert at this time of the evening said he What do you want Will you tell Sir Gilbert that mister Moneylaws clerk to mister Lindsey solicitor wishes to see him on important business I answered looking him hard in the face I think he ll be quick to see me when you give him that message He stared and growled at me a second or two before he went off with an ill grace leaving me on the steps But as I had expected he was back almost at once and beckoning me to enter and follow him And follow him I did past more flunkeys who stared at me as if I had come to steal the silver and through soft carpeted passages to a room into which he led me with small politeness You re to sit down and wait he said gruffly Sir Gilbert will attend to you presently He closed the door on me and I sat down and looked around I was in a small room that was filled with books from floor to ceiling big books and little in fine leather bindings and the gilt of their letterings and labels shining in the rays of a tall lamp that stood on a big desk in the centre It was a fine room that with everything luxurious in the way of furnishing and appointments you could have sunk your feet in the warmth of the carpets and rugs and there were things in it for comfort and convenience that I had never heard tell of I had never been in a rich man s house before and the grandeur of it and the idea that it gave one of wealth made me feel that there s a vast gulf fixed between them that have and them that have not And in the middle of these philosophies the door suddenly opened and in walked Sir Gilbert Carstairs and I stood up and made my politest bow to him He nodded affably enough and he laughed as he nodded Oh said he mister Moneylaws I ve seen you before at that inquest the other day I think Didn t I That is so Sir Gilbert I answered I was there with mister Lindsey Why of course and you gave evidence he said I remember Well and what did you want to see me about mister Moneylaws Will you smoke a cigar he went on picking up a box from the table and holding it out to me Help yourself Thank you Sir Gilbert I answered but I haven t started that yet Well then I will he laughed and he picked out a cigar lighted it and flinging himself into an easy chair motioned me to take another exactly opposite to him Now then fire away he said Nobody ll interrupt us and my time s yours You ve some message for me I took a good look at him before I spoke He was a big fine handsome man some five and fifty years of age I should have said but uncommonly well preserved a clean shaven powerful faced man with quick eyes and a very alert glance maybe if there was anything struck me particularly about him it was the rapidity and watchfulness of his glances the determination in his square jaw and the extraordinary strength and whiteness of his teeth He was quick at smiling and quick too in the use of his hands which were always moving as he spoke as if to emphasize whatever he said And he made a very fine and elegant figure as he sat there in his grand evening clothes and I was puzzled to know which struck me most the fact that he was what he was the seventh baronet and head of an old family or the familiar easy good natured fashion which he treated me and talked to me as if I had been a man of his own rank I had determined what to do as I sat waiting him and now that he had bidden me to speak I told him the whole story from start to finish beginning with Gilverthwaite and ending with Crone and sparing no detail or explanation of my own conduct He listened in silence and with more intentness and watchfulness than I had ever seen a man show in my life and now and then he nodded and sometimes smiled and when I had made an end he put a sharp question So beyond Crone who I hear is dead you ve never told a living soul of this he asked eyeing me closely Not one Sir Gilbert I assured him Not even Not even who he inquired quickly Not even my own sweetheart I said And it s the first secret ever I kept from her He smiled at that and gave me a quick look as if he were trying to get a fuller idea of me Well he said and you did right Not that I should care two pins mister Moneylaws if you d told all this out at the inquest But suspicion is easily aroused and it spreads aye like wildfire And I m a stranger as it were in this country so far and there s people might think things that I wouldn t have them think and in short I m much obliged to you And I ll tell you frankly as you ve been frank with me how I came to be at those cross roads at that particular time and on that particular night It s a simple explanation and could be easily corroborated if need be I suffer from a disturbing form of insomnia sleeplessness it s a custom of mine to go long walks late at night Since I came here I ve been out that way almost every night as my servants could assure you I walk as a rule from nine o clock to twelve to induce sleep And on that night I d been miles and miles out towards Yetholm and back and when you saw me with my map and electric torch I was looking for the nearest turn home I m not too well acquainted with the Border yet he concluded with a flash of his white teeth and I have to carry a map with me And that s how it was and that s all I rose out of my chair at that He spoke so readily and ingenuously that I had no more doubt of the truth of what he was saying than I had of my own existence Then it s all for me too Sir Gilbert said I I shan t say a word more of the matter to anybody It s as if it never existed I was thinking all the time there d be an explanation of it So I ll be bidding you good night Sit you down again a minute said he pointing to the easy chair No need for hurry You re a clerk to mister Lindsey the solicitor I am that I answered Are you articled to him he asked No said I I m an ordinary clerk of seven years standing Plenty of experience of office work and routine he inquired Aye I replied No end of that Sir Gilbert Are you good at figures and accounts he asked I ve kept all mister Lindsey s and a good many trust accounts for the last five years I answered wondering what all this was about In fact you re thoroughly well up in all clerical matters he suggested Keeping books writing letters all that sort of thing I can honestly say I m a past master in everything of that sort I affirmed He gave me a quick glance as if he were sizing me up altogether Well I ll tell you what mister Moneylaws he said The fact is I m wanting a sort of steward and it strikes me that you re just the man I m looking for CHAPTER XIV DEAD MAN S MONEY I was so much amazed by this extraordinary suggestion that for the moment I could only stand staring at him and before I could find my tongue he threw a quick question at me Lindsey wouldn t stand in your way would he he asked Such jobs don t go begging you know mister Lindsey wouldn t stand in my way Sir Gilbert I answered But But what said he seeing me hesitate Is it a post you wouldn t care about then There s five hundred a year with it and a permanency Strange as it may seem considering all the circumstances it never occurred to me for one moment that the man was buying my silence buying me There wasn t the ghost of such a thought in my head I let out what was there in my next words I d like such a post fine Sir Gilbert I said What I m thinking of could I give satisfaction He laughed at that as if my answer amused him Well there s nothing like a spice of modesty Moneylaws said he If you can do all we ve just talked of you ll satisfy me well enough I like the looks of you and I m sure you re the sort that ll do the thing thoroughly The post s at your disposal if you like to take it I was still struggling with my amazement Five hundred pounds a year and a permanency It seemed a fortune to a lad of my age And I was trying to find the right words in which to say all that I felt when he spoke again Look here he said Don t let us arrange this as if we d done it behind your present employer s back I wouldn t like mister Lindsey to think I d gone behind him to get you Let it be done this way I ll call on mister Lindsey myself and tell him I m wanting a steward for the property and that I ve heard good reports of his clerk and that I ll engage you on his recommendation He s the sort that would give you a strong word by way of reference eh Oh he ll do that Sir Gilbert I exclaimed Anything that ll help me on Then let s leave it at that said he I ll drop in on him at his office perhaps to morrow In the meantime keep your own counsel But you ll take my offer I d be proud and glad to Sir Gilbert said I And if you ll make allowance for a bit of inexperience You ll do your best eh he laughed That s all right Moneylaws He walked out with me to the door and on to the terrace And as I wheeled my bicycle away from the porch he took a step or two alongside me his hands in his pockets his lips humming a careless tune And suddenly he turned on me Have you heard any more about that affair last night he asked I mean about Crone Nothing Sir Gilbert I answered I hear that the opinion is that the man was struck down by a gaff he remarked And perhaps killed before he was thrown into the Till So the doctor seemed to think I said And the police too I believe Aye well said he I don t know if the police are aware of it but I m very sure there s night poaching of salmon going on hereabouts Moneylaws I ve fancied it for some time and I ve had thoughts of talking to the police about it But you see my land doesn t touch either Till or Tweed so I haven t cared to interfere But I m sure that it is so and it wouldn t surprise me if both these men Crone and Phillips met their deaths at the hands of the gang I m thinking of It s a notion that s worth following up anyway and I ll have a word with Murray about it when I m in the town tomorrow Then with a brief good night he left me and went into the house and I got outside Hathercleugh and rode home in a whirl of thoughts And I ll confess readily that those thoughts had little to do with what Sir Gilbert Carstairs had last talked about they were not so much of Phillips nor of Crone nor of his suggestion of a possible gang of night poachers as about myself and this sudden chance of a great change in my fortunes For when all is said and done we must needs look after ourselves and when a young man of the age I was then arrived at is asked if he would like to exchange a clerkship of a hundred and twenty a year for a stewardship at more than four times as much as a permanency you must agree that his mind will fix itself on what such an exchange means to him to the exclusion of all other affairs Five hundred a year to me meant all sorts of fine things independence and a house of my own and not least by a long way marriage with Maisie Dunlop And it was a wonder that I managed to keep cool and to hold my tongue when I got home but hold it I did and to some purpose and more than once During the half hour which I managed to get with Maisie last thing that night she asked me why I was so silent and hard though it was to keep from doing so I let nothing out The truth was Sir Gilbert Carstairs had fascinated me not only with his grand offer but with his pleasant off hand companionable manners He had put me at my ease at once he had spoken so frankly and with such evident sincerity about his doings on that eventful night that I accepted every word he said And in the little that I had thought of it I was very ready to accept his theory as to how those two men had come by their deaths and it was one that was certainly feasible and worth following up Some years before I remembered something of the same sort had gone on and had resulted in an affray between salmon poachers and river watchers why should it not have cropped up again The more I thought of it the more I felt Sir Gilbert s suggestion to have reason in it And in that case all the mystery would be knocked clean out of these affairs the murder of Phillips the death of Crone might prove to be the outcome of some vulgar encounter between them and desperadoes who had subsequently scuttled to safety and were doubtless quaking near at hand in fear of their misdeeds coming to light what appeared to be a perfect tangle might be the simplest matter in the world So I judged and next morning there came news that seemed to indicate that matters were going to be explained on the lines which Sir Gilbert had suggested Chisholm brought that news to our office just after mister Lindsey had come in He told it to both of us and from his manner of telling it we both saw I perhaps not so clearly as mister Lindsey that the police were already at their favourite trick of going for what seemed to them the obvious line of pursuit I m thinking we ve got on the right clue at last as regards the murder of yon man Phillips announced Chisholm with an air of satisfaction And if it is the right clue as it seems to be mister Lindsey there ll be no great mystery in the matter after all Just a plain case of murder for the sake of robbery that s it What s your clue asked mister Lindsey quietly Well answered Chisholm with a sort of sly wink you ll understand mister Lindsey that we haven t been doing nothing these last few days since yon inquest on Phillips you know As a matter of fact we ve been making inquiries wherever there seemed a chance of finding anything out And we ve found something out through one of the banks yonder at Peebles He looked at us as if to see if we were impressed seeing at any rate that we were deeply interested he went on It appears I ll tell you the story in order as it were he said it appears that about eight months ago the agent of the British Linen Bank at Peebles got a letter from one John Phillips written from a place called Colon in Panama that s Central America as you ll be aware enclosing a draft for three thousand pounds on the International Banking Corporation of New York The letter instructed the Peebles agent to collect this sum and to place it in his bank to the writer s credit Furthermore it stated that the money was to be there until Phillips came home to Scotland in a few months time from the date of writing This of course was all done in due course there was the three thousand pounds in Phillips s name There was a bit of correspondence between him at Colon and the bank at Peebles then at last he wrote that he was leaving Panama for Scotland and would call on the bank soon after his arrival And on the morning of the day on which he was murdered Phillips did call at the bank and established his identity and so on and he then drew out five hundred pounds of his money two hundred pounds in gold and the rest in small notes and mister Lindsey he carried that sum away with him in a little handbag that he had with him mister Lindsey who had been listening with great attention nodded Aye he said Carried five hundred pounds away with him Go on then Now continued Chisholm evidently very well satisfied with himself for the way he was marshalling his facts we that is to put it plainly I myself have been making more searching inquiries about Cornhill and Coldstream There s two of the men at Cornhill station will swear that when Phillips got out of the train there that evening of the murder he was carrying a little handbag such as the bank cashier remembers a small new brown leather bag They re certain of it the ticket collector remembers him putting it under his arm while he searched his pocket for his ticket And what s more the landlord of the inn across the bridge there at Coldstream he remembers the bag clearly enough and that Phillips never had his hand off it while he was in his house And of course mister Lindsey the probability is that in that bag was the money just as he had drawn it out of the bank You ve more to tell remarked mister Lindsey Just so replied Chisholm And there s two items First of all we ve found that bag Empty you may be sure In the woods near that old ruin on Till side Thrown away under a lot of stuff dead stuff you ll understand where it might have lain till Doomsday if I hadn t had a most particular search made But that s not all The second item is here the railway folk at Cornhill are unanimous in declaring that by that same train which brought Phillips there two men strangers that looked like tourist gentlemen came as well whose tickets were from where d ye think then mister Lindsey Peebles of course answered mister Lindsey And you ve guessed right exclaimed Chisholm triumphantly Peebles it was and now how do you think this affair looks There s so many tourists on Tweedside this time of the year that nobody paid any great attention that night to these men nor where they went But what could be plainer d ye think of course those two had tracked Phillips from the bank and they followed him till they had him in yon place where he was found and they murdered him to rob him CHAPTER XV FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR It was very evident that Chisholm was in a state of gleeful assurance about his theory and I don t think he was very well pleased when mister Lindsey instead of enthusiastically acclaiming it as a promising one began to ask him questions You found a pretty considerable sum on Phillips as it was when you searched his body didn t you he asked Aye a good lot assented Chisholm But it was in a pocket book in an inner pocket of his coat and in his purse If it was robbery why didn t they take everything inquired mister Lindsey Aye I knew you d ask that replied Chisholm But the thing is that they were interrupted The bag they could carry off but it s probable that they heard mister Moneylaws here coming down the lane before they could search the man s pockets Umph said mister Lindsey And how do you account for two men getting away from the neighbourhood without attracting attention Easy enough declared Chisholm As I said just now there s numbers of strangers comes about Tweedside at this time of the year and who d think anything of seeing them What was easier than for these two to separate to keep close during the rest of the night and to get away by train from some wayside station or other next morning They could manage it easily and we re making inquiries at all the stations in the district on both sides the Tweed with that idea Well you ll have a lot of people to follow up then remarked mister Lindsey drily If you re going to follow every tourist that got on a train next morning between Berwick and Wooler and Berwick and Kelso and Berwick and Burnmouth and Berwick and Blyth you ll have your work set I m thinking All the same said Chisholm doggedly that s how it s been And the bank at Peebles has the numbers of the notes that Phillips carried off in his little bag and I ll trace those fellows yet mister Lindsey Good luck to you sergeant answered mister Lindsey He turned to me when Chisholm had gone That s the police all over Hugh he remarked And you might talk till you were black in the face to yon man and he d stick to his story You don t believe it then I asked him somewhat surprised He may be right he replied I m not saying Let him attend to his business and now we ll be seeing to ours It was a busy day with us in the office that being the day before court day and we had no time to talk of anything but our own affairs But during the afternoon at a time when I had left the office for an hour or two on business Sir Gilbert Carstairs called and he was closeted with mister Lindsey when I returned And after they had been together some time mister Lindsey came out to me and beckoned me into a little waiting room that we had and shut the door on us and I saw at once from the expression on his face that he had no idea that Sir Gilbert and I had met the night before or that I had any notion of what he was going to say to me Hugh my lad said he clapping me on the shoulder you re evidently one of those that are born lucky What s the old saying Some achieve greatness some have greatness thrust upon them eh Here s greatness in a degree thrusting itself on you What s this you re talking about mister Lindsey I asked There s not much greatness about me I m thinking Well it s not what you re thinking in this case he answered it s what other folks are thinking of you Here s Sir Gilbert Carstairs in my room yonder He s wanting a steward somebody that can keep accounts and letters and look after the estate and he s been looking round for a likely man and he s heard that Lindsey s clerk Hugh Moneylaws is just the sort he wants and in short the job s yours if you like to take it And my lad it s worth five hundred a year and a permanency too A fine chance for a young fellow of your age Do you advise me to take it mister Lindsey I asked endeavouring to combine surprise with a proper respect for the value of his counsel It s a serious job that for as you say a young fellow Not if he s got your headpiece on him he replied giving me another clap on the shoulder I do advise you to take it I ve given you the strongest recommendations to him Go into my office now and talk it over with Sir Gilbert by yourself But when it comes to settling details call me in I ll see you re done right to I thanked him warmly and went into his room where Sir Gilbert was sitting in an easy chair He motioned me to shut the door and once that was done he gave a quick inquiring look You didn t let him know that you and I had talked last night he asked at once No said I That s right and I didn t either he went on I don t want him to know I spoke to you before speaking to him it would look as if I were trying to get his clerk away from him Well it s settled then Moneylaws You ll take the post I shall be very glad to Sir Gilbert said I And I ll serve you to the best of my ability if you ll have a bit of patience with me at the beginning There ll be some difference between my present job and this you re giving me but I m a quick learner and Oh that s all right man he interrupted carelessly You ll do all that I want I hate accounts and letter writing and all that sort of thing take all that off my hands and you ll do Of course whenever you re in a fix about anything come to me but I can explain all there is to do in an hour s talk with you at the beginning All right ask mister Lindsey to step in to me and we ll put the matter on a business footing mister Lindsey came in and took over the job of settling matters on my behalf And the affair was quickly arranged I was to stay with mister Lindsey another month so as to give him the opportunity of getting a new head clerk then I was to enter on my new duties at Hathercleugh I was to have five hundred pounds a year salary with six months notice on either side at the end of five years if I was still in the situation the terms were to be revised with a view to an increase and all this was to be duly set down in black and white These propositions of course were mister Lindsey s and Sir Gilbert assented to all of them readily and promptly He appeared to be the sort of man who is inclined to accept anything put before him rather than have a lot of talk about it And presently remarking that that was all right and he d leave mister Lindsey to see to it he rose to go but at the door paused and came back I m thinking of dropping in at the police station and telling Murray my ideas about that Crone affair he remarked It s my opinion mister Lindsey that there s salmon poaching going on hereabouts and if my land adjoined either Tweed or Till I d have spoken about it before There are queer characters about along both rivers at nights I know because I go out a good deal very late walking to try and cure myself of insomnia and I know what I ve seen It s my impression that Crone was probably mixed up with some gang and that his death arose out of an affray between them That s probable answered mister Lindsey There was trouble of that sort some years ago but I haven t heard of it lately Certainly it would be a good thing to start the idea in Murray s mind he might follow it up and find something out That other business the Phillips murder might have sprung out of the same cause suggested Sir Gilbert If those chaps caught a stranger in a lonely place The police have a theory already about Phillips remarked mister Lindsey They think he was followed from Peebles and murdered for the sake of money that he was carrying in a bag he had with him And my experience he added with a laugh is that if the police once get a theory of their own it s no use suggesting any other to them they ll ride theirs either till it drops or they get home with it Sir Gilbert nodded his head as if he agreed with that and he suddenly gave mister Lindsey an inquiring look What s your own opinion he asked But mister Lindsey was not to be drawn He laughed and shrugged his shoulders as if to indicate that the affair was none of his I wouldn t say that I have an opinion Sir Gilbert he answered It s much too soon to form one and I haven t the details and I m not a detective But all these matters are very simple when you get to the bottom of them The police think this is going to be a very simple affair mere vulgar murder for the sake of mere vulgar robbery We shall see Then Sir Gilbert went away and mister Lindsey looked at me who stood a little apart and he saw that I was thinking Well my lad he said a bit dazed by your new opening It s a fine chance for you too Now I suppose you ll be wanting to get married Is it that you re thinking about Well I was not mister Lindsey said I I was just wondering if you must know how it was that as he was here you didn t tell Sir Gilbert about that signature of his brother s that you found on Gilverthwaite s will He shared a sharp look between me and the door but the door was safely shut No he said Neither to him nor to anybody yet a while And don t you mention that my lad Keep it dark till I give the word I ll find out about that in my own way You understand on that point absolute silence I replied that of course I would not say a word and presently I went into the office to resume my duties But I had not been long at that before the door opened and Chisholm put his face within and looked at me I m wanting you mister Moneylaws he said You said you were with Crone buying something that night before his body was found You d be paying him money and he might be giving you change Did you happen to see his purse now Aye answered I What for do you ask that Because said he we ve taken a fellow at one of those riverside publics that s been drinking heavily and of course spending money freely And he has a queer looking purse on him and one or two men that s seen it vows and declares it was Abel Crone s CHAPTER XVI THE MAN IN THE CELL Before I could reply to Chisholm s inquiry mister Lindsey put his head out of his door and seeing the police sergeant there asked what he was after And when Chisholm had repeated his inquiry both looked at me I did see Crone s purse that night I answered an old thing that he kept tied up with a boot lace And he d a lot of money in it too Come round then and see if you can identify this that we found on the man requested Chisholm And he added turning to mister Lindsey there s another thing The man s sober enough now that we ve got him it s given him a bit of a pull together being arrested And he s demanding a lawyer Perhaps you ll come to him mister Lindsey Who is he asked mister Lindsey A Berwick man He isn t replied Chisholm He s a stranger a fellow that says he was seeking work and had been stopping at a common lodging house in the town He vows and declares that he d nothing to do with killing Crone and he s shouting for a lawyer mister Lindsey put on his hat and he and I went off with Chisholm to the police station And as we got in sight of it we became aware that there was a fine to do in the street before its door The news of the arrest had spread quickly and folk had come running to get more particulars And amongst the women and children and loafers that were crowding around was Crone s housekeeper a great heavy rough haired Irishwoman called Nance Maguire and she was waving her big arms and shaking her fists at a couple of policemen whom she was adjuring to bring out the murderer so that she might do justice on him then and there all this being mingled with encomiums on the victim The best man that ever lived she was screaming at the top of her voice The best and kindest creature ever set foot in your murdering town And didn t I know he was to be done to death by some of ye Didn t he tell me himself that there was one would give his two eyes to be seeing his corpse And if ye ve laid hands on him that did it bring him out to me so and I ll mister Lindsey laid a quiet hand on the woman s arm and twisted her round in the direction of her cottage Hold your wisht good wife and go home he whispered to her And if you know anything keep your tongue still till I come to see you Be away now and leave it to me I don t know how it was but Nance Maguire after a sharp look at mister Lindsey turned away as meekly as a lamb and went off tearful enough but quiet down the street followed by half the rabble while mister Lindsey Chisholm and myself turned into the police station And there we met mister Murray who wagged his head at us as if he were very well satisfied with something Not much doubt about this last affair anyhow said he as he took us into his office You might say the man was caught red handed All the same mister Lindsey he s in his rights to ask for a lawyer and you can see him whenever you like What are the facts asked mister Lindsey Let me know that much first mister Murray jerked his thumb at Chisholm The sergeant there knows them he answered He took the man It was this way d ye see mister Lindsey said Chisholm who was becoming an adept at putting statements before people You know that bit of a public there is along the river yonder outside the wall the Cod and Lobster Well James Macfarlane that keeps it he came to me maybe an hour or so ago and said there was a fellow a stranger had been in and out there all day since morning drinking and though he wouldn t say the man was what you d rightly call drunk still he d had a skinful and he was in there again and they wouldn t serve him and he was getting quarrelsome and abusive and in the middle of it had pulled out a purse that another man who was in there vowed and declared aside to Macfarlane was Abel Crone s So I got a couple of constables and went back with Macfarlane and there was the man vowing he d be served and with a handful of money to prove that he could pay for whatever he called for And as he began to turn ugly and show fight we just clapped the bracelets on him and brought him along and there he is in the cells and of course it s sobered him down and he s demanding his rights to see a lawyer Who is he asked mister Lindsey A stranger to the town replied Chisholm And he ll neither give name nor address but to a lawyer he declares But we know he was staying at one of the common lodging houses Watson s three nights ago and that the last two nights he wasn t in there at all Well where s that purse demanded mister Lindsey mister Moneylaws here says he can identify it if it s Crone s Chisholm opened a drawer and took out what I at once knew to be Abel Crone s purse which was in reality a sort of old pocket book or wallet of some sort of skin with a good deal of the original hair left on it and tied about with a bit of old bootlace There were both gold and silver in it just as I had seen when Crone pulled it out to find me some change for a five shilling piece I had given him and more by token there was the five shilling piece itself That s Crone s purse I exclaimed I ve no doubt about that And that s a crown piece I gave him myself I ve no doubt about that either Let us see the man said mister Lindsey Chisholm led us down a corridor to the cells and unlocked a door He stepped within the cell behind it motioning us to follow And there on the one stool which the place contained sat a big hulking fellow that looked like a navvy whose rough clothes bore evidence of his having slept out in them and whose boots were stained with the mud and clay which they would be likely to collect along the riverside He was sitting nursing his head in his hands growling to himself and he looked up at us as I have seen wild beasts look out through the bars of cages And somehow there was that in the man s eyes which made me think there and then that he was not reflecting on any murder that he had done but was sullenly and stupidly angry with himself Now then here s a lawyer for you said Chisholm mister Lindsey solicitor Well my man began mister Lindsey taking a careful look at this queer client What have you got to say to me The prisoner gave Chisholm a disapproving look Not going to say a word before the likes of him he growled I know my rights guv nor What I say I ll say private to you Better leave us sergeant said mister Lindsey He waited till Chisholm a bit unwilling had left the cell and closed the door and then he turned to the man Now then he continued you know what they charge you with You ve been drinking hard are you sober enough to talk sense Very well then what s this you want me for To defend me of course growled the prisoner He twisted a hand round to the back of his trousers as if to find something I ve money of my own a bit put away in a belt he said I ll pay you Never mind that now answered mister Lindsey Who are you and what do you want to say Name of John Carter replied the man General labourer navvy work anything of that sort On tramp seeking a job Came here going north night before last And no more to do with the murder of yon man than you have They found his purse on you anyway remarked mister Lindsey bluntly What have you got to say to that What I say is that I m a damned fool answered Carter surlily It s all against me I know but I ll tell you you can tell lawyers anything Who s that young fellow he demanded suddenly glaring at me I m not going to talk before no detectives My clerk replied mister Lindsey Now then tell your tale And just remember what a dangerous position you re in Know that as well as you do muttered the prisoner But I m sober enough now It s this way I stopped here in the town three nights since and looked about for a job next day and then I heard of something likely up the river and went after it and didn t get it so I started back here late at night it was And after crossing that bridge at a place called Twizel I turned down to the river bank thinking to take a short cut And it was well after dark then mind you guv nor in coming along through the woods just before where the little river runs into the big one I come across this man s body stumbled on it That s the truth Well said mister Lindsey He was lying I could show you the place easy between the edge of the wood and the river bank continued Carter And though he was dead enough when I found him guv nor he hadn t been dead so long But dead he was and not from aught of my doing What time was this asked mister Lindsey It would be past eleven o clock replied Carter It was ten when I called by Cornhill station I went the way I did down through the woods to the river bank because I d noticed a hut there in the morning that I could sleep in I was making for that when I found the body Well about the purse demanded mister Lindsey shortly No lies now The prisoner shook his head at that and growled but it was evident he was growling at himself That s right enough he confessed I felt in his pockets and I did take the purse But I didn t put him in the water True as I m here guv nor I did no more than take the purse I left him there just as he was and the next day I got drinking and last night I stopped in that hut again and today I was drinking pretty heavy and I sort of lost my head and pulled the purse out and that s the truth anyway whether you believe it or not But I didn t kill yon man though I ll admit I robbed his body like the fool I am Well you see where it s landed you remarked mister Lindsey All right hold your tongue now and I ll see what I can do I ll appear for you when you come before the magistrate tomorrow He tapped at the door of the cell and Chisholm who had evidently waited in the corridor let us out mister Lindsey said nothing to him nor to the superintendent he led me away into the street And there he clapped me on the arm I believe every word that man said he murmured Come on now we ll see this Nance Maguire CHAPTER XVII THE IRISH HOUSEKEEPER I was a good deal surprised that mister Lindsey should be apparently so anxious to interview Crone s housekeeper and I said as much He turned on me sharply with a knowing look Didn t you hear what the woman was saying when we came across her there outside the police station he exclaimed She was saying that Crone had said to her that there was some man who would give his two eyes to be seeing his corpse Crone s been telling her something And I m so convinced that that man in the cells yonder has told us the truth as regards himself that I m going to find out what Crone did tell her Who is there who could there be that wanted to see Crone s dead body Let s try to find that out I made no answer but I was beginning to think and to wonder too in a vague not very pleasant fashion Was this was Crone s death murder whatever it was at all connected with the previous affair of Phillips Had Crone told me the truth that night I went to buy the stuff for Tom Dunlop s rabbit hutches or had he kept something back And while I was reflecting on these points mister Lindsey began talking again I watched that man closely when he was giving me his account of what happened he said and as I said just now I believe he told us the truth Whoever it was that did Crone to death he s not in that cell Hugh my lad and unless I m much mistaken all this is of a piece with Phillips s murder But let s hear what this Irishwoman has to say Crone s cottage was a mean miserable shanty sort of place down a narrow alley in a poor part of the town When we reached its door there was a group of women and children round it all agog with excitement But the door itself was closed and it was not opened to us until Nance Maguire s face had appeared at the bit of a window and Nance had assured herself of the identity of her visitors And when she had let us in she shut the door once more and slipped a bolt into its socket I an t said a word your honour said she since your honour told me not to though them outside is sharp on me to tell em this and that And I wouldn t have said what I did up yonder had I known your honour would be for supporting me I was feeling there wasn t a soul in the place would see justice done for him that s gone the poor good man If you want justice my good woman remarked mister Lindsey keep your tongue quiet and don t talk to your neighbours nor to the police just keep anything you know till I tell you to let it out Now then what s this you were saying that Crone told you there was a man in the place would give his two eyes to see him a corpse Them very words your honour and not once nor twice but a good many times did he say it replied the woman It was a sort of hint he was giving me your honour he had that way of speaking Since when did he give you such hints asked mister Lindsey Was it only lately It was since that other bloody murder your honour said Nance Maguire Only since then He would talk of it as we sat over the fire there at nights There s murder in the air says he Bloody murder is all around us he says And it s myself will have to pick my steps careful he says for there s him about would give his two eyes to see me a stark and staring corpse he says Me knowing he says more than you d give me credit for says he And not another word than them could I get out of him your honour He never told you who the man was that he had his fears of inquired mister Lindsey He did not then your honour replied Nance He was a close man and you wouldn t be getting more out of him than he liked to tell Now then just tell me the truth about a thing or two said mister Lindsey Crone used to be out at nights now and then didn t he Indeed then he did so your honour she answered readily Tis true he would be out at nights now and again Poaching as a matter of fact suggested mister Lindsey And that s the truth your honour she assented He was a clever hand with the rabbits Aye but did he never bring home a salmon now asked mister Lindsey Come out with it I ll not deny that neither your honour admitted the woman He was clever at that too Well now about that night when he was supposed to be killed continued mister Lindsey that s Tuesday last this being Thursday Did he ever come home that evening from his shop I had been listening silently all this time and I listened with redoubled attention for the woman s answer to the last question It was on the Tuesday evening about nine o clock that I had had my talk with Crone and I was anxious to know what happened after that And Nance Maguire replied readily enough it was evident her memory was clear on these events He did not then she said He was in here having his tea at six o clock that evening and he went away to the shop when he d had it and I never put my eyes on him again alive your honour He was never home that night and he didn t come to his breakfast next morning and he wasn t at the shop and I never heard this or that of him till they come and tell me the bad news I knew then what must have happened After I had left him Crone had gone away up the river towards Tillmouth he had a crazy old bicycle that he rode about on And most people having heard Nance Maguire s admissions would have said that he had gone poaching But I was not so sure of that I was beginning to suspect that Crone had played some game with me and had not told me anything like the truth during our conversation There had been more within his knowledge than he had let out but what was it And I could not help feeling that his object in setting off in that direction immediately after I had left him might have been not poaching but somebody to whom he wished to communicate the result of his talk with me And in that case who was the somebody But just then I had to leave my own thoughts and speculations alone and to attend to what was going on between my principal and Nance Maguire mister Lindsey however appeared to be satisfied with what he had heard He gave the woman some further advice about keeping her tongue still told her what to do as regards Crone s effects and left the cottage And when we were out in the main street again on our way back to the office he turned to me with a look of decision I ve come to a definite theory about this affair Hugh he said And I ll lay a fiver to a farthing that it s the right one Yes mister Lindsey said I keenly interested at hearing that Crone knew who killed Phillips he said And the man who killed Phillips killed Crone too because Crone knew That s been the way of it my lad And now then who s the man I could make no reply to such a question and presently he went on talking as much to himself I think as to me I wish I knew certain things he muttered I wish I knew what Phillips and Gilverthwaite came here for I wish I knew if Gilverthwaite ever had any secret dealings with Crone I wish I do wish I knew if there has been if there is a third man in this Phillips Gilverthwaite affair who has managed and is managing to keep himself in the background But I ll stake my professional reputation on one thing whoever killed Phillips killed Abel Crone It s all of a piece Now of course I know now have known for many a year that it was at this exact juncture that I made a fatal a reprehensible mistake in my share of all this business It was there at that exact point that I ought to have made a clean breast to mister Lindsey of everything that I knew I ought to have told him there and then of what I had seen at the cross roads that night of the murder of Phillips and of my conversation about that with Abel Crone at his shop and of my visit to Sir Gilbert Carstairs at Hathercleugh House Had I done so matters would have become simplified and much more horror and trouble avoided for mister Lindsey was just then at the beginning of a straight track and my silence turned him away from it to get into more twisted and obscure ones But I said nothing And why The answer is simple and there s the excuse of human nature in it I was so much filled with the grand prospects of my stewardship and of all it would bring me and was so highly pleased with Sir Gilbert Carstairs for his advancement of my fortunes that here s the plain truth I could not bring myself to think of or bother with anything else Up to then of course I had not said a word to my mother or to Maisie Dunlop of the stewardship I was impatient to tell both So I held my peace and said nothing to mister Lindsey and presently the office work for the day was over and I was free to race home with my grand news Is it likely that with such news as that I would be troubling my head any longer about other folks lives and deaths That I suppose was the most important evening I had ever spent in my life To begin with I felt as if I had suddenly become older and bigger and much more important I became inclined to adopt magisterial airs to my mother and my sweetheart laying down the law to them as to the future in a fashion which made Maisie poke fun at me for a crowing cockerel It was only natural that I should suffer a little from swelled head that night I should not have been human otherwise But Andrew Dunlop took the conceit out of me with a vengeance when Maisie and I told him the news and I explained everything to him in his back parlour He was at times a man of many words and at times a man of few words and when he said little he meant most Aye said he Well that s a fine prospect Hugh my man and I wish you well in it But there ll be no talk of any wedding for two years so get that notion out of your heads both of you In two years you ll just have got settled to your new job and you ll be finding out how you suit your master and how he suits you we ll get the preliminaries over and see how things promise in that time And we ll see too how much money you ve saved out of your salary my man so you ll just not hear the wedding bells calling for a couple of twelvemonths and ll behave yourselves like good children in the meanwhile There s a deal of things may happen in two years I m thinking He might have added that a deal of things may happen in two weeks and indeed he would have had good reason for adding it could he have looked a few days ahead CHAPTER XVIII THE ICE AX The police put Carter in the dock before a full bench of magistrates next morning and the court was so crowded that it was all mister Lindsey and I could do to force our way to the solicitors table Several minor cases came on before Carter was brought up from the cells and during this hearing I had leisure to look round the court and see who was there And almost at once I saw Sir Gilbert Carstairs who though not yet a justice of the peace his commission to that honourable office arrived a few days later oddly enough had been given a seat on the bench in company with one or two other local dignitaries one of whom I observed with some curiosity was that Reverend mister Ridley who had given evidence at the inquest on Phillips All these folk it was easy to see were in a high state of inquisitiveness about Crone s murder and from certain whispers that I overheard I gathered that the chief cause of this interest lay in a generally accepted opinion that it was as mister Lindsey had declared to me more than once all of a piece with the crime of the previous week And it was very easy to observe that they were not so curious to see Carter as to hear what might be alleged against him There appeared to be some general surprise when mister Lindsey quietly announced that he was there on behalf of the prisoner You would have thought from the demeanour of the police that in their opinion there was nothing for the bench to do but hear a bit of evidence and commit Carter straight away to the Assizes to take his trial for wilful murder What evidence they did bring forward was of course plain and straightforward enough Crone had been found lying in a deep pool in the River Till but the medical testimony showed that he had met his fate by a blow from some sharp instrument the point of which had penetrated the skull and the frontal part of the brain in such a fashion as to cause instantaneous death The man in the dock had been apprehended with Crone s purse in his possession therefore said the police he had murdered and robbed Crone As I say mister Murray and all of them as you could see were quite of the opinion that this was sufficient and I am pretty sure that the magistrates were of the same way of thinking And the police were not over well pleased and the rest of the folk in court were to say the least a little mystified when mister Lindsey asked a few questions of two witnesses of whom Chisholm was one and the doctor who had been fetched to Crone s body the other And before setting down what questions they were that mister Lindsey asked I will remark here that there was a certain something a sort of mysterious hinting in his manner of asking them that suggested a lot more than the mere questions themselves and made people begin to whisper amongst each other that Lawyer Lindsey knew things that he was not just then minded to let out It was to Chisholm that he put his first questions casually as if they were very ordinary ones and yet with an atmosphere of meaning behind them that excited curiosity You made a very exhaustive search of the neighbourhood of the spot where Crone s body was found didn t you he inquired A thorough search answered Chisholm You found the exact spot where the man had been struck down Judging by the marks of blood yes On the river bank between the river and a coppice wasn t it Just so between the bank and the coppice How far had the body been dragged before it was thrown into the river Ten yards replied Chisholm promptly Did you notice any footprints asked mister Lindsey It would be difficult to trace any explained Chisholm The grass is very thick in some places and where it isn t thick it s that close and wiry in texture that a boot wouldn t make any impression One more question said mister Lindsey leaning forward and looking Chisholm full in the face When you charged the man there in the dock with the murder of Abel Crone didn t he at once instantly show the greatest surprise Come now on your oath yes or no Yes admitted Chisholm he did But he just as readily admitted he was in possession of Crone s purse Again yes or no Yes said Chisholm Yes that s so That was all mister Lindsey asked Chisholm It was not much more that he asked the doctor But there was more excitement about what he did ask him arising out of something that he did in asking it There s been talk doctor as to what the precise weapon was which caused the fatal injury to this man Crone he said It s been suggested that the wound which occasioned his death might have been and probably was caused by a blow from a salmon gaff What is your opinion It might have been said the doctor cautiously It was certainly caused by a pointed weapon some sort of a spiked weapon suggested mister Lindsey A sharp pointed weapon most certainly affirmed the doctor There are other things than a salmon gaff that in your opinion could have caused it Oh of course said the doctor mister Lindsey paused a moment and looked round the court as if he were thinking over his next question Then he suddenly plunged his hand under the table at which he was standing and amidst a dead silence drew out a long narrow brown paper parcel which I had seen him bring to the office that morning Quietly while the silence grew deeper and the interest stronger he produced from this an object such as I had never seen before an implement or weapon about three feet in length its shaft made of some tough but evidently elastic wood furnished at one end with a strong iron ferrule and at the other with a steel head one extremity of which was shaped like a carpenter s adze while the other tapered off to a fine point He balanced this across his open palms for a moment so that the court might see it then he passed it over to the witness box Now doctor he said look at that which is one of the latest forms of the ice ax Could that wound have been caused by that or something very similar to it The witness put a forefinger on the sharp point of the head Certainly he answered It is much more likely to have been caused by such an implement as this than by a salmon gaff mister Lindsey reached out his hand for the ice ax and repossessing himself of it passed it and its brown paper wrapping to me Thank you doctor he said that s all I wanted to know He turned to the bench I wish to ask your worships if it is your intention on the evidence you have heard to commit the prisoner on the capital charge today he asked If it is I shall oppose such a course What I do ask knowing what I do is that you should adjourn this case for a week when I shall have some evidence to put before you which I think will prove that this man did not kill Abel Crone There was some discussion I paid little attention to it being considerably amazed at the sudden turn which things had taken and astonished altogether by mister Lindsey s production of the ice ax But the discussion ended in mister Lindsey having his own way and Carter was remanded in custody to be brought up again a week later and presently we were all out in the streets in groups everybody talking excitedly about what had just taken place and speculating on what it was that Lawyer Lindsey was after mister Lindsey himself however was more imperturbable and if anything cooler than usual He tapped me on the arm as we went out of court and at the same time took the parcel containing the ice ax from me Hugh he said there s nothing more to do today and I m going out of town at once until tomorrow You can lock up the office now and you and the other two can take a holiday I m going straight home and then to the station He turned hurriedly away in the direction of his house and I went off to the office to carry out his instructions There was nothing strange in his giving us a holiday it was a thing he often did in summer on fine days when we had nothing much to do and this was a gloriously fine day and the proceedings in court had been so short that it was not yet noon So I packed off the two junior clerks and the office lad and locked up and went away myself and in the street outside I met Sir Gilbert Carstairs He was coming along in our direction evidently deep in thought and he started a little as he looked up and saw me Hullo Moneylaws he said in his off hand fashion I was just wanting to see you I say he went on laying a hand on my arm you re dead certain that you ve never mentioned to a soul but myself anything about that affair of yours and Crone s you know what I mean Absolutely certain Sir Gilbert I answered There s no living being knows but yourself That s all right he said and I could see he was relieved I don t want mixing up with these matters I should very much dislike it What s Lindsey trying to get at in his defence of this man Carter I can t think I replied Unless it is that he s now inclining to the theory of the police that Phillips was murdered by some man or men who followed him from Peebles and that the same man or men murdered Crone I think that must be it there were some men tourists about who haven t been found yet He hesitated a moment and then glanced at our office door Lindsey in he asked No Sir Gilbert I replied He s gone out of town and given us a holiday Oh he said looking at me with a sudden smile You ve got a holiday have you Moneylaws Look here I m going for a run in my bit of a yacht come with me How soon can you be ready As soon as I ve taken my dinner Sir Gilbert I answered pleased enough at the invitation Would an hour do You needn t bother about your dinner he said I m having a lunch basket packed now at the hotel and I ll step in and tell them to put in enough for two Go and get a good thick coat and meet me down at the front in half an hour I ran off home told my mother where I was going and hurried away to the river side The Tweed was like a mirror flashing back the sunlight that day and out beyond its mouth the open sea was bright and blue as the sky above How could I foresee that out there in those far off dancing waters there was that awaiting me of which I can only think now when it is long past with fear and horror CHAPTER XIX MY TURN I had known for some time that Sir Gilbert Carstairs had a small yacht lying at one of the boathouses on the riverside indeed I had seen her before ever I saw him She was a trim graceful thing with all the appearance of an excellent sea boat and though she looked like a craft that could stand a lot of heavy weather she had the advantage of being so light in draught something under three feet that it was possible for her to enter the shallowest harbour I had heard that Sir Gilbert was constantly sailing her up and down the coast and sometimes going well out to sea in her On these occasions he was usually accompanied by a fisherlad whom he had picked up somehow or other this lad Wattie Mason was down by the yacht when I reached her and he gave me a glowering look when he found that I was to put his nose out for this time at any rate He hung around us until we got off as a hungry dog hangs around a table on the chance of a bone being thrown to him but he got no recognition from Sir Gilbert who though the lad had been useful enough to him before took no more notice of him that day than of one of the pebbles on the beach And if I had been more of a student of human nature I should have gained some idea of my future employer s character from that small circumstance and have seen that he had no feeling or consideration for anybody unless it happened to be serving and suiting his purpose But at that moment I was thinking of nothing but the pleasure of taking a cruise in the yacht in the company of a man in whom I was naturally interested I was passionately fond of the sea and had already learned from the Berwick sea going folk how to handle small craft and the management of a three oar vessel like this was an easy matter to me as I soon let Sir Gilbert know Once outside the river mouth with a nice light breeze blowing off the land we set squaresail mainsail and foresail and stood directly out to sea on as grand a day and under as fair conditions as a yachtsman could desire and when we were gaily bowling along Sir Gilbert bade me unpack the basket which had been put aboard from the hotel it was a long time he said since his breakfast and we would eat and drink at the outset of things If I had not been hungry myself the sight of the provisions in that basket would have made me so there was everything in there that a man could desire from cold salmon and cold chicken to solid roast beef and there was plenty of claret and whisky to wash it down with And considering how readily and healthily Sir Gilbert Carstairs ate and drank and how he talked and laughed while we lunched side by side under that glorious sky gliding away over a smooth innocent looking sea I have often wondered since if what was to come before nightfall came of deliberate intention on his part or from a sudden yielding to temptation when the chance of it arose and for the life of me I cannot decide But if the man had murder in his heart while he sat there at my side eating his good food and drinking his fine liquor and sharing both with me and pressing me to help myself to his generous provision if it was so I say then he was of an indescribable cruelty which it makes me cringe to think of and I would prefer to believe that the impulse to bring about my death came from a sudden temptation springing from a sudden chance And yet God knows it is a difficult problem to settle For this was what it came to and before sunset was reddening the western skies behind the Cheviots We went a long long way out far beyond the thirty fathom line which is as all sailors acquainted with those waters know a good seven miles from shore indeed as I afterwards reckoned we were more than twice that distance from Berwick pier end when the affair happened perhaps still further We had been tacking about all the afternoon first south then north not with any particular purpose but aimlessly We scarcely set eyes on another sail and at a little after seven o clock in the evening when there was some talk of going about and catching the wind which had changed a good deal since noon and was now coming more from the southeast we were in the midst of a great waste of sea in which I could not make out a sign of any craft but ours not even a trail of smoke on the horizon The flat of the land had long since disappeared the upper slopes of the Cheviots on one side of Tweed and of the Lammermoor Hills on the other only just showed above the line of the sea There was I say nothing visible on all that level of scarcely stirred water but our own sails set to catch whatever breeze there was when that happened which not only brought me to the very gates of death but in the mere doing of it gave me the greatest horror of any that I have ever known I was standing up at the moment one foot on the gunwale the other on the planking behind me carelessly balancing myself while I stared across the sea in search of some object which he this man that I trusted so thoroughly and in whose company I had spent so many pleasant hours that afternoon and who was standing behind me at the moment professed to see in the distance when he suddenly lurched against me as if he had slipped and lost his footing That was what I believed in that startling moment but as I went head first overboard I was aware that his fall was confined to a sprawl into the scuppers Overboard I went but he remained where he was And my weight I was weighing a good thirteen stone at that time being a big and hefty youngster carried me down and down into the green water for I had been shot over the side with considerable impetus And when I came up a couple of boat s lengths from the yacht expecting to find that he was bringing her up so that I could scramble aboard I saw with amazed and incredulous affright that he was doing nothing of the sort instead working at it as hard as he could go he was letting out a couple of reefs which he had taken up in the mainsail an hour before in another minute they were out the yacht moved more swiftly and springing to the tiller he deliberately steered her clear away from me I suppose I saw his purpose all at once Perhaps it drove me wild mad frenzied The yacht was going away from me fast faster good swimmer though I was it was impossible for me to catch up to her she was making her own length to every stroke I took and as she drew away he stood there one hand on the tiller the other in his pocket I have often wondered if it was fingering a revolver in there his eyes turned steadily on me And I began first to beg and entreat him to save me and then to shout out and curse him and at that and seeing that we were becoming further and further separated he deliberately put the yacht still more before the freshening wind and went swiftly away and looked at me no more So he left me to drown We had been talking a lot about swimming during the afternoon and I had told him that though I had been a swimmer ever since boyhood I had never done more than a mile at a stretch and then only in the river He knew therefore that he was leaving me a good fourteen miles from land with not a sail in sight not a chance of being picked up Was it likely that I could make land was there ever a probability of anything coming along that would sight me There was small likelihood anyway the likelihood was that long before the darkness had come on I should be exhausted give up and go down You may conceive with what anger and with what fierce resentment I watched this man and his yacht going fast away from me and with what despair too But even in that moment I was conscious of two facts I now knew that yonder was the probable murderer of both Phillips and Crone and that he was leaving me to die because I was the one person living who could throw some light on those matters and though I had kept silence up to then might be tempted or induced or obliged to do so he would silence me while he had so good a chance And the other was that although there seemed about as much likelihood of my ever seeing Berwick again as of being made King of England I must do my utmost to save my strength and my life I had a wealth of incentives Maisie my mother mister Lindsey youth the desire to live and now there was another added to them the desire to circumvent that cold hearted cruel devil who I was now sure had all along been up to some desperate game and to have my revenge and see justice done on him I was not going to give in without making a fight for it But it was a poor chance that I had and I was well aware of it There was small prospect of fishing boats or the like coming out that evening small likelihood of any coasting steamer sighting a bit of a speck like me All the same I was going to keep my chin up as long as possible and the first thing to do was to take care of my strength I made shift to divest myself of a heavy pea jacket that I was wearing and of the unnecessary clothing beneath it I got rid too of my boots And after resting a bit on my back and considering matters I decided to make a try for land I might perhaps meet some boat coming out I lifted my head well up and took a glance at what I could see and my heart sank at what I did see The yacht was a speck in the distance by that time and far beyond it the Cheviots and the Lammermoors were mere bits of grey outline against the gold and crimson of the sky One thought instantly filled and depressed me I was further from land than I had believed At this distance from it I have but confused and vague recollections of that night Sometimes I dream of it even now and wake sweating with fear In those dreams I am toiling and toiling through a smooth sea it is always a smooth oily slippery sea towards something to which I make no great headway Sometimes I give up toiling through sheer and desperate aching of body and limbs and let myself lie drifting into helplessness and a growing sleep And then in my dream I start to find myself going down into strange cavernous depths of shining green and I wake in my dream to begin fighting and toiling again against my compelling desire to give up I do not know how long I made a fight of it in reality it must have been for hours alternately swimming alternately resting myself by floating I had queer thoughts It was then about the time that some men were attempting to swim the Channel I remember laughing grimly wishing them joy of their job they were welcome to mine I remember too that at last in the darkness I felt that I must give up and said my prayers and it was about that time when I was beginning to feel a certain numbness of mind as well as weariness of body that as I struck out in the mechanical and weakening fashion which I kept up from what little determination I had left I came across my salvation in the shape of a piece of wreckage that shoved itself against me in the blackness as if it had been some faithful dog pushing its nose into my hand to let me know it was there It was no more than a square of grating but it was heavy and substantial and as I clung to and climbed on to it I knew that it made all the difference to me between life and death CHAPTER XX THE SAMARITAN SKIPPER I clung to that heaven sent bit of wreckage exhausted and weary until the light began to break in the east 
1230-139216-0001	train-other-500	I was numbed and shivering with cold but I was alive and safe That square yard of good and solid wood was as much to me as if it had been a floating island And as the light grew and grew
1230-139216-0002	train-other-500	and the sun at last came up a ball of fire out of the far horizon I looked across the sea on all sides hoping to catch sight of a sail
none	none	 or of a wisp of smoke 
1230-139216-0003	train-other-500	of anything that would tell me of the near presence of human beings And one fact I realized at once I was further away from land than when I had begun my battle with death There was no sign of land in the west
1230-139216-0004	train-other-500	The sky was now clear and bright on all sides but there was nothing to break the line where it met the sea Before the fading of the light on the previous evening I had easily made out the well known outlines of the Cheviots on one hand and of Says Law on the other
none	none	 now there was not a vestige of either 
1230-139216-0005	train-other-500	I knew from that fact that I had somehow drifted further and further away from the coast There was accordingly nothing to do but wait the chance of being sighted and picked up
1230-139216-0006	train-other-500	and I set to work as well as I could on my tiny raft to chafe my limbs and get some warmth into my body And never in my life did I bless the sun as I did that morning for when he sprang out of bed in the northeast skies
1230-139216-0007	train-other-500	it was with his full and hearty vigour of high springtide and his heat warmed my chilled blood and sent a new glow of hope to my heart But that heat was not an unmixed blessing
none	none	 and I was already parched with thirst and as the sun mounted higher and higher pouring his rays full upon me the thirst became almost intolerable and my tongue felt as if my mouth could no longer contain it 
1230-139216-0008	train-other-500	It was perhaps one hour after sunrise when my agony was becoming almost insupportable that I first noticed a wisp of smoke on the southern rim of the circle of sea
none	none	 which just then was all my world 
1230-139216-0009	train-other-500	I never strained my eyes for anything as I did for that patch of grey against the cloudless blue It grew bigger and bigger I knew of course that it was some steamer gradually approaching
1230-139216-0010	train-other-500	But it seemed ages before I could make out her funnels ages before I saw the first bit of her black bulk show up above the level of the dancing waves Yet there she was at last
1230-139216-0011	train-other-500	coming bows on straight in my direction My nerves must have given out at the sight I remember the tears rolling down my cheeks I remember hearing myself make strange sounds which I suppose were those of relief and thankfulness
1230-139216-0012	train-other-500	And then the horror of being unseen of being left to endure more tortures of thirst
none	none	 of the steamer changing her course 
1230-139216-0013	train-other-500	fell on me and long before she was anywhere near me I was trying to balance myself on the grating so that I could stand erect and attract her attention She was a very slow going craft that
1230-139216-0014	train-other-500	not able to do more than nine or ten knots at best and another hour passed before she was anywhere near me But thank God she came within a mile of me and I made shift to stand up on my raft and to wave to her
1230-139216-0015	train-other-500	And thereon she altered her course and lumbered over in my direction She was one of the ugliest vessels that ever left a shipyard
none	none	 but I thought I had never seen anything so beautiful in my life as she looked in those moments 
1230-139216-0016	train-other-500	and I had certainly never been so thankful for anything as for her solid and dirty deck when willing and kindly hands helped me up on it Half an hour after that with dry clothes on me and hot coffee and rum inside me
1230-139216-0017	train-other-500	I was closeted with the skipper in his cabin telling him under a strict pledge of secrecy as much of my tale as I felt inclined to share with him
none	none	 He was a sympathetic and an understanding man 
1230-139216-0018	train-other-500	and he swore warmly and plentifully when he heard how treacherously I had been treated intimating it as the just then dearest wish of his heart to have the handling of the man who had played me the trick
none	none	 But you ll be dealing with him yourself said he Man you ll not spare him promise me you ll not spare him And you ll send me a newspaper with the full account of all that s done to him when you ve set the law to work dod I hope they ll quarter him 
1230-139216-0019	train-other-500	Them was grand days when there was more licence and liberty in punishing malefactors
none	none	 oh I d like fine to see this man put into boiling oil or something of that sort the cold hearted murdering villain You ll be sure to send me the newspaper I laughed for the first time since when 
1230-139216-0020	train-other-500	It seemed years since I had laughed and yet it was only a few hours after all Before I can set the law to work on him I must get on dry land captain I answered
none	none	 Where are you going 
1230-139216-0021	train-other-500	Dundee he replied Dundee and we re just between sixty and seventy miles away now and it s near seven o clock We ll be in Dundee early in the afternoon anyway
none	none	 And what ll you do there You ll be for getting the next train to Berwick I m not so sure captain I answered 
1230-139216-0022	train-other-500	I don t want that man to know I m alive yet It ll be a nice surprise for him later But there are those that I must let know as soon as possible so the first thing I ll do I ll wire And in the meantime
1230-139216-0023	train-other-500	let me have a sleep The steamer that had picked me up was nothing but a tramp plodding along with a general cargo from London to Dundee and its accommodation was as rough as its skipper was homely
1230-139216-0024	train-other-500	But it was a veritable palace of delight and luxury to me after that terrible night
none	none	 and I was soon hard and fast asleep in the skipper s own bunk 
1230-139216-0025	train-other-500	and was still asleep when he laid a hand on me at three o clock that afternoon
none	none	 We re in the Tay he said and we ll dock in half an hour And now you can t go ashore in your underclothing man And where s your purse 
1230-139216-0026	train-other-500	He had rightly sized up the situation
none	none	 I had got rid of everything but my singlet and drawers in the attempt to keep going as for my purse 
1230-139216-0027	train-other-500	that was where the rest of my possessions were sunk or floating
none	none	 You and me s about of a build he remarked I ll fit you up with a good suit that I have and lend you what money you want 
1230-139216-0028	train-other-500	But what is it you re going to do How long are you going to stop here in Dundee captain I asked Four days he answered I ll be discharging tomorrow and loading the next two days and then I ll be away again
1230-139216-0029	train-other-500	Lend me the clothes and a sovereign said I I ll wire to my principal the gentleman I told you about to come here at once with clothes and money so I ll repay you and hand your suit back first thing tomorrow morning when I ll bring him to see you
1230-139216-0030	train-other-500	He immediately pulled a sovereign out of his pocket and turning to a locker produced a new suit of blue serge and some necessary linen Aye he remarked a bit wonderingly
1230-139216-0031	train-other-500	You ll be for fetching him along here then And for what purpose I want him to take your evidence about picking me up I answered That s one thing and
none	none	 there s other reasons that we ll tell you about afterwards 
1230-139216-0032	train-other-500	And don t tell anybody here of what s happened and pass the word for silence to your crew It ll be something in their pockets when my friend comes along He was a cute man
1230-139216-0033	train-other-500	and he understood that my object was to keep the news of my escape from Sir Gilbert Carstairs
none	none	 and he promised to do what I asked And before long he and I being as he had observed very much of a size 
1230-139216-0034	train-other-500	and the serge suit fitting me very well I was in the streets of Dundee
none	none	 where I had never been before 
1230-139216-0035	train-other-500	seeking out a telegraph office
none	none	 and twiddling the skipper s sovereign between thumb and finger 
1230-139216-0036	train-other-500	while I worked out a problem that needed some little thought I must let my mother and Maisie know of my safety at once I must let mister Lindsey know too I knew what must have happened there at Berwick
1230-139216-0037	train-other-500	That monstrous villain would sneak home and say that a sad accident had happened me
none	none	 It made me grind my teeth and long to get my hands at his lying tongue 
1230-139216-0038	train-other-500	when I thought of what Maisie and my mother must have suffered after hearing his tales and excuses But I did not want him to know I was safe I did not want the town to know
none	none	 Should I telephone to mister Lindsey s office it was almost certain one of my fellow clerks there would answer the ring and recognize my voice 
1230-139216-0039	train-other-500	Then everything would be noised around And after thinking it all over I sent mister Lindsey a telegram in the following words hoping that he would fully understand
none	none	 Keep this secret from everybody Bring suit of clothes linen money mother and Maisie by next train to Dundee 
1230-139216-0040	train-other-500	Give post office people orders not to let this out
none	none	 most important H M I read that over half a dozen times before I finally dispatched it 
1230-139216-0041	train-other-500	It seemed all wrong somehow and all right in another way And however badly put it was it expressed my meaning So I handed it in and my borrowed sovereign with it
none	none	 and jingling the change which was given back to me 
1230-139216-0042	train-other-500	I went out of the telegraph office to stare around me It was a queer thing but I was now as light hearted as could be
none	none	 I caught myself laughing from a curious feeling of pleasure The truth was if you want to analyse the sources 
1230-139216-0043	train-other-500	I was vastly relieved to be able to get in touch with my own people Within an hour perhaps sooner they would have the news
none	none	 and I knew well that they would lose no time in setting off to me 
1230-139216-0044	train-other-500	And finding myself just then in the neighbourhood of the North British Railway Station I went in and managed to make out that if mister Lindsey was at the office when my wire arrived and acted promptly in accordance with it he and they
1230-139216-0045	train-other-500	could reach Dundee by a late train that evening That knowledge of course made me in a still more light hearted mood But there was another source of my satisfaction and complaisance
none	none	 things were in a grand way now 
1230-139216-0046	train-other-500	for my revenge on Sir Gilbert Carstairs and what had been a mystery was one no longer I went back to the dock where I had left the tramp steamer and told its good natured skipper what I had done
1230-139216-0047	train-other-500	for he was as much interested in the affair as if he had been my own brother And that accomplished I left him again and went sight seeing
none	none	 having been wonderfully freshened up and restored by my good sleep of the morning 
1230-139216-0048	train-other-500	I wandered up and down and about Dundee till I was leg weary and it was nearly six o clock of the afternoon And at that time being in Bank Street
none	none	 and looking about me for some place where I could get a cup of tea and a bite of food 
1230-139216-0049	train-other-500	I chanced by sheer accident to see a name on a brass plate fixed amongst more of the same sort on the outer door of a suite of offices That name was Gavin Smeaton
1230-139216-0050	train-other-500	I recalled it at once and moved by a sudden impulse I went climbing up a lot of steps
none	none	 to mister Gavin Smeaton s office CHAPTER XXI mister GAVIN SMEATON I walked into a room right at the top of the building wherein a young man of thirty or thereabouts was sitting at a desk putting together a quantity of letters which a lad standing at his side was evidently about to carry to the post He was a good looking alert businesslike sort of young man this of a superior type of countenance very well dressed and altogether a noticeable person What first struck me about him was that though he gave me a quick glance when having first tapped at his door and walked inside his office I stood there confronting him he finished his immediate concern before giving me any further attention It was not until he had given all the letters to the lad and bade him hurry off to the post that he turned to me with another sharp look and one word of interrogation Yes he said mister Gavin Smeaton asked I That s my name he answered What can I do for you Up to that moment I had not the least idea as to the exact reasons which had led me to climb those stairs The truth was I had acted on impulse And now that I was actually in the presence of a man who was obviously a very businesslike and matter of fact sort of person I felt awkward and tongue tied He was looking me over all the time as if there was a wonder in his mind about me and when I was slow in answering he stirred a bit impatiently in his chair My business hours are over for the day he said If it s business It s not business in the ordinary sense mister Smeaton I made shift to get out But it is business for all that The fact is you ll remember that the Berwick police sent you a telegram some days ago asking did you know anything about a man named John Phillips He showed a sudden interest at that and he regarded me with a slight smile You aren t a detective he inquired No I m a solicitor s clerk I replied From Berwick my principal mister Lindsey has to do with that case He nodded at a pile of newspapers which stood with a heavy book on top of it on a side table near his desk So I see from these papers he remarked I ve read all I could about the affairs of both Phillips and Crone ever since I heard that my name and address had been found on Phillips Has any further light been thrown on that Of course there was nothing much in my name and address being found on the man nor would there be if they were found on any man As you see I m a general agent for various sorts of foreign merchandise and this man had likely been recommended to me especially if he was from America There s been no further light on that matter mister Smeaton I answered He had pointed me to a chair at his desk side by that time and we were mutually inspecting each other Nothing more has been heard on that point Then have you come purposely to see me about it he asked Not at all said I I was passing along this street below and I saw your name on the door and I remembered it and so I just came up Oh he said looking at me rather blankly You re staying in Dundee taking a holiday I came to Dundee in a fashion I d not like to follow on any other occasion said I If a man hadn t lent me this suit of clothes and a sovereign I d have come ashore in my undergarments and without a penny He stared at me more blankly than ever when I let this out on him and suddenly he laughed What riddle s all this he asked It sounds like a piece out of a story book one of those tales of adventure Aye does it said I Only in my case mister Smeaton fact s been a lot stranger than fiction You ve read all about this Berwick mystery in the newspapers Every word seeing that I was mentioned he answered Then I ll give you the latest chapter I continued You ll know my name when you hear it Hugh Moneylaws It was I discovered Phillips s dead body I saw that he had been getting more and more interested as we talked at the mention of my name his interest obviously increased And suddenly he pulled a box of cigars towards him took one out and pushed the box to me Help yourself mister Moneylaws and go ahead he said I m willing to hear as many chapters as you like of this story I shook my head at the cigars and went on to tell him of all that had happened since the murder of Crone He was a good listener he took in every detail every point quietly smoking while I talked and never interrupting me And when I had made an end he threw up his head with a significant gesture that implied much That beats all the story books he exclaimed I m glad to see you re safe anyway mister Moneylaws and your mother and your young lady ll be glad too They will that mister Smeaton I said I m much obliged to you You think that man really meant you to drown he asked What would you think yourself mister Smeaton I replied Besides didn t I see his face as he got himself and his yacht away from me Yon man is a murderer It s a queer strange business he remarked nodding his head You ll be thinking now of course that it was he murdered both Phillips and Crone eh Aye I do think that said I What else And he wanted to silence me because I m the only living person that could let out about seeing him at the cross roads that night and could prove that Crone saw him too My own impression is that Crone went straight to him after his talk with me and paid the penalty That s likely he assented But what do you think made him turn on you so suddenly yesterday when things looked like going smoothly about everything and he d given you that stewardship which was of course to stop your mouth I ll tell you I said It was mister Lindsey s fault he let out too much at the police court Carstairs was there he d a seat on the bench and mister Lindsey frightened him Maybe it was yon ice ax mister Lindsey s got some powerful card up his sleeve about that what it is I don t know But I m certain now now that Carstairs took a fear into his head at those proceedings yesterday morning and he thought he d settle me once and for all before I could be drawn into it and forced to say things that would be against him I daresay you re right he agreed Well it is indeed a strange affair and there ll be some stranger revelations yet I d like to see this mister Lindsey you re sure he ll come to you here Aye unless there s been an earthquake between here and Tweed I declared He ll be here right enough mister Smeaton before many hours are over And he ll like to see you You can t think now of how or why yon Phillips man could have got that bit of letter paper of yours on him It was like that I added pointing to a block of memorandum forms that stood in his stationery case at the desk before him Just the same I can t said he But there s nothing unusual in that some correspondent of mine might have handed it to him torn it off one of my letters do you see I ve correspondents in a great many seaports and mercantile centres both here and in America These men will appear to have come from Central America I remarked They d seem to have been employed one way or another on that Panama Canal affair that there s been so much in the papers about these last few years You d notice that in the accounts mister Smeaton I did he replied And it interested me because I m from those parts myself I was born there He said that as if this fact was of no significance But the news made me prick up my ears Do you tell me that said I Where now if it s a fair question New Orleans near enough anyway to those parts he answered But I was sent across here when I was ten years old to be educated and brought up and here I ve been ever since But you re a Scotsman I made bold to ask him Aye on both sides though I was born out of Scotland he answered with a laugh And then he got out of his chair It s mighty interesting all this he went on But I m a married man and my wife ll be wanting dinner for me Now will you bring mister Lindsey to see me in the morning if he comes He ll come and I ll bring him I answered He ll be right glad to see you too for it may be mister Smeaton that there is something to be traced out of that bit of letter paper of yours yet It may be he agreed And if there s any help I can give it s at your disposal But you ll be finding this you re in a dark lane with some queer turnings in it before you come to the plain outcome of all this business We went down into the street together and after he had asked if there was anything he could do for me that night and I had assured him there was not we parted with an agreement that mister Lindsey and I should call at his office early next morning When he had left me I sought out a place where I could get some supper and that over I idled about the town until it was time for the train from the south to get in And I was on the platform when it came and there was my mother and Maisie and mister Lindsey and I saw at a glance that all that was filling each was sheer and infinite surprise My mother gripped me on the instant Hugh she exclaimed What are you doing here and what does all this mean Such a fright as you ve given us What s the meaning of it I was so taken aback having been certain that Carstairs would have gone home and told them I was accidentally drowned that all I could do was to stare from one to the other As for Maisie she only looked wonderingly at me as for mister Lindsey he gazed at me as scrutinizingly as my mother was doing Aye said he what s the meaning of it young man We ve done your bidding and more but why I found my tongue at that What I exclaimed Haven t you seen Sir Gilbert Carstairs Didn t you hear from him that We know nothing about Sir Gilbert Carstairs he interrupted The fact is my lad that until your wire arrived this afternoon nobody had even heard of you and Sir Gilbert Carstairs since you went off in his yacht yesterday Neither he nor the yacht have ever returned to Berwick Where are they CHAPTER XXII I READ MY OWN OBITUARY It was my turn to stare again and stare I did from one to the other in silence and being far too much amazed to find ready speech And before I could get my tongue once more my mother who was always remarkably sharp of eye got her word in What re you doing in that new suit of clothes she demanded And where s your own good clothes that you went away in yesterday noon I misdoubt this stewardship s leading you into some strange ways My own good clothes mother are somewhere in the North Sea retorted I Top or bottom sunk or afloat it s there you ll find them if you re more anxious about them than me Do you tell me that Carstairs has never been home I went on turning to mister Lindsey Then I don t know where he is nor his yacht either All I know is that he left me to drown last night a good twenty miles from land and that it s only by a special mercy of Providence that I m here Wherever he is yon man s a murderer I ve settled that mister Lindsey The women began to tremble and to exclaim at this news and to ask one question after another and mister Lindsey shook his head impatiently We can t stand talking our affairs in the station all night said he Let s get to an hotel my lad we re all wanting our suppers You don t seem as if you were in very bad spirits yourself I m all right mister Lindsey I answered cheerfully I ve been down to Jericho it s true and to worse but I chanced across a good Samaritan or two And I ve looked out a clean and comfortable hotel for you and we ll go there now I led them away to a good hotel that I had noticed in my walks and while they took their suppers I sat by and told them all my adventure to the accompaniment of many exclamations from my mother and Maisie But mister Lindsey made none and I was quick to notice that what most interested him was that I had been to see mister Gavin Smeaton But what for did you not come straight home when you were safely on shore again asked my mother who was thinking of the expense I was putting her to What s the reason of fetching us all this way when you re alive and well I looked at mister Lindsey knowingly I suppose Because mother I answered her I believed yon Carstairs would go back to Berwick and tell that there d been a sad accident and I was dead drowned and I wanted to let him go on thinking that I was dead and so I decided to keep away And if he is alive it ll be the best thing to let the man still go on thinking I was drowned as I ll prove to mister Lindsey there If Carstairs is alive I say it s the right policy for me to keep out of his sight and our neighbourhood Aye agreed mister Lindsey who was a quick hand at taking up things There s something in that Hugh Well it s beyond me all this observed my mother and it all comes of me taking yon Gilverthwaite into the house But me and Maisie ll away to our beds and maybe you and mister Lindsey ll get more light out of the matter than I can and glad I ll be when all this mystery s cleared up and we ll be able to live as honest folk should without all this flying about the country and spending good money I contrived to get a few minutes with Maisie however before she and my mother retired and I found then that had I known it I need not have been so anxious and disturbed For they had attached no particular importance to the fact that I had not returned the night before they had thought that Sir Gilbert had sailed his yacht in elsewhere and that I would be turning up later and there had been no great to do after me until my own telegram had arrived when of course there was consternation and alarm and nothing but hurry to catch the next train north But mister Lindsey had contrived to find out that nothing had been seen of Sir Gilbert Carstairs and his yacht at Berwick and to that point he and I at once turned when the women had gone to bed and I went with him into the smoking room while he had his pipe and his drop of whisky By that time I had told him of the secret about the meeting at the cross roads and about my interview with Crone at his shop and Sir Gilbert Carstairs at Hathercleugh when he offered me the stewardship and I was greatly relieved when mister Lindsey let me down lightly and said no more than that if I d told him these things at first there might have been a great difference But we re on the beginning of something he concluded That Sir Gilbert Carstairs has some connection with these murders I m now convinced but what it is I m not yet certain What I am certain about is that he took fright yesterday morning in our court when I produced that ice ax and asked the doctor those questions about it And I m sure of that too mister Lindsey said I And I ve been wondering what there was about yon ice ax that frightened him You ll know that yourself of course Aye but I m not going to tell you he answered You ll have to await developments on that point my man And now we ll be getting to bed and in the morning we ll see this mister Gavin Smeaton It would be a queer thing now wouldn t it if we got some clue to all this through him But I m keenly interested in hearing that he comes from the other side of the Atlantic Hugh for I ve been of opinion that it s across there that the secret of the whole thing will be found They had brought me a supply of clothes and money with them and first thing in the morning I went off to the docks and found my Samaritan skipper and gave him back his sovereign and his blue serge suit with my heartiest thanks and a promise to keep him fully posted up in the development of what he called the case And then I went back to breakfast with the rest of them and at once there was the question of what was to be done My mother was all for going homeward as quickly as possible and it ended up in our seeing her and Maisie away by the next train mister Lindsey having made both swear solemnly that they would not divulge one word of what had happened nor reveal the fact that I was alive to any living soul but Andrew Dunlop who of course could be trusted And my mother agreed though the proposal was anything but pleasant or proper to her You re putting on me more than any woman ought to be asked to bear mister Lindsey said she as we saw them into the train You re asking me to go home and behave as if we didn t know whether the lad was alive or dead I m not good at the playacting and I m far from sure that it s either truthful or honest to be professing things that isn t so And I ll be much obliged to you if you ll get all this cleared up and let Hugh there settle down to his work in the proper way instead of wandering about on business that s no concern of his We shook our heads at each other as the train went off Maisie waving good bye to us and my mother sitting very stiff and stern and disapproving in her corner of the compartment No concern of yours d ye hear my lad laughed mister Lindsey Aye but your mother forgets that in affairs of this sort a lot of people are drawn in where they aren t concerned It s like being on the edge of a whirlpool you re dragged into it before you re aware And now we ll go and see this mister Smeaton but first where s the telegraph office in this station I want to wire to Murray to ask him to keep me posted up during today if any news comes in about the yacht When mister Lindsey was in the telegraph office I bought that morning s Dundee Advertiser more to fill up a few spare moments than from any particular desire to get the news for I was not a great newspaper reader I had scarcely opened it when I saw my own name And there I stood in the middle of the bustling railway station enjoying the sensation of reading my own obituary notice Our Berwick on Tweed correspondent telegraphing late last night says Considerable anxiety is being felt in the town respecting the fate of Sir Gilbert Carstairs Bart of Hathercleugh House and mister Hugh Moneylaws who are feared to have suffered a disaster at sea At noon yesterday Sir Gilbert accompanied by mister Moneylaws went out in the former s yacht a small vessel of light weight for a sail which according to certain fishermen who were about when the yacht left was to be one of a few hours only The yacht had not returned last night nor has it been seen or heard of since its departure Various Berwick fishing craft have been out well off the coast during today but no tidings of the missing gentlemen have come to hand Nothing has been heard of or from Sir Gilbert at Hathercleugh up to nine o clock this evening and the only ray of hope lies in the fact that mister Moneylaws mother left the town hurriedly this afternoon possibly having received some news of her son It is believed here however that the light vessel was capsized in a sudden squall and that both occupants have lost their lives Sir Gilbert Carstairs who was the seventh baronet had only recently come to the neighbourhood on succeeding to the title and estates mister Moneylaws who was senior clerk to mister Lindsey solicitor of Berwick was a very promising young man of great ability and had recently been much before the public eye as a witness in connection with the mysterious murders of John Phillips and Abel Crone which are still attracting so much attention I shoved the newspaper into mister Lindsey s hand as he came out of the telegraph office He read the paragraph in silence smiling as he read Aye he said at last you have to leave home to get the home news Well they re welcome to be thinking that for the present I ve just wired Murray that I ll be here till at any rate this evening and that he s to telegraph at once if there s tidings of that yacht or of Carstairs Meanwhile well go and see this mister Smeaton mister Smeaton was expecting us he too was reading about me in the Advertiser when we entered and he made some joking remark about it only being great men that were sometimes treated to death notices before they were dead And then he turned to mister Lindsey who I noticed had been taking close stock of him I ve been thinking out things since mister Moneylaws was in here last night he remarked Bringing my mind to bear do you see on certain points that I hadn t thought of before And maybe there s something more than appears at first sight in yon man John Phillips having my name and address on him Aye asked mister Lindsey quietly How now Well replied mister Smeaton there may be something in it and there may be nothing just nothing at all But it s the fact that my father hailed from Tweedside and from some place not so far from Berwick CHAPTER XXIII FAMILY HISTORY I was watching mister Lindsey pretty closely being desirous of seeing how he took to mister Gavin Smeaton and what he made of him and I saw him prick his ears at this announcement clearly it seemed to suggest something of interest to him Aye he exclaimed Your father hailed from Berwick or thereabouts You don t know exactly from where mister Smeaton No I don t replied Smeaton promptly The truth is strange as it may seem mister Lindsey I know precious little about my father and what I do know is mostly from hearsay I ve no recollection of having ever seen him And more wondrous still you ll say I don t know whether he s alive or dead Here indeed was something that bordered on the mysterious and mister Lindsey and myself who had been dealing in that commodity to some considerable degree of late exchanged glances And Smeaton saw us look at each other and he smiled and went on I was thinking all this out last night he said and it came to me I wonder if that man John Phillips who had as I hear my name and address in his pocket could have been some man who was coming to see me on my father s behalf or it s an odd thing to fancy and considering what s happened him not a pleasant one could have been my father himself There was silence amongst us for a moment This was a new vista down which we were looking and it was full of thick shadow As for me I began to recollect things According to the evidence which Chisholm had got from the British Linen Bank at Peebles John Phillips had certainly come from Panama Just as certainly he had made for Tweedside And with equal certainty nobody at all had come forward to claim him to assert kinship with him though there had been the widest publicity given to the circumstances of his murder In Gilverthwaite s instance his sister had quickly turned up to see what there was for her Phillips had been just as freely mentioned in the newspapers as Gilverthwaite but no one had made inquiries after him though there was a tidy sum of money of his in the Peebles bank for his next of kin to claim Who was he then mister Lindsey was evidently deep in thought or I should perhaps say in surmise And he seemed to arrive where I did at a question which was of course just that which Smeaton had suggested I might answer that better if I knew what you could tell me about your father mister Smeaton he said And about yourself I ll tell you all I can with pleasure answered Smeaton To tell you the truth I never attached much importance to this matter in spite of my name and address being found on Phillips until mister Moneylaws there came in last night and then after what he told me I did begin to think pretty deeply over it and I m coming to the opinion that there s a lot more in all this than appears on the surface You can affirm that with confidence remarked mister Lindsey drily There is Well about my father continued Smeaton All I know is this and I got it from hearsay His name the name given to me anyway was Martin Smeaton He hailed from somewhere about Berwick Whether it was on the English side or the Scottish side of the Tweed I don t know But he went to America as a young man with a young wife and they were in New Orleans when I was born And when I was born my mother died So I never saw her Do you know her maiden name asked mister Lindsey No more than that her Christian name was Mary replied Smeaton You ll find out as I go on that it s very little I do know of anything definitely Well when my mother died my father evidently left New Orleans and went off travelling I ve made out that he must have been a regular rolling stone at all times a man that couldn t rest long in one place But he didn t take me with him There was a Scotsman and his wife in New Orleans that my father had forgathered with some people of the name of Watson and he left me with them and in their care in New Orleans I remained till I was ten years old From my recollection he evidently paid them well for looking after me there was never at any time any need of money on my account And of course never having known any other I came to look on the Watsons as father and mother When I was ten years old they returned to Scotland here to Dundee and I came with them I have a letter or two that my father wrote at that time giving instructions as to what was to be done with me I was to have the best education as much as I liked and was capable of and though I didn t then and don t now know all the details it s evident he furnished Watson with plenty of funds on my behalf We came here to Dundee and I was put to the High School and there I stopped till I was eighteen and then I had two years at University College Now the odd thing was that all that time though I knew that regular and handsome remittances came to the Watsons on my behalf from my father he never expressed any wishes or made any suggestions as to what I should do with myself But I was all for commercial life and when I left college I went into an office here in the town and began to study the ins and outs of foreign trade Then when I was just twenty one my father sent me a considerable sum two thousand pounds as a matter of fact saying it was for me to start business with And do you know mister Lindsey from that day now ten years ago to this I ve never heard a word of him mister Lindsey was always an attentive man in a business interview but I had never seen him listen to anybody so closely as he listened to mister Smeaton And after his usual fashion he at once began to ask questions Those Watsons now he said They re living No replied Smeaton Both dead a few years ago That s a pity remarked mister Lindsey But you ll have recollections of what they told you about your father from their own remembrance of him They d little to tell said Smeaton I made out they knew very little indeed of him except that he was a tall fine looking fellow evidently of a superior class and education Of my mother they knew less You ll have letters of your father s suggested mister Lindsey Just a few mere scraps he was never a man who did more than write down what he wanted doing and as briefly as possible replied Smeaton In fact he added with a laugh his letters to me were what you might call odd When the money came that I mentioned just now be wrote me the shortest note I can repeat every word of it I ve sent Watson two thousand pounds for you he wrote You can start yourself in business with it as I hear you re inclined that way and some day I ll come over and see how you re getting along That was all And you ve never heard of or from him since exclaimed mister Lindsey That s a strange thing now But where was he then Where did he send the money from New York replied Smeaton The other letters I have from him are from places in both North and South America It always seemed to me and the Watsons that he was never in any place for long always going about I should like to see those letters mister Smeaton said mister Lindsey Especially the last one They re at my house answered Smeaton I ll bring them down here this afternoon and show them to you if you ll call in But now do you think this man Phillips may have been my father Well replied mister Lindsey reflectively it s an odd thing that Phillips whoever he was drew five hundred pounds in cash out of the British Linen Bank at Peebles and carried it straight away to Tweedside where you believe your father came from It looks as if Phillips had meant to do something with that cash to give it to somebody you know I read the description of Phillips in the newspapers remarked Smeaton But of course it conveyed nothing to me You ve no photograph of your father asked mister Lindsey No none never had answered Smeaton Nor any papers of his except those bits of letters mister Lindsey sat in silence for a time tapping the point of his stick on the floor and staring at the carpet I wish we knew what that man Gilverthwaite was wanting at Berwick and in the district he said at last But isn t that evident suggested Smeaton He was looking in the parish registers I ve a good mind to have a search made in those quarters for particulars of my father mister Lindsey gave him a sharp look Aye he said in a rather sly fashion But you don t know if your father s real name was Smeaton Both Smeaton and myself started at that it was a new idea And I saw that it struck Smeaton with great force True he replied after a pause I don t It might have been And in that case how could one find out what it was mister Lindsey got up shaking his head A big job he answered A stiff job You d have to work back a long way But it could be done What time can I look in this afternoon mister Smeaton to get a glance at those letters Three o clock replied Smeaton He walked to the door of his office with us and he gave me a smile You re none the worse for your adventure I see he remarked Well what about this man Carstairs what news of him We ll maybe be able to tell you some later in the day replied mister Lindsey There ll be lots of news about him one way or another before we re through with all this We went out into the street then and at his request I took mister Lindsey to the docks to see the friendly skipper who was greatly delighted to tell the story of my rescue We stopped on his ship talking with him for a good part of the morning and it was well past noon when we went back to the hotel for lunch And the first thing we saw there was a telegram for mister Lindsey He tore the envelope open as we stood in the hall and I made no apology for looking over his shoulder and reading the message with him Just heard by wire from Largo police that small yacht answering description of Carstairs has been brought in there by fishermen who found it early this morning in Largo Bay empty We looked at each other And mister Lindsey suddenly laughed Empty he exclaimed Aye but that doesn t prove that the man s dead CHAPTER XXIV THE SUIT OF CLOTHES mister Lindsey made no further remark until we were half through our lunch and it was not to me that he then spoke but to a waiter who was just at his elbow There s three things you can get me he said Our bill a railway guide a map of Scotland Bring the map first The man went away and mister Lindsey bent across the table Largo is in Fife said he We ll go there I m going to see that yacht with my own eyes and hear with my own ears what the man who found it has got to say For as I remarked just now my lad the mere fact that the yacht was found empty doesn t prove that Carstairs has been drowned And well just settle up here and go round and see Smeaton to get a look at those letters and then we ll take train to Largo and make a bit of inquiry mister Smeaton had the letters spread out on his desk when we went in and mister Lindsey looked them over There were not more than half a dozen altogether and they were mere scraps as he had said usually a few lines on half sheets of paper mister Lindsey appeared to take no great notice of any of them but the last the one that Smeaton had quoted to us in the morning But over that he bent for some time examining it closely in silence I wish you d lend me this for a day or two he said at last I ll take the greatest care of it it shan t go out of my own personal possession and I ll return it by registered post The fact is mister Smeaton I want to compare that writing with some other writing Certainly agreed Smeaton handing the letter over I ll do anything I can to help I m beginning you know mister Lindsey to fear I m mixed up in this You ll keep me informed I can give you some information now answered mister Lindsey pulling out the telegram There s more mystery do you see And Moneylaws and I are off to Largo now we ll take it on our way home For by this and that I m going to know what s become of Sir Gilbert Carstairs We presently left mister Gavin Smeaton with a promise to keep him posted up and a promise on his part that he d come to Berwick if that seemed necessary and then we set out on our journey It was not such an easy business to get quickly to Largo and the afternoon was wearing well into evening when we reached it and found the police official who had wired to Berwick There was not much that he could tell us of his own knowledge The yacht he said was now lying in the harbour at Lower Largo where it had been brought in by a fisherman named Andrew Robertson to whom he offered to take us Him we found at a little inn near the harbour a taciturn somewhat sour faced fellow who showed no great desire to talk and would probably have given us scant information if we had not been accompanied by the police official though he brightened up when mister Lindsey hinted at the possibility of reward When did you come across this yacht asked mister Lindsey Between eight and nine o clock this morning replied Robertson And where About seven miles out a bit outside the bay Empty demanded mister Lindsey looking keenly at the man Not a soul in her Not a soul answered Robertson Neither alive nor dead Were her sails set at all asked mister Lindsey They were not She was just drifting anywhere replied the man And I put a line to her and brought her in Any other craft than yours about at the time inquired mister Lindsey Not within a few miles said Robertson We went off to the yacht then She had been towed into a quiet corner of the harbour and an old fellow who was keeping guard over her assured us that nobody but the police had been aboard her since Robertson brought her in We of course went aboard mister Lindsey after being assured by me that this really was Sir Gilbert Carstairs yacht remarking that he didn t know we could do much good by doing so But I speedily made a discovery of singular and significant importance Small as she was the yacht possessed a cabin there was no great amount of head room in it it s true and a tall man could not stand upright in it but it was spacious for a craft of that size and amply furnished with shelving and lockers And on these lockers lay the clothes a Norfolk suit of grey tweed in which Sir Gilbert Carstairs had set out with me from Berwick I let out a fine exclamation when I saw that and the other three turned and stared at me mister Lindsey said I look here Those are the clothes he was wearing when I saw the last of him And there s the shirt he had on too and the shoes Wherever he is and whatever happened to him he made a complete change of linen and clothing before he quitted the yacht That s a plain fact mister Lindsey A fact it was and one that made me think however it affected the others It disposed for instance of any notion or theory of suicide A man doesn t change his clothes if he s going to drown himself And it looked as if this had been part of some premeditated plan at the very least of it it was a curious thing You re sure of that inquired mister Lindsey eyeing the things that had been thrown aside Dead sure of it said I I couldn t be mistaken Did he bring a portmanteau or anything aboard with him then asked he He didn t but he could have kept clothes and linen and the like in these lockers I pointed out beginning to lift the lids See here here s brushes and combs and the like I tell you before ever he left this yacht or fell out of it or whatever s happened him he d changed everything from his toe to his top there s the very cap he was wearing They all looked at each other and mister Lindsey s gaze finally fastened itself on Andrew Robertson I suppose you don t know anything about this my friend he asked What should I know answered Robertson a bit surlily The yacht s just as I found it not a thing s been touched There was the luncheon basket lying on the cabin table just as I had last seen it except that Carstairs had evidently finished the provisions which he and I had left And I think the same thought occurred to mister Lindsey and myself at the same moment how long had he stopped on board that yacht after his cruel abandoning of me For forty eight hours had elapsed since that episode and in forty eight hours a man may do a great deal in the way of making himself scarce which now seemed to me to be precisely what Sir Gilbert Carstairs had done though in what particular fashion and exactly why it was beyond either of us to surmise I suppose no one has heard anything of this yacht having been seen drifting about yesterday or during last night asked mister Lindsey putting his question to both men No talk of it hereabouts But neither the police nor Andrew Robertson had heard a murmur of that nature and there was evidently nothing to be got out of them more than we had already got Nor had the police heard of any stranger being seen about there though as the man who was with us observed there was no great likelihood of anybody noticing a stranger for Largo was nowadays a somewhat popular seaside resort and down there on the beach there were many strangers it being summer and holiday time so that a strange man more or less would pass unobserved Supposing a man landed about the coast here asked mister Lindsey I m just putting a case to you and didn t go into the town but walked along the beach where would he strike a railway station now The police official replied that there were railway stations to the right and left of the bay a man could easily make Edinburgh in one direction and saint Andrews in the other and then not unnaturally he was wanting to know if mister Lindsey was suggesting that Sir Gilbert Carstairs had sailed his yacht ashore left it and that it had drifted out to sea again I m not suggesting anything answered mister Lindsey I m only speculating on possibilities And that s about as idle work as standing here talking What will be practical will be to arrange about this yacht being locked up in some boat house and we d best see to that at once We made arrangements with the owner of a boat house to pull the yacht in there and to keep her under lock and key and after settling matters with the police to have an eye on her and see that her contents were untouched until further instructions reached them from Berwick we went off to continue our journey But we had stayed so long in Largo that when we got to Edinburgh the last train for Berwick had gone and we were obliged to turn into an hotel for the night Naturally all our talk was of what had just transpired the events of the last two days said mister Lindsey only made these mysteries deeper than they were before and why Sir Gilbert Carstairs should have abandoned his yacht as he doubtless had was a still further addition to the growing problem And I m not certain my lad that I believe yon man Robertson s tale he remarked as we were discussing matters from every imaginable point of view just before going to bed He may have brought the yacht in but we don t know that he didn t bring Carstairs aboard her Why was that change of clothes made Probably because he knew that he d be described as wearing certain things and he wanted to come ashore in other things For aught we know he came safely ashore boarded a train somewhere in the neighbourhood or at Largo itself why not and went off likely here to Edinburgh where he d mingle with a few thousand of folk unnoticed Then in that case you think he s what mister Lindsey I asked Do you mean he s running away Between you and me that s not far from what I do think he replied And I think I know what he s running away from too But we ll hear a lot more before many hours are over or I m mistaken We were in Berwick at an early hour next morning and we went straight to the police station and into the superintendent s office Chisholm was with mister Murray when we walked in and both men turned to us with eagerness Here s more mystery about this affair mister Lindsey exclaimed Murray It s enough to make a man s wits go wool gathering There s no news of Sir Gilbert and Lady Carstairs has been missing since twelve o clock noon yesterday CHAPTER XXV THE SECOND DISAPPEARANCE mister Lindsey was always one of the coolest of hands at receiving news of a startling nature and now instead of breaking out into exclamations he just nodded his head and dropped into the nearest chair Aye he remarked quietly So her ladyship s disappeared too has she And when did you get to hear that now Half an hour ago replied Murray The butler at Hathercleugh House has just been in driven over in a hurry to tell us What do you make of it at all Before I answer that I want to know what s been happening here while I ve been away replied mister Lindsey What s happened within your own province officially I mean Not much answered Murray There began to be talk evening before last amongst the fishermen about Sir Gilbert s yacht He d been seen of course to go out with Moneylaws there two days ago at noon And there is Moneylaws Doesn t he know anything Where s Sir Gilbert Moneylaws He ll tell all that when I tell him to said mister Lindsey with a glance at me Go on with your story first The superintendent shook his head as if all these things were beyond his comprehension Oh well he continued I tell you there was talk you know how they gossip down yonder on the beach It was said the yacht had never come in and though many of them had been out they d never set eyes on her and rumours of her soon began to spread So I sent Chisholm there out to Hathercleugh to make some inquiry tell mister Lindsey what you heard he went on turning to the sergeant Not much I think Next to nothing replied Chisholm I saw Lady Carstairs She laughed at me She said Sir Gilbert was not likely to come to harm he d been sailing yachts big and little for many a year and he d no doubt gone further on this occasion than he d first intended I pointed out that he d mister Moneylaws with him and that he d been due at his business early that morning She laughed again at that and said she d no doubt Sir Gilbert and mister Moneylaws had settled that matter between them and that as she d no anxieties she was sure Berwick folk needn t have any And so I came away And we heard no more until we got your wire yesterday from Dundee mister Lindsey said Murray and that was followed not so very long after by one from the police at Largo which I reported to you Now here s an important question put in mister Lindsey a bit hurriedly as if something had just struck him Did you communicate the news from Largo to Hathercleugh We did at once answered Murray I telephoned immediately to Lady Carstairs I spoke to her over the wire myself telling her what the Largo police reported What time would that be asked mister Lindsey sharply Half past eleven replied Murray Then according to what you tell me she left Hathercleugh soon after you telephoned to her said mister Lindsey According to what the butler told us this morning answered Murray Lady Carstairs went out on her bicycle at exactly noon yesterday and she s never been seen or heard of since She left no message at the house asked mister Lindsey None And added the superintendent significantly she didn t mention to the butler that I d just telephoned to her It s a queer business this I m thinking mister Lindsey But what s your own news and what s Moneylaws got to tell about Sir Gilbert mister Lindsey took no notice of the last question He sat in silence for a while evidently thinking And in the end he pointed to some telegram forms that lay on the superintendent s desk There s one thing must be done at once Murray he said and I ll take the responsibility of doing it myself We must communicate with the Carstairs family solicitors I d have done it as soon as the butler brought me the news about Lady Carstairs remarked Murray but I don t know who they are I do answered mister Lindsey Holmshaw and Portlethorpe of Newcastle Here he went on passing a telegram form to me Write out this message Sir Gilbert and Lady Carstairs are both missing from Hathercleugh under strange circumstances please send some authorized person here at once Sign that with my name Hugh and take it to the post office and come back here When I got back mister Lindsey had evidently told Murray and Chisholm all about my adventures with Sir Gilbert and the two men regarded me with a new interest as if I had suddenly become a person of the first importance And the superintendent at once fell upon me for my reticence You made a bad mistake young man in keeping back what you ought to have told at the inquest on Phillips he said reprovingly Indeed you ought to have told it before that you should have told us Aye if I d only known as much as that began Chisholm I d have You d probably have done just what he did broke in mister Lindsey held your tongue till you knew more so let that pass the lad did what he thought was for the best You never suspected Sir Gilbert of any share in these affairs either of you so come now Why as to that mister Lindsey remarked Murray who looked somewhat nettled by this last passage you didn t suspect him yourself or if you did you kept it uncommonly quiet Does mister Lindsey suspect him now asked Chisholm a bit maliciously For if he does maybe he ll give us a hand mister Lindsey looked at both of them in a way that he had of looking at people of whose abilities he had no very great idea but there was some indulgence in the look on this occasion Well now that things have come to this pass he said and after Sir Gilbert s deliberate attempt to get rid of Moneylaws to murder him in fact I don t mind telling you the truth I do suspect Sir Gilbert of the murder of Crone and that s why I produced that ice ax in court the other day And when he saw that ice ax he knew that I suspected him and that s why he took Moneylaws out with him intending to rid himself of a man that could give evidence against him If I d known that Moneylaws was going with him I d have likely charged Sir Gilbert there and then anyway I wouldn t have let Moneylaws go Aye you know something then exclaimed Murray You re in possession of some evidence that we know nothing about I know this and I ll make you a present of it now answered mister Lindsey As you re aware I m a bit of a mountaineer you know that I ve spent a good many of my holidays in Switzerland climbing Consequently I know what alpenstocks and ice axes are And when I came to reflect on the circumstances of Crone s murder I remember that not so long since happening to be out along the riverside I chanced across Sir Gilbert Carstairs using a very late type of ice ax as a walking stick as he well could do and might have picked up in his hall as some men ll pick up a golf stick to go walking with and I ve done that myself hundred of times And I knew that I had an ice ax of that very pattern at home and so I just shoved it under the doctor s nose in court and asked him if that hole in Crone s head couldn t have been made by the spike of it Why Because I knew that Carstairs would be present in court and I wanted to see if he would catch what I was after And you think he did asked the superintendent eagerly I kept the corner of an eye on him answered mister Lindsey knowingly He saw what I was after He s a clever fellow that but he took the mask off his face for the thousandth part of a second I saw The two listeners were so amazed by this that they sat in silence for a while staring at mister Lindsey with open mouthed amazement It s a dark dark business sighed Murray at last What s the true meaning of it do you think mister Lindsey Some secret that s being gradually got at replied mister Lindsey promptly That s what it is And there s nothing to do just now but wait until somebody comes from Holmshaw and Portlethorpe s Holmshaw is an old man probably Portlethorpe himself will come along He may know something they ve been family solicitors to the Carstairs lot for many a year But it s my impression that Sir Gilbert Carstairs is away and that his wife s after him And if you want to be doing something try to find out where she went on her bicycle yesterday likely she rode to some station in the neighbourhood and then took train mister Lindsey and I then went to the office and we had not been there long when a telegram arrived from Newcastle mister Portlethorpe himself was coming on to Berwick immediately And in the middle of the afternoon he arrived a middle aged somewhat nervous mannered man whom I had seen two or three times when we had business at the Assizes and whom mister Lindsey evidently knew pretty well judging by their familiar manner of greeting each other What s all this Lindsey asked mister Portlethorpe as soon as he walked in and without any preliminaries Your wire says Sir Gilbert and Lady Carstairs have disappeared Does that mean Did you read your newspaper yesterday interrupted mister Lindsey who knew that what we had read in the Dundee Advertiser had also appeared in the Newcastle Daily Chronicle Evidently not Portlethorpe or you d have known in part at any rate what my wire meant But I ll tell you in a hundred words and then I ll ask you a couple of questions before we go any further He gave mister Portlethorpe an epitomized account of the situation and mister Portlethorpe listened attentively to the end And without making any comment he said three words Well your questions The first answered mister Lindsey is this How long is it since you saw or heard from Sir Gilbert Carstairs A week by letter replied mister Portlethorpe The second continued mister Lindsey is much more important much What Portlethorpe do you know of Sir Gilbert Carstairs mister Portlethorpe hesitated a moment Then he replied frankly and with evident candour To tell you the truth Lindsey he said beyond knowing that he is Sir Gilbert Carstairs nothing CHAPTER XXVI missus RALSTON OF CRAIG mister Lindsey made no remark on this answer and for a minute or two he and mister Portlethorpe sat looking at each other Then mister Portlethorpe bent forward a little his hands on his knees and gave mister Lindsey a sort of quizzical but earnest glance Now why do you ask that last question he said quietly You ve some object It s like this answered mister Lindsey Here s a man comes into these parts to take up a title and estates who certainly had been out of them for thirty years His recent conduct is something more than suspicious no one can deny that he left my clerk there to drown without possibility of help That s intended murder And so I ask What do you his solicitor know of him his character his doings during the thirty years he was away And you answer nothing Just so assented mister Portlethorpe And nobody does hereabouts Except that he is Sir Gilbert Carstairs nobody in these parts knows anything about him how should they We I suppose know more than anybody and we know just a few bare facts I think you ll have to let me know what these bare facts are remarked mister Lindsey And Moneylaws too Moneylaws has a definite charge to bring against this man and he ll bring it if I ve anything to do with it He shall press it if he can find Carstairs And I think you d better tell us what you know Portlethorpe Things have got to come out I ve no objection to telling you and mister Moneylaws what we know answered mister Portlethorpe After all it is in a way common knowledge to some people at any rate And to begin with you are probably aware that the recent history of this Carstairs family is a queer one You know that old Sir Alexander had two sons and one daughter the daughter being very much younger than her brothers When the two sons Michael and Gilbert were about from twenty one to twenty three both quarrelled with their father and cleared out of this neighbourhood altogether it s always believed that Sir Alexander gave Michael a fair lot of money to go and do for himself each hating the other s society and that Michael went off to America As to Gilbert he got money at that time too and went south and was understood to be first a medical student and then a doctor in London and abroad There is no doubt at all that both sons did get money considerable amounts because from the time they went away no allowance was ever paid to them nor did Sir Alexander ever have any relations with them What the cause of the quarrel was nobody knows but the quarrel itself and the ensuing separation were final father and sons never resumed relations And when the daughter now missus Ralston of Craig near here grew up and married old Sir Alexander pursued a similar money policy towards her he presented her with thirty thousand pounds the day she was married and told her she d never have another penny from him I tell you he was a queer man Queer lot altogether muttered mister Lindsey And interesting Oh it s interesting enough agreed mister Portlethorpe with a chuckle Deeply so Well that s how things were until about a year before old Sir Alexander died which as you know is fourteen months since As I say about six years before his death formal notice came of the death of Michael Carstairs who of course was next in succession to the title It came from a solicitor in Havana where Michael had died there were all the formal proofs He had died unmarried and intestate and his estate amounted to about a thousand pounds Sir Alexander put the affair in our hands and of course as he was next of kin to his eldest son what there was came to him And we then pointed out to him that now that mister Michael Carstairs was dead mister Gilbert came next he would get the title in any case and we earnestly pressed Sir Alexander to make a will And he was always going to and he never did and he died intestate as you know And at that of course Sir Gilbert Carstairs came forward and A moment interrupted mister Lindsey Did anybody know where he was at the time of his father s death Nobody hereabouts at any rate replied mister Portlethorpe Neither his father nor his sister nor ourselves had heard of him for many a long year But he called on us within twenty four hours of his father s death With proof of course that he was the man he represented himself to be asked mister Lindsey Oh of course full proof answered mister Portlethorpe Papers letters all that sort of thing all in order He had been living in London for a year or two at that time but according to his own account he had gone pretty well all over the world during the thirty years absence He d been a ship s surgeon he d been attached to the medical staff of more than one foreign army and had seen service he d been on one or two voyages of discovery he d lived in every continent in fact he d had a very adventurous life and lately he d married a rich American heiress Oh Lady Carstairs is an American is she remarked mister Lindsey Just so haven t you met her asked mister Portlethorpe Never set eyes on her that I know of replied mister Lindsey But go on Well of course there was no doubt of Sir Gilbert s identity continued mister Portlethorpe and as there was also no doubt that Sir Alexander had died intestate we at once began to put matters right Sir Gilbert of course came into the whole of the real estate and he and missus Ralston shared the personalty which by the by was considerable they both got nearly a hundred thousand each in cash And there you are That all asked mister Lindsey mister Portlethorpe hesitated a moment then he glanced at me Moneylaws is safe at a secret said mister Lindsey If it is a secret Well then answered mister Portlethorpe it s not quite all There is a circumstance which has I can t exactly say bothered but has somewhat disturbed me Sir Gilbert Carstairs has now been in possession of his estates for a little over a year and during that time he has sold nearly every yard of them except Hathercleugh mister Lindsey whistled It was the first symptom of astonishment that he had manifested and I glanced quickly at him and saw a look of indescribable intelligence and almost undeniable cunning cross his face But it went as swiftly as it came and he merely nodded as if in surprise Aye he exclaimed Quick work Portlethorpe Oh he gave good reasons answered mister Portlethorpe He said from the first that he meant to do it he wanted and his wife wanted too to get rid of these small and detached Northern properties and buy a really fine one in the South of England keeping Hathercleugh as a sort of holiday seat He d no intention of selling that at any time But there s the fact he s sold pretty nearly everything else I never heard of these sales of land remarked mister Lindsey Oh they ve all been sold by private treaty replied mister Portlethorpe The Carstairs property was in parcels here and there the last two baronets before this one had bought considerably in other parts It was all valuable there was no difficulty in selling to adjacent owners Then if he s been selling to that extent Sir Gilbert must have large sums of money at command unless he s bought that new estate you re talking of said mister Lindsey He has not bought anything that I know of answered mister Portlethorpe And he must have a considerable a very large sum of money at his bankers All of which he continued looking keenly at mister Lindsey makes me absolutely amazed to hear what you ve just told me It s very serious this charge you re implying against him Lindsey Why should he want to take men s lives in this fashion A man of his position his great wealth Portlethorpe broke in mister Lindsey didn t you tell me just now that this man according to his own account has lived a most adventurous life in all parts of the world What more likely than that in the course of such a life he made acquaintance with queer characters and possibly did some queer things himself Isn t it a significant thing that within a year of his coming into the title and estates two highly mysterious individuals turn up here and that all this foul play ensues It s impossible now to doubt that Gilverthwaite and Phillips came into these parts because this man was already here If you ve read all the stuff that s been in the papers and add to it just what we ve told you about this last adventure with the yacht you can t doubt it either It s very very strange all of it agreed mister Portlethorpe Have you no theory Lindsey I ve a sort of one answered mister Lindsey I think Gilverthwaite and Phillips probably were in possession of some secret about Sir Gilbert Carstairs and that Crone may have somehow got an inkling of it Now as we know Gilverthwaite died suddenly and it s possible that Carstairs killed both Phillips and Crone as he certainly meant to kill this lad And what does it all look like Before mister Portlethorpe could reply to that last question and while he was shaking his head over it one of our junior clerks brought in missus Ralston of Craig at the mention of whose name mister Lindsey immediately bustled forward She was a shrewd clever looking woman well under middle age who had been a widow for the last four or five years and was celebrated in our parts for being a very managing and interfering sort of body who chiefly occupied herself with works of charity and philanthropy and was prominent on committees and boards And she looked over the two solicitors as if they were candidates for examination and she the examiner I have been to the police to find out what all this talk is about Sir Gilbert Carstairs she began at once They tell me you know more than they do mister Lindsey Well what have you to say And what have you to say mister Portlethorpe You ought to know more than anybody What does it all amount to mister Portlethorpe whose face had become very dismal at the sight of missus Ralston turned as if seeking help to mister Lindsey He was obviously taken aback by missus Ralston s questions and a little afraid of her but mister Lindsey was never afraid of anybody and he at once turned on his visitor Before we answer your questions missus Ralston he said there s one I ll take leave to ask you When Sir Gilbert came back at your father s death did you recognize him missus Ralston tossed her head with obvious impatience Now what ridiculous nonsense mister Lindsey she exclaimed How on earth do you suppose that I could recognize a man whom I hadn t seen since I was a child of seven and certainly not for at least thirty years Of course I didn t impossible CHAPTER XXVII THE BANK BALANCE It was now mister Portlethorpe and I who looked at each other with a mutual questioning What was mister Lindsey hinting suggesting And mister Portlethorpe suddenly turned on him with a direct inquiry What is it you are after Lindsey he asked There s something in your mind A lot answered mister Lindsey And before I let it out I think we d better fully inform missus Ralston of everything that s happened and of how things stand up to and including this moment This is the position missus Ralston and the facts and he went on to give his caller a brief but complete summary of all that he and mister Portlethorpe had just talked over You now see how matters are he concluded at the end of his epitome during his delivery of which the lady had gradually grown more and more portentous of countenance Now what do you say missus Ralston spoke sharply and decisively Precisely what I have felt inclined to say more than once of late she answered I m beginning to suspect that the man who calls himself Sir Gilbert Carstairs is not Sir Gilbert Carstairs at all He s an impostor In spite of my subordinate position as a privileged but inferior member of the conference I could not help letting out a hasty exclamation of astonishment at that I was thoroughly and genuinely astounded such a notion as that had never once occurred to me An impostor not the real man The idea was amazing and mister Portlethorpe found it amazing too and he seconded my exclamation with another and emphasized it with an incredulous laugh My dear madam he said deprecatingly Really That s impossible But mister Lindsey calmer than ever nodded his head confidently I m absolutely of missus Ralston s opinion he declared What she suggests I believe to be true An impostor mister Portlethorpe flushed and began to look very uneasy Really he repeated Really Lindsey you forget that I examined into the whole thing I saw all the papers letters documents Oh the suggestion is you ll pardon me missus Ralston ridiculous No man could have been in possession of those documents unless he d been the real man the absolute Simon Pure Why my dear lady he produced letters written by yourself when you were a little girl and and all sorts of little private matters It s impossible that there has been any imposture a a reflection on me Cleverer men than you have been taken in Portlethorpe remarked mister Lindsey And the matters you speak of might have been stolen But let missus Ralston give us her reasons for suspecting this man she has some strong ones I ll be bound mister Portlethorpe showed signs of irritation but missus Ralston promptly took up mister Lindsey s challenge Sufficiently strong to have made me very uneasy of late at any rate she answered She turned to mister Portlethorpe You remember she went on that my first meeting with this man when he came to claim the title and estates was at your office in Newcastle a few days after he first presented himself to you He said then that he had not yet been down to Hathercleugh but I have since found out that he had or rather that he had been in the neighbourhood incognito That s a suspicious circumstance mister Portlethorpe Excuse me ma am I don t see it retorted mister Portlethorpe I don t see it at all I do then said missus Ralston Suspicious because I his sister and only living relation was close by Why didn t he come straight to me He was here he took a quiet look around before he let any one know who he was That s one thing I have against him whatever you say it was very suspicious conduct and he lied about it in saying he had not been here when he certainly had been here But that s far from all The real Gilbert Carstairs mister Lindsey as mister Portlethorpe knows lived at Hathercleugh House until he was twenty two years old He was always at Hathercleugh except when he was at Edinburgh University studying medicine He knew the whole of the district thoroughly But as I have found out for myself this man does not know the district I have discovered on visiting him though I have not gone there much as I don t like either him or his wife that this is a strange country to him He knows next to nothing though he has done his best to learn of its features its history its people Is it likely that a man who had lived on the Border until he was two and twenty could forget all about it simply because he was away from it for thirty years Although I was only seven or eight when my brother Gilbert left home I was then a very sharp child and I remember that he knew every mile of the country round Hathercleugh But this man doesn t mister Portlethorpe muttered something about it being very possible for a man to forget a tremendous lot in thirty years but missus Ralston and mister Lindsey shook their heads at his dissent from their opinion As for me I was thinking of the undoubted fact that the supposed Sir Gilbert Carstairs had been obliged in my presence to use a map in order to find his exact whereabouts when he was literally within two miles of his own house Another thing continued missus Ralston in my few visits to Hathercleugh since he came I have found out that while he is very well posted up in certain details of our family history he is unaccountably ignorant of others with which he ought to have been perfectly familiar I found out too that he is exceedingly clever in avoiding subjects in which his ignorance might be detected But clever as he is he has more than once given me grounds for suspicion And I tell you plainly mister Portlethorpe that since he has been selling property to the extent you report you ought at this juncture and as things are to find out how money matters stand He must have realized vast amounts in cash Where is it At his bankers in Newcastle my dear madam replied mister Portlethorpe Where else should it be He has not yet made the purchase he contemplated so of course the necessary funds are waiting until he does I cannot but think that you and mister Lindsey are mistaken and that there will be some proper and adequate explanation of all this and Portlethorpe exclaimed mister Lindsey that s no good Things have gone too far Whether this man s Sir Gilbert Carstairs or an impostor he did his best to murder my clerk and we suspect him of the murder of Crone and he s going to be brought to justice that s flat And your duty at present is to fall in with us to this extent you must adopt missus Ralston s suggestion and ascertain how money matters stand As missus Ralston rightly says by the sale of these properties a vast amount of ready money must have been accumulated and at this man s disposal Portlethorpe we must know if it s true How can I tell you that demanded mister Portlethorpe who was growing more and more nervous and peevish I ve nothing to do with Sir Gilbert Carstairs private banking account I can t go and ask point blank of his bankers how much money he has in their hands Then I will exclaimed mister Lindsey I know where he banks in Newcastle and I know the manager I shall go this very night to the manager s private house and tell him exactly everything that s transpired I shall tell him missus Ralston s and my own suspicions and I shall ask him where the money is Do you understand that The proper course to adopt said missus Ralston The one thing to do It must be done Oh very well then in that case I suppose I d better go with you said mister Portlethorpe Of course it s no use going to the bank they ll be closed but we can as you say go privately to the manager And we shall be placed in a very unenviable position if Sir Gilbert Carstairs turns up with a perfectly good explanation of all this mystery mister Lindsey pointed a finger at me He can t explain that he exclaimed He left that lad to drown Is that attempted murder or isn t it I tell you I ll have that man in the dock never mind who he is Hugh pass me the railway guide It was presently settled that mister Portlethorpe and mister Lindsey should go off to Newcastle by the next train to see the bank manager mister Lindsey insisted that I should go with them he would have no hole and corner work he said and I should tell my own story to the man we were going to see so that he would know some of the ground of our suspicion missus Ralston supported that and when mister Portlethorpe remarked that we were going too fast and were working up all the elements of a fine scandal she tartly remarked that if more care had been taken at the beginning all this would not have happened We found the bank manager at his private house outside Newcastle that evening He knew both my companions personally and he listened with great attention to all that mister Lindsey as spokesman had to tell he also heard my story of the yacht affair He was an astute elderly man evidently quick at sizing things up and I knew by the way he turned to mister Portlethorpe and by the glance he gave him after hearing everything that his conclusions were those of mister Lindsey and missus Ralston I m afraid there s something wrong Portlethorpe he remarked quietly The truth is I ve had suspicions myself lately Good God you don t mean it exclaimed mister Portlethorpe How then Since Sir Gilbert began selling property continued the bank manager very large sums have been paid in to his credit at our bank where previous to that he already had a very considerable balance But at the present moment we hold very little that is comparatively little money of his What said mister Portlethorpe What You don t mean that During the past three or four months said the bank manager Sir Gilbert has regularly drawn very large cheques in favour of a mister John Paley They have been presented to us through the Scottish American Bank at Edinburgh And he added with a significant look at mister Lindsey I think you d better go to Edinburgh and find out who mister John Paley is mister Portlethorpe got up looking very white and frightened How much of all that money is there left in your hands he asked hoarsely Not more than a couple of thousand answered the bank manager with promptitude Then he s paid out in the way you state what demanded mister Portlethorpe Quite two hundred thousand pounds And concluded our informant with another knowing look now that I m in possession of the facts you ve just put before me I should advise you to go and find out if Sir Gilbert Carstairs and John Paley are not one and the same person CHAPTER XXVIII THE HATHERCLEUGH BUTLER The three of us went away from the bank manager s house struggling with the various moods peculiar to our individual characters mister Portlethorpe being naturally a nervous man given to despondency was greatly upset and manifested his emotions in sundry ejaculations of a dark nature I being young was full of amazement at the news just given us and of the excitement of hunting down the man we knew as Sir Gilbert Carstairs But I am not sure that mister Lindsey struggled much with anything he was cool and phlegmatic as usual and immediately began to think of practical measures Look here Portlethorpe he said as soon as we were in the motor car which we had chartered from Newcastle station we ve got to get going in this matter at once straight away We must be in Edinburgh as early as possible in the morning Be guided by me come straight back to Berwick stop the night with me at my house and we ll be on our way to Edinburgh by the very first train we can get there early by the time the banks are open There s another reason why I want you to come I ve some documents that I wish you to see documents that may have a very important bearing on this affair There s one in my pocket book now and you ll be astonished when you hear how it came into my possession But it s not one half so astonishing as another that I ve got at my house I remembered then that we had been so busily engaged since our return from the North that morning that we had had no time to go into the matter of the letter which mister Gavin Smeaton had entrusted to mister Lindsey here again was going to be more work of the ferreting out sort But mister Portlethorpe it was clear had no taste for mysteries and no great desire to forsake his own bed even for mister Lindsey s hospitality and it needed insistence before he consented to go back to Berwick with us Go back however he did and before midnight we were in our own town again and passing the deserted streets towards mister Lindsey s home I going with the others because mister Lindsey insisted that it was now too late for me to go home and I should be nearer the station if I slept at his place And just before we got to the house which was a quiet villa standing in its own grounds a little north of the top end of the town a man who was sauntering ahead of us suddenly turned and came up to mister Lindsey and in the light of a street lamp I recognized in him the Hathercleugh butler mister Lindsey recognized the man too so also did mister Portlethorpe and they both came to a dead halt staring And both rapped out the same inquiry in identical words Some news I looked as eagerly at the butler as they did He had been sour enough and pompous enough in his manner and attitude to me that night of my call on his master and it surprised me now to see how polite and suave and in a fashion insinuating he was in his behaviour to the two solicitors He was a big fleshy strongly built fellow with a rather flabby deeply lined face and a pallid complexion rendered all the paler by his black overcoat and top hat and as he stood there rubbing his hands glancing from mister Lindsey to mister Portlethorpe and speaking in soft oily suggestive accents I felt that I disliked him even more than when he had addressed me in such supercilious accents at the doors of Hathercleugh Well er not precisely news gentlemen he replied The fact is I wanted to see you privately mister Lindsey sir but of course I ve no objections to speaking before mister Portlethorpe as he s Sir Gilbert s solicitor Perhaps I can come in with you mister Lindsey the truth is I ve been waiting about sir they said you d gone to Newcastle and might be coming back by this last train And it s possibly of importance Come in said mister Lindsey He let us all into his house with his latch key and led us to his study where he closed the door Now he went on turning to the butler What is it You can speak freely we are all three mister Portlethorpe mister Moneylaws and myself pretty well acquainted with all that is going on by this time And I m perhaps not far wrong when I suggest that you know something The butler who had taken the chair which mister Lindsey had pointed out rubbed his hands and looked at us with an undeniable expression of cunning and slyness Well sir he said in a low suggesting tone of voice A man in my position naturally gets to know things whether he wants to or not sometimes I have had ideas gentlemen for some time That something was wrong asked mister Portlethorpe Approaching to something of that nature sir replied the butler Of course you will bear in mind that I am as it were a stranger I have only been in Sir Gilbert s Carstairs employ nine months But I have eyes And ears And the long and short of it is gentlemen I believe Sir Gilbert and Lady Carstairs have gone Absolutely gone exclaimed mister Portlethorpe Good gracious Hollins you don t mean that I shall be much surprised if it is not found to be the case sir answered Hollins whose name I now heard for the first time And incidentally as it were I may mention that I think it will be discovered that a good deal has gone with them What property demanded mister Portlethorpe Impossible they couldn t carry property away going as they seem to have done or are said to have done Hollins coughed behind one of his big fat hands and glanced knowingly at mister Lindsey who was listening silently but with deep attention I m not so sure about that sir he said You re aware that there were certain small matters at Hathercleugh of what we may term the heirloom nature though whether they were heirlooms or not I can t say the miniature of himself set in diamonds given by George the Third to the second baronet the necklace also diamonds which belonged to a Queen of Spain the small picture priceless given to the fifth baronet by a Czar of Russia and similar things mister Portlethorpe And gentlemen the family jewels all of which had been reset They ve got all those You mean to say of your own knowledge they re not at Hathercleugh suddenly inquired mister Lindsey I mean to say they positively are not sir replied the butler They were kept in a certain safe in a small room used by Lady Carstairs as her boudoir Her ladyship left very hastily and secretly yesterday as I understand the police have told you and in her haste she forgot to lock up that safe which she had no doubt unlocked before her departure That safe sir is empty of those things at any rate God bless my soul exclaimed mister Portlethorpe greatly agitated This is really terrible Could she carry those things all of them on her bicycle by which I hear she left asked mister Lindsey Easily sir replied Hollins She had a small luggage carrier on her bicycle it would hold all those things They were not bulky of course You ve no idea where she went on that bicycle inquired mister Lindsey Hollins smiled cunningly and drew his chair a little nearer to us I hadn t when I went to mister Murray at the police station this morning he answered But I ve an idea now That s precisely why I came in to see you mister Lindsey He put his hand inside his overcoat and produced a pocket book from which he presently drew out a scrap of paper After I d seen mister Murray this morning he continued I went back to Hathercleugh and took it upon myself to have a look round I didn t find anything of a remarkably suspicious nature until this afternoon pretty late when I made the discovery about the safe in the boudoir that all the articles I d mentioned had disappeared Then I began to examine a waste paper basket in the boudoir I d personally seen Lady Carstairs tear up some letters which she received yesterday morning by the first post and throw the scraps into that basket which hadn t been emptied since And I found this gentlemen and you can perhaps draw some conclusion from it I ve had no difficulty in drawing one myself He laid on the table a torn scrap of paper over which all three of us at once bent There was no more on it than the terminations of lines but the wording was certainly suggestive at once quietly best time would be before lunch at Kelso usual place in Glasgow mister Portlethorpe started at sight of the handwriting That s Sir Gilbert s he exclaimed No doubt of that What are we to understand by it Lindsey What do you make of this asked mister Lindsey turning to Hollins You say you ve drawn a deduction I make this out sir answered the butler quietly Yesterday morning there were only four letters for Lady Carstairs Two were from London in the handwriting of ladies One was a tradesman s letter from Newcastle The fourth was in a registered envelope and the address was typewritten and the post mark Edinburgh I m convinced mister Lindsey that the registered one contained that A letter you understand from Sir Gilbert I found other scraps of it but so small that it s impossible to piece them together though I have them here And I conclude that he gave Lady Carstairs orders to cycle to Kelso an easy ride for her and to take the train to Glasgow where he d meet her Glasgow sir is a highly convenient city I believe for people who wish to disappear And I should suggest that Glasgow should be communicated with Have you ever known Sir Gilbert Carstairs visit Glasgow recently asked mister Lindsey who had listened attentively to all this He was there three weeks ago replied Hollins And Edinburgh suggested mister Lindsey He went regularly to Edinburgh at one time twice a week said the butler And then mister Lindsey not making any further remark he glanced at him and at mister Portlethorpe Of course gentlemen he continued this is all between ourselves I feel it my duty you know mister Lindsey answered that we all understood the situation and presently he let the man out after a whispered sentence or two between them in the hall Then he came back to us and without a word as to what had just transpired drew the Smeaton letter from his pocket CHAPTER XXIX ALL IN ORDER So that we might have it to ourselves we had returned from Newcastle to Berwick in a first class compartment 
1230-139225-0000	train-other-500	and in its privacy mister Lindsey had told mister Portlethorpe the whole of the Smeaton story mister Portlethorpe had listened so it seemed to me with a good deal of irritation and impatience
none	none	 he was clearly one of those people who do not like interference with what they regard as an established order of things 
1230-139225-0001	train-other-500	and it evidently irked him to have any questions raised as to the Carstairs affairs which of course he himself had done much to settle when Sir Gilbert succeeded to the title In his opinion the whole thing was cut dried and done with
1230-139225-0002	train-other-500	and he was still impatient and restive when mister Lindsey laid before him the letter which mister Gavin Smeaton had lent us and invited him to look carefully at the handwriting He made no proper response to that invitation what he did
1230-139225-0003	train-other-500	was to give a peevish glance at the letter and then push it aside with an equally peevish exclamation
none	none	 What of it he said 
1230-139225-0004	train-other-500	It conveys nothing to me
none	none	 Take your time Portlethorpe remonstrated mister Lindsey 
1230-139225-0005	train-other-500	who was unlocking a drawer in his desk It ll perhaps convey something to you when you compare that writing with a certain signature which I shall now show you This he continued as he produced Gilverthwaite s will
1230-139225-0006	train-other-500	and laid it before his visitor is the will of the man whose coming to Berwick ushered in all these mysteries Now then do you see who was one of the witnesses to the will Look man
1230-139225-0007	train-other-500	mister Portlethorpe looked and was startled out of his peevishness
none	none	 God bless me he exclaimed 
1230-139225-0008	train-other-500	Michael Carstairs Just that said mister Lindsey Now then compare Michael Carstairs handwriting with the handwriting of that letter Come here Hugh you too have a look
1230-139225-0009	train-other-500	And there s no need for any very close or careful looking either no need for expert calligraphic evidence or for the use of microscopes I ll stake all I m worth that that signature and that letter are the work of the same hand
none	none	 Now that I saw the Smeaton letter and the signature of the first witness to Gilverthwaite s will side by side 
1230-139225-0010	train-other-500	I had no hesitation in thinking as mister Lindsey did It was an exceptionally curious not to say eccentric handwriting some of the letters were oddly formed other letters were indicated rather than formed at all
1230-139225-0011	train-other-500	It seemed impossible that two different individuals could write in that style it was rather the style developed for himself by a man who scorned all conventional matters and was as self distinct in his penmanship
1230-139225-0012	train-other-500	as he probably was in his life and thoughts Anyway there was an undeniable an extraordinary similarity and even mister Portlethorpe had to admit that it was undoubtedly there
1230-139225-0013	train-other-500	He threw off his impatience and irritability and became interested and grave That s very strange and uncommonly important Lindsey he said I
1230-139225-0014	train-other-500	yes I am certainly inclined to agree with you Now what do you make of it If you want to know my precise idea replied mister Lindsey it s just this Michael Carstairs and Martin Smeaton
1230-139225-0015	train-other-500	are one and the same man or I should say
none	none	 were 
1230-139225-0016	train-other-500	That s about it Portlethorpe Then in that case that young fellow at Dundee is Michael Carstairs son exclaimed mister Portlethorpe
none	none	 And in my opinion that s not far off the truth said mister Lindsey You ve hit it But Michael Carstairs was never married declared 
1230-139225-0017	train-other-500	mister Portlethorpe mister Lindsey picked up Gilverthwaite s will and the Smeaton letter and carefully locked them away in his drawer
none	none	 I m not so sure about that he remarked drily Michael Carstairs was very evidently a queer man who did a lot of things in a peculiar fashion of his own and The solicitor who sent us formal proof of his death from Havana 
1230-139225-0018	train-other-500	previous to Sir Alexander s death said distinctly that Michael had never been married interrupted mister Portlethorpe And surely he would know And I say just as surely that from all I ve heard of Michael Carstairs
1230-139225-0019	train-other-500	there d be a lot of things that no solicitor would know even if he sat at Michael s dying bed retorted mister Lindsey But we ll see And talking of beds it s time I was showing you to yours and that we were all between the sheets
1230-139225-0020	train-other-500	for it s one o clock in the morning and we ll have to be stirring again at six sharp And I ll tell you what we ll do Portlethorpe to save time we ll just take a mere cup of coffee and a mouthful of bread here and we ll breakfast in Edinburgh we ll be there by eight thirty
1230-139225-0021	train-other-500	So now come to your beds
none	none	 He marshalled us upstairs he and mister Portlethorpe had already taken their night caps while they talked 
1230-139225-0022	train-other-500	and when he had bestowed the senior visitor in his room he came to me in mine carrying an alarm clock which he set down at my bed head Hugh my man he said you ll have to stir yourself an hour before mister Portlethorpe and me
1230-139225-0023	train-other-500	I ve set that implement for five o clock Get yourself up when it rings and make yourself ready
none	none	 and go round to Murray at the police station rouse him out of his bed 
1230-139225-0024	train-other-500	Tell him what we heard from that man Hollins tonight and bid him communicate with the Glasgow police to look out for Sir Gilbert Carstairs Tell him too that we re going on to Edinburgh and why and that if need be
1230-139225-0025	train-other-500	I ll ring him up from the Station Hotel during the morning with any news we have and I ll ask for his at the same time Insist on his getting in touch with Glasgow it s there without doubt that Lady Carstairs went off and where Sir Gilbert would meet her
1230-139225-0026	train-other-500	let him start inquiries about the shipping offices and the like And that s all and get your bit of sleep
none	none	 I had Murray out of his bed before half past five that morning and I laid it on him heavily about the Glasgow affair 
1230-139225-0027	train-other-500	which as we came to know later was the biggest mistake we made and one that involved us in no end of sore trouble and at a quarter past six mister Lindsey and mister Portlethorpe and I were drinking our coffee
none	none	 and blinking at each other over the rims of the cups But mister Lindsey was sharp enough of his wits even at that hour and before we set off from Berwick 
1230-139225-0028	train-other-500	he wrote out a telegram to mister Gavin Smeaton asking him to meet us in Edinburgh during the day so that mister Portlethorpe might make his acquaintance This telegram he left with his housekeeper to be dispatched as soon as the post office was open
none	none	 And then we were off and by half past eight were at breakfast in the Waverley Station and as the last stroke of ten was sounding from the Edinburgh clocks we were walking into the premises 
1230-139225-0029	train-other-500	of the Scottish American Bank The manager who presently received us in his private rooms looked at mister Lindsey and mister Portlethorpe with evident surprise
none	none	 it may have been that there was mystery in their countenances I know that I on my part felt as if a purblind man might have seen that I was clothed about with mystery from the crown of my head to the sole of my foot 
1230-139225-0030	train-other-500	And he appeared still more surprised when mister Lindsey briefly but fully
none	none	 explained why we had called upon him Of course I ve read the newspapers about your strange doings at Berwick he observed when mister Lindsey 
1230-139225-0031	train-other-500	aided by some remarks from mister Portlethorpe had come to the end of his explanation
none	none	 And I gather that you now want to know what we here know of Sir Gilbert Carstairs 
1230-139225-0032	train-other-500	and mister John Paley I can reply to that in a sentence nothing that is to their discredit They are two thoroughly estimable and trustworthy gentlemen so far as we are aware
none	none	 Then there is a mister John Paley demanded mister Lindsey 
1230-139225-0033	train-other-500	who was obviously surprised The manager evidently was also surprised by the signs of mister Lindsey s surprise
none	none	 mister John Paley is a stockbroker in this city he replied Quite well known The fact is we that is I 
1230-139225-0034	train-other-500	introduced Sir Gilbert Carstairs to him Perhaps he continued glancing from one gentleman to the other
none	none	 I had better tell you all the facts 
1230-139225-0035	train-other-500	They re very simple and quite of an ordinary nature Sir Gilbert Carstairs came in here introducing himself some months ago He told me that he was intending to sell off a good deal of the Carstairs property and that he wanted to reinvest his proceeds
1230-139225-0036	train-other-500	in the very best American securities
none	none	 I gathered that he had spent a lot of time in America that he preferred America to England 
1230-139225-0037	train-other-500	and in short that he had a decided intention of going back to the States
none	none	 keeping Hathercleugh as a place to come to occasionally 
1230-139225-0038	train-other-500	He asked me if I could recommend him a broker here in Edinburgh
none	none	 who was thoroughly well acquainted with the very best class of American investments and I at once recommended mister John Paley And that s all I know gentlemen 
1230-139225-0039	train-other-500	Except remarked mister Lindsey
none	none	 that you know that considerable transactions have taken place between mister Paley and Sir Gilbert Carstairs We know that from what we heard last night in Newcastle 
1230-139225-0040	train-other-500	Precisely then you know as much as I can tell you replied the manager But I have no objection to saying that large sums of money coming from Sir Gilbert Carstairs
none	none	 have certainly been passed through mister Paley s banking account here and I suppose mister Paley has made the investments which Sir Gilbert desired in fact 
1230-139225-0041	train-other-500	I know he has And
none	none	 I should suggest you call on mister Paley himself 
1230-139225-0042	train-other-500	We went away upon that
none	none	 and it seemed to me that mister Lindsey was somewhat taken aback And we were no sooner clear of the bank than mister Portlethorpe a little triumphantly 
1230-139225-0043	train-other-500	a little maliciously turned on him There
none	none	 what did I say he exclaimed 
1230-139225-0044	train-other-500	Everything is in order you see Lindsey
none	none	 I confess I m surprised to hear about those American investments 
1230-139225-0045	train-other-500	but after all Sir Gilbert has a right to do what he likes with his own
none	none	 I told you we were running our heads against the wall 
1230-139225-0046	train-other-500	personally I don t see what use there is in seeing this mister Paley
none	none	 We re only interfering with other people s business 
1230-139225-0047	train-other-500	As I say Sir Gilbert can make what disposal he pleases of his own property And what I say Portlethorpe retorted mister Lindsey is that I m going to be convinced that it is his own property
1230-139225-0048	train-other-500	I m going to see Paley whether you do or not and you ll be a fool if you don t come mister Portlethorpe protested but he accompanied us
none	none	 And we were very soon in mister John Paley s office 
1230-139225-0049	train-other-500	a quiet self possessed sort of man
none	none	 who showed no surprise at our appearance indeed he at once remarked that the bank manager had just telephoned that we were on the way and why 
1230-139225-0050	train-other-500	Then I ll ask you a question at once said mister Lindsey
none	none	 And I m sure you ll be good enough to answer it When did you last see Sir Gilbert Carstairs 
1230-139225-0051	train-other-500	mister Paley immediately turned to a diary which lay on his desk and gave one glance at it
none	none	 Three days ago he answered promptly Wednesday eleven o clock CHAPTER XXX THE CARSTAIRS MOTTO mister Lindsey reflected a moment after getting that precise answer and he glanced at me as if trying to recollect something That would be the very morning after the affair of the yacht he asked of me But before I could speak mister Paley took the words out of my mouth Quite right he said quietly I knew nothing of it at the time of course but I have read a good deal in the newspapers since It was the morning after Sir Gilbert left Berwick in his yacht Did he mention anything about the yacht to you inquired mister Lindsey Not a word I took it that he had come in to see me in the ordinary way replied the stockbroker He wasn t here ten minutes I had no idea whatever that anything had happened Before we go any further said mister Lindsey may I ask you to tell us what he came for You know that mister Portlethorpe is his solicitor I am asking the question on his behalf as well as my own I don t know why I shouldn t tell you answered mister Paley He came on perfectly legitimate business It was to call for some scrip which I held scrip of his own of course Which he took away with him suggested mister Lindsey Naturally replied the stockbroker That was what he came for Did he give you any hint as to where he was going asked mister Lindsey Did he for instance happen to mention that he was leaving home for a time Not at all answered mister Paley He spoke of nothing but the business that had brought him As I said just now he wasn t here ten minutes It was evident to me that mister Lindsey was still more taken aback What we had learned during the last half hour seemed to surprise him And mister Portlethorpe who was sharp enough of observation saw this and made haste to step into the arena mister Lindsey he said has been much upset by the apparently extraordinary circumstances of Sir Gilbert Carstairs disappearance and so I may say has Sir Gilbert s sister missus Ralston I have pointed out that Sir Gilbert himself may have probably has a quite proper explanation of his movements Wait a minute Lindsey he went on as mister Lindsey showed signs of restiveness It s my turn I think He looked at mister Paley again Your transactions with Sir Gilbert have been quite in order all through I suppose and quite ordinary Quite in order and quite ordinary answered the stockbroker readily He was sent to me by the manager of the Scottish American Bank who knows that I do a considerable business in first class American securities and investments Sir Gilbert told me that he was disposing of a great deal of his property in England and wished to re invest the proceeds in American stock He gave me to understand that he wished to spend most of his time over there in future as neither he nor his wife cared about Hathercleugh though they meant to keep it up as the family estate and headquarters He placed considerable sums of money in my hands from time to time and I invested them in accordance with his instructions handing him the securities as each transaction was concluded And that s really all I know mister Lindsey got in his word before mister Portlethorpe could speak again There are just two questions I should like to ask to which nobody can take exception I think he said One is I gather that you ve invested all the money which Sir Gilbert placed in your hands Yes about all replied mister Paley I have a balance a small balance And the other is this continued mister Lindsey I suppose all these American securities which he now has are of such a nature that they could be turned into cash at any time on any market That is so certainly assented mister Paley Yes certainly so Then that s enough for me exclaimed mister Lindsey rising and beckoning me to follow Much obliged to you sir Without further ceremony he stumped out into the street with me at his heels to be followed a few minutes later by mister Portlethorpe And thereupon began a warm altercation between them which continued until all three of us were stowed away in a quiet corner of the smoking room in the hotel at which it had been arranged mister Gavin Smeaton was to seek us on his arrival and there it was renewed with equal vigour at least with equal vigour on mister Lindsey s part As for me I sat before the two disputants my hands in my pockets listening as if I were judge and jury all in one to what each had to urge They were of course at absolutely opposite poles of thought One man was approaching the matter from one standpoint the other from one diametrically opposed to it mister Portlethorpe was all for minimizing things mister Lindsey all for taking the maximum attitude mister Portlethorpe said that even if we had not come to Edinburgh on a fool s errand which appeared to be his secret and private notion we had at any rate got the information which mister Lindsey wanted and had far better go home now and attend to our proper business which he added was not to pry and peep into other folks affairs He was convinced that Sir Gilbert Carstairs was Sir Gilbert Carstairs and that missus Ralston s and mister Lindsey s suspicions were all wrong He failed to see any connection between Sir Gilbert and the Berwick mysteries and murders it was ridiculous to suppose it As for the yacht incident he admitted it looked at least strange but he added with a half apologetic glance at me he would like to hear Sir Gilbert s version of that affair before he himself made up his mind about it If we can lay hands on him you ll be hearing his version from the dock retorted mister Lindsey Your natural love of letting things go smoothly Portlethorpe is leading you into strange courses Man alive take a look at the whole thing from a dispassionate attitude Since the fellow got hold of the Hathercleugh property he s sold everything practically but Hathercleugh itself he s lost no time in converting the proceeds a couple of hundred thousand pounds into foreign securities which says yon man Paley are convertible into cash at any moment in any market Something occurs we don t know what yet to make him insecure in his position without doubt it s mixed up with Phillips and Gilverthwaite and no doubt afterwards with Crone This lad here accidentally knows something which might be fatal Carstairs tries having as I believe murdered Crone to drown Moneylaws And what then It s every evident that after leaving Moneylaws he ran his yacht in somewhere on the Scottish coast and turned her adrift or which is more likely fell in with that fisher fellow Robertson at Largo and bribed him to tell a cock and bull tale about the whole thing made his way to Edinburgh next morning and possessed himself of the rest of his securities after which he clears out to be joined somewhere by his wife who if what Hollins told us last night is true and it no doubt is carried certain valuables off with her What does it look like but that he s an impostor who s just made all he can out of the property while he d the chance and is now away to enjoy his ill gotten gains That s what I m saying Portlethorpe and I insist on my common sense view of it And I say it s just as common sense to insist as I do that it s all capable of proper and reasonable explanation retorted mister Portlethorpe You re a good hand at drawing deductions Lindsey but you re bad in your premises You start off by asking me to take something for granted and I m not fond of mental gymnastics If you d be strictly logical They went on arguing like that one against the other for a good hour and it seemed to me that the talk they were having would have gone on for ever indefinitely if on the stroke of noon mister Gavin Smeaton had not walked in on us At sight of him they stopped and presently they were deep in the matter of the similarity of the handwritings mister Lindsey having brought the letter and the will with him Deep at any rate mister Lindsey and mister Portlethorpe were as for mister Gavin Smeaton he appeared to be utterly amazed at the suggestion which mister Lindsey threw out to him that the father of whom he knew so little was in reality Michael Carstairs Do you know what it is you re suggesting Lindsey demanded mister Portlethorpe suddenly You ve got the idea into your head now that this young man s father whom he s always heard of as one Martin Smeaton was in strict truth the late Michael Carstairs elder son of the late Sir Alexander in fact being the wilful and headstrong man that you are you re already positive of it I am so declared mister Lindsey That s a fact Portlethorpe Then what follows asked mister Portlethorpe If mister Smeaton there is the true and lawful son of the late Michael Carstairs his name is not Smeaton at all but Carstairs and he s the true holder of the baronetcy and as his grandfather died intestate the legal owner of the property D you follow that I should be a fool if I didn t retorted mister Lindsey I ve been thinking of it for thirty six hours Well it ll have to be proved muttered mister Portlethorpe He had been staring hard at mister Gavin Smeaton ever since he came in and suddenly he let out a frank exclamation There s no denying you ve a strong Carstairs look on you said he Bless and save me this is the strangest affair Smeaton put his hand into his pocket and drew out a little package which he began to unwrap I wonder if this has anything to do with it he said I remembered thinking things over last night that I had something which so the Watsons used to tell me was round my neck when I first came to them It s a bit of gold ornament with a motto on it I ve had it carefully locked away for many a long year He took out of his package a heart shaped pendant with a much worn gold chain attached to it and turned it over to show an engraved inscription on the reverse side There s the motto he said You see Who Will Shall Whose is it God bless us exclaimed mister Portlethorpe The Carstairs motto Aye their motto for many a hundred years Lindsey this is an extraordinary thing I m inclined to think you may have some right in your notions We must But before mister Portlethorpe could say what they must do there was a diversion in our proceedings which took all interest in them clean away from me and made me forget whatever mystery there was about Carstairs Smeaton or anybody else A page lad came along with a telegram in his hand asking was there any gentleman there of the name of Moneylaws I took the envelope from him in a whirl of wonder and tore it open feeling an unaccountable sense of coming trouble And in another minute the room was spinning round me but the wording of the telegram was clear enough Come home first train Maisie Dunlop been unaccountably missing since last evening and no trace of her Murray I flung the bit of paper on the table before the other three and feeling like my head was on fire was out of the room and the hotel and in the street and racing into the station before one of them could find a word to put on his tongue CHAPTER XXXI NO TRACE That telegram had swept all the doings of the morning clear away from me Little I cared about the Carstairs affairs and all the mystery that was wrapping round them in comparison with the news which Murray had sent along in that peculiarly distressing fashion I would cheerfully have given all I ever hoped to be worth if he had only added more news but he had just said enough to make me feel as if I should go mad unless I could get home there and then I had not seen Maisie since she and my mother had left mister Lindsey and me at Dundee I had been so fully engaged since then what with the police and missus Ralston and mister Portlethorpe and the hurried journeys first to Newcastle and then to Edinburgh that I had never had a minute to run down and see how things were going on What of course drove me into an agony of apprehension was Murray s use of that one word unaccountably Why should Maisie be unaccountably missing What had happened to take her out of her father s house where had she gone that no trace of her could be got what had led to this utterly startling development what But it was no use speculating on these things the need was for action And I had seized on the first porter I met and was asking him for the next train to Berwick when mister Gavin Smeaton gripped my arm There s a train in ten minutes Moneylaws said he quietly Come away to it I ll go with you we re all going mister Lindsey thinks we ll do as much there as here now Looking round I saw the two solicitors hurrying in our direction mister Lindsey carrying Murray s telegram in his hand He pulled me aside as we all walked towards the train What do you make of this Hugh he asked Can you account for any reason why the girl should be missing I haven t an idea said I But if it s anything to do with all the rest of this business mister Lindsey let somebody look out I ll have no mercy on anybody that s interfered with her and what else can it be I wish I d never left the town Aye well we ll soon be back in it he said consolingly And we ll hope to find better news I wish Murray had said more it s a mistake to frighten folk in that way he s said just too much and just too little It was a fast express that we caught for Berwick and we were not long in covering the distance but it seemed like ages to me and the rest of them failed to get a word out of my lips during the whole time And my heart was in my mouth when as we ran into Berwick station I saw Chisholm and Andrew Dunlop on the platform waiting us Folk that have had bad news are always in a state of fearing to receive worse and I dreaded what they might have come to the station to tell us And mister Lindsey saw how I was feeling and he was on the two of them with an instant question Do you know any more about the girl than was in Murray s wire he demanded If so what The lad here s mad for news Chisholm shook his head and Andrew Dunlop looked searchingly at me We know nothing more he answered You don t know anything yourself my lad he went on staring at me still harder I mister Dunlop I exclaimed What do you think now asking me a question like yon What should I know How should I know that said he You dragged your mother and my lass all the way to Dundee for nothing so far as I could learn and He d good reason interrupted mister Lindsey He did quite right Now what is this about your daughter mister Dunlop Just let s have the plain tale of it and then we ll know where we are I had already seen that Andrew Dunlop was not over well pleased with me and now I saw why He was a terrible hand at economy saving every penny he could lay hands on and as nothing particular seemed to have come of it and so far as he could see there had been no great reason for it he was sore at my sending for his daughter to Dundee and all the sorer because though I of course was utterly innocent of it Maisie had gone off on that journey without as much as a by your leave to him And he was not over ready or over civil to mister Lindsey Aye well said he There s strange doings afoot and it s not my will that my lass should be at all mixed up in them mister Lindsey All this running up and down hither and thither on business that doesn t concern mister Lindsey had the shortest of tempers on occasion and I saw that he was already impatient He suddenly turned away with a growl and collared Chisholm You re a fool Dunlop he exclaimed over his shoulder it s your tongue that wants to go running Now then sergeant what is all this about Miss Dunlop Come on My future father in law drew off in high displeasure but Chisholm hurriedly explained matters He s in a huffy state mister Lindsey he said nodding at Andrew s retreating figure Until you came in he was under the firm belief that you and mister Hugh had got the young lady away again on some of this mystery business he wouldn t have it any other way And truth to tell I was wondering if you had myself But since you haven t it s here and I hope nothing s befallen the poor young thing for For God s sake man get it out said I We ve had preface enough come to your tale I m only explaining to you mister Hugh he answered calmly And I understand your impatience It s like this d ye see Andrew Dunlop yonder has a sister that s married to a man a sheep farmer whose place is near Coldsmouth Hill between Mindrum and Kirk Yetholm I know I said You mean missus Heselton Well man missus Heselton of course said he You re right there And last night about seven or so in the evening a telegram came to the Dunlops saying missus Heselton was taken very ill and would Miss Dunlop go over And away she went there and then on her bicycle and alone and she never reached the place How do you know that demanded mister Lindsey Because answered Chisholm about nine o clock this morning in comes one of the Heselton lads to Dunlop to tell him his mother had died during the night and then of course they asked did Miss Dunlop get there in time and the lad said they d never set eyes on her And that s all there is to tell mister Lindsey I was for starting off with I think the idea of instantly mounting my bicycle and setting out for Heselton s farm when mister Lindsey seized my elbow Take your time lad said he Let s think what we re doing Now then how far is it to this place where the girl was going Seventeen miles said I promptly You know it he asked And the road I ve been there with her many a time mister Lindsey I answered I know every inch of the road Now then he said get the best motor car there is in the town and be off Make inquiries all the way along it ll be a queer thing if you can t trace something it would be broad daylight all the time she d be on her journey Make a thorough search and full inquiry she must have been seen He turned to mister Smeaton who had stood near listening Go with him he said It ll be a good turn to do him he wants company mister Smeaton and I hurried outside the station a car or two stood in the yard and we picked out the best As we got in Chisholm came up to us You d better have a word or two with our men along the road mister Hugh said he There s not many between here and the part you re going to but you d do no harm to give them an idea of what it is you re after and tell them to keep their eyes open and their ears for that matter Aye we ll do that Chisholm I answered And do you keep eyes and ears open here in Berwick I ll give ten pounds and cash in his hand to the first man that gives me news and you can let that be known as much as you like and at once whether Andrew Dunlop thinks it s throwing money away or not And then we were off and maybe that he might draw me away from over much apprehension mister Smeaton began to ask me about the road which Maisie would take to get to the Heseltons farm the road which we of course were taking ourselves And I explained to him that it was just the ordinary high road that ran between Berwick and Kelso that Maisie would follow until she came to Cornhill where she would turn south by way of Mindrum Mill where if that fact had anything to do with her disappearance she would come into a wildish stretch of country at the northern edge of the Cheviots There ll be places villages and the like all along I expect he asked It s a lonely road mister Smeaton I answered I know it well what places there are are more off than on it but there s no stretch of it that s out of what you might term human reach And how anybody could happen aught along it of a summer s evening is beyond me unless indeed we re going back to the old kidnapping times And if you knew Maisie Dunlop you d know that she s the sort that would put up a fight if she was interfered with I m wondering if this has aught to do with all yon Carstairs affair There s been such blackness about that and such villainy that I wish I d never heard the name Aye he answered I understand you But it s coming to an end And in queer ways queer ways indeed I made no reply to him and I was sick of the Carstairs matters it seemed to me I had been eating and drinking and living and sleeping with murder and fraud till I was choked with the thought of them Let me only find Maisie said I to myself and I would wash my hands of any further to do with the whole vile business But we were not to find Maisie during the long hours of that weary afternoon and the evening that followed it mister Lindsey had bade me keep the car and spare no expense and we journeyed hither and thither all round the district seeking news and getting none She had been seen just once at East Ord just outside Berwick by a man that was working in his cottage garden by the roadside no other tidings could we get We searched all along the road that runs by the side of Bowmont Water between Mindrum and the Yetholms devoting ourselves particularly to that stretch as being the loneliest and without result And as the twilight came on and both of us were dead weary we turned homeward myself feeling much more desperate than even I did when I was swimming for my very life in the North Sea And I m pretty well sure of what it is now mister Smeaton I exclaimed as we gave up the search for that time There s been foul play And I ll have all the police in Northumberland on this business or Aye he said it s a police matter this without doubt Moneylaws We d best get back to Berwick and insist on Murray setting his men thoroughly to work We went first to mister Lindsey s when we got back his house being on our way And at sight of us he hurried out and had us in his study There was a gentleman with him there mister Ridley the clergyman who had given evidence about Gilverthwaite at the opening of the inquest on Phillips CHAPTER XXXII THE LINK I knew by one glance at mister Lindsey s face that he had news for us but there was only one sort of news I was wanting at that moment and I was just as quick to see that whatever news he had it was not for me And as soon as I heard him say that nothing had been heard of Maisie Dunlop during our absence I was for going away meaning to start inquiries of my own in the town there and then dead beat though I was But before I could reach the door he had a hand on me You ll just come in my lad and sit you down to a hot supper that s waiting you and mister Smeaton there he said in that masterful way he had which took no denial from anybody You can do no more good just now I ve made every arrangement possible with the police and they re scouring the countryside So into that chair with you and eat and drink you ll be all the better for it mister Smeaton he went on as he had us both to the supper table and began to help us to food here s news for you for such news as it is affects you I m thinking more than any man that it has to do with mister Ridley here has found out something relating to Michael Carstairs that ll change the whole course of events especially if we prove as I ve no doubt we shall that Michael Carstairs was no other than your father whom you knew as Martin Smeaton Smeaton turned in his chair and looked at mister Ridley who he and mister Lindsey having taken their supper before we got in was sitting in a corner by the fire eyeing the stranger from Dundee with evident and curious interest I ve heard of you sir said he You gave some evidence at the inquest on Phillips about Gilverthwaite s searching of your registers I think Aye and it s a fortunate thing and shows how one thing leads to another that Gilverthwaite did go to mister Ridley explained mister Lindsey It set mister Ridley on a track and he s been following it up and to cut matters short he s found particulars of the marriage of Michael Carstairs who was said to have died unmarried And I wish Portlethorpe hadn t gone home to Newcastle before mister Ridley came to me with the news Tired as I was and utterly heart sick about Maisie I pricked up my ears at that For at intervals mister Lindsey and I had discussed the probabilities of this affair and I knew that there was a strong likelihood of its being found out that the mysterious Martin Smeaton was no other than the Michael Carstairs who had left Hathercleugh for good as a young man And if it were established that he was married and that Gavin Smeaton was his lawful son why then but mister Ridley was speaking and I broke off my own speculations to listen to him You ve scarcely got me to thank for this mister Smeaton he said There was naturally a good deal of talk in the neighbourhood after that inquest on Phillips people began wondering what that man Gilverthwaite wanted to find in the parish registers of which I now know he examined a good many on both sides the Tweed And in the ordinary course of things and if some one had made a definite search with a definite object what has been found now could have been found at once But I ll tell you how it was Up to some thirty years ago there was an old parish church away in the loneliest part of the Cheviots which had served a village that gradually went out of existence though it s still got a name Walholm there s but a house or two in it now and as there was next to no congregation and the church itself was becoming ruinous the old parish was abolished and merged in the neighbouring parish of Felside whose rector my friend mister Longfield has the old Walholm registers in his possession When he read of the Phillips inquest and what I d said then he thought of those registers and turned them up out of a chest where they d lain for thirty years anyway and he at once found the entry of the marriage of one Michael Carstairs with a Mary Smeaton which was by licence and performed by the last vicar of Walholm it was as a matter of fact the very last marriage which ever took place in the old church And I should say concluded mister Ridley that it was what one would call a secret wedding secret at any rate in so far as this as it was by licence and as the old church was a most lonely and isolated place far away from anywhere even then there d be no one to know of it beyond the officiating clergyman and the witnesses who could of course be asked to hold their tongues about the matter as they probably were But there s the copy of the entry in the old register Smeaton and I looked eagerly over the slip of paper which mister Ridley handed across And he to whom it meant such a vast deal asked but one question I wonder if I can find out anything about Mary Smeaton mister Longfield has already made some quiet inquiries amongst two or three old people of the neighbourhood on that point remarked mister Ridley The two witnesses to the marriage are both dead years ago But there are folk living in the neighbourhood who remember Mary Smeaton The facts are these she was a very handsome young woman not a native of the district who came in service to one of the farms on the Cheviots and who by a comparison of dates left her place somewhat suddenly very soon after that marriage Smeaton turned to mister Lindsey in the same quiet fashion What do you make of all this he asked Plain as a pikestaff answered mister Lindsey in his most confident manner Michael Carstairs fell in love with this girl and married her quietly as mister Ridley says seeing that the marriage was by licence it s probable nay certain that nobody but the parson and the witnesses ever knew anything about it I take it that immediately after the marriage Michael Carstairs and his wife went off to America and that he for reasons of his own dropped his own proper patronymic and adopted hers And he ended slapping his knee I ve no doubt that you re the child of that marriage that your real name is Gavin Carstairs and that you re the successor to the baronetcy and the real owner of Hathercleugh as I shall have pleasure in proving We shall see said Smeaton quietly as ever But there s a good deal to do before we get to that mister Lindsey The present holder or claimant for example What of him I ve insisted on the police setting every bit of available machinery to work in an effort to lay hands on him replied mister Lindsey Murray not only communicated all that Hollins told us last night to the Glasgow police this morning first thing but he s sent a man over there with the fullest news he s wired the London authorities and he s asked for special detective help He s got a couple of detectives from Newcastle all s being done that can be done And for you too Hugh my lad he added turning suddenly to me Whatever the police are doing in the other direction they re doing in yours For ugly as it may sound and seem there s nothing like facing facts and I m afraid I m very much afraid that this disappearance of Maisie Dunlop is all of a piece with the rest of the villainy that s been going on I am indeed I pushed my plate away at that and got on my feet I had been dreading as much myself all day but I had never dared put it into words You mean mister Lindsey that she s somehow got into the hands of what who I asked him Something and somebody that s at the bottom of all this he answered shaking his head I m afraid lad I m afraid I went away from all of them then and nobody made any attempt to stop me that time maybe they saw in my face that it was useless I left the house and went unconsciously I think away through the town to my mother s driving my nails into the palms of my hands and cursing Sir Gilbert Carstairs if that was the devil s name between my teeth And from cursing him I fell to cursing myself that I hadn t told at once of my seeing him at those crossroads on the night I went the errand for Gilverthwaite It had been late when Smeaton and I had got to mister Lindsey s and the night was now fallen on the town a black sultry night with great clouds overhead that threatened a thunderstorm Our house was in a badly lighted part of the street and it was gloomy enough about it as I drew near debating in myself what further I could do sleep I knew I should not until I had news of Maisie And in the middle of my speculations a man came out of the corner of a narrow lane that ran from the angle of our house and touched me on the elbow There was a shaft of light just there from a neighbour s window in it I recognized the man as a fellow named Scott that did odd gardening jobs here and there in the neighbourhood Wisht mister Hugh said he drawing me into the shadows of the lane I ve been waiting your coming there s a word I have for you between ourselves Well said I I hear you re promising ten pounds cash on the spot to the man that can give you some news of your young lady he went on eagerly Is it right now Can you I asked For if you can you ll soon see that it s right You d be reasonable about it he urged again taking the liberty to grip my arm If I couldn t just exactly give what you d call exact and definite news you d consider it the same thing if I made a suggestion wouldn t you now mister Hugh a suggestion that would lead to something Aye would I I exclaimed And if you ve got any suggestions Scott out with them and don t beat about Tell me anything that ll lead to discovery and you ll see your ten pound quickly Well he answered I have to be certain for I m a poor man as you know with a young family and it would be a poor thing for me to hint at aught that would take the bread out of their mouths and my own And I have the chance of a fine regular job now at Hathercleugh yonder and I wouldn t like to be putting it in peril It s Hathercleugh you re talking of then I asked him eagerly For God s sake man out with it What is it you can tell me Not a word to a soul of what I say then at any time present or future mister Hugh he urged Oh man not a word I cried impatiently I ll never let on that I had speech of you in the matter Well then he whispered getting himself still closer mind you I can t say anything for certain it s only a hint I m giving you but if I were in your shoes I d take a quiet look round yon old part of Hathercleugh House I would so It s never used as you ll know nobody ever goes near it but mister Hugh whoever and however it is there s somebody in it now The old part I exclaimed The Tower part Aye surely he answered If you could get quietly to it I gave his arm a grip that might have told him volumes I ll see you privately tomorrow Scott I said And if your news is any good man there ll be your ten pound in your hand as soon as I set eyes on you And therewith I darted away from him and headlong into our house doorway CHAPTER XXXIII THE OLD TOWER My mother was at her knitting in her easy chair in her own particular corner of the living room when I rushed in and though she started at the sight of me she went on knitting as methodically as if all the world was regular as her own stitches So you ve come to your own roof at last my man she said with a touch of the sharpness that she could put into her tongue on occasion There s them would say you d forgotten the way to it judging by experience why did you not let me know you were not coming home last night and you in the town as I hear from other folks Oh mother I exclaimed How can you ask such questions when you know how things are it was midnight when mister Lindsey and I got in from Newcastle and he would make me stop with him and we were away again to Edinburgh first thing in the morning Aye well if mister Lindsey likes to spend his money flying about the country he s welcome she retorted But I ll be thankful when you settle down to peaceful ways again Where are you going now she demanded There s a warm supper for you in the oven I ve had my supper at mister Lindsey s mother I said as I dragged my bicycle out of the back place I ve just got to go out whether I will or no and I don t know when I ll be in either do you think I can sleep in my bed when I don t know where Maisie is You ll not do much good Hugh where the police have failed she answered There s yon man Chisholm been here during the evening and he tells me they haven t come across a trace of her so far Chisholm s been here then I exclaimed For no more than that Aye for no more than that she replied And then this very noon there was that Irishwoman that kept house for Crone asking at the door for you What Nance Maguire I said What did she want You retorted my mother Nice sort of people we have coming to our door in these times Police and murderers and Irish Did she say why she wanted me I interrupted her I gave her no chance said my mother Do you think I was going to hold talk with a creature like that at my steps I d hold talk with the devil himself mother if I could get some news of Maisie I flung back at her as I made off You re as bad as Andrew Dunlop There was the house door between her and me before she could reply to that and the next instant I had my bicycle on the road and my leg over the saddle and was hesitating before I put my foot to the pedal What did Nance Maguire want of me Had she any news of Maisie It was odd that she should come down had I better not ride up the town and see her But I reflected that if she had any news which was highly improbable she would give it to the police and so anxious was I to test what Scott had hinted at that I swung on to my machine without further delay or reflection and went off towards Hathercleugh And as I crossed the old bridge in the opening murmur of a coming storm I had an illumination which came as suddenly as the first flash of lightning that followed just afterwards It had been a matter of astonishment to me all day long that nobody with the exception of the one man at East Ord had noticed Maisie as she went along the road between Berwick and Mindrum on the previous evening now I remembered blaming myself for not having remembered it before that there was a short cut over a certain right of way through the grounds of Hathercleugh House which would save her a good three miles in her journey She would naturally be anxious to get to her aunt as quickly as possible she would think of the nearest way she would take it And now I began to understand the whole thing Maisie had gone into the grounds of Hathercleugh and she had never left them The realization made me sick with fear The idea of my girl being trapped by such a villain as I firmly believed the man whom we knew as Sir Gilbert Carstairs to be was enough to shake every nerve in my body but to think that she had been in his power for twenty four hours alone defenceless brought on me a faintness that was almost beyond sustaining I felt physically and mentally ill weak And yet God knows there never was so much as a thought of defeat in me What I felt was that I must get there and make some effort that would bring the suspense to an end for both of us I was beginning to see how things might be passing through those grounds she might have chanced on something or somebody or Sir Gilbert himself who naturally would not let anybody escape him that could tell anything of his whereabouts But if he was at Hathercleugh what of the tale which Hollins had told us the night before nay that very morning for it was after midnight when he sat there in mister Lindsey s parlour And suddenly another idea flashed across me Was that tale true or was the man telling us a pack of lies all for some end Against that last notion there was of course the torn scrap of letter to be set but but supposing that was all part of a plot meant to deceive us while these villains taking Hollins to be in at the other man s game got clear away in some totally different direction If it was then it had been successful for we had taken the bait and all attention was being directed on Glasgow and none elsewhere and as far as I knew certainly none at Hathercleugh itself whither nobody expected Sir Gilbert to come back But these were all speculations the main thing was to get to Hathercleugh acting on the hint I had just got from Scott and to take a look round the old part of the big house as far as I could There was no difficulty about getting there although I had small acquaintance with the house and grounds never having been in them till the night of my visit to Sir Gilbert Carstairs I knew the surroundings well enough to know how to get in amongst the shrubberies and coppices I could have got in there unobserved in the daytime and it was now black night I had taken care to extinguish my lamp as soon as I got clear of the Border Bridge and now riding along in the darkness I was secure from the observation of any possible enemy And before I got to the actual boundaries of Hathercleugh I was off the bicycle and had hidden it in the undergrowth at the roadside and instead of going into the grounds by the right of way which I was convinced Maisie must have taken I climbed a fence and went forward through a spinny of young pine in the direction of the house Presently I had a fine bit of chance guidance to it as I parted the last of the feathery branches through which I had quietly made my way and came out on the edge of the open park a vivid flash of lightning showed me the great building standing on its plateau right before me a quarter of a mile off its turrets and gables vividly illuminated in the glare And when that glare passed as quickly as it had come and the heavy blackness fell again there was a gleam of light coming from some window or other and I made for that going swiftly and silently over the intervening space not without a fear that if anybody should chance to be on the watch another lightning flash might reveal my advancing figure But there had been no more lightning by the time I reached the plateau on which Hathercleugh was built then however came a flash that was more blinding than the last followed by an immediate crash of thunder right overhead In that flash I saw that I was now close to the exact spot I wanted the ancient part of the house I saw too that between where I stood and the actual walls there was no cover of shrubbery or coppice or spinny there was nothing but a closely cropped lawn to cross And in the darkness I crossed it there and then hastening forward with outstretched hands which presently came against the masonry In the same moment came the rain in torrents In the same moment too came something else that damped my spirits more than any rains however fierce and heavy could damp my skin the sense of my own utter helplessness There I was having acted on impulse at the foot of a mass of grey stone which had once been impregnable and was still formidable I neither knew how to get in nor how to look in if that had been possible and I now saw that in coming at all I ought to have come accompanied by a squad of police with authority to search the whole place from end to end and top to bottom And I reflected with a grim sense of the irony of it that to do that would have been a fine long job for a dozen men what then was it that I had undertaken single handed It was at this moment as I clung against the wall sheltering myself as well as I could from the pouring rain that I heard through its steady beating an equally steady throb as of some sort of machine It was a very subdued scarcely apparent sound but it was there it was unmistakable And suddenly though in those days we were only just becoming familiar with them I knew what it was the engine of some sort of automobile but not in action the sound came from the boilers or condensers or whatever the things were called which they used in the steam driven cars And it was near by near at my right hand farther along the line of the wall beneath which I was cowering There was something to set all my curiosity aflame what should an automobile be doing there at that hour for it was now nearing well on to midnight and in such close proximity to a half ruinous place like that And now caring no more for the rain than if it had been a springtide shower I slowly began to creep along the wall in the direction of the sound And here you will understand the situation of things better if I say that the habitable part of Hathercleugh was a long way from the old part to which I had come The entire mass of building old and new was of vast extent and the old was separated from the new by a broken and utterly ruinous wing long since covered over with ivy As for the old itself there was a great square tower at one corner of it with walls extending from its two angles it was along one of these walls that I was now creeping And presently the sound of the gentle throbbing growing slightly louder as I made my way along I came to the tower and to the deep set gateway in it and I knew at once that in that gateway there was an automobile drawn up all ready for being driven out and away Feeling quietly for the corner of the gateway I looked round cautiously lest a headlight on the car should betray my presence But there was no headlight and there was no sound beyond the steady throb of the steam and the ceaseless pouring of the rain behind me And then as I looked came a third flash of lightning and the entire scene was lighted up for me the deep set gateway with its groined and arched roof the grim walls at each side the dark massive masonry beyond it and there within the shelter a small brand new car evidently of fine and powerful make which even my inexperienced eyes knew to be ready for departure from that place at any moment And I saw something more during that flash a half open door in the wall to the left of the car and the first steps of a winding stair As the darkness fell again blacker than ever and the thunder crashed out above the old tower I stole along the wall to that door intending to listen if aught were stirring within or on the stairs or in the rooms above And I had just got my fingers on the rounded pillar of the doorway and the thunder was just dying to a grumble when a hand seized the back of my neck as in a vice and something hard and round and cold pressed itself insistingly into my right temple It was all done in the half of a second but I knew just as clearly as if I could see it that a man of no ordinary strength had gripped me by the neck with one hand and was holding a revolver to my head with the other CHAPTER XXXIV THE BARGAIN It may be that when one is placed in such a predicament as that in which I then found myself one s wits are suddenly sharpened and a new sense is given to one

1084-139230-0005	train-other-500	of the revolver and beginning to boggle at the first steps old and much worn ones which were deeply hollowed in the middle He shoved me forward Up you go he said straight ahead Put your arms up and out in front of you till you feel a door
1084-139230-0006	train-other-500	push it open He kept one hand on the scruff of my neck too tightly for comfort and with the other pressed the revolver into the cavity just above it and in this fashion we went up And even in that predicament I must have had my wits about me
1084-139230-0007	train-other-500	for I counted two and twenty steps
none	none	 Then came the door a heavy iron studded piece of strong oak and it was slightly open and as I pushed it wider in the darkness 
1084-139230-0008	train-other-500	a musty close smell came from whatever was within
none	none	 No steps said he straight on 
1084-139230-0009	train-other-500	Now then halt and keep halting If you move one finger Moneylaws out fly your brains No great loss to the community my lad but I ve some use for them yet
none	none	 He took his hand away from my neck but the revolver was still pressed into my hair and the pressure never relaxed 
1084-139230-0010	train-other-500	And suddenly I heard a snap behind me and the place in which we stood was lighted up feebly but enough to show me a cell like sort of room stone walled of course and destitute of everything in the furnishing way
none	none	 but a bit of a cranky old table and a couple of three legged stools on either side of it With the released hand he had snapped the catch of an electric pocket lamp and 
1084-139230-0011	train-other-500	in its blue glare he drew the revolver away from my head and stepping aside but always covering me with his weapon motioned me to the further stool I obeyed him mechanically
none	none	 and he pulled the table a little towards him 
1084-139230-0012	train-other-500	sat down on the other stool and resting his elbow on the table ledge poked the revolver within a few inches of my nose Now we ll talk for a few minutes Moneylaws he said quietly
none	none	 Storm or no storm I m bound to be away on my business 
1084-139230-0013	train-other-500	and I d have been off now if it hadn t been for your cursed peeping and prying But I don t want to kill you unless I m obliged to
none	none	 so you ll just serve your own interests best if you answer a question or two and tell no lies Are there more of you outside or about 
1084-139230-0014	train-other-500	Not to my knowledge said I You came alone he asked Absolutely alone I replied And why he demanded To see if I could get any news of Miss Dunlop I answered
1084-139230-0015	train-other-500	Why should you think to find Miss Dunlop here in this old ruin he argued and I could see he was genuinely curious Come now straight talk Moneylaws
none	none	 and it ll be all the better for you 
1084-139230-0016	train-other-500	She s missing since last night I replied It came to me that she likely took a short cut across these grounds and that in doing so she fell in with Sir Gilbert or with you and was kept lest she should let out what she d seen
1084-139230-0017	train-other-500	That s the plain truth mister Hollins He was keeping his eyes on me just as steadily as he kept the revolver and I saw from the look in them that he believed me Aye he said
none	none	 I see you can draw conclusions if it comes to it 
1084-139230-0018	train-other-500	But did you keep that idea of yours strictly to yourself now Absolutely I repeated You didn t mention it to a soul he asked searchingly Not to a soul said I There isn t man woman or child knows I m here
1084-139230-0019	train-other-500	I thought he might have dropped the muzzle of the revolver at that but he still kept it in a line with my nose and made no sign of relaxing his vigilance But as he was silent for the moment I let out a question at him
1084-139230-0020	train-other-500	It ll do you no harm to tell me the truth mister Hollins I said Do you know anything about Miss Dunlop Is she safe You ve maybe had a young lady yourself one time or another you ll understand what I m feeling about it
1084-139230-0021	train-other-500	He nodded solemnly at that and in quite a friendly way Aye he answered I understand your feelings well enough Moneylaws
none	none	 and I m a man of sentiment 
1084-139230-0022	train-other-500	so I ll tell you at once that the lass is safe enough and there s not as much harm come to her as you could put on a sixpence so there But I m not sure yet that you re safe yourself he went on
none	none	 still eyeing me consideringly 
1084-139230-0023	train-other-500	I m a soft hearted man Moneylaws or else you wouldn t have your brains in their place at this present minute There s a mighty lot of chance of my harming you anyway said I with a laugh that surprised myself Not so much as a penknife on me
1084-139230-0024	train-other-500	and you with that thing at my head Aye but you ve got a tongue in that head
none	none	 said he And you might be using it 
1084-139230-0025	train-other-500	But come now I m loth to harm you
none	none	 and you d best tell me a bit more 
1084-139230-0026	train-other-500	What s the police doing What police do you mean I inquired Here there everywhere anywhere he exclaimed No quibbles now you ll have had plenty of information They re acting on yours I retorted
1084-139230-0027	train-other-500	Searching about Glasgow for Sir Gilbert and Lady Carstairs you put us on to that mister Hollins I had to he answered Aye I put Lindsey on to it to be sure and he took it all in like it was gospel and so did all of you
1084-139230-0028	train-other-500	It gained time do you see Moneylaws it had to be done Then they aren t in Glasgow I asked He shook his big head solemnly at that and something like a smile came about the corners of his lips
none	none	 They re not in Glasgow 
1084-139230-0029	train-other-500	nor near it he answered readily but where all the police in England and in Scotland too for that matter
none	none	 ll find it hard to get speech with them 
1084-139230-0030	train-other-500	Out of hand Moneylaws out of hand d ye see for the police
none	none	 He gave a sort of chuckle when he said this and it emboldened me to come to grips with him as far as words went Then what harm can I do you mister Hollins I asked 
1084-139230-0031	train-other-500	You re not in any danger that I know of He looked at me as if wondering whether I wasn t trying a joke on him
none	none	 and after staring a while he shook his head 
1084-139230-0032	train-other-500	I m leaving this part finally he answered
none	none	 That s Sir Gilbert s brand new car that s all ready for me down the stairs 
1084-139230-0033	train-other-500	and as I say whether it s storm or no storm I must be away And there s just two things I can do Moneylaws I can lay you out on the floor here with your brains running over your face or I can trust to your honour
1084-139230-0034	train-other-500	We looked at each other for a full minute in silence our eyes meeting in the queer bluish light of the electric pocket lamp which he had set on the table before us Between us too was that revolver always pointing at me out of its one black eye
1084-139230-0035	train-other-500	If it s all the same to you mister Hollins
none	none	 said I at length 
1084-139230-0036	train-other-500	I d prefer you to trust to my honour Whatever quality my brains may have I d rather they were used than misused in the way you re suggesting If it s just this that you want me to hold my tongue
1084-139230-0037	train-other-500	I ll make a bargain with you he broke in on me
none	none	 You d be fine and glad to see your sweetheart Moneylaws and assure yourself that she s come to no harm and is safe and well 
1084-139230-0038	train-other-500	Aye I would that I exclaimed Give me the chance mister Hollins Then give me your word that whatever happens whatever comes you ll not mention to the police that you ve seen me tonight and that whenever you re questioned you ll know nothing about me
1084-139230-0039	train-other-500	he said eagerly Twelve hours start aye six means safety to me Moneylaws Will you keep silence Where s Miss Dunlop asked I You can be with her in three minutes he answered
none	none	 if you ll give me your word and you re a truthful lad I think 
1084-139230-0040	train-other-500	that you ll both bide where you are till morning
none	none	 and that after that 
1084-139230-0041	train-other-500	you ll keep your tongue quiet Will you do that She s close by I demanded Over our heads he said calmly And you ve only to say the word It s said mister Hollins I exclaimed Go your ways
1084-139230-0042	train-other-500	I ll never breathe a syllable of it to a soul Neither in six nor twelve nor a thousand hours your secret s safe enough with me so long as you keep your word about her and just now He drew his free hand off the table still watching me
1084-139230-0043	train-other-500	and still keeping up the revolver and from a drawer in the table
none	none	 between us pulled out a key and pushed it over 
1084-139230-0044	train-other-500	There s a door behind you in yon corner he said And you ll find a lantern at its foot you ve matches on you no doubt And beyond the door there s another stair that leads up to the turret
1084-139230-0045	train-other-500	and you ll find her there and safe and so go your ways now Moneylaws and I ll go mine He dropped the revolver into a side pocket of his waterproof coat as he spoke and pointing me to the door in the corner
1084-139230-0046	train-other-500	turned to that by which he had entered And as he turned he snapped off the light of his electric lamp while I myself
none	none	 having fumbled for a box of matches struck one and looked around me for this lantern he had mentioned 
1084-139230-0047	train-other-500	In its spluttering light I saw his big figure round the corner then just as I made for the lantern the match went out and all was darkness again
none	none	 As I felt for another match I heard him pounding the stair 
1084-139230-0048	train-other-500	and suddenly there was a sort of scuffle and he cried out loudly once and there was the sound of a fall and then of lighter steps hurrying away and then a heavy rattling groan
1084-139230-0049	train-other-500	And with my heart in my mouth and fingers trembling so that I could scarcely hold the match I made shift to light the candle in the lantern and went fearfully after him There
none	none	 in an angle of the stairway he was lying 
1084-139230-0050	train-other-500	with the blood running in dark streams from a gap in his throat while his hands which he had instinctively put up to it were feebly dropping away and relaxing on his broad chest
1084-139230-0051	train-other-500	And as I put the lantern closer to him he looked up at me in a queer puzzled fashion
none	none	 and died before my very eyes CHAPTER XXXV THE SWAG I shrank back against the mouldy wall of that old stairway shivering as if I had been suddenly stricken with the ague 
1430-139231-0000	train-other-500	I had trembled in every limb before ever I heard the sound of the sudden scuffle and from a variety of reasons the relief of having Hollins s revolver withdrawn from my nose the knowledge that Maisie was close by
1430-139231-0001	train-other-500	the gradual wearing down of my nerves during a whole day of heart sickening suspense but now the trembling had deepened into utter shaking I heard my own teeth chattering and my heart going like a pump as I stood there
1430-139231-0002	train-other-500	staring at the man s face over which a grey pallor was quickly spreading itself And though I knew that he was as dead as ever a man can be I called to him and the sound of my own voice frightened me
1430-139231-0003	train-other-500	mister Hollins I cried mister Hollins And then I was frightened still more for as if in answer to my summons but of course because of some muscular contraction following on death
1430-139231-0004	train-other-500	the dead lips slightly parted and they looked as if they were grinning at me At that
none	none	 I lost what nerve I had left and let out a cry 
1430-139231-0005	train-other-500	and turned to run back into the room where we had talked But as I turned there were sounds at the foot of the stair and the flash of a bull s eye lamp and I heard Chisholm s voice down in the gateway below Hullo up there he was demanding
1430-139231-0006	train-other-500	Is there anybody above It seemed as if I was bursting my chest when I got an answer out to him Oh man I shouted come up There s me here and there s murder
1430-139231-0007	train-other-500	I heard him exclaim in a dismayed and surprised fashion and mutter some words to somebody that was evidently with him and then there was heavy tramping below and presently Chisholm s face appeared round the corner
1430-139231-0008	train-other-500	and as he held his bull s eye before him its light fell full on Hollins and he jumped back
none	none	 a step or two 
1430-139231-0009	train-other-500	Mercy on us he let out What s all this The man s lying dead Dead enough Chisholm said I gradually getting the better of my fright And murdered too
1430-139231-0010	train-other-500	But who murdered him God knows I don t He trapped me in here not ten minutes ago
none	none	 and had me at the end of a revolver and we came to terms 
1430-139231-0011	train-other-500	and he left me and he was no sooner down the stairs here than I heard a bit of a scuffle and him fall and groan and I ran out to find that And somebody was off and away have you seen nobody outside there
1430-139231-0012	train-other-500	You can t see an inch before your eyes
none	none	 the night s that black 
1430-139231-0013	train-other-500	he answered bending over the dead man We ve only just come round from the house But whatever were you doing here yourself I came to see if I could find any trace of Miss Dunlop in this old part I answered and he told me
1430-139231-0014	train-other-500	just before this happened she s in the tower above and safe And I ll go up there now Chisholm for if she s heard aught of all this There was another policeman with him and they stepped past the body
1430-139231-0015	train-other-500	and followed me into the little room and looked round curiously I left them whispering and opened the door that Hollins had pointed out There was a stair there as he had said set deep in the thick wall
1430-139231-0016	train-other-500	and I went a long way up it before I came to another door in which there was a key set in the lock And in a moment I had it turned and there was Maisie
1430-139231-0017	train-other-500	and I had her in my arms and was flooding her with questions and holding the light to her face to see if she was safe all at once You ve come to no harm you re all right you ve not been frightened out of your senses how did it all come about
1430-139231-0018	train-other-500	I rapped out at her Oh Maisie I ve been seeking for you all day long and And then being utterly overwrought I was giving out
none	none	 and I suddenly felt a 
1430-139231-0019	train-other-500	queer giddiness coming over me and if it had not been for her I should have fallen and maybe fainted and she saw it and got me to a couch from which she had started when I turned the key
1430-139231-0020	train-other-500	and was holding a glass of water to my lips that she snatched up from a table and encouraging me who should have been consoling her
none	none	 all within the minute of my setting eyes on her 
1430-139231-0021	train-other-500	and me so weak as it seemed that I could only cling on to her hand making sure
none	none	 that I had really got her 
1430-139231-0022	train-other-500	There there it s all right Hugh she murmured patting my arm as if I had been some child
none	none	 that had just started awake from a bad dream 
1430-139231-0023	train-other-500	There s no harm come to me at all
none	none	 barring the weary waiting in this black hole of a place 
1430-139231-0024	train-other-500	I ve had food and drink and a light as you see they promised me I should have no harm when they locked me in But oh it s seemed like it was ages since then They Who I demanded Who locked you in
1430-139231-0025	train-other-500	Sir Gilbert and that butler of his Hollins she answered I took the short cut through the grounds here last night and I ran upon the two of them at the corner of the ruins and they stopped me and wouldn t let me go
1430-139231-0026	train-other-500	and locked me up here promising I d be let out later on Sir Gilbert I exclaimed
none	none	 You re sure it was Sir Gilbert 
1430-139231-0027	train-other-500	Of course I m sure she replied Who else And I made out they were afraid of my letting out that I d seen them it was Sir Gilbert himself said they could run no risks You ve seen him since I asked
none	none	 He s been in here 
1430-139231-0028	train-other-500	No not since last night she answered And Hollins not since this morning when he brought me some food I ve not wanted for that she went on with a laugh pointing to things that had been set on the table
1430-139231-0029	train-other-500	And he said then that about midnight tonight I d hear the key turned and after that I was free to go but I d have to make my way home on foot
none	none	 for he wasn t wanting me to be in Berwick again too soon 
1430-139231-0030	train-other-500	Aye I said shaking my head I m beginning to see through some of it But Maisie you ll be a good girl and just do what I tell you and that s to stay where you are until I fetch you down
1430-139231-0031	train-other-500	For there s more dreadfulness below where Sir Gilbert may be Heaven knows but Hollins is lying murdered on the stair and if I didn t see him murdered I saw him take his last breath She too shook a bit at that
1430-139231-0032	train-other-500	and she gripped me tighter You re not by yourself Hugh she asked anxiously You re in no danger But just then Chisholm called up the stair of the turret asking
none	none	 was Miss Dunlop safe and I bade Maisie speak to him 
1430-139231-0033	train-other-500	That s good news said he But will you tell mister Hugh to come down to us and you d best stop where you are yourself Miss Dunlop there s no very pleasant sight down this way Have you no idea at all who did this
1430-139231-0034	train-other-500	he asked as I went down to him You were with him Man alive I ve no more idea than you have I exclaimed He was making off somewhere in yon car that s below
none	none	 he threatened me with the loss of my life if I didn t agree to let him get away in peace 
1430-139231-0035	train-other-500	and he was going down the stairs to the car when it happened But I ll tell you this Miss Dunlop says Sir Gilbert was here last night
none	none	 and it was he and Hollins imprisoned her above there 
1430-139231-0036	train-other-500	frightened she d let out on them if she got away Then the Glasgow tale was all lies he exclaimed It came from this man too that s lying dead it s been a put up thing d ye think mister Hugh
1430-139231-0037	train-other-500	It s all part of a put up thing Chisholm said I Hadn t we better get the man in here and see what s on him And what made you come here yourselves and are there any more of you about We came asking some information at the house he answered
1430-139231-0038	train-other-500	and we were passing round here under the wall on our way to the road when we heard that car throbbing and then saw your bit of a light And that s a good idea of yours and we ll bring him into this place and see if there s aught to give us a clue
1430-139231-0039	train-other-500	Slip down he went on turning to the other man and bring the headlights off the car so that we can see what we re doing Do you think
none	none	 this is some of Sir Gilbert s work mister Hugh 
1430-139231-0040	train-other-500	he whispered when we were alone
none	none	 If he was about here and this Hollins was in some of his secrets 
1430-139231-0041	train-other-500	Oh don t ask me I exclaimed It seems like there was nothing but murder on every hand of us And whoever did this can t be far away only the night s that black and there s so many holes and corners hereabouts that it would
1430-139231-0042	train-other-500	be like searching a rabbit warren you ll have to get help from the town Aye to be sure he agreed But we ll take a view of things ourselves first There may be effects on him that ll suggest something
1430-139231-0043	train-other-500	We carried the body into the room when the policeman came up with the lamps from the car and stretched it out on the table at which
none	none	 Hollins and I had sat not so long before though that time indeed now seemed to me to belong to some other life And Chisholm made a hasty examination of what there was in the man s pockets 
1430-139231-0044	train-other-500	and there was little that had any significance except that in a purse which he carried in an inner pocket of his waistcoat
none	none	 there was a considerable sum of money in notes and gold 
1430-139231-0045	train-other-500	The other policeman who held one of the lamps over the table while Chisholm was making this search waited silently until it was over and then he nodded his head at the stair
1430-139231-0046	train-other-500	There s some boxes or cases down in yon car he remarked All fastened up and labelled it might be worth while to take a look into them sergeant What s more there s tools lying in the car
1430-139231-0047	train-other-500	that looks like they d been used to fasten them up We ll have them up here then said Chisholm Stop you here mister Hugh
none	none	 while we fetch them and don t let your young lady come down 
1430-139231-0048	train-other-500	while that s lying here You might cover him up he went on with a significant nod It s an ill sight for even a man s eyes that There were some old moth eaten hangings
1430-139231-0049	train-other-500	about the walls here and there and I took one down and laid it over Hollins wondering while I did this office for him
none	none	 what strange secret 
1430-139231-0050	train-other-500	it was that he had carried away into death and why that queer and puzzled expression had crossed his face in death s very moment And that done I ran up to Maisie again
none	none	 bidding her be patient awhile 
1430-139231-0051	train-other-500	and we talked quietly a bit until Chisholm called me down to look at the boxes There were four of them stout new made wooden cases clamped with iron at the corners and securely screwed down
1430-139231-0052	train-other-500	and when the policemen invited me to feel the weight I was put in mind in a lesser degree of Gilverthwaite s oak chest What do you think s like to be in there now mister Hugh asked Chisholm
none	none	 Do you know what I think There s various heavy metals in the world 
1430-139231-0053	train-other-500	aye and isn t gold one of the heaviest it ll not be lead that s in here And look you at that He pointed to some neatly addressed labels tacked strongly to each lid
none	none	 the writing done in firm bold print like characters 
1430-139231-0054	train-other-500	John Harrison passenger by S S Aerolite Newcastle to Hamburg
none	none	 I was looking from one label to the other and finding them all alike when we heard voices at the foot of the stair and from out of them came Superintendent Murray s demanding loudly who was above CHAPTER XXXVI GOLD There was quite a company of men came up the stair with Murray crowding all of them into the room with eyes full of astonishment at what they saw mister Lindsey and mister Gavin Smeaton and a policeman or two and what was of more interest to me a couple of strangers But looking at these more closely I saw that I had seen one of them before an elderly man whom I recognized as having been present in court when Carter was brought up before the magistrates a quiet noticing sort of man whom I remembered as appearing to take great and intelligent interest in the proceedings And he and the other man now with him seemed to take just as keen an interest in what Chisholm and I had to tell but while Murray was full of questions to both of us they asked none Only during that questioning the man whom I had never seen before quietly lifted the hanging which I had spread over Hollins s dead body and took a searching look at his face mister Lindsey drew me aside and pointed at the elderly man whom I remembered seeing in the police court You see yon gentleman he whispered That s a mister Elphinstone that was formerly steward to old Sir Alexander Carstairs He s retired a good many years now and lives the other side of Alnwick in a place of his own But this affair s fetched him into the light again to some purpose I saw him in the court when Carter was before the bench mister Lindsey I remarked Aye and I wish he d told me that day what he could have told exclaimed mister Lindsey under his breath But he s a cautious a very cautious man and he preferred to work quietly and it wasn t until very late tonight that he came to Murray and sent for me an hour it was after you d gone home The other man with him is a London detective Man there s nice revelations come out and pretty much on the lines I was suspecting We d have been up here an hour ago if it hadn t been for yon storm And but now that the storm s over Hugh we must get Maisie Dunlop out of this come up now and show me where she is that first and the rest after We left the others still grouped around the dead man and the boxes which had been brought up from the car and I took mister Lindsey up the stairs to the room in the turret which had served Maisie for a prison all that weary time And after a word or two with her about her sore adventures mister Lindsey told her she must be away and he would get Murray to send one of the policemen with her to see her safe home I myself being still wanted down below But at that Maisie began to show signs of distinct dislike and disapproval I ll not go a yard mister Lindsey she declared unless you ll give me your word that you ll not let Hugh out of your sight again till all this is settled and done with Twice within this last few days the lad s been within an inch of his life and they say the third time pays for all and how do I know there mightn t be a third time in his case And I d rather stay by him and we ll take our chances together Now now broke in mister Lindsey patting her arm There s a good half dozen of us with him now and we ll take good care no harm comes to him or any of us so be a good lass and get you home to Andrew and tell him all about it for the worthy man s got a bee in his bonnet that we ve been in some way responsible for your absence my girl You re sure you never set eyes on Sir Gilbert again after he and Hollins stopped you he asked suddenly as we went down the stair Nor heard his voice down here or anywhere I never saw him again nor heard him answered Maisie And till Hugh came just now I d never seen Hollins himself since morning and Oh She had caught sight of the still figure stretched out in the lower room and she shrank to me as we hurried her past it and down to the gateway below Thither Murray followed us and after a bit more questioning he put her in a car in which he and some of the others had come up and sent one of his men off with her but before this Maisie pulled me away into the darkness and gripped me tight by the arm You ll promise me Hugh before ever I go that you ll not run yourself into any more dangers she asked earnestly We ve been through enough of that and I m just more than satisfied with it and it s like as if there was something lurking about She began to shiver as she looked into the black night about us and it was indeed although in summer time as black a night as ever I saw and her hand got a tighter grip on mine How do you know yon bad man isn t still about she whispered It was he killed Hollins of course and if he wanted to kill you yon time in the yacht he ll want again It s small chance he ll get then now I said There s no fear of that Maisie amongst all yon lot of men above Away you go now and get to your bed and as sure as sure I ll be home to eat my breakfast with you It s my opinion all this is at an end Not while yon man s alive she answered And I d have far rather stayed with you till it s daylight anyway However she let me put her into the car and when I had charged the policeman who went with her not to take his eyes off her until she was safe in Andrew Dunlop s house they went off and mister Lindsey and I turned up the stair again Murray had preceded us and under his superintendence Chisholm was beginning to open the screwed up boxes The rest of us stood round while this job was going on waiting in silence It was no easy or quick job for the screws had been fastened in after a thoroughly workmanlike fashion and when he got the first lid off we saw that the boxes themselves had been evidently specially made for this purpose They were of some very strong well seasoned wood and they were lined first with zinc and then with thick felt And as we were soon aware they were filled to the brim with gold There it lay roll upon roll all carefully packed gold It shone red and fiery in the light of our lamps and it seemed to me that in every gleam of it I saw devils eyes full of malice and mockery and murder But there was one box lighter than the rest in which instead of gold we found the valuable things of which Hollins had told mister Lindsey and mister Portlethorpe and myself when he came to us on his lying mission only the previous midnight There they all were the presents that had been given to various of the Carstairs baronets by royal donors carefully packed and bestowed And at sight of them mister Lindsey looked significantly at me and then at Murray He was a wily and a clever man this fellow that s lying behind us he muttered He pulled our hair over our eyes to some purpose with his tale of Lady Carstairs and her bicycle but I m forgetting he broke off and drew me aside There s another thing come out since you left me and Smeaton tonight he whispered The police have found out something for themselves I ll give them that credit That was all lies lies nothing but lies that Hollins told us all done to throw us off the scent You remember the tale of the registered letter from Edinburgh the police found out last evening from the post folks that there never was any registered letter You remember Hollins said Lady Carstairs went off on her bicycle The police have found out she never went off on any bicycle she wasn t there to go off She was away early that morning she took a train south from Beal station before breakfast at least a veiled woman answering her description did and she s safe hidden in London or elsewhere by now my lad But him the man Sir Gilbert or whoever he is I whispered What of him mister Lindsey Aye just so he said I m gradually piecing it together as we go on It would seem to me that he made his way to Edinburgh after getting rid of you as he thought and hoped probably got there the very next morning through the help of yon fisherman at Largo Robertson who of course told us and the police a pack of lies and when he d got the last of these securities from Paley he worked back here secretly and with the help of Hollins and has no doubt kept quiet in this old tower until they could get away with that gold Of course Hollins has been in at all this but now who s killed Hollins And where s the chief party the other man What I exclaimed You don t think he killed Hollins then I should be a fool if I did my lad he answered Bethink yourself when all was cut and dried for their getting off do you think he d stick a knife in his confederate s throat No I can see their plan and it was a good one Hollins would have run those cases down to Newcastle in a couple of hours there d have been no suspicion about them and no questions which he couldn t answer he d have gone across to Hamburg with them himself As for the man we know as Sir Gilbert you ll be hearing something presently from mister Elphinstone yonder but my impression is as Maisie never saw or heard of him during the night and day that he got away after his wife last night and with those securities on him Then who killed Hollins I said in sheer amazement Are there others in at all this You may well ask that lad he responded shaking his head Indeed though we re nearing it I think we re not quite at the end of the lane and there ll be a queer turning or two in it yet before we get out But here s Murray come to an end of the present business Murray had finished his inspection of the cases and was helping Chisholm to replace the lids He Chisholm and the detective were exchanging whispered remarks over this job mister Elphinstone and mister Gavin Smeaton were talking together in low voices near the door Presently Murray turned to us We can do no more here now mister Lindsey he said and I m going to lock this place up until daylight and leave a man in the gateway below on guard But as to the next step you haven t the least idea in your head Moneylaws about Hollins s assailant he went on turning to me You heard and saw nothing I ve told you what I heard mister Murray I answered As to seeing anything how could I The thing happened on the stair there and I was in this corner unlocking the inner door It s as big a mystery as all the rest of it he muttered And it s just convincing me there s more behind all this than we think for And one thing s certain we can t search these grounds or the neighbourhood until the light comes But we can go round to the house He marched us all out at that and himself locked up the room leaving the dead man with the chests of gold and having stationed a constable in the gateway of the old tower he led us off in a body to the habited part of the house There were lights there in plenty and a couple of policemen at the door and behind them a whole troop of servants in the hall half dressed and open mouthed with fright and curiosity CHAPTER XXXVII THE DARK POOL As I went into that house with the rest of them I had two sudden impressions One was that here at my side in the person of mister Gavin Smeaton was in all probability its real owner the real holder of the ancient title who was coming to his lawful rights in this strange fashion The other was of the contrast between my own coming at that moment and the visit which I had paid there only a few evenings previously when Hollins had regarded me with some disfavour and the usurper had been so friendly Now Hollins was lying dead in the old ruin and the other man was a fugitive and where was he Murray had brought us there to do something towards settling that point and he began his work at once by assembling every Jack and Jill in the house and with the help of the London detective subjecting them to a searching examination as to the recent doings of their master and mistress and the butler But mister Lindsey motioned mister Elphinstone and mister Gavin Smeaton and myself into a side room and shut the door on us We can leave the police to do their own work he remarked motioning us to be seated at a convenient table My impression is that they ll find little out from the servants And while that s afoot I d like to have that promised story of yours mister Elphinstone I only got an idea of it you know when you and Murray came to my house And these two would like to hear it one of them at any rate is more interested in this affair than you d think or than he knew of himself until recently Now that we were in a properly lighted room I took a more careful look at the former steward of Hathercleugh He was a well preserved shrewd looking man of between sixty and seventy quiet and observant the sort of man that you could see would think a lot without saying much He smiled a little as he put his hands together on the table and glanced at our expectant faces it was just the smile of a man who knows what he is talking about Aye well mister Lindsey he responded maybe there s not so much mystery in this affair as there seems to be once you ve got at an idea I ll tell you how I got at mine and what s come of it Of course you ll not know for I think you didn t come to Berwick yourself until after I d left the neighbourhood but I was connected with the Hathercleugh estate from the time I was a lad until fifteen years ago when I gave up the steward s job and went to live on a bit of property of my own near Alnwick Of course I knew the two sons Michael and Gilbert and I remember well enough when owing to perpetual quarrelling with their father he gave them both a good lot of money and they went their several ways And after that neither ever came back that I heard of nor did I ever come across either except on one occasion to which I ll refer in due course In time as I ve just said I retired in time too Sir Alexander died and I heard that mister Michael being dead in the West Indies Sir Gilbert had come into the title and estates I did think once or twice of coming over to see him but the older a man gets the fonder he is of his own fireside and I didn t come here nor did I ever hear much of him he certainly made no attempt to see me And so we come to the beginning of what we ll call the present crisis That beginning came with the man who turned up in Berwick this spring You mean Gilverthwaite asked mister Lindsey Aye but I didn t know him by that name assented mister Elphinstone with a sly smile I didn t know him by any name What I know is this It must have been about a week certainly not more before Gilverthwaite s death that he I m sure of his identity because of his description called on me at my house and with a good deal of hinting and such like told me that he was a private inquiry agent and could I tell him something about the late Michael Carstairs and that it turned out was Did I know if Michael was married before he left England and if so where and to whom Of course I knew nothing about it and as the man wouldn t give me the least information I packed him off pretty sharply And the next thing I heard was of the murder of John Phillips I didn t connect that with the visit of the mysterious man at first but of course I read the account of the inquest and mister Ridley s evidence and then I began to see there was some strange business going on though I couldn t even guess at what it could be And I did nothing and said nothing there seemed nothing then that I could do or say though I meant to come forward later until I saw the affair of Crone in the newspapers and I knew then that there was more in the matter than was on the surface So when I learnt that a man named Carter had been arrested on the charge of murdering Crone I came to Berwick and went to the court to hear what was said when Carter was put before the magistrates I got a quiet seat in the court and maybe you didn t see me I did I exclaimed I remember you perfectly mister Elphinstone Aye he said with an amused smile You re the lad that s had his finger in the pie pretty deep you re well out of it my man Well there I was and a man sitting by me that knew everybody and before ever the case was called this man pointed out Sir Gilbert Carstairs coming in and being given a seat on the bench And I knew that there was a fine to do and perhaps nobody but myself knowing of it for the man pointed out to me was no Sir Gilbert Carstairs nor any Carstairs at all not he But I knew him You knew him exclaimed mister Lindsey Man that s the first direct bit of real illumination we ve had And who is he then mister Elphinstone Take your time answered mister Elphinstone We ll have to go back a bit you ll put the police court out of your mind a while It s about I forget rightly how long since but it was just after I gave up the stewardship that I had occasion to go up to London on business of my own And there one morning as I was sauntering down the lower end of Regent Street I met Gilbert Carstairs whom I d never seen since he left home He d his arm in mine in a minute and he would have me go with him to his rooms in Jermyn Street close by there was no denying him I went and found his rooms full of trunks and cases and the like he and a friend of his he said were just off on a sort of hunting exploration trip to some part of Central America I don t know what they weren t going to do but it was to be a big affair and they were to come back loaded up with natural history specimens and to make a pile of money out of the venture too And he was telling me all about it in his eager excitable way when the other man came in and I was introduced to him And gentlemen that s the man I saw under the name of Sir Gilbert Carstairs on the bench at Berwick only the other day He s changed of course more than I should have thought he would have done in fifteen years for that s about the time since I saw him and Gilbert together there in Jermyn Street but I knew him as soon as I clapped eyes on him and whatever doubt I had went as soon as I saw him lift his right hand to his moustache for there are two fingers missing on that hand the middle ones and I remembered that fact about the man Gilbert Carstairs had introduced to me I knew I tell you as I sat in that court that the fellow there on the bench listening was an impostor We were all bending forward across the table listening eagerly and there was a question in all our thoughts which mister Lindsey put into words The man s name It was given to me in Jermyn Street that morning as Meekin doctor Meekin answered mister Elphinstone Gilbert Carstairs as you re aware was a medical man himself he d qualified anyway and this was a friend of his But that was all I gathered then they were both up to the eyes in their preparations for they were off for Southampton that night and I left them to it and of course never heard of them again But now to come back to the police court the other day I tell you I was purposely in a quiet corner and there I kept till the case was over but just when everybody was getting away the man on the bench caught sight of me Ah exclaimed mister Lindsey looking across at me Ah that s another reason that supplements the ice ax one Aye he caught sight of you mister Elphinstone And continued mister Elphinstone I saw a queer puzzled look come into his face He looked again looked hard I took no notice of his look though I continued to watch him and presently he turned away and went out But I knew he had recognized me as a man he had seen somewhere Now remember when Gilbert Carstairs introduced me to this man Gilbert did not mention any connection of mine with Hathercleugh he merely spoke of me as an old friend so Meekin when he came into these parts would have no idea of finding me here But I saw he was afraid badly afraid because of his recognition and doubt about me And the next question was what was I to do I m not the man to do things in haste and I could see this was a black deep business with maybe two murders in it I went off and got my lunch and thought At the end of it rather than go to the police I went to your office mister Lindsey And your office was locked up and you were all away for the day And then an idea struck me I have a relative the man outside with Murray who s a high placed officer in the Criminal Investigation Department at New Scotland Yard I would go to him So I went straight off to London by the very next South express Why To see if he could trace anything about this Meekin Aye nodded mister Lindsey admiringly You were in the right of it there that was a good notion And you did Not since the Jermyn Street affair answered mister Elphinstone We traced him in the medical register all right up to that point His name is Francis Meekin he s various medical letters to it He was in one of the London hospitals with Gilbert Carstairs he shared those rooms in Jermyn Street with Gilbert Carstairs We found easily a man who d been their valet and who remembered their setting off on the hunting expedition They never came back to Jermyn Street anyway Nothing was ever heard or seen of them in their old haunts about that quarter from that time And when we d found all that out we came straight down last evening to the police and that s all mister Lindsey And of course the thing is plain to me Gilbert probably died while in this man s company this man possessed himself of his letters and papers and so on and in time hearing how things were and when the chance came he presented himself to the family solicitors as Gilbert Carstairs Could anything be plainer Nothing exclaimed mister Lindsey It s a sure case and simple when you see it in the light of your knowledge a case of common personation But I m wondering what the connection between the Gilverthwaite and Phillips affair and this Meekin has been if we could get at it Shall I give you my theory suggested mister Elphinstone Of course I ve read all there s been in the newspapers and Murray told me a lot last night before we came to you and you mentioned mister Ridley s discovery well then I ve no doubt whatever that this young gentleman is Michael Carstairs son and therefore the real owner of the title and estates And I ll tell you how I explain the whole thing Michael Carstairs as I remember him and I saw plenty of him as a lad and a young man was what you d call violently radical in his ideas He was a queer eccentric dour chap in some ways kindly enough in others He d a most extraordinary objection to titles for one thing another he thought that given a chance every man ought to make himself Now my opinion is that when he secretly married a girl who was much below him in station he went off to America intending to put his principles in practice He evidently wanted his son to owe nothing to his birth and though he certainly made ample and generous provision for him and gave him a fine start he wanted him to make his own life and fortune That accounts for mister Gavin Smeaton s bringing up But now as regards the secret Michael Carstairs was evidently a rolling stone who came up against some queer characters Gilverthwaite was one Phillips whoever he may have been another It s very evident from what I ve heard from you that the three men were associates at one time And it may be it s probably the case that in some moment of confidence Michael let out his secret to these two and that when he was dead they decided to make more inquiries into it possibly to blackmail the man who had stepped in and whom they most likely believed to be the genuine Sir Gilbert Carstairs Put it this way once they d found the documentary evidence they wanted the particulars of Michael s marriage and so on what had they to do but go to Sir Gilbert as they thought him to be and put it to him that if he didn t square them to keep silence they d reveal the truth to his nephew whom it s evident they d already got to know of as mister Gavin Smeaton But as regards the actual murder of Phillips ah that s a mystery that in my opinion is not like to be solved The probability is that a meeting had been arranged with Sir Gilbert which means of course Meekin that night and that Phillips was killed by him As to Crone it s my opinion that Crone s murder came out of Crone s own greed and foolishness he probably caught Meekin unawares told what he knew and paid the penalty There s another possible theory about the Phillips murder remarked mister Gavin Smeaton According to what you know mister Elphinstone this Meekin is a man who has travelled much abroad so had Phillips How do we know that when Meekin and Phillips met that night Meekin wasn t recognized by Phillips as Meekin and that Meekin accordingly had a double incentive to kill him Good exclaimed mister Lindsey Capital theory and probably the right one But he continued rising and making for the door all the theories in the world won t help us to lay hands on Meekin and I m going to see if Murray has made out anything from his search and his questioning Murray had made out nothing There was nothing whatever in the private rooms of the supposed Sir Gilbert Carstairs and his wife to suggest any clue to their whereabouts the servants could tell nothing of their movements beyond what the police already knew Sir Gilbert had never been seen by any of them since the morning on which he went into Berwick to hear the case against Carter Lady Carstairs had not been seen since her departure from the house secretly two mornings later Not one of all the many servants men or women could tell anything of their master or mistress nor of any suspicious doings on the part of Hollins during the past two days except that he had been away from the house a good deal Whatever share the butler had taken in these recent events he had played his part skilfully So as it seemed there was nothing for it but to look further away the impression of the police being that Meekin had escaped in one direction and his wife in another and that it had been their plan that Hollins should foregather with them somewhere on the Continent and presently we all left Hathercleugh House to go back to Berwick As we crossed the threshold mister Lindsey turned to mister Gavin Smeaton with a shrewd smile The next time you step across here sir it ll be as Sir Gavin Carstairs he said And we ll hope that ll not long be delayed I m afraid there s a good deal to do before you ll be seeing that mister Lindsey answered the prospective owner We re not out of the wood yet you know We certainly were not out of the wood so far as I was concerned those last words might have been prophetic as a little later I was inclined to think Maisie s had been before she went off in the car The rest of them mister Lindsey and his group Murray and his had driven up from Berwick in the first conveyances they could get at that time of night and they now went off to where they had been waiting in a neighbouring shed They wanted me to go with them but I was anxious about my bicycle a nearly new machine I had stowed it away as securely as I could under some thick undergrowth on the edge of the woods but the downpour of rain had been so heavy that I knew it must have soaked through the foliage and that I should have a nice lot of rust to face let alone a saturated saddle So I went away across the park to where I had left it and the others drove off to Berwick and so both mister Lindsey and myself broke our solemn words to Maisie For now I was alone and I certainly did not anticipate more danger But not only danger but the very threatening of death was on me as I went my way We had stayed some time in Hathercleugh House and the dawn had broken before we left The morning came clear and bright after the storm and the newly risen sun it was just four o clock and he was nicely above the horizon was transforming the clustering raindrops on the firs and pines into glistening diamonds as I plunged into the thick of the woods I had no other thought at that moment but of getting home and changing my clothes before going to Andrew Dunlop s to tell the news when as I crossed a narrow cut in the undergrowth I saw some distance away a man s head slowly look out from the trees I drew back on the instant watching Fortunately or unfortunately he was not looking in my direction and did not catch even a momentary glance of me and when he twisted his neck in my direction I saw that he was the man we had been talking of and whom I now knew to be doctor Meekin And it flashed on me at once that he was hanging about for Hollins all unconscious that Hollins was lying dead there in the old tower So it was not he who had driven that murderous knife into Hollins s throat I watched him myself securely hidden He came out of his shelter crossed the cut went through the belt of wood which I had just passed and looked out across the park to the house all this I saw by cautiously edging through the trees and bushes behind me He was a good forty yards away from me at that time but I could see the strained anxious expression on his face Things had gone wrong Hollins and the car had not met him where he had expected them and he was trying to find out what had happened And once he made a movement as if he would skirt the coppices and make for the tower which lay right opposite but with an open space between it and us and then he as suddenly drew back and began to go away among the trees I followed him cautiously I had always been a bit proud of what I called my woodcraft having played much at Red Indians as a youngster and I took care to walk lightly as I stalked him from one brake to another He went on and on a long way right away from Hathercleugh and in the direction of where Till meets Tweed And at last he was out of the Hathercleugh grounds and close to the Till and in the end he took to a thin belt of trees that ran down the side of the Till close by the place where Crone s body had been found and almost opposite the very spot on the other bank where I had come across Phillips lying dead and suddenly I saw what he was after There right ahead was an old boat tied up to the bank he was making for it intending doubtless to put himself across the two rivers to get the north bank of the Tweed and so to make for safety in other quarters It was there that things went wrong I was following cautiously from tree to tree close to the river bank when my foot caught in a trail of ground bramble and I went headlong into the brushwood Before I was well on my feet he had turned and was running back at me his face white with rage and alarm and a revolver in his hand And when he saw who it was he had the revolver at the full length of his arm covering me Go back he said stopping and steadying himself No said I If you come a yard further Moneylaws I ll shoot you dead he declared I mean it Go back I m not coming a foot nearer I retorted keeping where I was But I m not going back And whenever you move forward I m following I m not losing sight of you again mister Meekin He fairly started at that and then he began looking on all sides of me as if to find out if I was accompanied And all of a sudden he plumped me with a question Where is Hollins he asked I ll be bound you know Dead I answered him Dead mister Meekin As dead as Phillips or as Abel Crone And the police are after you all round and you d better fling that thing into the Till there and come with me You ll not get away from me as easily now as you did yon time in your yacht It was then that he fired at me from some twelve or fifteen yards distance And whether he meant to kill me or only to cripple me I don t know but the bullet went through my left knee at the lower edge of the knee cap and the next thing I knew I was sprawling on all fours on the earth and the next and it was in the succeeding second before even I felt a smart I was staring up from that position to see the vengeance that fell on my would be murderer in the very instant of his attempt on me For as he fired and I fell a woman sprang out of the bushes at his side and a knife flashed and then he too fell with a cry that was something between a groan and a scream and I saw that his assailant was the Irishwoman Nance Maguire and I knew at once who it was that had killed Hollins But she had not killed Meekin He rose like a badly wounded thing half rose that is as I have seen crippled animals rise and he cried like a beast in a trap fighting with his hands And the woman struck again with the knife and again he sank back and again he rose and I shut my eyes sick with horror as she drove the knife into him for the third time But that was nothing to the horror to come When I looked again he was still writhing and crying and fighting blindly for his life and I cried out on her to leave him alone for I saw that in a few minutes he would be dead I even made an effort to crawl to them that I might drag her away from him but my knee gave at the movement and I fell back half fainting And taking no more notice of me than if I had been one of the stocks and stones close by she suddenly gripped him writhing as he was by the throat and drawing him over the bank as easily as if he had been a child in her grasp she plunged knee deep into the Till and held him down under the water until he was drowned There was a most extraordinary horror came over me as I lay there powerless to move propped up on my elbow watching The purposeful deliberation with which the woman finished her work the dead silence about us broken only by an occasional faint lapping of the river against its bank the knowledge that this was a deed of revenge all these things produced a mental state in me which was as near to the awful as ever I approached it I could only lie and watch fascinated But it was over at last and she let the body go and stood watching for a moment as it floated into a dark pool beneath the alders and then shaking herself like a dog she came up the bank and looked at me in silence That was in revenge for Crone I managed to get out It was them killed Crone she answered in a queer dry voice Let the pollis find this one where they found Crone You re not greatly hurt yourself and there s somebody at hand Then she suddenly turned and vanished amongst the trees and twisting myself round in the direction to which she had pointed I saw a gamekeeper coming along His gun was thrown carelessly in the crook of his arm and he was whistling gaily and unconcernedly I have a perpetual memento of that morning in my somewhat crippled knee And once two years ago when I was on business in a certain English town and in a quarter of it into which few but its own denizens penetrate I met for one moment at a slum corner a great raw boned Irishwoman who noticed my bit of a limp and turned her eyes for an instant to give me a sharp look that won as sharp an answer And there may have been mutual understanding and sympathy in the glance we thus exchanged certainly when it had passed between us we continued on our separate ways silent THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dead Men s Money by J S Fletcher END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DEAD MEN S MONEY This file should

Gutenberg tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year For example http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER ten thousand are filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For example an eBook of filename ten thousand two hundred thirty four would be found at http www gutenberg net one zero two three ten thousand two hundred thirty four or filename twenty four thousand six hundred eighty nine would be found at http www gutenberg net two four six eight twenty four thousand six hundred eighty nine An alternative method of locating eBooks http www
