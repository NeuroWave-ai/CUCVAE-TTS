have just handed me a small bunch of asbestos writing paper and the fountain pen has been sterilized to remove the poison so I will write you Great Scottovitch you can never enjoy the feeling of anxiety which gallops over me when I wake in the morning and wonder will the hard boiled eggs explode before I eat my breakfast At six o clock this morning I was awakened by a scratching noise on the iron quilt which covers my repose A cold perspiration broke out on my forehead I buried my head in the hardwood pillows and waited the end Just then M Stepupski the Minister of the Department of Bum Shells walked in through the secret tunnel in the wall I threw the aluminum blanket off my face and cried What is it What is it Pardonoviski Your Majesty said M Stepupski it is the cat Whether it is a trained cat carrying a deadly bombshell in the forward turret I don t know but we will investigationiski at once My minister coaxed the cat away and five minutes later a loud explosion confirmed M

a lot of new furniture Take my advice Tolstoi and don t be a royalty I say this as one friend to another and not because I have to wear copper fastened pajamas I don t mind the copper fastened pajamas

reported that he had discovered something suspicious in the dish of peeled prunes We examined the prunes carefully and found them stuffed with free tickets to ride on the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad We burned the tickets hastily and saved our lives again M Cornmealski reports that up to date two hundred nineteen different breakfast foods have been received at the palace kitchen He says they range all the way from consolidated shavings to perforated sawdust with here and there some compressed knot holes In a mad moment yesterday I took the Yale lock off my appetite and ordered up one of those breakfast food samples but just as I had the spoonful at my lips I remembered the prayer of my youth Woodman spare that tree and once more my life was saved Ten minutes ago M Blackandblueski the Minister of the Department of Witch Hazel rushed into my bulkhead compartment Oxcooski Your Majesty said the Minister but this morning the cookski was burning a few links of sausage for breakfast Well Your Majesty about two minutes afterwards the cookski and the stove and one side of the palace left in a hurry and went away in a northwesterly direction We don t expect them back because the sausage was stuffed with rapid transit material Your Majesty Thus it goes all day Don t you think it is pretty hard lines when I have to make them wash the water on both sides before putting it in the teapot

none	none	A disease which breaks out in society every winter and can be cured only by inward applications of a seat in a box and outward applications of diamonds on the chest Bjingle Bjangle the celebrated Norwegian raconteur thus describes in his book of travels a visit to the grand opera in New York as follows I went to the opera last night and enjoyed it unspeakably I noticed that most of the ladies in the boxes enjoyed it also but not unspeakably The ladies Heaven bless them seemed to be suffering from that operatic disease which is called nervous conversation This is a disease which attacks the vocal chords just as soon as the curtain rises and causes the voice to fall out I also enjoyed the names of the singers Some of the names on the programme looked like a round robin sent out by a Turnverein bowling club but I suppose if they were baked in the oven until translated they would mean something soft and soothing like a custard pudding Why is it that foreign singers and singerettes always have a name which listens like a cuckoo clock with a sore throat Perhaps if we knew how to unlock them these names would mean just plain Schmidt or Jones There was one singer on the programme that had the most extravagant name I ever witnessed If you read it off quick it sounded like the finish of the six day bicycle race at the Madison Square Garden Then if you looked at it sideways it seemed to be the report of a skirmish between the Russians and the Japs I think that fellow just waded into the alphabet with a dip net and all the letters he caught he kept I liked the plot of the Opera Illustration She was a blonde lady with one of those embonpoint faces which must cost a good deal to keep in repair The hero was a young gentleman with a sweet expression and a forehead which had moved into his hair when it was very young I don t know which was the villain but I have my suspicions that it was the usher who gave me a seat I was interpolated in between a fat man who spoke with an

none	none	To prove how careless we are I will cite the fact that Manhattan Island is called after a cocktail This nervousness is our undoing because we are always in such a hurry to get somewhere that we would rather take the first car and get squeezed into breathlessness than wait for the next which would likely squeeze us into insensibility Breathlessness can be cured but insensibility is dangerous without an alarm clock For a man with a small dining room the sardine car has its advantages but when a stout man rides in them he finds himself supporting a lot of strangers he never met before One morning I jumped on one of those sardine cars feeling just like a two year old full of health and happiness During the first seven blocks three men fresh from a distillery grew up in front of me and removed the scenery One of them had to get out in a hurry so he kicked me on the shins to show how sorry he was to leave me One of the other two must have been in the distillery a long time because pretty soon he neglected to use his memory and sat down in my lap When I remonstrated with him he replied that this is a free country and if he wished to sit down I had no business to stop him Then his friend pulled us apart and I resumed the use of my lap During the next twenty blocks I had one of the worst daylight nightmares I ever rode behind The party which had been studying the exhibits in the distillery got the idea in his head that my foot was the loud pedal on a piano and he started to play the overture from William Tell until I yelled W at ell That man was such a hard drinker that he gave me the gout just from standing on my feet Then I jumped off and swore off and swore at and walked home If the man who invented the idea of standing up between the seats in a

would have a fit like the crime Illustration T Blue sky of a Greenish Hue The man with plenty of money has friends to burn and when he goes broke he finds he has burned most of them The sky always

Adopted By All Automobile Societies The automobile is the rich man s liquor and the poor man s chaser It keeps our streets full of red white and blue streaks all the livelong day and if the weary pedestrian is not supplied with a ball bearing neck his chance of getting home is null and void Probably the safest part about the machinery of an automobile is the Chauffeur because he knows which way to jump out Chauffeur is the name of the man who points the machine at you and dares you to get out of the way We have no word in the English language brave enough to ride on a horseless wagon when it goes real fast That is why we had to reach over to Paris and pull a word out of the French Chauffeur was the first word we grabbed and I think we should give it back at the first opportunity The first Careless Cart we had in this country was called the Coroner s Delight because it lived up to its name Consequently it became necessary that a set of road rules should be composed which would help the general public to die easier when automobo annihilated Here are the rules one One sharp toot from the horn on a Happy Hansom means that business men messenger boys and other persons in a hurry must postpone indefinitely their contemplated journey across the street Crossing the street in front of a chauffeur who has given the above signal is very bad form and is generally productive of spinal meningitis and doctor s bills two Two sharp toots from the horn on a Vaseline Brougham is a signal to the truck drivers ahead that they must dismount at once bow politely and say Gesundheit to the chauffeur as he passes Truck drivers who refuse to obey this signal should be run into and injured severely three Three sharp toots from the horn on a Benzine Buggy is a signal to the policeman on the corner who must immediately come to parade rest doff his helmet and comment enthusiastically on the grace and general elegance of the chauffeur until the latter has disappeared in the distance Policemen who fail to follow this rule should be arrested tried convicted and sent to Siberia four Four sharp toots from the horn on a Gasolene Barouche is a signal for the Fire Department to assemble immediately and remove all trees statues and things of that sort so that the chauffeur may take a short cut through any of the parks Failure on the part of the firemen to obey this rule will justify the chauffeur in delaying an engine on its way to a fire by stopping in front of it long enough to get run over five Five sharp toots from the horn of a Whiz Wagon is a signal to all drivers of brewery wagons ice wagons and mowing machines in the vicinage that they must descend at once from their various pedestals and lead their juggernautian caravans into the dry goods stores out of harm s way If there are no dry good stores handy a candy shop will do No driver of a brewery wagon ice wagon or mowing machine will be excused for breaking this rule simply because he doesn t know the meaning of vicinage six Six sharp toots from the horn of a Gas Carryall is a signal to conductors and motormen that they must without any unnecessary delay lift their cars from the rails and place them on the sidewalk If the passengers in the cars so signalled offer any objections the policemen on that beat will take the offenders to the nearest automobile garage and compel them to drink gasoline seven One long and one short toot means that everybody in the neighborhood not in a Bubble must start promptly for the woods Failure to observe this rule will justify any chauffeur in chasing the offender seventy six consecutive miles in a southwesterly direction eight Long and continued applause from the horn on any Rowdy Runabout means that the chauffeur has lost the combination on his brain cells and is suffering severely from stage fright superinduced by the sudden appearance of a coal cart directly in his pathway In a predicament of this kind strict guiding rules cannot be laid down but no blame can attach to the automobilist if he climbs over the tailboard of the vehicle and adds a new series of phrenological bumps to the suburban part of the head of the offending coal cart director nine If the foregoing rules are carefully observed there is no occasion for further instructions and automobubbling will become a thing of pleasure and a joy forever LITTLE BLASTS OF HOT AIR Life is a tragedy and that s the best reason why it should be well acted What a lot of motive power is wasted by those who jolly other people along A fault finder is a home made knocker Every woman jumps quickly from mice and at conclusions Don t be a clam must be wisdom on the half shell The man who means everything he says is generally a stingy talker Hot air is mighty and will prevail in politics A fool and his money is the root of much laughter INSOMNIA How to Effect a Permanent and Lasting Cure one Lie perfectly still and count two hundred eighty seven thousand six hundred forty three in a slow methodical manner By the time you have finished counting it will be daylight and you will be surprised to notice how quickly the night has passed two Always partake of a bountiful repast before retiring giving special attention to a lobster salad welsh rarebit and hard boiled eggs This will no doubt give you delirium tremens night mare saint Vitus dance and indigestion but the pleasing thought will remain that you have kept the rest of the household awake as well as yourself three Always undress in the dark When you have broken three chairs upset the centre table and stepped on six assorted tacks you will realize what a stupid habit sleeping is anyway and your senses will have become so acute that you will want to sit up and read the Family Story Paper during that portion of the night which has not been devoted to swearing four Always lie with your head lower than any other point of your body and throw the pillows away The monotony of a sleepless night will then be relieved by the novelty of having apoplexy or heart failure either of which diseases is much more exciting and dangerous than insomnia five Always concentrate your thoughts and endeavor to breathe pronouncedly and with exaggeration like a freight engine climbing a grade This is calculated to frighten the rest of the family into convulsions and stampede all the cattle in the neighborhood but you will be enabled to while the remaining hours of the night away by listening to the terse remarks hurled at you from time to time by the other members of the household six Always sponge your face with boiling water several times before retiring If you keep this up long enough it will be breakfast time and you may then go about your daily labor with the happy consciousness that you have saved the bed clothes a great deal of wear and tear seven Always take a brisk long walk before retiring taking particular care to come home late and allow the watch dog to mistake you for a tramp and chase you hurriedly into the next country side It is also calculated to withdraw the blood from the brain and put wings on your feet A brisk run of sixteen miles across country as the crow flies with an angry bulldog pushing you pretty hard for first place is a pleasant diversion in a sleepless night eight Be phlegmatic and indifferent in a marked degree If you hear thieves in the chicken coop during the night don t move a muscle if you smell smoke and know the house is on fire lie perfectly still and count imaginary sheep jumping over an imaginary fence if you feel the folding bed closing up let it close and go on with your counting if you know that burglars are in the room pay no attention to them and let them burgle you have business of your own to attend to A man with a thoroughly developed case of insomnia has no time for such trifling details WISDOM IS AS WISDOM DOES All is not cold that shivers Success never shakes hands with a lazy man An American husband in the hand is worth two foreign Dukes in the divorce court The most successful politician is the one who knows how to finance his brains Before marriage a woman is an angel after marriage she is still an angel but her husband is now from Missouri and she has to show him If it were impossible to speak anything but truth in this world how many times a day would we be insulted WHIST Being a Few Hints How to Play the Game Whist is a well known game with cards It requires close attention and silence Some people learn to play whist in fifteen minutes but their partners generally wear a worried look There are other people who never learn to play the game but unfortunately for humanity they never fully realize this fact Their partners soon discover it however but politeness forbids them making the discovery known to the wide wide world The following series of Don ts may help you to understand some of the intricacies of the delightful game of whist If they do not help you the only thing to do is to try pinochle Don t get up and dance a serpentine dance every time you take a trick It is in very bad taste unless you are a good dancer and even then your opponents may feel deeply chagrined Don t smile sweetly your partner and inform him in a few well chosen words that you have seven trumps in your hand Your opponents may hear you and scowl darkly at you Don t fail to call the attention of your opponent to the fact that he or she hasn t followed suit being very careful to select a loud and resonant tone of voice for the occasion This compels your opponent to look carefully through his or her cards and fervently wish that you had sense enough to mind your own business Don t ask what s trumps more than eighteen times during one hand The limit used to be twenty six times but the best authorities on whist now say eighteen Don t have a conniption fit every time you lose a trick Conniption fits are very bad form and they delay the game Don t get excited and climb up on the table when the game is close It shows a want of refinement and breeding to climb up on the table especially if you are in a strange house Don t whistle softly while waiting for somebody to play Whistling is not in good taste Go and perform on the piano It has a much better effect particularly if your selection is something lively like El Capitan or The Maiden s Prayer Don t talk politics while playing whist Either whist or politics will suffer if you do Statisticians claim that thirty four million six hundred forty seven thousand nine hundred thirty two times out of thirty four million six hundred forty seven thousand nine hundred thirty three it is whist that suffers Don t when drawing a trick towards you pause in the act to smile disdainfully upon your opponents They may not admire a spectacular arrangement of your features and if they happen to be in a bad humor your facial expression may be ruined for life Don t labor under the erroneous impression that your opponents have no right to trump your ace if they can Neither is it considered elegant or refined to hit them carelessly across the forehead with the bric a brac for so doing Don t make an earnest endeavor to split the table asunder when playing a winning card People may think you are eccentric if you try to make kindling wood of the table every time you lay down an honor Don t lead the three of clubs in mistake for the ace of trumps and then get mad and jump seventeen feet in the air because you are not permitted to pull it back It isn t good form to jump seventeen feet in the air Besides you might fall and hurt yourself and the neighborhood Don t hesitate to inquire what was led when there is but one card on the table It shows that you are taking a deep interest in the game and it makes the other players admire your elocutionary powers Don t fail to dispute the count after every hand has been played It draws attention to the fact that you are anxious to win It also draws uncomplimentary remarks from your opponents and sometimes occasions the use of a club Don t fall off the chair in horrified dismay when your opponent puts your ace to sleep with a little trump Trumps were invented for that purpose and horrified dismay is not becoming to every style of beauty A FEW HARMLESS GERMS How the rest of the world does hate the people who have a good time A Miss is as good as a mile of Misses if you love the girl The horseshoe is always lucky when the horse wins A hard worker will never be arrested for killing time One half the world doesn t know why the other half doesn t get off the earth Be good and you ll be happy but you won t get your name in the papers so often BASEBALL Being a Guide for the Grouchy Grandstandee These do nots have been arranged compiled and hammered together with a view to rendering assistance to the spectator whose thinking machinery climbs out over his collar and who shows symptoms of being dazed and disorderly during the progress of a game Don t have any regard for the feelings of your neighbors Get up on the slightest provocation and yell To make matters more exciting you had better get up on the back of the seat also Don t stop to make a careful selection of the English language before addressing the universe at large when the play is not to your liking Say the first thing that comes into your mind Doubtless it will be glad to get out Don t pay any attention to the fact that ladies are in the immediate neighborhood Your money is just as good as theirs Besides it s a man s privilege to swear and make a howling idiot of himself Don t fail to keep up a running comment on the general inefficiency of the visiting club The majority of those who sit near you came out to the game especially to hear your views on this subject Don t neglect to call him a fat headed renegade every time one of the home players makes an error The home players need to be reproved at times and nothing is quite so reproving as the term fat headed renegade hurled at them by a bibulous gentleman with a subterbeerean voice Don t hesitate to tell all who are listening and if your voice is as convalescent as usual everybody in your section of the Western Hemisphere will have to listen that you know more about the game than Pop Anson and Pop Anson s younger brother Methuselah Under certain circumstances modesty is a crime therefore you should not commit a crime by withholding this information Don t forget the umpire Don t forget him for one little moment He will notice it if you do and become miserably unhappy Tell him what you think of him unceasingly There is nothing so pleasing to an umpire s ears as the sweet strains of a whiskey trimmed voice ringing softly on the evening air Hey red light youse is a robber an a thief Umpires love to be criticised in this manner With every criticism they brace up wonderfully and their straying sense of justice returns You ve noticed this fact of course Don t hesitate to insult a player on the field Remember it is very hard for him to pick you out of the crowd Besides if he does and jumps over the rail for the purpose of putting his imprint on your slats you can scream for help The police will probably wake up and come to your assistance Don t forget to use the most blood curdling and decorative style of language now on the market when you engage in the pleasing duty of hurting a player s feelings This will attract attention to you from all quarters and will stamp you as a gentleman of the aber nit style of architecture Don t pay any attention to the uneasiness displayed by those about you who came out for the selfish purpose of enjoying the game If they cannot enjoy you and your lung power exhibit they should stay at home Keep right on utilizing your vocal chords Chatter on incessantly Be a consistent ass until the last man is out and the umpire crawls into his cyclone cellar Then go home and bathe what s left of your voice in witch hazel and get ready for the morrow BURSTS OF CONFIDENCE A trouble hunter always makes a success of his job The girl who hesitates is left at the hitching post The world has a poor memory for many who believe themselves famous The wise man saves up for a rainy day and always stays in the house when it storms It keeps many a good man down to keep up appearances Some men are like a phonograph they talk when you start them but they have no originality THE POOR MAN S COOK BOOK Presented by the President of the Food Trust This Cook Book was invented by the President of the Food Trust with the hope that the poor man will find therein much to comfort him since meat and other luxuries have gone out of his life because the Trust needs the money The beauty about the dishes mentioned here is their cheapness Let us begin with the soup MOCK CHICKEN SOUP Take a piece of white paper and a lead pencil and draw from memory the outlines of a hen Then carefully remove the feathers Pour one gallon of boiling water into a saucepan and sprinkle a pinch of salt on the hen s tail Now let it simper If the soup has a blonde appearance stir it with a lead pencil which will make it more of a brunette Let it boil two hours Then coax the hen away from the saucepan and serve the soup hot with a glass of ice water on the side BEEF TEA Take the white of an egg and beat it without mercy When it is insensible put it in the teapot and add enough boiling water to drown it Let it drown about twenty minutes Then lead the yolk of the egg over to the teapot and push it in Season with a small pinch of tobasco and let it simper Serve hot and always be sure to put a piece of lemon in the finger bowl MOCK BEEFSTEAK Carefully remove the laces from one shoe and put them away because they can be used for shoe string potatoes just as soon as the Potato Trust gets started Beat the shoe with a hammer for ten minutes until its tongue stops wagging and it gets black and blue in the face Then put it in the frying pan and stir gently When it begins to sizzle add the yolk of an egg and season with parsley Imitation parsley can be made from green wall paper with the scissors If there is no green wall paper in the house speak to the landlord about it Let it simper In two hours try it with a fork If it breaks the fork it is not done Let it simper Should you wish to smother it with onions now is your chance because after cooking so long it is almost helpless Serve hot with a hatchet on the side If there are more than four people in the family use both shoes IRISH STEW Remove the jacket and waistcoat from a potato and put it in a saucepan Add three quarts of boiling water Get a map of Ireland and hang it on the wall directly in front of the saucepan This will furnish the local color for the stew Let it boil two hours When the potato begins to moult it is a sign the stew is getting done Walk easy so as not to frighten it Add a pinch of rhubarb and serve hot with lettuce dressing This is one of the best stews without meat that the Food Trust has ever invented for the poor man MOCK PORK PIE Peel the bark carefully away from the hindquarters of a spruce tree and remove the tenderloin One of last year s Christmas trees is excellent for the purpose Chop it up fine and place in a saucepan Add boiling water and let it simper two hours Season with a pinch of salt and if this is not satisfactory you might also pinch a little pepper Put the bark in the coffee grinder and turn the handle rapidly to the left Add boiling water and serve with milk and sugar This will be a splendid joke on the Coffee Trust The mock pork pie is now done Serve with lionaise dressing and tomato catsup After dinner eat four pepsin tablets and send for the doctor IMITATION APPLE FRITTERS First catch your fritter Be sure that it is a young fritter The way
