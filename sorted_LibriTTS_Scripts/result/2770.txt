none	none	 FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS A HOME VIEW The little old kitchen had quieted down from the bustle and confusion of mid day and now with its afternoon manners on presented a holiday aspect that as the principal room in the brown house it was eminently proper it should have It was just on the edge of the twilight and the little Peppers all except Ben the oldest of the flock were enjoying a breathing spell as their mother called it which meant some quiet work suitable for the hour All the breathing spell they could remember however poor things for times were always hard with them nowadays and since the father died when Phronsie was a baby missus

5400_3587_000094_000001	train-clean-360	 oh dear me 
none	none	I didn t mean to mammy well I wouldn t care how much money it cost we d have as much light as we wanted for once so Mercy said missus Pepper you d have the house afire Two hundred candles who ever heard of such a thing Would they burn asked Phronsie anxiously getting up from the floor where she was crouching with David overseeing Joel nail on the cover of an old box and going to Polly s side she awaited her answer patiently Burn said Polly There that s done now mamsie dear And she put the coat with a last little pat into her mother s lap I guess they would Phronsie pet And Polly caught up the little girl and spun round and round the old kitchen till they were both glad to stop Then said Phronsie as Polly put her down and stood breathless after her last glorious spin I do so wish we might Polly oh just this very one minute And Phronsie clasped her fat little hands in rapture at the thought Well said Polly giving a look up at the old clock in the corner deary me it s half past five and most time for Ben to come home Away she flew to get supper So for the next few moments nothing was heard but the pulling out of the old table into the middle of the floor the laying the cloth and all the other bustle attendant upon the being ready for Ben Polly went skipping around cutting the bread and bringing dishes only stopping long enough to fling some scraps of reassuring nonsense to the two boys who were thoroughly dismayed at being obliged to remove their traps into a corner Phronsie still stood just where Polly left her Two hundred candles oh what could it mean She gazed up to the old beams overhead and around the dingy walls and to the old black stove with the fire nearly out and then over everything the kitchen contained trying to think how it would seem To have it bright and winsome and warm to suit Polly oh she screamed Goodness said Polly taking her head out of the old cupboard in the corner how you scared me Phronsie Would they ever go out asked the child gravely still standing where Polly left her What asked Polly stopping with a dish of cold potatoes in her hand What Phronsie Why the candles said the child the ever an ever so many pretty lights Oh my senses cried Polly with a little laugh haven t you forgotten that Yes no that is Phronsie if we could have em at all we wouldn t ever let em go out Not once asked Phronsie coming up to Polly with a little skip and nearly upsetting her potatoes and all not once Polly truly No not forever an ever said Polly take care Phronsie there goes a potato no we d keep em always No you don t want to said missus Pepper coming out of the bedroom in time to catch the last words they won t be good to morrow better have them to night Polly Ma am said Polly setting down her potato dish on the table and staring at her mother with all her might have what mother Why the potatoes to be sure replied missus Pepper didn t you say you better keep them child Twasn t potatoes at all said Polly with a little gasp twas dear me here s Ben For the door opened and Phronsie with a scream of delight bounded into Ben s arms It s just jolly said Ben coming in his chubby face all aglow and his big blue eyes shining so honest and true it s just jolly to get home supper ready Polly Yes said Polly that is all but and she dashed off for Phronsie s eating apron Sometime said Phronsie with her mouth half full when the meal was nearly over we re going to be awful rich we are Ben truly No said Ben affecting the most hearty astonishment you don t say so Chick Yes said Phronsie shaking her yellow head very wisely at him and diving down into her cup of very weak milk and water to see if Polly had put any sugar in by mistake a proceeding always expectantly observed Yes we are really Bensie very dreadful rich I wish we could be rich

none	none	said Ben taking another generous slice of the brown bread in time for mamsie s birthday and he cast a sorrowful glance at Polly I know said Polly oh dear if we only could celebrate it I don t want any other celebration said missus Pepper beaming on them so that a little flash of sunshine seemed to hop right down on the table than to look round on you all I m rich now and that s a fact Mamsie don t mind her five bothers cried Polly jumping up and running to hug her mother thereby producing a like desire in all the others who immediately left their seats and followed her example Mother s rich enough ejaculated missus Pepper her bright black eyes glistening with delight as the noisy troop filed back to their bread and potatoes if we can only keep together dears and grow up good so that the little brown house won t be ashamed of us that s all I ask Well said Polly in a burst of confidence to Ben after the table had been pushed back against the wall the dishes nicely washed wiped and set up neatly in the cupboard and all traces of the meal cleared away I don t care let s try and get a celebration somehow for mamsie How are you going to do it asked Ben who was of a decidedly practical turn of mind and thus couldn t always follow Polly in her flights of imagination
5400_3587_000140_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know said Polly 
none	none	but we must some way Phoh that s no good said Ben disdainfully then seeing Polly s face he added kindly let s think though and perhaps there ll be some way Oh I know cried Polly in delight I know the very thing Ben let s make her a cake a big one you know and She ll see you bake it said Ben or else she ll smell it and that d be just as bad No she won t either replied Polly Don t you know she s going to help missus Henderson to morrow so there So she is said Ben good for you Polly you always think of everything And then said Polly with a comfortable little feeling at her heart at Ben s praise why we can have it all out of the way splendidly you know when she comes home and besides Grandma Bascom ll tell me how You know we ve only got brown flour Ben I mean to go right over and ask her now Oh no you mustn t cried Ben catching hold of her arm as she was preparing to fly off Mammy ll find it out better wait till to morrow and besides Polly And Ben stopped unwilling to dampen this propitious beginning The stove ll act like everything to morrow I know twill then what ll you do It sha n t said Polly running up to look it in the face if it does I ll shake it the mean old thing The idea of Polly s shaking the lumbering old black affair sent Ben into such a peal of laughter that it brought all the other children running to the spot and nothing would do but they must one and all be told the reason So Polly and Ben took them into confidence which so elated them that half an hour after when long past her bedtime Phronsie declared I m not going to bed I want to sit up like Polly Don t tease her whispered Polly to Ben who thought she ought to go so she sat straight up on her little stool winking like everything to keep awake At last as Polly was in the midst of one of her liveliest sallies over tumbled Phronsie a sleepy little heap upon the floor I want to go to bed she said 
5400_3587_000026_000002	train-clean-360	take me Polly 
none	none	I thought so laughed Polly and bundled her off into the bedroom MAKING HAPPINESS FOR MAMSIE And so the minute her mother had departed for the minister s house next morning and Ben had gone to his day s work chopping wood for Deacon Blodgett Polly assembled her force around the old stove and proceeded to business She and the children had been up betimes that morning to get through with the work and now as they glanced around with a look of pride on the neatly swept floor the dishes all done and everything in order the moment their mother s back was turned they began to implore Polly to hurry and begin It s most leven o clock said Joel who having no work to do outside that day was prancing around wild to help along the festivities it s most leven o clock Polly Pepper you won t have it done Oh no tisn t either Joe said Polly with a very flushed face and her arms full of kindlings glancing up at the old clock as she spoke tisn t but quarter of nine there take care Phronsie you can t lift off the cover do help her Davie No let me cried Joel springing forward it s my turn Dave got the shingles it s my turn Polly So tis said Polly I forgot there as she flung in the wood and poked it all up in a nice little heap coaxingly It can t help but burn what a cake we ll have for mamsie It ll be so big cried Phronsie hopping around on one set of toes that mamsie won t know what to do will she Polly No I don t believe she will said Polly gayly stuffing in more wood Oh dear there goes Ben s putty it s all come out So it has said Joel going around back of the stove to explore and then he added cheerfully it s bigger n ever oh it s an awful big hole Polly Now whatever shall we do said Polly in great distress that hateful old crack and Ben s clear off to Deacon Blodgett s I ll run and get him cried Joel briskly I ll bring him right home in ten minutes Oh no you must not Joe cried Polly in alarm it wouldn t ever be right to take him off from his work mamsie wouldn t like it What will you do then asked Joel pausing on his way to the door I m sure I don t know said Polly getting down on her knees to examine the crack I shall have to stuff it with paper I s pose Twon t stay in said Joel scornfully don t you know you stuffed it before last week I know said Polly with a small sigh and sitting down on the floor she remained quite still for a minute with her two black hands thrust out straight before her Can t you fix it asked Davie soberly coming up then we can t have the cake Dear me exclaimed Polly springing up quickly don t be afraid we re going to have that cake There you ugly old thing you this to the stove see what you ve done as two big tears flew out of Phronsie s brown eyes at the direful prospect and the sorrowful faces of the two boys looked up into Polly s own for comfort I can fix it I most know do get some paper Joe as quick as you can Don t know where there is any said Joel rummaging around it s all tore up xcept the almanac can t I take that Oh dear no cried Polly put it right back Joe I guess there s some in the wood shed There isn t either said little Davie quickly Joel and I took it to make kites with Oh dear groaned Polly I don t know what we shall do unless as a bright thought struck her you let me have the kites boys Can t said Joel they re all flew away and torn up Well now children said Polly turning round impressively upon them the effect of which was heightened by the extremely crocky appearance she had gained in her explorations we must have some paper or something to stop up that old hole with some way there I know said little Davie where we ll get it it s upstairs and without another word he flew out of the room and in another minute he put into Polly s hand an old leather boot top one of his most treasured possessions You can chip it he said real fine and then twill go in So we can said Polly and you re a real good boy Davie to give it that s a splendid present to help celebrate for mamsie I d a given a boot top said Joel looking grimly at the precious bit of leather which Polly was rapidly stripping into little bits if I d a hed it I don t have anything I know you would Joey said Polly kindly there now you ll stay I guess as with the united efforts of the two boys cheered on by Phronsie s enthusiastic little crow of delight the leather was crowded into place and the fire began to burn Now boys said Polly getting up and drawing a long breath I m going over to Grandma Bascom s to get her to tell me how to make the cake and you must stay and keep house I m going to nail said Joel I ve got lots to do All right said Polly tying on her hood Phronsie ll love to watch you I won t be gone long and she was off Grandma Bascom wasn t really the children s grandmother only everybody in the village called her so by courtesy Her cottage was over across the lane and just a bit around the corner and Polly flew along and up to the door fully knowing that now she would be helped out of her difficulty She didn t stop to knock as the old lady was so deaf she knew she wouldn t hear her but opened the door and walked in Grandma was sweeping up the floor already as neat as a pin when she saw Polly coming she stopped and leaned on her broom How s your ma she asked when Polly had said good morning and then hesitated Oh mammy s pretty well shouted Polly into the old lady s ear and to morrow s her birthday To morrow ll be a bad day said grandma Oh don t never say that You mustn t borrow trouble child I didn t said Polly I mean it s her birthday grandma this last so loud that grandma s cap border vibrated perceptibly The land s sakes tis cried missus Bascom delightedly you don t say so Yes said Polly skipping around the old lady and giving her a small hug and we re going to give her a surprise What is the matter with her eyes asked grandma sharply turning around and facing her she s been a sewin too stiddy hain t she A surprise shouted Polly standing upon tiptoe to bring her mouth on a level with the old lady s ear a cake grandma a big one A cake exclaimed grandma dropping the broom to settle her cap which Polly in her extreme endeavors to carry on the conversation had knocked slightly awry well that ll be fine Yes said Polly picking up the broom and flinging off her hood at the same time and oh won t you please tell me how to make it grandma To be sure to be sure cried the old lady delighted beyond measure to give advice I ve got splendid receets I ll go get em right off and she ambled to the door of the pantry And I ll finish sweeping up said Polly which grandma didn t hear so she took up the broom and sent it energetically and merrily flying away to the tune of her own happy thoughts Yes they re right in here said grandma waddling back with an old tin teapot in her hand goodness child what a dust you ve kicked up that ain t the way to sweep And she took the broom out of Polly s hand who stood quite still in mortification There she said drawing it mildly over the few bits she could scrape together and gently coaxing them into a little heap that s the way and then they don t go all over the room I m sorry began poor Polly Tain t any matter said missus Bascom kindly catching sight of Polly s discomfited face tain t a mite of matter you ll sweep better next time now let s go to the cake and putting the broom into the corner she waddled back again to the table followed by Polly and proceeded to turn out the contents of the teapot in search of just the right receet But the right one didn t seem to appear not even after the teapot was turned upside down and shaken by both grandma s and Polly s anxious hands Every other receet seemed to tumble out gladly and stare them in the face little dingy rolls of yellow paper with an ancient odor of spice still clinging to them but all efforts to find this particular one failed utterly Won t some other one do asked Polly in the interval of fruitless searching when grandma bewailed and lamented and wondered where I could a put it No no child answered the old lady now where do you s pose tis and she clapped both hands to her head to see if she could possibly remember no no child she repeated Why they had it down to my niece Mirandy s weddin twas just elegant light as a feather and twan t rich either she added no eggs nor Oh I couldn t have eggs cried Polly in amazement at the thought of such luxury and we ve only brown flour grandma you know Well you can make it of brown said missus Bascom kindly when the raisins is in twill look quite nice Oh we haven t any raisins answered Polly Haven t any raisins echoed grandma looking at her over her spectacles what are you goin to put in Oh cinnamon said Polly briskly we ve got plenty of that and it ll be good I guess grandma she finished anxiously anyway we must have a cake there isn t any other way to celebrate mamsie s birthday Well now said grandma bustling around I shouldn t be surprised if you had real good luck Polly And your ma ll set ever so much by it now if we only could find that receet and returning to the charge she commenced to fumble among her bits of paper again I never shall forget how they eat on it why there wasn t a crumb left Polly Oh dear said Polly to whom Mirandy s wedding cake now became the height of her desires if you only can find it can t I climb up and look on the pantry shelves Maybe tis there said missus Bascom slowly you might try sometimes I do put things away so s to have em safe So Polly got an old wooden chair according to direction and then mounted up on it with grandma below to direct she handed down bowl after bowl interspersed at the right intervals with cracked teacups and handleless pitchers But at the end of these explorations Mirandy s wedding cake was further off than ever Tain t a mite o use at last said the old lady sinking down in despair while Polly perched on the top of the chair and looked at her I must a give it away Can t I have the next best one then asked Polly despairingly feeling sure that Mirandy s wedding cake would have celebrated the day just right and I must hurry right home please she added getting down from the chair and tying on her hood or Phronsie won t know what to do So another receet was looked over and selected and with many charges and bits of advice not to let the oven get too hot et cetera et cetera Polly took the precious bit in her hand and flew over home Now we ve got to she began bounding in merrily with dancing eyes but her delight had a sudden stop as she brought up so suddenly at the sight within that she couldn t utter another word Phronsie was crouching a miserable little heap of woe in one corner of the mother s big calico covered rocking chair and crying bitterly while Joel hung over her in the utmost concern What s the matter gasped Polly Flinging the receet on the table she rushed up to the old chair and was down on her knees before it her arms around the little figure Phronsie turned and threw herself into Polly s protecting arms who gathered her up and sitting down in the depths of the chair comforted her as only she could What is it she asked of Joel who was nervously begging Phronsie not to cry now tell me all that s happened I was a nailing began Joel oh dear don t cry Phronsie do stop her Polly Go on said Polly hoarsely I was a nailing began Joel slowly and and Davie s gone to get the peppermint he added brightening up Tell me Joe said Polly all that s been going on and she looked sternly into his face or I ll get Davie to as little Davie came running back with a bottle of castor oil which in his flurry he had mistaken for peppermint This he presented with a flourish to Polly who was too excited to see it Oh no cried Joel in intense alarm Davie isn t going to I ll tell Polly I will truly Go on then said Polly tell at once feeling as if somebody didn t tell pretty quick she should tumble over Well said Joel gathering himself up with a fresh effort the old hammer was a shaking and Phronsie stuck her foot in the way and I couldn t help it Polly no I just couldn t Polly Quick as a flash Polly tore off the little old shoe and well worn stocking and brought to light Phronsie s fat little foot Tenderly taking hold of the white toes the boys clustering around in the greatest anxiety she worked them back and forth and up and down Nothing s broken she said at last and drew a long breath It s there said Phronsie through a rain of tears and it hurts Polly and she began to wiggle the big toe where around the nail was settling a small black spot Poor little toe began Polly cuddling up the suffering foot Just then a small and peculiar noise struck her ear and looking up she saw Joel with a very distorted face making violent efforts to keep from bursting out into a loud cry All his attempts however failed and he flung himself into Polly s lap in a perfect torrent of tears I didn t mean to Polly he cried twas the ugly old hammer oh dear There there Joey dear said Polly gathering him up in the other corner of the old chair close to her side don t feel bad I know you didn t mean to and she dropped a kiss on his stubby black hair When Phronsie saw that anybody else could cry she stopped immediately and leaning over Polly put one little fat hand on Joel s neck Don t cry she said does your toe ache At this Joel screamed louder than ever and Polly was at her wit s end to know what to do for the boy s heart was almost broken That he should have hurt Phronsie the baby the pet of the whole house upon whom all their hearts centered it was too much So for the next few moments Polly had all she could do by way of comforting and consoling him Just as she had succeeded the door opened and Grandma Bascom walked in Settin down said she I hope your cake ain t in Polly looking anxiously at the stove for I ve found it and she waved a small piece of paper triumphantly towards the rocking chair as she spoke Do tell her said Polly to little David what s happened for I can t get up So little Davie went up to the old lady and standing on tiptoe screamed into her ear all the particulars he could think of concerning the accident that had just happened Hey said grandma in a perfect bewilderment what s he a sayin Polly I can t make it out You ll have to go all over it again David said Polly despairingly she didn t hear one word I don t believe So David tried again this time with better success And then he got down from his tiptoes and escorted grandma to Phronsie in flushed triumph Land alive said the old lady sitting down in the chair which he brought her you got pounded did you looking at Phronsie as she took the little foot in her ample hand Yes m said Polly quickly twasn t any one s fault what ll we do for it grandma Wormwood said the old lady adjusting her spectacles in extreme deliberation and then examining the little black and blue spot which was spreading rapidly is the very best thing and I ve got some to home you run right over she said turning round on David quickly an get it it s a hang in by the chimbley Let me let me cried Joel springing out of the old chair so suddenly that grandma s spectacles nearly dropped off in fright oh I want to do it for Phronsie Yes let Joel please put in Polly he ll find it grandma So Joel departed with great speed and presently returned with a bunch of dry herbs which dangled comfortingly by his side as he came in Now I ll fix it said missus Bascom getting up and taking off her shawl there s a few raisins for you Polly I don t want em and they ll make your cake go better and she placed a little parcel on the table as she spoke Yes I ll put it to steep an after it s put on real strong and tied up in an old cloth Phronsie won t know as she s got any toes and grandma broke up a generous supply of the herb and put it into an old tin cup which she covered up with a saucer and placed on the stove Oh said Polly I can t thank you for the raisins and all you re so good They re awful hard said Joel investigating into the bundle with Davie which however luckily the old lady didn t hear There don t try she said cheerily an I found cousin Mirandy s weddin cake receet for Did you cried Polly oh I m so glad feeling as if that were comfort enough for a good deal Yes twas in my Bible said missus Bascom I remember now I put it there to be ready to give John s folks when they come in they wanted it so you ll go all straight now and I must get home for I left some meat a boilin So grandma put on her shawl and waddled off leaving a great deal of comfort behind her Now says I said Polly to Phronsie when the little foot was snugly tied up in the wet wormwood you ve got to have one of mamsie s old slippers Oh ho laughed Phronsie won t that be funny Polly I should think it would laughed Polly back again pulling on the big cloth slipper which Joel produced from the bedroom the two boys joining uproariously as the old black thing flapped dismally up and down and showed strong symptoms of flying off We shall have to tie it on It looks like a pudding bag said Joel as Polly tied it securely through the middle with a bit of twine an old black pudding bag he finished Old black pudding bag echoed Phronsie with a merry little crow and then all of a sudden she grew very sober and looked intently at the foot thrust out straight before her as she still sat in the chair What is it Phronsie asked Polly who was bustling around making preparations for the cake making Can I ever wear my new shoes again asked the child gravely looking dismally at the black bundle before her Oh yes my goodness yes cried Polly as quick again as ever you ll be around again as smart as a cricket in a week see if you aren t Will it go on asked Phronsie still looking incredulously at the bundle and button up Yes indeed cried Polly again button into every one of the little holes Phronsie Pepper just as elegant as ever Oh said Phronsie and then she gave a sigh of relief and thought no more of it because Polly had said that all would be right MAMSIE S BIRTHDAY Run down and get the cinnamon will you Joey said Polly it s in the Provision Room The Provision Room was a little shed that was tacked on to the main house and reached by a short flight of rickety steps so called because as Polly said twas a good place to keep provisions in even if we haven t any and besides she always finished it sounds nice Come on Dave then we ll get something to eat So the cinnamon was handed up and then Joel flew back to Davie And now Polly s cake was done and ready for the oven With many admiring glances from herself and Phronsie who with Seraphina an extremely old but greatly revered doll tightly hugged in her arms was watching everything with the biggest of eyes from the depths of the old chair it was placed in the oven the door shut to with a happy little bang then Polly gathered Phronsie up in her arms and sat down in the chair to have a good time with her and to watch the process of cooking There was a bumping noise that came from the Provision Room that sounded ominous and then a smothered sound of words followed by a scuffling over the old floor Boys called Polly No answer everything was just as still as a mouse Joel and David called Polly again in her loudest tones Yes came up the crooked stairs in Davie s voice Come up here right away went back again from Polly So up the stairs trudged the two boys and presented themselves rather sheepishly before the big chair What was that noise she asked what have you been doing Twasn t anything but the pail answered Joel not looking at her We had something to eat said Davie by way of explanation you always let us I know said Polly that s right you can have as much bread as you want to but what you been doing with the pail Nothing said Joel twouldn t hangup that s all And you ve been bumping it said Polly oh Joel how could you You might have broken it then what would mamsie say I didn t said Joel stoutly with his hands in his pockets bump it worse n Davie so there Why Davie said Polly turning to him sorrowfully I shouldn t have thought you would Well I m tired of hanging it up said little Davie vehemently and I said I wasn t a goin to Joel always makes me I ve done it for two million times I guess Oh dear said Polly sinking back into the chair I don t know what I ever shall do here s Phronsie hurt and we want to celebrate to morrow and you two boys are bumping and banging out the bread pail and Oh we won t cried both of the children perfectly overwhelmed with remorse we ll hang it right up I ll hang it said Davie clattering off down the stairs with a will No I will shouted Joel going after him at double pace and presently both came up with shining faces and reported it nicely done And now said Polly after they had all sat around the stove another half hour watching and sniffing expectantly the cake s done dear me it s turning black And quickly as possible Polly twitched it out with energy and set it on the table Oh dear of all things in the world The beautiful cake over which so many hopes had been formed that was to have given so much happiness on the morrow to the dear mother presented a forlorn appearance as it stood there in anything but holiday attire It was quite black on the top in the center of which was a depressing little dump as if to say My feelings wouldn t allow me to rise to the occasion Now said Polly turning away with a little fling and looking at the stove I hope you re satisfied you old thing you ve spoiled our mamsie s birthday and without a bit of warning she sat right down in the middle of the floor and began to cry as hard as she could Well I never said a cheery voice that made the children skip It s missus Beebe oh it s missus Beebe cried Davie see Polly Polly scrambled up to her feet ashamed to be caught thus and whisked away the tears the others explaining to their new visitor the sad disappointment that had befallen them and she was soon oh ing and ah ing enough to suit even their distressed little souls You poor creeters you she exclaimed at last for about the fiftieth time Here Polly here s some posies for you and Oh thank you cried Polly with a radiant face why missus Beebe we can put them in here can t we the very thing And she set the little knot of flowers in the hollow of the cake and there they stood and nodded away to the delighted children like brave little comforters as they were The very thing echoed missus Beebe tickled to death to see their delight it looks beautiful I declare and now I must run right along or pa ll be worrying and so the good woman trotted out to her waiting husband who was impatient to be off mister Beebe kept a little shoe shop in town and always being of the impression if he left it for ten minutes that crowds of customers would visit it He was the most restless of companions on any pleasure excursion And Phronsie s got hurt said missus Beebe telling him the news as he finished tucking her up and started the old horse Ho you don t say so he cried whoa Dear me said missus Beebe how you scat me pal what s the matter What the little girl that bought the shoes asked her husband Yes replied his wife she s hurt her foot Sho now said the old gentleman that s too bad and he began to feel in all his pockets industriously there can you get out again and take her that and he laid a small piece of peppermint candy thick and white in his wife s lap Oh yes cried missus Beebe good naturedly beginning to clamber over the wheel So the candy was handed in to Phronsie who insisted that Polly should hold her up to the window to thank mister Beebe So amid nods and shakings of hands the Beebes drove off and quiet settled down over the little brown house again Now children said Polly after Phronsie had made them take a bite of her candy all around let s get the cake put away safe for mamsie may come home early Where ll you put it asked Joel wishing the world was all peppermint candy Oh in the cupboard said Polly taking it up there Joe you can climb up and put it clear back in the corner oh wait I must take the posies off and keep them fresh in water so the cake was finally deposited in a place of safety followed by the eyes of all the children Now said Polly as they shut the door tight don t you go to looking at the cupboard Joey or mammy ll guess something Can t I just open it a little crack and take one smell when she isn t looking asked Joel I should think you might Polly just one No said Polly firmly not one Joe she ll guess if you do But missus Pepper was so utterly engrossed with her baby when she came home and heard the account of the accident that she wouldn t have guessed if there d been a dozen cakes in the cupboard Joel was consoled as his mother assured him in a satisfactory way that she never should think of blaming him and Phronsie was comforted and coddled to her heart s content And so the evening passed rapidly and happily away Ben smuggling Phronsie off into a corner where she told him all the doings of the day the disappointment of the cake and how it was finally crowned with flowers all of which Phronsie with no small pride in being the narrator related gravely to her absorbed listener And don t you think Bensie she said clasping her little hand in a convincing way over his two bigger stronger ones that Polly s stove was very naughty to make poor Polly cry Yes I do said Ben and he shut his lips tightly together To have Polly cry hurt him more than he cared to have Phronsie see What are you staring at Joe asked Polly a few minutes later as her eyes fell upon Joel who sat with his back to the cupboard persistently gazing at the opposite wall Why you told me yourself not to look at the cupboard said Joel in the loudest of stage whispers Dear me that ll make mammy suspect worse n anything else if you look like that said Polly What did you say about the cupboard asked missus Pepper who caught Joe s last word We can t tell said Phronsie shaking her head at her mother cause there s a ca Ugh and Polly clapped her hand on the child s mouth don t you want Ben to tell us a story Oh yes cried little Phronsie in which all the others joined with a whoop of delight so a most wonderful story drawn up in Ben s best style followed till bedtime The first thing Polly did in the morning was to run to the old cupboard followed by all the others to see if the cake was safe and then it had to be drawn out and dressed anew with the flowers for they had decided to have it on the breakfast table It looks better whispered Polly to Ben than it did yesterday and aren t the flowers pretty It looks good enough to eat anyway said Ben smacking his lips Well we tried said Polly stilling a sigh now boys call mamsie everything s ready Oh how surprised their mother appeared when she was ushered out to the feast and the full glory of the table burst upon her Her delight in the cake was fully enough to satisfy the most exacting mind She admired and admired it on every side protesting that she shouldn t have supposed Polly could possibly have baked it as good in the old stove and then she cut it and gave a piece to every child with a little posy on top Wasn t it good though for like many other things the cake proved better on trial than it looked and so turned out to be really quite a good surprise all around Why can t I ever have a birthday asked Joel finishing the last crumb of his piece I should think I might he added reflectively Why you have Joe said Ben eight of em What a story ejaculated Joel when did I have em I never had a cake did I Polly Not a cake birthday Joel said his mother you haven t got to that yet When s it coming asked Joel who was decidedly of a matter of fact turn of mind I don t know said missus Pepper laughing but there s plenty of time ahead TROUBLE FOR THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE Oh I do wish said Joel a few mornings after pushing back his chair and looking discontentedly at his bowl of mush and molasses that we could ever have something new besides this everlasting old breakfast Why can t we mammy Better be glad you ve got that Joe said missus Pepper taking another cold potato and sprinkling on a little salt folks shouldn t complain so long as they ve anything to eat But I m so tired of it same old thing growled Joel seems as if I sh d turn into a meal bag or a molasses jug Well hand it over then proposed Ben who was unusually hungry and had a hard day s work before him No said Joel alarmed at the prospect and putting in an enormous mouthful it s better than nothing Oh dear said little Phronsie catching Joel s tone it isn t nice no it isn t And she put down her spoon so suddenly that the molasses spun off in a big drop that trailed off the corner of the table and made Polly jump up and run for the floor cloth Oh Phronsie she said reprovingly you ought not to Never mind pet as she caught sight of two big tears trying to make a path in the little molasses streaked face Polly ll wipe it up Sha n t we ever have anything else to eat Polly asked the child gravely getting down from her high chair to watch the operation of cleaning the floor Oh yes said Polly cheerfully lots and lots when our ship comes in What ll they be asked Phronsie in the greatest delight prepared for anything Oh I don t know said Polly ice cream for one thing Phronsie and maybe little cakes With pink on top interrupted Phronsie getting down by Polly s side Oh yes said Polly warming with her subject ever and ever so much pink Phronsie Pepper more than you could eat Phronsie just clasped her hands and sighed More than she could eat was beyond her Hoh said Joel who caught the imaginary bill of fare that s nothing Polly I d speak for a plum puddin Like the one mother made us for Thanksgiving asked Polly getting up and waiting a minute cloth in hand for the answer Yes sir said Joel shutting one eye and looking up at the ceiling musingly while he smacked his lips in remembrance wasn t that prime though Yes said Polly thoughtfully would you have em all like that Joe Every one replied Joe promptly I d have seventy five of em Seventy five what asked missus Pepper who had gone into the bedroom and now came out a coat in hand to sit down in the west window where she began to sew rapidly Better clear up the dishes Polly and set the table back seventy five what Joel Plum puddings said Joel kissing Phronsie Dear me ejaculated missus Pepper you don t know what you re saying Joel Pepper the house couldn t hold em Wouldn t long responded Joel we d eat em That would be foolish interposed Ben I d have roast beef and fixings and oysters and huckleberry pie Oh dear cried Polly how nice Ben you always do think of the very best things But Joel phoohed and declared he wouldn t waste his time over old beef he d have something like And then he cried Come on Dave what d you choose Little Davie had been quietly eating his breakfast amid all this chatter and somehow thinking it might make the mother feel badly he had refrained from saying just how tiresome he had really found this everlasting breakfast as Joel called it But now he looked up eagerly his answer all ready Oh I know he cried what would be most beautiful toasted bread white bread and candy What s candy asked Phronsie Oh don t you know Phronsie cried Polly what missus Beebe gave you the day you got your shoes the pink sticks and And the peppermint stick mister Beebe gave you Phronsie finished Joel his mouth watering at the remembrance That day when you got your toe pounded added Davie looking at Joel Oh cried Phronsie I want some now I do Well Davie said Polly you shall have that for breakfast when our ship comes in then Your ships aren t ever coming broke in missus Pepper wisely if you sit there talking folks don t ever make any fortunes by wishing True enough laughed Ben jumping up and setting back his chair Come on Joe you ve got to pile to day Oh dear said Joel dismally I wish mister Blodgett s wood was all a fire Never say that Joel said missus Pepper looking up sternly it s biting your own nose off to wish that wood was a fire and besides it s dreadfully wicked Joel hung his head for his mother never spoke in that way unless she was strongly moved but he soon recovered and hastened off for his jacket I m sorry I can t help you do the dishes Polly said David running after Joel I m going to help her said Phronsie I am So Polly got the little wooden tub that she always used gave Phronsie the well worn cup napkin and allowed her to wipe the handleless cups and cracked saucers which afforded the little one intense delight Don t you wish Polly said little Phronsie bustling around with a very important air nearly smothered in the depths of a big brown apron that Polly had carefully tied under her chin that you didn t ever an ever have so many dishes to do Um maybe said Polly thoughtlessly She was thinking of something else besides cups and saucers just then of how nice it would be to go off for just one day and do exactly as she had a mind to in everything She even envied Ben and the boys who were going to work hard at Deacon Blodgett s woodpile Well I tell you said Phronsie confidentially setting down a cup that she had polished with great care I m going to do em all to morrow for you Polly I can truly let me now Polly do Nonsense said Polly giving a great splash with her mop in the tub ashamed of her inward repinings Phronsie you re no bigger than a mouse Yes I am retorted Phronsie very indignantly Her face began to get very red and she straightened up so suddenly to show Polly just how very big she was that her little head came up against the edge of the tub over it went a pile of saucers followed There now cried Polly see what you ve done Ow whimpered Phronsie breaking into a subdued roar oh Polly it s all running down my back Is it said Polly bursting out into a laugh never mind Phronsie I ll dry you Dear me Polly said missus Pepper who had looked up in time to see the tub racing along by itself towards the Provision Room door a stream of dish water following in its wake she will be wet clear through do get off her things quick Yes m cried Polly picking up the tub and giving two or three quick sops to the floor Here you are Pussy grasping Phronsie crying as she was and carrying her into the bedroom Oh dear wailed the child still holding the wet dish towel I won t ever do it again if you ll only let me do em all to morrow When you re big and strong said Polly giving her a hug you shall do em every day May I really said little Phronsie blinking through the tears and looking radiant Yes truly every day Then I ll grow right away I will said Phronsie bursting out merrily and she sat down and pulled off the well worn shoes into which a big pool of dish water had run while Polly went for dry stockings So you shall said Polly coming back a big piece of gingerbread in her hand and this ll make you grow Phronsie O o h and Phronsie s little white teeth shut down quickly on the comforting morsel Gingerbread didn t come often enough into the Pepper household to be lightly esteemed Now said missus Pepper when order was restored the floor washed up brightly and every cup and platter in place hobnobbing away to themselves on the shelves of the old corner cupboard and Polly had come as usual with needle and thread to help mother Polly was getting so that she could do the plain parts on the coats and jackets which filled her with pride at the very thought now said missus Pepper you needn t help me this morning Polly I m getting on pretty smart but you may just run down to the parson s and see how he is Is he sick asked Polly in awe To have the parson sick was something quite different from an ordinary person s illness He s taken with a chill said missus Pepper biting off a thread so Miss Huldy Folsom told me last night and I m afraid he s going to have a fever Oh dear said Polly in dire distress whatever d we do mammy Don t know I m sure replied missus Pepper setting her stitches firmly the Lord ll provide So you run along child and see how he is Can t Phronsie go asked Polly pausing half way to the bedroom door Well yes I suppose she might said missus Pepper assentingly No she can t either said Polly coming back with her sun bonnet in her hand and shutting the door carefully after her cause she s fast asleep on the floor Is she said missus Pepper well she s been running so this morning she s tired out I s pose And her face is dreadfully red continued Polly tying on her bonnet now what ll I say mammy Well I should think twould be said missus Pepper replying to the first half of Polly s speech she cried so Well you just tell missus Henderson your ma wants to know how mister Henderson is this morning and if twas a chill he had yesterday and how he slept last night and Oh ma said Polly I can t ever remember all that Oh yes you can said missus Pepper encouragingly just put your mind on it Polly tisn t anything to what I used to have to remember when I was a little girl no bigger than you are Polly sighed and feeling sure that something must be the matter with her mind gave her whole attention to the errand till at last after a multiplicity of messages and charges not to forget any one of them missus Pepper let her depart Up to the old fashioned green door with its brass knocker Polly went running over in her mind just which of the messages she ought to give first She couldn t for her life think whether if twas a chill he had yesterday ought to come before how he slept She knocked timidly hoping missus Henderson would help her out of her difficulty by telling her without the asking All other front doors in Badgertown were ornaments only opened on grand occasions like a wedding or a funeral But the minister s was accessible alike to all So Polly let fall the knocker and awaited the answer A scuffling noise sounded along the passage and then Polly s soul sank down in dire dismay It was the minister s sister and not gentle little missus Henderson She never could get on with Miss Jerusha in the least She made her feel as she told her mother once as if I don t know what my name is And now here she was and all those messages Miss Jerusha unbolted the door slid back the great bar opened the upper half and stood there She was a big woman with sharp black eyes and spectacles over which she looked which to Polly was much worse for that gave her four eyes Well and what do you want she asked I came to see I mean my ma sent me stammered poor Polly And who is your ma demanded Miss Jerusha as much like a policeman as anything and
5400_3587_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 where do you live 
none	none	I live in Primrose Lane replied Polly wishing very much that she was back there I don t want to know where you live before I know who you are said Miss Jerusha you should answer the question I asked first always remember that My ma s missus Pepper said Polly missus who repeated Miss Jerusha By this time Polly was so worn that she came very near turning and fleeing but she thought of her mother s disappointment in her and the loss of the news and stood quite still What is it Jerusha a gentle voice here broke upon Polly s ear I don t know responded Miss Jerusha tartly still holding the door much as if Polly were a robber it s a little girl and I can t make out what she wants Why it s Polly Pepper exclaimed missus Henderson pleasantly Come in child She opened the other half of the big door and led the way through the wide hall into a big old fashioned room with painted floor and high old side board and some stiff backed rocking chairs Miss Jerusha stalked in also and seated herself by the window and began to knit Polly had just opened her mouth to tell her errand when the door also opened suddenly and mister Henderson walked in Oh said Polly and then she stopped and the color flushed up into her face What is it my dear and the minister took her hand kindly and looked down into her flushed face You are not going to have a fever and be sick and die she cried I hope not my little girl he smiled back encouragingly and then Polly gave her messages which now she managed easily enough There broke in Miss Jerusha a cat can t sneeze in this town but everybody ll know it in quarter of an hour And then missus Henderson took Polly out to see a brood of new little chicks that had just popped their heads out into the world and to Polly down on her knees admiring the time passed very swiftly indeed Now I must go ma am she said at last looking up into the lady s face regretfully for mammy didn t say I was to stay Very well dear do you think you could carry a little pat of butter I have some very nice my sister sent me and I want your mother to share it Oh thank you ma am cried Polly thinking how glad Davie ll be for he does so love butter only Wait a bit then said missus Henderson who didn t seem to notice the objection So she went into the house and Polly went down again in admiration before the fascinating little puff balls But she was soon on the way with a little pat of butter in a blue bowl tied over with a clean cloth happy in her gift for mammy and in the knowledge of the minister being all well I wonder if Phronsie s awake she thought to herself turning in at the little brown gate if she is she shall have a piece of bread with lots of butter Hush said missus Pepper from the rocking chair in the middle of the floor She had something in her arms Polly stopped suddenly almost letting the bowl fall It s Phronsie said the mother and I don t know what the matter is with her you ll have to go for the doctor Polly and just as fast as you can Polly still stood holding the bowl and staring with all her might Phronsie sick Don t wake her said missus Pepper Poor Polly couldn t have stirred to save her life for a minute then she said Where shall I go Oh run to doctor Fisher s and don t be gone long Polly set down the bowl of butter and sped on the wings of the wind for the doctor Something dreadful was the matter she felt for never had a physician been summoned to the hearty Pepper family since she could remember only when the father died Fear lent speed to her feet and soon the doctor came and bent over poor little Phronsie who still lay in her mother s arms in a burning fever It s measles he pronounced that s all no cause for alarm you ever had it he asked turning suddenly around on Polly who was watching with wide open eyes for the verdict No sir answered Polly not knowing in the least what measles was What shall we do said missus Pepper there haven t any of them had it The doctor was over by the little old table under the window mixing up some black looking stuff in a tumbler and he didn t hear her There he said putting a spoonful into Phronsie s mouth she ll get along well enough only keep her out of the cold Then he pulled out a big silver watch He was a little thin man and the watch was immense Polly for her life couldn t keep her eyes off from it if Ben could only have one so fine Polly whispered missus Pepper run and get my purse it s in the top bureau drawer Yes m said Polly taking her eyes off by a violent wrench from the fascinating watch and she ran quickly and got the little old stocking leg where the hard earnings that staid long enough to be put anywhere always found refuge She put it into her mother s lap and watched while missus Pepper counted out slowly one dollar in small pieces Here sir said missus Pepper holding them out towards the doctor and thank you for coming Hey said the little man spinning round that dollar s the Lord s missus Pepper looked bewildered and still sat holding it out And the Lord has given it to you to take care of these children with see that you do it And without another word he was gone Wasn t he good mammy asked Polly after the first surprise was over I m sure he was said missus Pepper Well tie it up again Polly tie it up tight we shall want it I m sure sighing at her little sick girl Mayn t I take Phronsie ma asked Polly No no said Phronsie She had got mammy and she meant to improve the privilege What is measles anyway mammy asked Polly sitting down on the floor at their feet Oh tis something children always have replied missus Pepper but I m sure I hoped it wouldn t come just yet I sha n t have it said Polly decisively I know I sha n t nor Ben nor Joe nor nor Davie I guess she added hesitatingly for Davie was the delicate one of the family at least not nearly so strong as the others missus Pepper looked at her anxiously but Polly seemed as bright and healthy as ever as she jumped up and ran to put the kettle on the stove What ll the boys say I wonder she thought to herself feeling quite important that they really had sickness in the house As long as Phronsie wasn t dangerous it seemed quite like rich folks and she forgot the toil and the grind of poverty She looked out from time to time as she passed the window but no boys came I ll put her in bed Polly said missus Pepper in a whisper as Phronsie closed her eyes and breathed regularly And then will you have your dinner ma Yes said missus Pepper I don t care if the boys come The boys ll never come said Polly impatiently I don t believe why here they are now Oh dear said Joel coming in crossly I m so hungry oh butter where d you get it I thought we never should get here I thought so too said Polly Hush why where s Ben He s just back began Joel commencing to eat and Davie something is the matter with Ben he says he feels funny Something the matter with Ben repeated Polly She dropped the cup she held which broke in a dozen pieces Oh whocky cried Joel see what you ve done Polly Pepper But Polly didn t hear over the big flat door stone she sped and met Ben with little David coming in the gate His face was just like Phronsie s And with a cold heavy feeling at her heart Polly realized that this was no play Oh Ben she cried flinging her arms around his neck and bursting into tears don t please I wish you wouldn t Phronsie s got em and that s enough Got what asked Ben while Davie s eyes grew to their widest proportions Oh measles cried Polly bursting out afresh the hate fullest horridest measles and now you re taken Oh no I m not responded Ben cheerfully who knew what measles were wipe up Polly I m all right only my head aches and my eyes feel funny But Polly only half reassured controlled her sobs and the sorrowful trio repaired to mother Oh dear ejaculated missus Pepper sinking in a chair in dismay at sight of Ben s red face whatever ll we do now The prop and stay of her life would be taken away if Ben should be laid aside No more stray half or quarter dollars would come to help her out when she didn t know where to turn Polly cleared off the deserted table for once Joel had all the bread and butter he wanted Ben took some of Phronsie s medicine and crawled up into the loft to bed and quiet settled down on the little household Polly whispered Ben as she tucked him in it ll be hard buckling to now for you but I guess you ll do it MORE TROUBLE Oh dear said Polly to herself the next morning trying to get a breakfast for the sick ones out of the inevitable mush everything s just as bad as it can be they can t ever eat this I wish I had an ocean of toast Toast some of the bread in the pail Polly said missus Pepper She looked worn and worried she had been up nearly all night back and forth from Ben s bed in the loft to restless fretful little Phronsie in the big four poster in the bedroom for Phronsie wouldn t get into the crib Polly had tried her best to help her and had rubbed her eyes diligently to keep awake but she was wholly unaccustomed to it and her healthy tired little body succumbed and then when she awoke shame and remorse filled her very heart That isn t nice ma she said glancing at the poor old pail which she had brought out of the Provision Room Old brown bread I want to fix em something nice Well you can t you know said missus Pepper with a sigh but you ve got butter now that ll be splendid I know it said Polly running to the corner cupboard where the precious morsel in the blue bowl remained whatever should we do without it mammy Do without it said missus Pepper same s we have done Well twas splendid in missus Henderson to give it to us anyway said Polly longing for just one taste seems as if twas a year since I was there oh ma and here Polly took up the thread that had been so rudely snapped don t you think she s got ten of the prettiest yes the sweetest little chickens you ever saw Why can t we have some mammy Costs money replied missus Pepper We ve got too many in the house to have any outside Oh dear said Polly with a red face that was toasting about as much as the bread she was holding on the point of an old fork we never have had anything There she added at last that s the best I can do now I ll put the butter on this little blue plate ain t that cunning ma Yes said missus Pepper approvingly it takes you Polly So Polly trotted first to Ben up the crooked low stairs to the loft and while she regaled him with the brown toast and butter she kept her tongue flying on the subject of the little chicks and all that she saw on the famous Henderson visit Poor Ben pretended hard to eat but ate nothing really and Polly saw it all and it cut her to the heart so she talked faster than ever Now she said starting to go back to Phronsie Ben Pepper just as soon as you get well we ll have some chickens so there Guess we sha n t get em very soon said Ben despondently if I ve got to lie here and besides Polly you know every bit we can save has got to go for the new stove Oh dear said Polly I forgot that so it has seems to me everything s giving out You can t bake any longer in the old thing said Ben turning over and looking at her poor girl I don t see how you ve stood it so long And we ve been stuffing it cried Polly merrily till twon t stuff any more No said Ben turning back again that s all worn out Well you must go to sleep said Polly or mammy ll be up here and Phronsie hasn t had her breakfast either Phronsie was wailing away dismally sitting up in the middle of the old bed Her face pricked she said and she was rubbing it vigorously with both fat little hands and then crying worse than ever Oh me oh my cried Polly how you look Phronsie I want my mammy cried poor Phronsie Mammy can t come now Phronsie dear she s sewing See what Polly s got for you butter isn t that splendid Phronsie stopped for just one moment and took a mouthful but the toast was hard and dry and she cried harder than before Now said Polly curling up on the bed beside her if you ll stop crying Phronsie Pepper I ll tell you about the cunningest yes the very cunningest little chickens you ever saw One was white and he looked just like this said Polly tumbling over on the bed in a heap he couldn t stand up straight he was so fat Did he bite asked Phronsie full of interest No he didn t bite me said Polly but his mother put a bug in his mouth just as I m doing you know and she broke off a small piece of the toast put on a generous bit of butter and held it over Phronsie s mouth Did he swallow it asked the child obediently opening her little red lips Oh snapped it answered Polly quick as ever he could I tell you but twasn t good like this Phronsie Did he have two bugs asked Phronsie eying suspiciously the second morsel of dry toast that Polly was conveying to her mouth Well he would have had replied Polly if there d been bugs enough but there were nine other chicks Phronsie Poor chickies said Phronsie and looked lovingly at the rest of the toast and butter on the plate and while Polly fed it to her listened with absorbed interest to all the particulars concerning each and every chick in the Henderson hen coop Mother said Polly towards evening I m going to sit up with Ben to night say I may do mother Oh no you can t replied missus Pepper you ll get worn out and then what shall I do Joel can hand him his medicine Oh Joe would tumble to sleep mammy said Polly the first thing let me Perhaps Phronsie ll let me go to night said missus Pepper reflectively Oh no she won t I know replied Polly decisively she wants you all the time I will Polly said Davie coming in with an armful of wood in time to hear the conversation I ll give him his medicine mayn t I mammy and David let down his load and came over where his mother and Polly sat sewing to urge his rights I don t know said his mother smiling on him Can you do you think Yes ma am said Davie straightening himself up When they told Ben he said he knew a better way than for Davie to watch he d have a string tied to Davie s arm and the end he d hold in bed and when twas time for medicine he d pull the string and that would wake Davie up Polly didn t sleep much more on her shake down on the floor than if she had watched with Ben for Phronsie cried and moaned and wanted a drink of water every two minutes it seemed to her As she went back into her nest after one of these travels Polly thought Well I don t care if nobody else gets sick if Ben ll only get well To morrow I m goin to do mammy s sack she s begun for mister Jackson it s all plain sew in just like a bag and I can do it I know and so she fell into a troubled sleep only to be awakened by Phronsie s fretful little voice I want a drink of water Polly I do Don t she drink awfully mammy asked Polly after one of these excursions out to the kitchen after the necessary draught Yes said missus Pepper and she mustn t have any more twill hurt her But Phronsie fell into a delicious sleep after that and didn t want any more luckily Here Joe said missus Pepper the next morning take this coat up to mister Peterses and be sure you get the money for it How ll I get it asked Joe who didn t relish the long hot walk Why tell em we re sick Ben s sick added missus Pepper as the most decisive thing and we must have it and then wait for it Tisn t pleasant up at the Peterses grumbled Joel taking the parcel and moving slowly off No no Polly said missus Pepper you needn t do that seeing Polly take up some sewing after doing up the room and finishing the semi weekly bake you re all beat out with that tussle over the stove that sack ll have to go till next week It can t mammy said Polly snipping off a basting thread we ve got to have the money how much ll he give you for it Thirty cents replied missus Pepper Well said Polly we ve got to get all the thirty centses we can mammy dear and I know I can do it truly try me once she implored Well missus Pepper relented slowly Don t feel bad mammy dear comforted Polly sewing away briskly Ben ll get well pretty soon and then we ll be all right Maybe said missus Pepper and went back to Phronsie who could scarcely let her out of her sight Polly stitched away bravely Now if I do this good mammy ll let me do it other times she said to herself Davie too worked patiently out of doors trying to do Ben s chores The little fellow blundered over things that Ben would have accomplished in half the time and he had to sit down often on the steps of the little old shed where the tools were kept to wipe his hot face and rest Polly said missus Pepper hadn t you better stop a little Dear me how fast you sew child Polly gave a delighted little hum at her mother s evident approval I m going to do em all next week mammy she said then mister Atkins won t take em away from us I guess mister Atkins kept the store and gave out coats and sacks of coarse linen and homespun to missus Pepper to make and it was the fear of losing the work that had made the mother s heart sink I don t believe anybody s got such children as I have she said and she gave Polly a motherly little pat that the little daughter felt clear to the tips of her toes with a thrill of delight About half past two long after dinner Joe came walking in hungry as a beaver but flushed and triumphant Why where have you been all this time asked his mother Oh Joe you didn t stop to play asked Polly from her perch where she sat sewing giving him a reproachful glance Stop to play retorted Joe indignantly no I guess I didn t I ve been to Old Peterses Not all this time exclaimed missus Pepper Yes I have too replied Joel sturdily marching up to her And there s your money mother and he counted out a quarter of a dollar in silver pieces and pennies which he took from a dingy wad of paper stowed away in the depths of his pocket Oh Joe said missus Pepper sinking back in her chair and looking at him what do you mean Polly put her work in her lap and waited to hear Where s my dinner Polly asked Joel I hope it s a big one Yes tis said Polly you ve got lots to day it s in the corner of the cupboard covered up with the plate so tell on Joe That s elegant said Joel coming back with the well filled plate Ben s and his own share Do tell us Joey implored Polly mother s waiting Well said Joel his mouth half full I waited and he said the coat was all right and and missus Peters said twas all right and Mirandy Peters said twas all right but they didn t any of em say anythin about payin so I didn t think twas all right and and can t I have some more butter Polly No said Polly sorry to refuse him he d been so good about the money the butter s got to be saved for Ben and Phronsie Oh said Joe I wish Miss Henderson would send us some more I do I think she might For shame Joe said missus Pepper she was very good to send this I think now what else did you say she asked Well said Joel taking another mouthful of bread so I waited you told me to mother you know and they all went to work and they didn t mind me at all and there wasn t anything to look at so I sat and sat Polly can t I have some gingerbread No said Polly it s all gone I gave the last piece to Phronsie the day she was taken sick Oh dear said Joel everything s gone Well do go on Joe do And then they had dinner and mister Peters said Hasn t that boy gone home yet and missus Peters said no and he called me in and asked me why I didn t run along home and I said Phronsie was sick and Ben had the squeezles The what said Polly The squeezles repeated Joel irritably that s what you said It s measles Joey corrected missus Pepper never mind I wouldn t feel bad Well they all laughed and laughed and then I said you told me to wait till I did get the money Oh Joe began missus Pepper you shouldn t have told em so what did he say Well he laughed and said I was a smart boy and he d see and Mirandy said do pay him pa he must be tired to death and don t you think he went to a big desk in the corner and took out a box and twas full most of money lots oh and he gave me mine and that s all and I m tired to death And Joel flung himself down on the floor expanded his legs as only Joel could and took a comfortable roll So you must be said Polly pityingly waiting at those Peterses Don t ever want to see any more Peterses said Joel never never never Oh dear thought Polly as she sewed on into the afternoon I wonder what does all my eyes feels just like sand in em and she rubbed and rubbed to thread her needle But she was afraid her mother would see so she kept at her sewing Once in awhile the bad feeling would go away and then she would forget all about it There now who says I can t do it that s most done she cried jumping up and spinning across the room to stretch herself a bit and to morrow I ll finish it Well said missus Pepper if you can do that Polly you ll be the greatest help I ve had yet So Polly tucked herself into the old shake down with a thankful heart that night hoping for morning Alas when morning did come Polly could hardly move The measles what should she do A faint hope of driving them off made her tumble out of bed and stagger across the room to look in the old cracked looking glass All hope was gone as the red reflection met her gaze Polly was on the sick list now I won t be sick she said at any rate I ll keep around An awful feeling made her clutch the back of a chair but she managed somehow to get into her clothes and go groping blindly into the kitchen Somehow Polly couldn t see very well She tried to set the table but twas no use Oh dear she thought whatever ll mammy do Hulloa said Joel coming in what s the matter Polly Polly started at his sudden entrance and wavering a minute fell over in a heap Oh ma ma screamed Joel running to the foot of the stairs leading to the loft where missus Pepper was with Ben something s taken Polly and she fell and I guess she s in the wood box HARD DAYS FOR POLLY Ma said David coming softly into the bedroom where poor Polly lay on the bed with Phronsie her eyes bandaged with a soft old handkerchief I ll set the table There isn t any table to set said missus Pepper sadly there isn t anybody to eat anything Davie you and Joel can get something out of the cupboard Can we get whatever we ve a mind to ma cried Joel who followed Davie rubbing his face with a towel after his morning ablutions Yes replied his mother absently Come on Dave cried Joel we ll have a breakfast We mustn t said little Davie doubtfully eat the whole Joey But that individual already had his head in the cupboard which soon engrossed them both doctor Fisher was called in the middle of the morning to see what was the matter with Polly s eyes The little man looked at her keenly over his spectacles then he said When were you taken This morning answered Polly her eyes smarting Didn t you feel badly before questioned the doctor Polly thought back and then she remembered that she had felt very badly that when she was baking over the old stove the day before her back had ached dreadfully and that somehow when she sat down to sew it didn t stop only her eyes had bothered her so she didn t mind her back so much I thought so said the doctor when Polly answered And those eyes of yours have been used too much what has she been doing ma am He turned around sharply on missus Pepper as he asked this Sewing said missus Pepper and everything Polly does everything sir Humph said the doctor well she won t again in one spell her eyes are very bad At this a whoop small but terrible to hear came from the middle of the bed and Phronsie sat bolt upright Everybody started while Phronsie broke out Don t make my Polly sick oh please don t Hey said the doctor and he looked kindly at the small object with a very red face in the middle of the bed Then he added gently We re going to make Polly well little girl so that she can see splendidly Will you really asked the child doubtfully Yes said the doctor we ll try hard and you mustn t cry cause then Polly ll cry and that will make her eyes very bad very bad indeed he repeated impressively I won t cry said Phronsie no not one bit And she wiped off the last tear with her fat little hand and watched to see what next was to be done And Polly was left very rebellious indeed in the big bed with a cooling lotion on the poor eyes that somehow didn t cool them one bit If twas anythin but my eyes mammy I could stand it she bewailed flouncing over and over in her impatience and who ll do all the work now Don t think of the work Polly said missus Pepper I can t do anything but think said poor Polly Just at that moment a queer noise out in the kitchen was heard Do go out mother and see what tis said Polly I ve come said a cracked voice close up by the bedroom door followed by a big black cap which could belong to no other than Grandma Bascom to set by you a spell what s the matter she asked and stopped amazed to see Polly in bed Oh Polly s taken screamed missus Pepper in her ear Taken repeated the old lady what is it a fit No said missus Pepper the same as Ben s got and Phronsie the measles The measles has she said grandma well that s bad and Ben s away you say No he isn t either screamed missus Pepper he s got them too Got two what asked grandma Measles he s got the measles too repeated missus Pepper loud as she could so loud that the old lady s cap trembled at the noise Oh the dreadful said grandma and this girl too laying her hand on Phronsie s head Yes said missus Pepper feeling it a little relief to tell over her miseries all three of them I haven t said Joel coming in in hopes that grandma had a stray peppermint or two in her pocket as she sometimes did and I m not going to either Oh dear groaned his mother that s what Polly said and she s got em bad It s her eyes she screamed to grandma who looked inquiringly Her eyes is it asked missus Bascom well I ve got a receet that cousin Samanthy s folks had when John s children had em and I ll run right along home and get it and she started to go No you needn t screamed missus Pepper thank you missus Bascom but doctor Fisher s been here and he put something on Polly s eyes and he said it mustn t be touched Hey said the old lady so missus Pepper had to go all over it again till at last she made her understand that Polly s eyes were taken care of and they must wait for time to do the rest You come along of me whispered grandma when at last her call was done to Joel who stood by the door I ve got some peppermints to home I forgot to bring em Yes m said Joel brightening up Where you going Joe asked missus Pepper seeing him move off with missus Bascom I may want you Oh I ve got to go over to grandma s said Joel briskly she wants me Well don t be gone long then replied his mother There said grandma going into her keeping room to an old fashioned chest of drawers opening one she took therefrom a paper from which she shook out before Joe s delighted eyes some red and white peppermint drops There now you take these home you may have some but be sure you give the most to the sick ones and Polly let Polly have the biggest She won t take em said Joel wishing he had the measles Well you try her said grandma run along now But it was useless to tell Joel that for he was half way home already He carried out grandma s wishes and distributed conscientiously the precious drops But when he came to Polly she didn t answer and looking at her in surprise he saw two big tears rolling out under the bandage and wetting the pillow I don t want em Joe said Polly when he made her understand that twas peppermints real peppermints you may have em Try one Polly they re real good said Joel who had an undefined wish to comfort there open your mouth So Polly opened her mouth and Joel put one in with satisfaction Isn t it good he asked watching her crunch it Yes said Polly real good where d you get em Over to Grandma Bascom s said Joel she gave me lots for all of us have another Polly No said Polly not yet you put two on my pillow where I can reach em and then you keep the rest Joel I ll put three said Joel counting out one red and two white ones and laying them on the pillow there And I want another Joey I do said Phronsie from the other side of the bed Well you may have one said Joel a red one Phronsie yes you may have two Now come on Dave we ll have the rest out by the wood pile How they ever got through that day I don t know But late in the afternoon carriage wheels were heard and then they stopped right at the Peppers little brown gate Polly said missus Pepper running to the bedroom door it s missus Henderson Is it said Polly from the darkened room oh I m so glad is Miss Jerushy with her she asked fearfully No said missus Pepper going back to ascertain why it s the parson himself Deary how we look Never mind mammy called back Polly longing to spring out of bed and fix up a bit I m sorry to hear the children are sick said missus Henderson coming in in her sweet gentle way We didn t know it said the minister until this morning can we see them Oh yes sir said missus Pepper Ben s upstairs and Polly and Phronsie are in here Poor little things said missus Henderson compassionately hadn t you better turning to the minister go up and see Ben first while I will visit the little girls So the minister mounted the crooked stairs and missus Henderson went straight up to Polly s side and the first thing Polly knew a cool gentle hand was laid on her hot head and a voice said I ve come to see my little chicken now Oh ma am said Polly bursting into a sob I don t care about my eyes only mammy and she broke right down I know said the minister s wife soothingly but it s for you to bear patiently Polly what do you suppose the chicks were doing when I came away And missus Henderson while she held Polly s hand smiled and nodded encouragingly to Phronsie who was staring at her from the other side of the bed I don t know ma am said Polly please tell us Well they were all fighting over a grasshopper yes ten of them Which one got it asked Polly in intense interest oh I hope the white one did Well he looked as much like winning as any of them said the lady laughing Bless her thought missus Pepper to herself out in the kitchen finishing the sack Polly had left she s a parson s wife I say And then the minister came down from Ben s room and went into the bedroom and missus Henderson went up stairs into the loft So he said kindly as after patting Phronsie s head he came over and sat down by Polly this is the little girl who came to see me when I was sick Oh sir said Polly I m so glad you wasn t Well when I come again said mister Henderson rising after a merry chat I see I shall have to slip a book into my pocket and read for those poor eyes Oh thank you cried Polly and then she stopped and blushed Well what is it asked the minister encouragingly Ben loves to hear reading said Polly Does he well by that time my little girl I guess Ben will be down stairs he s all right Polly don t you worry about him and I ll sit in the kitchen by the bedroom door and you can hear nicely So the Hendersons went away But somehow before they went a good many things found their way out of the old fashioned chaise into the Peppers little kitchen But Polly s eyes didn t get any better with all the care and the lines of worry on missus Pepper s face grew deeper and deeper At last she just confronted doctor Fisher in the kitchen one day after his visit to Polly and boldly asked him if they ever could be cured I know she s and there isn t any use keeping it from me said the poor woman she s going to be stone blind My good woman doctor Fisher s voice was very gentle and he took the hard brown hand in his own your little girl will not be blind I tell you the truth but it will take some time to make her eyes quite strong time and rest She has strained them in some way but she will come out of it Praise the Lord cried missus Pepper throwing her apron over her head and then she sobbed on and
5400_3587_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 thank you sir 
none	none	I can t ever thank you for for if Polly was blind we might as well give up The next day Phronsie who had the doctor s permission to sit up only she was to be kept from taking cold scampered around in stocking feet in search of her shoes which she hadn t seen since she was first taken sick Oh I want on my very best shoes she cried can t I mammy Oh no Phronsie you must keep them nice remonstrated her mother you can t wear em every day you know Tisn t every day said Phronsie slowly it s only one day Well and then you ll want em on again tomorrow said her mother Oh no I won t cried Phronsie never no more to morrow if I can have em to day please mammy dear missus Pepper went to the lowest drawer in the high bureau and took therefrom a small parcel done up in white tissue paper Slowly unrolling this before the delighted eyes of the child who stood patiently waiting she disclosed the precious red topped shoes which Phronsie immediately clasped to her bosom My own very own shoes whole mine she cried and trudged out into the kitchen to put them on herself Hulloa cried doctor Fisher coming in about a quarter of an hour later to find her tugging laboriously at the buttons new shoes I declare My own cried Phronsie sticking out one foot for inspection where every button was in the wrong button hole and they ve got red tops too So they have said the doctor getting down on the floor beside her beautiful red tops aren t they Be yew ti ful sang the child delightedly Does Polly have new shoes every day asked the doctor in a low voice pretending to examine the other foot Phronsie opened her eyes very wide at this Oh no she don t have anything Polly don t And what does Polly want most of all do you know see if you can tell me And the doctor put on the most alluring expression that he could muster Oh I know cried Phronsie with a very wise look There now cried the doctor you re the girl for me to think you know so what is it Phronsie got up very gravely and with one shoe half on she leaned over and whispered in the doctor s ear A stove A what said the doctor looking at her and then at the old black thing in the corner that looked as if it were ashamed of itself why she s got one Oh said the child it won t burn and sometimes Polly cries she does when she s all alone and I see her Now said the doctor very sympathetically that s too bad that is and then what does she do Oh Ben stuffs it up said the child laughing and so does Polly too with paper and then it all tumbles out quick oh just as quick And Phronsie shook her yellow head at the dismal remembrance Do you suppose said the doctor getting up that you know of any smart little girl around here about four years old and that knows how to button on her own red topped shoes that would like to go to ride to morrow morning in my carriage with me Oh I do cried Phronsie hopping on one toe it s me Very well then said doctor Fisher going to the bedroom door we ll lookout for to morrow then To poor Polly lying in the darkened room or sitting up in the big rocking chair for Polly wasn t really very sick in other respects the disease having all gone into the merry brown eyes the time seemed interminable Not to do anything The very idea at any time would have filled her active wide awake little body with horror and now here she was Oh dear I can t bear it she said when she knew by the noise in the kitchen that everybody was out there so nobody heard except a fat old black spider in the corner and he didn t tell anyone I know it s a week she said since dinnertime If Ben were only well to talk to me Oh I say Polly screamed Joel at that moment running in Ben s a comin down the stairs Stop Joe said missus Pepper you shouldn t have told he wanted to surprise Polly Oh is he cried Polly clasping her hands in rapture mammy can t I take off this horrid bandage and see him Dear me no said missus Pepper springing forward not for the world Polly doctor Fisher d have our ears off Well I can hear any way said Polly resigning herself to the remaining comfort here he is oh Ben There said Ben grasping Polly bandage and all now we re all right and say Polly you re a brick Mammy told me not to say that the other day said Joel with a very virtuous air Can t help it said Ben who was a little wild over Polly and besides he had been sick himself and had borne a good deal too Now said missus Pepper after the first excitement was over you re so comfortable together and Phronsie don t want me now I ll go to the store I must get some more work if mister Atkins ll give it to me I ll be all right now mammy that Ben s here cried Polly settling back into her chair with Phronsie on the stool at her feet I m goin to tell her stories ma cried Ben so you needn t worry about us Isn t it funny Ben said Polly as the gate clicked after the mother to be sitting still and telling stories in the daytime Rather funny replied Ben Well do go on said Joel as usual rolling on the floor in a dreadful hurry for the story to begin Little David looked up quietly as he sat on Ben s other side his hands clasped tight together just as eager though he said nothing Well once upon a time began Ben delightfully and launched into one of the stories that the children thought perfectly lovely Oh Bensie cried Polly entranced as they listened with bated breath however do you think of such nice things I ve had time enough to think the last week said Ben laughing to last a life time Do go on put in Joel impatient at the delay Don t hurry him so said Polly reprovingly he isn t strong Ben said David drawing a long breath his eyes very big did he really see a bear No said Ben oh where was I Why you said Tommy heard a noise said Polly and he thought it was a bear Oh yes said Ben I remember twasn t a Oh make it a bear Ben cried Joel terribly disappointed don t let it be not a bear Why I can t said Ben twouldn t sound true Never mind make it sound true insisted Joel you can make anything true Very well said Ben laughing I suppose I must Make it two bears Ben begged little Phronsie Oh no Phronsie that s too much cried Joel that ll spoil it but make it a big bear do Ben and have him bite him somewhere and most kill him Oh Joel cried Polly while David s eyes got bigger than ever So Ben drew upon his powers as story teller to suit his exacting audience and was making his bear work havoc upon poor Tommy in a way captivating to all even Joel when Well I declare sounded missus Pepper s cheery voice coming in upon them if this isn t comfortable Oh mammy cried Phronsie jumping out of Polly s arms whither she had taken refuge during the thrilling tale and running to her mother who gathered her baby up we ve had a bear a real live bear we have Ben made him Have you said missus Pepper taking off her shawl and laying her parcel of work down on the table now that s nice Oh mammy cried Polly it does seem so good to be all together again And I thank the Lord said missus Pepper looking down on her happy little group and the tears were in her eyes and children we ought to be very good and please Him for He s been so good to us THE CLOUD OVER THE LITTLE BROWN HOUSE When Phronsie with many crows of delight and much chattering had gotten fairly started the following morning on her much anticipated drive with the doctor the whole family excepting Polly drawn up around the door to see them off missus Pepper resolved to snatch the time and run down for an hour or two to one of her customers who had long been waiting for a little tailoring to be done for her boys Now Joel she said putting on her bonnet before the cracked looking glass you stay along of Polly Ben must go up to bed the doctor said and Davie s going to the store for some molasses so you and Polly must keep house Yes m said Joel may I have somethin to eat ma Yes said missus Pepper but don t you eat the new bread you may have as much as you want of the old Isn t there any molasses mammy asked Joel as she bade Polly good bye and gave her numberless charges to be careful of your eyes and not to let a crack of light in through the curtain as the old green paper shade was called No if you re very hungry you can eat bread said missus Pepper sensibly Joel said Polly after the mother had gone I do wish you could read to me Well I can t said Joel glad he didn t know how I thought the minister was comin Well he was said Polly but mammy said he had to go out of town to a consequence A what asked Joel very much impressed A con repeated Polly Well it began with a con and I am sure yes very sure it was consequence That must be splendid said Joel coming up to her chair and slowly drawing a string he held in his hand back and forth to go to consequences and everything When I m a man Polly Pepper I m going to be a minister and have a nice time and go just everywhere Oh Joel exclaimed Polly quite shocked you couldn t be one you aren t good enough I don t care said Joel not at all dashed by her plainness I ll be good then when I m a big man don t you suppose Polly as a new idea struck him that mister Henderson ever is naughty No said Polly very decidedly never never never Then I don t want to be one said Joel veering round with a sigh of relief and besides I d rather have a pair of horses like mister Slocum s and then I could go everywheres I guess And sell tin asked Polly just like mister Slocum Yes said Joel this is the way I d go Gee whop gee whoa and Joel pranced with his imaginary steeds all around the room making about as much noise as any other four boys as he brought up occasionally against the four poster or the high old bureau Well said a voice close up by Polly s chair that made her skip with apprehension it was so like Miss Jerusha Henderson s Joel was whooping away behind the bedstead to his horses that had become seriously entangled so he didn t hear anything But when Polly said bashfully I can t see anything ma am he came up red and shining to the surface and stared with all his might I came to see you little girl said Miss Jerusha severely seating herself stiffly by Polly s side Thank you ma am said Polly faintly Who s this boy asked the lady turning around squarely on Joel and eying him from head to foot He s my brother Joel said Polly Joel still stared Which brother pursued Miss Jerusha like a census taker He is next to me said Polly wishing her mother was home he s nine Joel is He s big enough to do something to help his mother said Miss Jerusha looking him through and through Don t you think you might do something when the others are sick and your poor mother is working so hard she continued in a cold voice I do something blurted out Joel sturdily lots and lots You shouldn t say lots reproved Miss Jerusha with a sharp look over her spectacles tisn t proper for boys to talk so what do you do all day long she asked turning back to Polly after a withering glance at Joel who still stared I can t do anything ma am replied Polly sadly I can t see to do anything Well you might knit I should think said her visitor it s dreadful for a girl as big as you are to sit all day idle I had sore eyes once when I was a little girl how old are you she asked abruptly Eleven last month said Polly Well I wasn t only nine when I knit a stocking and I had sore eyes too you see I was a very little girl and Was you ever little interrupted Joel in extreme incredulity drawing near and looking over the big square figure Hey said Miss Jerusha so Joel repeated his question before Polly could stop him Of course answered Miss Jerusha and then she added tartly little boys shouldn t speak unless they re spoken to Now and she turned back to Polly again didn t you ever knit a stocking No ma am said Polly not a whole one Dear me exclaimed Miss Jerusha did I ever And she raised her black mitts in intense disdain A big girl like you never to knit a stocking to think your mother should bring you up so and She didn t bring us up screamed Joel in indignation facing her with blazing eyes Joel said Polly be still And you re very impertinent too said Miss Jerusha a good child never is impertinent Polly sat quite still and Miss Jerusha continued Now I hope you will learn to be industrious and when I come again I will see what you have done You aren t ever coming again said Joel defiantly no never Joel implored Polly and in her distress she pulled up her bandage as she looked at him you know mammy ll be so sorry at you Oh ma am and she turned to Miss Jerusha who was now thoroughly aroused to the duty she saw before her of doing these children good I don t know what is the reason ma am Joel never talks so he s real good and It only shows said the lady seeing her way quite clear for a little exhortation that you ve all had your own way from infancy and that you don t do what you might to make your mother s life a happy one Oh ma am cried Polly and she burst into a flood of tears please please don t say that And I say screamed Joel stamping his small foot if you make Polly cry you ll kill her Don t Polly don t and the boy put both arms around her neck and soothed and comforted her in every way he could think of And Miss Jerusha seeing no way to make herself heard disappeared feeling pity for children who would turn away from good advice But still Polly cried on all the pent up feelings that had been so long controlled had free vent now She really couldn t stop Joel frightened to death at last said I m going to wake up Ben 
4116_3582_000025_000000	train-clean-360	That brought Polly to 
none	none	and she sobbed out Oh no Jo ey I ll stop I will said Joel seeing his advantage I m going Polly and he started to the foot of the stairs No I m done now Joe said Polly wiping her eyes and choking back her thoughts oh Joe I must scream my eyes aches so and poor Polly fairly writhed all over the chair What ll I do said Joel at his wits end running back do you want some water Oh no gasped Polly doctor wouldn t let me oh I wish mammy d come I ll go and look for her suggested Joel feeling as if he must do something and he d rather be out at the gate than to see Polly suffer That won t bring her said Polly trying to keep still I ll try to wait Here she is now cried Joel peeping out of the window oh goody JOEL S TURN Well missus Pepper s tone was unusually blithe as she stepped into the kitchen you ve had a nice time I suppose what in the world and she stopped at the bedroom door Oh mammy if you d been here said Joel while Polly sat still only holding on to her eyes as if they were going to fly out there s been a big woman here she came right in and she talked awfully and Polly s been a cryin and her eyes ache dreadfully and Been crying repeated missus Pepper coming up to poor Polly Polly been crying she still repeated Oh mammy I couldn t help it said Polly she said and in spite of all she could do the rain of tears began again which bade fair to be as uncontrolled as before But missus Pepper took her up firmly in her arms as if she were Phronsie and sat down in the old rocking chair and just patted her back There there she whispered soothingly don t think of it Polly mother s got home Oh mammy said Polly crawling up to the comfortable neck for protection I ought not to mind but twas Miss Jerusha Henderson and she said What did she say asked missus Pepper thinking perhaps it to be the wiser thing to let Polly free her mind Oh she said that we ought to be doing something and I ought to knit and Go on said her mother And then Joel got naughty oh mammy he never did so before and I couldn t stop him cried Polly in great distress I really couldn t mammy and he talked to her and he told her she wasn t ever coming here again Joel shouldn t have said that said missus Pepper and under her breath something was added that Polly even failed to hear but no more she isn t And mammy cried Polly and she flung her arms around her mother s neck and gave her a grasp that nearly choked missus Pepper ain t I helpin you some mammy Oh I wish I could do something big for you Ain t you happy mammy For the land s sakes cried missus Pepper straining Polly to her heart whatever has that woman whatever could she have said to you Such a girl as you are too cried missus Pepper hugging Polly and covering her with kisses so tender that Polly warmed and cuddled up to her heart s content was comforted to the full Well said missus Pepper when at last she thought she had formed between Polly and Joel about the right idea of the visit well now we won t think of it ever any more tisn t worth it Polly you know But poor Polly and poor mother They both were obliged to think of it Nothing could avert the suffering of the next few days caused by that long flow of burning tears Nothing feels good on em mammy said Polly at last twisting her hands in the vain attempt to keep from rubbing the aching inflamed eyes that drove her nearly wild with their itching there isn t any use in trying anything There will be use energetically protested missus Pepper bringing another cool bandage as long as you ve got an eye in your head Polly Pepper doctor Fisher s face when he first saw the change that the fateful visit had wrought and heard the accounts was very grave indeed Everything had been so encouraging on his last visit that he had come very near promising Polly speedy freedom from the hateful bandage But the little Pepper household soon had something else to think of more important even than Polly s eyes for now the heartiest the jolliest of all the little group was down Joel How he fell sick they scarcely knew it all came so suddenly The poor bewildered family had hardly time to think before delirium and perhaps death stared them in the face When Polly first heard it by Phronsie s pattering downstairs and screaming Oh Polly Joey s dre ad ful sick he is she jumped right up and tore off the bandage Now I will help mother I will so there and in another minute she would have been up in the sick room But the first thing she knew a gentle but firm hand was laid upon hers and she found herself back again in the old rocking chair and listening to the Doctor s words which were quite stern and decisive Now I tell you he said you must not take off that bandage again do you know the consequences You will be blind and then you will be a care to your mother all your life I shall be blind anyway said Polly despairingly so twon t make any difference No your eyes will come out of it all right only I did hope and the good doctor s face fell that the other two boys would escape but and he brightened up at sight of Polly s forlorn visage see you do your part by keeping still But there came a day soon when everything was still around the once happy little brown house when only whispers were heard from white lips and thoughts were fearfully left unuttered On the morning of one of these days when missus Pepper felt she could not exist an hour longer without sleep kind missus Beebe came to stay until things were either better or worse Still the cloud hovered dark and forbidding At last one afternoon when Polly was all alone she could endure it no longer She flung herself down by the side of the old bed and buried her face in the gay patched bed quilt Dear God she said make me willing to have anything she hesitated yes anything happen to be blind forever and to have Joey sick only make me good How long she staid there she never knew for she fell asleep the first sleep she had had since Joey was taken sick And little missus Beebe coming in found her thus Polly the good woman said leaning over her you poor pretty creeter you I m goin to tell you somethin there there just to think Joel s goin to get well Oh missus Beebe cried Polly tumbling over in a heap on the floor her face as much as could be seen under the bandage in a perfect glow Is he really Yes to be sure the danger s all over now said the little old lady inwardly thinking If I hadn t a come Well then the Lord wants him to cried Polly in rapture don t he missus Beebe To be sure to be sure repeated the kind friend only half understanding Well I don t care about my eyes then cried Polly and to missus Beebe s intense astonishment and dismay she spun round and round in the middle of the floor Oh Polly Polly the little old lady cried running up to her do stop the doctor wouldn t let you he wouldn t really you know it ll all go to your eyes I don t care repeated Polly in the middle of a spin but she stopped obediently seems as if I just as soon be blind as not it s so beautiful Joey s going to get well SUNSHINE AGAIN But as Joel was smitten down suddenly so he came up quickly and his hearty nature asserted itself by rapid strides toward returning health and one morning he astonished them all by turning over suddenly and exclaiming I want something to eat Bless the Lord cried missus Pepper now he s going to live But he mustn t eat protested missus Beebe in great alarm trotting for the cup of gruel Here you pretty creeter you here s something nice And she temptingly held the spoon over Joel s mouth but with a grimace he turned away Oh I want something to eat some gingerbread or some bread and butter Dear me ejaculated missus Beebe Gingerbread Poor missus Pepper saw the hardest part of her trouble now before her as she realized that the returning appetite must be fed only on strengthening food for where it was to come from she couldn t tell The Lord only knows where we ll get it she groaned within herself Yes He knew A rap at the door and little David ran down to find the cause Oh mammy he said missus Henderson sent it see see And in the greatest excitement he placed in her lap a basket that smelt savory and nice even before it was opened When it was opened there lay a little bird delicately roasted and folded in a clean napkin also a glass of jelly crimson and clear Oh Joey cried missus Pepper almost overwhelmed with joy see what missus Henderson sent you now you can eat fit for a king That little bird certainly performed its mission in life for as missus Beebe said It just touched the spot and from that very moment Joel improved so rapidly they could hardly believe their eyes Hoh I haven t been sick he cried on the third day true to his nature Mammy I want to get up Oh dear no you mustn t Joel cried missus Pepper in a fright running up to him as he was preparing to give the bedclothes a lusty kick you ll send em in Send what in asked Joel looking up at his mother in terror as the dreadful thought made him pause Why the measles Joey they ll all go in if you get out How they goin to get in again I d like to know asked Joel looking at the little red spots on his hands in incredulity say ma Well they will said his mother as you ll find to your sorrow if you get out of bed Oh dear said Joel beginning to whimper as he drew into bed again when can I get up mammy Oh in a day or two responded missus Pepper cheerfully you re getting on so finely you ll be as smart as a cricket Shouldn t you say he might get up in a day or two missus Beebe she appealed to that individual who was knitting away cheerily in the corner Well if he keeps on as he s begun I shouldn t know what to think replied missus Beebe It beats all how quick he s picked up I never see anything like it I m sure And as missus Beebe was a great authority in sickness the old sunny cheeriness began to creep into the brown house once more and to bubble over as of yore Seems as if twas just good to live said missus Pepper thankfully once when her thoughts were too much for her I don t believe I shall ever care how poor we are she continued as long as we re together And that s just what the Lord meant maybe replied good missus Beebe who was preparing to go home Joel kept the house in a perfect uproar all through his getting well missus Pepper observed one day when he had been more turbulent than usual that she was almost worn to a thread Twasn t anything to take care of you Joe she added when you were real sick because then I knew where you were but well you won t ever have the measles again I s pose and that s some comfort Little David who had been nearly stunned by the sickness that had laid aside his almost constant companion could express his satisfaction and joy in no other way than by running every third minute and begging to do something for him And Joel who loved dearly to be waited on improved every opportunity that offered which missus Pepper observing soon put a stop to You ll run his legs off Joel at last she said when he sent David the third time down to the wood pile for a stick of just the exact thickness and which the little messenger declared wasn t to be found Haven t you any mercy You ve kept him going all day too she added glancing at David s pale face Oh mammy panted David don t I love to go Here Joe is the best I could find handing him a nice smooth stick I know you do said his mother but Joe s getting better now and he must learn to spare you I don t want to spare folks grumbled Joel whittling away with energy I ve been sick real sick he added lifting his chubby face to his mother to impress the fact I know you have she cried running to kiss her boy but now Joe you re most well To morrow I m going to let you go down stairs what do you think of that Hooray screamed Joel throwing away the stick and clapping his hands forgetting all about his serious illness that ll be prime Aren t you too sick to go Joey asked missus Pepper mischievously No I m not sick cried Joel in the greatest alarm fearful his mother meant to take back the promise I ve never been sick Oh mammy you know you ll let me go won t your I guess so laughed his mother Come on Phron cried Joel giving her a whirl David who was too tired for active sport sat on the floor and watched them frolic in great delight Mammy said he edging up to her side as the sport went on do you know I think it s just good it s oh it s so frisky since Joe got well isn t it mammy Yes indeed said missus Pepper giving him a radiant look in return for his and when Polly s around again with her two eyes all right well I don t know what we shall do I declare Boo cried a voice next morning close to Polly s elbow unmistakably Joel s Oh Joel Pepper she cried whirling around is that really you Yes cried that individual confidently it s I oh I say Polly I ve had fun up stairs I tell you what Poor boy said Polly compassionately I wasn t a poor boy cried Joel indignantly I had splendid things to eat oh my and he closed one eye and smacked his lips in the delightful memory I know it said Polly and I m so glad Joel I don t suppose I ll ever get so many again observed Joel reflectively after a minute s pause as one and another of the wondrous delicacies rose before his mind s eye not unless I have the measles again say Polly can t I have em again Mercy no cried Polly in intense alarm I hope not Well I don t said Joel I wish I could have em sixty no two hundred times so there Well mammy couldn t take care of you said Ben you don t know what you re sayin Joe Well then I wish I could have the things without the measles said Joel willing to accommodate only folks won t send em he added in an injured tone Polly s had the hardest time of all said her mother affectionately patting the bandage I think so too put in Ben if my eyes were hurt I d give up So would I said David and Joel to be in the fashion cried also I know I would while little Phronsie squeezed up to Polly s side And I too Would what Puss asked Ben tossing her up high Have good things cried the child in delight at understanding the others I would really Ben she cried gravely when they all screamed Well I hope so said Ben tossing her higher yet Don t laugh at her boys put in Polly we re all going to have good times now Phronsie now we ve got well Yes laughed the child from her high perch we aren t ever goin to be sick again ever any more she added impressively The good times were coming for Polly coming pretty near and she didn t know it All the children were in the secret for as missus Pepper declared They d have to know it and if they were let into the secret they d keep it better So they had individually and collectively been intrusted with the precious secret and charged with the extreme importance of never letting any one know and they had been nearly bursting ever since with the wild desire to impart their knowledge I m afraid I shall tell said David running to his mother at last oh mammy I don t dare stay near Polly I do want to tell so bad Oh no you won t David said his mother encouragingly when you know mother don t want you to and besides think how Polly ll look when she sees it I know cried David in the greatest rapture I wouldn t tell for all the world I guess she ll look nice don t you mother and he laughed in glee at the thought Poor child I guess she will and then missus Pepper laughed too till the little old kitchen rang with delight at the accustomed sound The children all had to play clap in and clap out in the bedroom while it came and stage coach too anything to make a noise Ben said And then after they got nicely started in the game he would be missing to help about the mysterious thing in the kitchen which was safe since Polly couldn t see him go on account of her bandage So she didn t suspect in the least And although the rest were almost dying to be out in the kitchen they conscientiously stuck to their bargain to keep Polly occupied Only Joel would open the door and peep once and then Phronsie behind him began Oh I see the sto but David swooped down on her in a twinkling and smothered the rest by tickling her Once they came very near having the whole thing pop out Whatever is that noise in the kitchen asked Polly as they all stopped to take breath after the scuffle of stage coach It sounds just like grating I ll go and see cried Joel promptly and then he flew out where his mother and Ben and two men were at work on a big black thing in the corner The old stove strange to say was nowhere to be seen Something else stood in its place a shiny black affair with a generous supply of oven doors and altogether such a comfortable home like look about it as if it would say I m going to make sunshine in this house Oh Joel cried his mother turning around on him with very black hands you haven t told No said Joel but she s hearin the noise Polly is Hush said Ben to one of the men We can t put it up without some noise the man replied but we ll be as still as we can Isn t it a big one ma asked Joel in the loudest of stage whispers that Polly on the other side of the door couldn t have failed to hear if Phronsie hadn t laughed just then Go back Joe do said Ben play tag anything he implored we ll be through in a few minutes It takes forever said Joel disappearing within the bedroom door Luckily for the secret Phronsie just then ran a pin sticking up on the arm of the old chair into her finger and Polly while comforting her forgot to question Joel And then the mother came in and though she had ill concealed hilarity in her voice she kept chattering and bustling around with Polly s supper to such an extent that there was no chance for a word to be got in Next morning it seemed as if the little brown house would turn inside out with joy Oh mammy cried Polly jumping into her arms the first thing as doctor Fisher untied the bandage my eyes are new just the same as if I d just got em Don t they look different she asked earnestly running to the cracked glass to see for herself No said Ben I hope not the same brown ones Polly Well said Polly hugging first one and then another everybody looks different through them anyway Oh cried Joel come out into the kitchen Polly it s a great deal better out there May I asked Polly who was in such a twitter looking at everything that she didn t know which way to turn Yes said the doctor smiling at her Well then sang Polly come mammy we ll go first isn t it just lovely oh MAMMY and Polly turned so very pale and looked as if she were going to tumble right over that missus Pepper grasped her arm in dismay What is it she asked pointing to the corner while all the children stood round in the greatest excitement Why cried Phronsie it s a stove don t you know Polly But Polly gave one plunge across the room and before anybody could think she was down on her knees with her arms flung right around the big black thing and laughing and crying over it all in the same breath And then they all took hold of hands and danced around it like wild little things while doctor Fisher stole out silently and missus Pepper laughed till she wiped her eyes to see them go We aren t ever goin to have any more burnt bread sang Polly all out of breath Nor your back isn t goin to break any more panted Ben with a very red face Hooray screamed Joel and David to fill any pause that might occur while Phronsie gurgled and laughed at everything just as it came along And then they all danced and capered again all but Polly who was down before the precious stove examining and exploring into ovens and everything that belonged to it Oh ma she announced coming up to missus Pepper who had been obliged to fly to her sewing again and exhibiting a very crocky face and a pair of extremely smutty hands it s most all ovens and it s just splendid I know it answered her mother delighted in the joy of her child My how black you are Polly Oh I wish cried Polly as the thought struck her that doctor Fisher could see it Where did he go to ma I guess doctor Fisher has seen it before said missus Pepper and then she began to laugh You haven t ever asked where the stove came from Polly And to be sure Polly had been so overwhelmed that if the stove had really dropped from the clouds it would have been small matter of astonishment to her as long as it had come that was the main thing Mammy said Polly turning around slowly with the stove lifter in her hand did doctor Fisher bring that stove He didn t exactly bring it answered her mother but I guess he knew something about it Oh he s the splendidest goodest man cried Polly that ever breathed Did he really get us that stove Yes said missus Pepper he would I couldn t stop him I don t know how he found out you wanted one so bad but he said it must be kept as a surprise when your eyes got well And he saved my eyes cried Polly full of gratitude I ve got a stove and two new eyes mammy just to think We ought to be good after all our mercies said missus Pepper thankfully looking around on her little group Joel was engaged in the pleasing occupation of seeing how far he could run his head into the biggest oven and then pulling it out to exhibit its blackness thus engrossing the others in a perfect hubbub I m going to bake my doctor some little cakes declared Polly when there was comparative quiet Do Polly cried Joel and then leave one or two over No said Polly we can t have any because these must be very nice Mammy can t I have some white on top just once she pleaded I don t know dubiously replied missus Pepper eggs are dreadful dear and I don t care said Polly recklessly I must just once for doctor Fisher I tell you Polly said missus Pepper what you might do you might make him some little apple tarts most every one likes them you know Well said Polly with a sigh I s pose they ll have to do but some time mammy I m going to bake him a big cake so there A THREATENED BLOW One day a few weeks after missus Pepper and Polly were busy in the kitchen Phronsie was out in the orchard as the one scraggy apple tree was called by courtesy singing her rag doll to sleep under its sheltering branches But Baby was cross and wouldn t go to sleep and Phronsie was on the point of giving up and returning to the house when a strain of music made her pause with dolly in her apron There she stood with her finger in her mouth in utter astonishment wondering where the sweet sounds came from Oh Phronsie screamed Polly from the back door where are oh here come quick it s the beau ti fullest What is it eagerly asked the little one hopping over the stubby grass leaving poor discarded Baby on its snubby nose where it dropped in her hurry Oh a monkey cried Polly do hurry the sweetest little monkey you ever saw What is a monkey asked Phronsie skurrying after Polly to the gate where her mother was waiting for them Why a monkey s a monkey explained Polly I don t know any better n that Here he is Isn t he splendid and she lifted Phronsie up to the big post where she could see finely O oh ow screamed little Phronsie see him Polly just see him A man with an organ was standing in the middle of the road playing away with all his might and at the end of a long rope was a lively little monkey in a bright red coat and a smart cocked hat The little creature pulled off his hat and with one long jump coming on the fence he made Phronsie a most magnificent bow Strange to say the child wasn t in the least frightened but put out her little fat hand speaking in gentle tones Poor little monkey come here poor little monkey Turning up his little wrinkled face and glancing fearfully at his master Jocko began to grimace and beg for something to eat The man pulled the string and struck up a merry tune and in a minute the monkey spun around and around at such a lively pace and put in so many queer antics that the little audience were fairly convulsed with laughter I can t pay you said missus Pepper wiping her eyes when at last the man pulled up the strap whistling to Jocko to jump up but I ll give you something to eat and the monkey too he shall have something for his pains in amusing my children The man looked very cross when she brought him out only brown bread and two cold potatoes Haven t you got nothin better n that It s as good as we have answered missus Pepper The man threw down the bread in the road But Jocko thankfully ate his share Polly and Phronsie busily feeding him and then he turned and snapped up the portion his master had left in the dusty road Then they moved on missus Pepper and Polly going back to their work in the kitchen A little down the road the man struck up another tune Phronsie who had started merrily to tell Baby all about it stopped a minute to hear and she didn t go back to the orchard About two hours after Polly said merrily I m going to call Phronsie in mammy she must be awfully tired and hungry by this time She sang gayly on the way I m coming Phronsie coming why where peeping under the tree Baby lay on its face disconsolately on the ground and the orchard was empty Phronsie was gone It s no use said Ben to the distracted household and such of the neighbors as the news had brought hurriedly to the scene to look any more around here but somebody must go toward Hingham he d be likely to go that way No one could tell where he would go cried Polly wringing her hands But he d change Ben if he thought folks would think he d gone there said missus Pepper We must go all roads said Ben firmly one must take the stage to Boxville and I ll take Deacon Brown s wagon on the Hingham road and somebody else must go to Toad Hollow I ll go in the stage screamed Joel who could scarcely see out of his eyes he had cried so I ll find find her I know Be spry then Joe and catch it at the corner Everybody soon knew that little Phronsie Pepper had gone off with a cross organ man and an awful monkey and in the course of an hour dozens of people were out on the hot dusty roads in search What s the matter asked a testy old gentleman in the stage of Joel who in his anxiety to see both sides of the road at once bobbed the old gentleman in the face so often as the stage lurched that at last he knocked his hat over his eyes My sister s gone off with a monkey explained Joel bobbing over to the other side as he thought he caught sight of something pink that he felt sure must be Phronsie s apron Stop stop there she is he roared and the driver who had his instructions and was fully in sympathy pulled up so suddenly that the old gentleman flew over into the opposite seat Where But when they got up to it Joel saw that it was only a bit of pink calico flapping on a clothes line so he climbed back and away they rumbled again The others were having the same luck No trace could be found of the child To Ben who took the Hingham road the minutes seemed like hours I won t go back he muttered until I take her I can t see mother s face But the ten miles were nearly traversed almost the last hope was gone Into every thicket and lurking place by the road side had he peered but no Phronsie Deacon Brown s horse began to lag Go on said Ben hoarsely oh dear Lord make me find her The hot sun poured down on the boy s face and he had no cap What cared he for that On and on he went Suddenly the horse stopped Ben doubled up the reins to give him a cut when WHOA he roared so loud that the horse in very astonishment gave a lurch that nearly flung him headlong But he was over the wheel in a twinkling and up with a bound to a small thicket of scrubby bushes on a high hill by the road side Here lay a little bundle on the ground and close by it a big black dog and over the whole standing guard was a boy a little bigger than Ben with honest gray eyes And the bundle was Phronsie Don t wake her up said the boy warningly as Ben with a hungry look in his eyes leaped up the hill she s tired to death She s my sister cried Ben our Phronsie I know it said the boy kindly but I wouldn t wake her up yet if I were you I ll tell you all about it and he took Ben s hand which was as cold as ice SAFE It s all right Prince the boy added encouragingly to the big dog who lifting his noble head had turned two big eyes steadily on Ben He s all right lie down again Then flinging himself down on the grass he told Ben how he came to rescue Phronsie Prince and I were out for a stroll said he I live over in Hingham pointing to the pretty little town just a short distance before them in the hollow that is laughing I do this summer Well we were out strolling along about a mile below here on the cross road and all of a sudden just as if they sprung right up out of the ground I saw a man with an organ and a monkey and a little girl coming along the road She was crying and as soon as Prince saw that he gave a growl and then the man saw us and he looked so mean and cringing I knew there must be something wrong and I inquired of him what he was doing with that little girl and then she looked up and begged so with her eyes and all of a sudden broke away from him and ran towards me screaming I want Polly Well the man sprang after her then I tell you here the boy forgot his caution about waking Phronsie we went for him Prince and I Prince is a noble fellow here the dog s ears twitched very perceptibly and he kept at that man oh how he bit him till he had to run for fear the monkey would get killed Was Phronsie frightened asked Ben she s never seen strangers Not a bit said the boy cheerily she just clung to me like everything I only wish she was my sister he added impulsively What were you going to do with her if I hadn t come along asked Ben Well I got out on the main road said the boy because I thought anybody who had lost her would probably come through this way but if somebody hadn t come I was going to carry her in to Hingham and the father and I d had to contrive some way to do Well said Ben as the boy finished and fastened his bright eyes on him somebody did come along and now I must get her home about as fast as I can for poor mammy and Polly Yes said the boy I ll help you lift her perhaps she won t wake up The big dog moved away a step or two but still kept his eye on Phronsie There said the boy brightly as they laid the child on the wagon seat now when you get in you can hold her head that s it he added seeing them both fixed to his satisfaction But still Ben lingered Thank you he tried to say I know laughed the boy only it s Prince instead of me and he pulled forward the big black creature who had followed faithfully down the hill to see the last of it To the front sir there We re coming to see you he continued if you will let us where do you live Do come said Ben lighting up for he was just feeling he couldn t bear to look his last on the merry honest face anybody ll tell you where missus Pepper lives Is she a Pepper asked the boy laughing and pointing to the unconscious little heap in the wagon and are you a Pepper Yes said Ben laughing too There are five of us besides mother Jolly that s something like Good bye Come on Prince Then away home to mother Phronsie never woke up or turned over once till she was put a little pink sleepy heap into her mother s arms Joel was there crying bitterly at his forlorn search The testy old gentleman in the seat opposite had relented and ordered the coach about and brought him home in an outburst of grief when all hope was gone And one after another they all had come back disheartened to the distracted mother Polly alone clung to hope Ben will bring her mammy I know God will let him she whispered But when Ben did bring her Polly for the second time in her life tumbled over with a gasp into old missus Bascom s lap Home and mother Little Phronsie slept all that night straight through The neighbors came in softly and with awestruck visages stole into the bedroom to look at the child and as they crept out again thoughts of their own little ones tugging at their hearts the tears would drop unheeded NEW FRIENDS Up the stairs of the hotel two steps at a time ran a boy with a big black dog at his heels Come on Prince soft now as they neared a door at the end of the corridors It opened into a corner room overlooking the Park as the small open space in front of the hotel was called Within the room there was sunshine and comfort it being the most luxurious one in the house which the proprietor had placed at the disposal of this most exacting guest He didn t look very happy however the gentleman who sat in an easy chair by the window a large handsome old gentleman whose whole bearing showed plainly that personal comfort had always been his and was therefore neither a matter of surprise nor thankfulness Where have you been he asked turning around to greet the boy who came in followed by Prince Oh such a long story father he cried flushed his eyes sparkling as he flung back the dark hair from his forehead You can t even guess Never mind now said the old gentleman testily your stories are always long the paper hasn t come strange indeed that one must needs be so annoyed do ring that bell again So the bell was pulled and a porter popped in his head What is it sir The paper said the old gentleman irritably hasn t it come yet No sir said the man and then he repeated taint in yet please sir Very well you said so once that s all waving his hand then as the door closed he said to his son That pays one for coming to such an out of the way country place as this away from papers I never will do it again As the old gentleman against the advice of many friends who knew his dependence on externals had determined to come to this very place the boy was not much startled at the decisive words He stood very quietly however until his father finished Then he said It s too bad father supposing I tell you my story Perhaps you ll enjoy hearing it while you wait it s really quite newspaperish Well you might as well tell it now I suppose said the old gentleman but it is a great shame about that paper to advertise that morning papers are to be obtained it s a swindle Jasper a complete swindle and the old gentleman looked so very irate that the boy exerted himself to soothe him I know he said but they can t help the trains being late They shouldn t have the trains late said his father unreasonably There s no necessity for all this prating about trains late I m convinced it s because they forgot to send down for the papers till they were all sold I don t believe that s it father said the boy trying to change the subject but you don t know how splendid Prince has been nor And then such a breakfast continued the old gentleman My liver certainly will be in a dreadful state if these things continue And he got up and going to the corner of the room opened his medicine chest and taking a box of pills therefrom he swallowed two which done he came back with a somewhat easier expression to his favorite chair He was just splendid father began the boy he went for him I tell you I hope Jasper your dog has not been doing anything violent said the old gentleman I must caution you he ll get you into trouble some day and then there ll be a heavy bill to pay he grows more irritable every day Irritable cried the boy flinging his arms around the dog s neck who was looking up at the old gentleman in high disdain He s done the most splendid thing you ever saw Why he saved a little girl father from a cross old organ man and he drove that man oh you ought to have seen him run And now that it was over Jasper put back his head and laughed long and loud as he remembered the rapid transit of the musical pair Well how do you know she wasn t the man s daughter asked his father determined to find fault someway You haven t any business to go around the country setting your dog on people I shall have an awful bill to pay some day Jasper an awful bill he continued getting up and commencing to pace up and down the floor in extreme irritation Father cried the boy half laughing half vexed springing to his side and keeping step with him we found her brother he came along when we were by the side of the road We couldn t go any further for the poor little thing was all tired out And don t you think they live over in Badgertown and Well said the old gentleman pausing in his walk and taking out his watch to wonder if that paper would ever come she had probably followed the organ man so it served her right after all Well but father and the boy s dark eyes glowed she was such a cunning little thing she wasn t more than four years old and she had such a pretty little yellow head and she said so funny I want Polly Did she said the old gentleman getting interested in spite of himself what then Why then sir said Jasper delighted at his success in diverting his thoughts Prince and I waited and waited and I was just going to bring her here to ask you what we should do when Dear me said the old gentleman instinctively starting back as if he actually saw the forlorn little damsel you needn t ever bring such people here Jasper I don t know what to do with them I m sure Well said the boy laughing we didn t have to did we Prince stroking the big head of the dog who was slowly following the two as they paced up and down but keeping carefully on the side of his master for just as we really didn t know what to do don t you think there was a big wagon came along drawn by the ricketiest old horse and a boy in the wagon looking both sides of the road and into every bush just as wild as he could be and before I could think hardly he spied us and if he didn t jump I thought he d broken his leg And I suppose he just abused you for what you had done observed the old gentleman petulantly that s about all the gratitude there is in this world He didn t seem to see me at all said the boy I thought he d eat the little girl up Ought to have looked out for her better then grumbled the old gentleman determined to find fault with somebody And he s a splendid fellow I just know cried Jasper waxing enthusiastic and his name is Pepper Pepper repeated his father no nice family ever had the name of Pepper Well I don t care and Jasper s laugh was loud and merry he s nice anyway I know and the little thing s nice and I m going to see them can t I father Dear me said his father how can you Jasper You do have the strangest tastes I ever saw It s dreadful dull here pleaded the boy touching the right string you know that yourself father and I don t know any boys around here and Prince and I are so lonely on our walks do permit me father The old gentleman who really cared very little about it turned away muttering Well I m sure I don t care go where you like when a knock was heard at the door and the paper was handed in which broke up the conversation and restored good humor The next day but one Ben was out by the wood pile trying to break up some kindlings for Polly who was washing up the dishes and otherwise preparing for the delights of baking day Hulloa said a voice bethought he knew He turned around to see the merry faced boy and the big black dog who immediately began to wag his tail as if willing to recognize him You see I thought you d never look round said the boy with a laugh How s the little girl Oh you have come really cried Ben springing over the wood pile with a beaming face Polly But Polly was already by the door with dish cloth in hand This is my sister Polly began Ben and then stopped not knowing the boy s name I m Jasper King said the boy stepping upon the flat stone by Polly s side and taking off his cap he put out his hand And this is Prince he added Polly put her hand in his and received a hearty shake and then she sprang over the big stove dish cloth and all and just flung her arms around the dog s neck Oh you splendid fellow you said she Don t you know we all think you re as good as gold The dog submitted to the astonishing proceeding as if he liked it while Jasper delighted with Polly s appreciation beamed down on them and struck up friendship with her on the instant Now I must call Phronsie said Polly getting up her face as red as a rose Is her name Phronsie asked the boy with interest No it s Sophronia said Polly but we call her Phronsie What a very funny name said Jasper Sophronia is for such a little thing and yours is Polly is it not he asked turning around suddenly on her Yes said Polly no not truly Polly it s Mary my real name is but I ve always been Polly I like Polly best too declared Jasper it sounds so nice And his name is Ben said Polly Ebenezer you mean said Ben correcting her Well we call him Ben said Polly it don t ever seem as if there was any Ebenezer about it I should think not laughed Jasper Well I must get Phronsie again said Polly running back into the bedroom where that small damsel was busily engaged in washing Baby in the basin of water that she had with extreme difficulty succeeded in getting down on the floor She had then by means of a handful of soft soap taken from Polly s soap bowl during the dish washing and a bit of old cotton plastered both herself and Baby to a comfortable degree of stickiness Phronsie said Polly dear me what you doing the big dog s out there you know that scared the naughty organ man and the boy but before the words were half out Phronsie had slipped from under her hands and to Polly s extreme dismay clattered out into the kitchen Here she is cried Jasper meeting her at the door The little soapy hands were grasped and kissing her Ugh he said as the soft soap plentifully spread on her face met his mouth Oh Phronsie you shouldn t cried Polly and then they all burst out into a peal of laughter at Jasper s funny grimaces She s been washing Baby explained Polly wiping her eyes and looking at Phronsie who was hanging over Prince in extreme affection Evidently Prince still regarded her as his especial property Have you got a baby asked Jasper I thought she was the baby pointing to Phronsie Oh I mean her littlest dolly she always calls her Baby said Polly Come Phronsie and have your face washed and a clean apron on When Phronsie could be fairly persuaded that Prince would not run away during her absence she allowed herself to be taken off and soon re appeared her own dainty little self Ben in the meantime had been initiating Jasper into the mysteries of cutting the wood the tool house and all the surroundings of the little brown house They had received a re inforcement in the advent of Joel and David who stared delightedly at Phronsie s protector made friends with the dog and altogether had had such a thoroughly good time that Phronsie coming back clapped her hands in glee to hear them I wish mammy was home said Polly polishing up the last cup carefully Let me put it up said Jasper taking it from her it goes up here don t it with the rest reaching up to the upper shelf of the old cupboard Yes said Polly Oh I should think you d have real good times said the boy enviously I haven t a single sister or brother Haven t you said Polly looking at him in extreme pity Yes we do have real fun she added answering his questioning look the house is just brimful sometimes even if we are poor We aren t poor said Joel who never could bear to be pitied Then with a very proud air he said in a grand way At any rate we aren t going to be long for something s coming What do you mean Joey asked Ben while the rest looked equally amazed Our ships said Joel confidently as if they were right before their eyes at which they all screamed See Polly s stove cried Phronsie wishing to entertain in her turn Here tis running up to it and pointing with her fat little finger Yes I see cried Jasper pretending to be greatly surprised it s new isn t it Yes said the child it s very all new four yesterdays ago And then Polly stopped in sweeping up and related with many additions and explanations from the others the history of the stove and good doctor Fisher upon whom they all dilated at great length and the dreadful measles and everything And Jasper sympathized and rejoiced with them to their hearts content and altogether got so very home like that they all felt as if they had known him for a year Ben neglected his work a little but then visitors didn t come every day to the Peppers so while Polly worked away at her bread which she was going to make like biscuits she said the audience gathered in the little old kitchen was in the merriest mood and enjoyed everything to the fullest extent Do put in another stick Bensie dear said Polly this bread won t be fit for anything Isn t this fun though cried Jasper running up to try the oven I wish I could ever bake and he looked longingly at the little brown biscuits waiting their turn out on the table You come out some day said Polly sociably and we ll all try baking mammy d like to have you I know feeling sure that nothing would be too much for missus Pepper to do for the protector of little Phronsie I will cried Jasper perfectly delighted You can t think how awfully dull it is out in Hingham Don t you live there asked Polly with a gasp almost dropping a tin full of little brown lumps of dough she was carrying to the oven Live there cried Jasper and then he burst out into a merry laugh No indeed I hope not Why we re only spending the summer there father and I in the hotel Where s your mother asked Joel squeezing in between Jasper and his audience And then they all felt instinctively that a very wrong question had been asked I haven t any mother said the boy in a low voice They all stood quite still for a moment then Polly said I wish you d come out sometime and you may bake or anything else she added and there was a kinder ring to her voice than ever No mother Polly for her life couldn t imagine how anybody could feel without a mother but the very words alone smote her heart and there was nothing she wouldn t have done to give pleasure to one who had done so much for them I wish you could see our mother she said gently Why here she comes now oh mamsie dear she cried Do Joe run and take her bundle missus Pepper stopped a minute to kiss Phronsie her baby was dearer than ever to her now Then her eye fell on Jasper who stood respectfully waiting and watching her with great interest Is this she asked taking it all in at the first glance the boy with the honest eyes as Ben had described him and the big black dog is this the boy who saved my little girl Oh ma am cried Jasper I didn t do much twas Prince I guess you never ll know how much you did do said missus Pepper Then looking with a long keen gaze into the boy s eyes that met her own so frankly and kindly I ll trust him she said to herself a boy with those eyes can t help but be good Her eyes are just the same as Polly s thought Jasper just such laughing ones only Polly s are brown and he liked her on the spot And then somehow the hubbub ceased Polly went on with her work and the others separated and missus Pepper and Jasper had a long talk When the mother s eyes fell on Phronsie playing around on the floor she gave the boy a grateful smile that he thought was beautiful Well I declare said Jasper at last looking up at the old clock in the corner by the side of the cupboard I m afraid I ll miss the stage and then father never ll let me come again Come Prince Oh don t go cried Phronsie wailing Let doggie stay Oh make him stay mammy I can t Phronsie said missus Pepper smiling if he thinks he ought to go I ll come again said Jasper eagerly if I may ma am He looked up at missus Pepper as he stood cap in hand waiting for the answer I m sure we should be glad if your father ll be willing she added thinking proudly My children are an honor to anybody I m sure as she glanced around on the bright little group she could call her own But be sure Jasper and she laid her hand on his arm as she looked down into his eyes that you father is willing that s all Oh yes ma am said the boy but he will be I guess if he feels well Then come on Thursday said Polly and can t we bake something then mammy I m sure I don t care laughed missus Pepper but you won t find much but brown flour and meal to bake with Well we can pretend said Polly and we can cut the cakes with the heart shape and they ll do for anything Oh I ll come laughed Jasper ready for such lovely fun in the old kitchen look out for me on Thursday Ben So Jasper and Prince took their leave all the children accompanying them to the gate and then after seeing him fairly started on a smart run to catch the stage Prince scampering at his heels they all began to sing his praises and to wish for Thursday to come But Jasper didn t come Thursday came and went a beautiful bright sunny day but with no signs of the merry boy whom all had begun to love nor of the big black dog The children had made all the needful preparations with much ostentation and bustle and were in a state of excited happiness ready for any gale But the last hope had to be given up as the old clock ticked away hour after hour And at last Polly had to put Phronsie to bed who wouldn t stop crying enough to eat her supper at the dreadful disappointment He couldn t come I know said both Ben and Polly standing staunchly up for their new friend but Joel and David felt that he had broken his word He promised said Joel vindictively I don t believe his father d let him said Polly wiping away a sly tear I know Jasper d come if he could missus Pepper wisely kept her own counsel simply giving them a kindly caution Don t you go to judging him children till you know Well he promised said Joel as a settler Aren t you ashamed Joel said his mother to talk about any one whose back is turned Wait till he tells you the reason himself Joel hung his head and then began to tease David in the corner to make up for his disappointment The next morning Ben had to go to the store after some more meal As he was going out rather dismally the storekeeper who was also postmaster called out Oh halloa there What is it asked Ben turning back thinking perhaps mister Atkins hadn t given him the right change Here said mister Atkins stepping up to the Post office department quite smart with its array of boxes and official notices where Ben had always lingered wishing there might be sometime a letter for him or some of them You ve got a sister Polly haven t you Yes said Ben wondering what was coming next Well she s got a letter said the postmaster holding up a nice big envelope looking just like those that Ben had so many times wished for That magic piece of white paper danced before the boy s eyes for a minute then he said It can t be for her mister Atkins why she s never had one Well she s got one now sure enough said mister Atkins here tis plain enough and he read what he had no need to study much as it had already passed examination by his own and his wife s faithful eyes Miss Polly Pepper near the Turnpike Badgertown that s her isn t it he added laying it down before Ben s eyes Must be a first time for everything you know my boy and he laughed long over his own joke so take it and run along home For Ben still stood looking at it and not offering to stir If you say so said the boy as if mister Atkins had given him something out of his own pocket but I m afraid tisn t for Polly Then buttoning up the precious letter in his jacket he spun along home as never before Polly Polly he screamed Where is she mother I don t know said missus Pepper coming out of the bedroom Dear me is anybody hurt Ben I don t know said Ben in a state to believe anything but Polly s got a letter Polly got a letter cried missus Pepper what do you mean Ben I don t know repeated the boy still holding out the precious letter but mister Atkins gave it to me where is Polly I know where she is said Joel she s up stairs And he flew out in a twinkling and just as soon reappeared with Polly scampering after him in the wildest excitement And then the kitchen was in an uproar as the precious missive was put into Polly s hand and they all gathered around her wondering and examining till Ben thought he would go wild with the delay I wonder where it did come from said Polly in the greatest anxiety examining again the address Where does the postmark say asked missus Pepper looking over her shoulder It s all rubbed out said Polly peering at it you can t see anything Do open it said Ben and then you ll find out But p raps tisn t for me said Polly timidly Well mister Atkins says tis said Ben impatiently here I ll open it for you Polly No let her open it for herself Ben protested his mother But she won t said Ben do tear it open Polly No I m goin to get a knife she said I ll get one cried Joel running up to the table drawer here s one Polly Oh dear groaned Ben you never ll get it open at this rate But at last it was cut and they all holding their breath gazed awe struck while Polly drew out the mysterious missive What does it say gasped missus Pepper Dear Miss Polly began both Ben and Polly in a breath Let Polly read said Joel who couldn t hear in the confusion Well go on Polly said Ben hurry Dear Miss Polly I was so sorry I couldn t come on Thursday Oh it s Jasper it s Jasper cried all the children in a breath I told you so cried Ben and Polly perfectly delighted to find their friend vindicated fully there Joey Pepper Well I don t care cried Joe nothing daunted he didn t come anyway do go on Polly I was so sorry I couldn t come began Polly You read that said Joel I know it said Polly but it s just lovely on Thursday but my father was sick and I couldn t leave him If you don t mind I ll come again I mean I ll come some other day if it s just as convenient for you for I do so want the baking and the nice time I forgot to say that I had a cold to here Jasper had evidently had a struggle in his mind whether there should be two o s or one and he had at last decided it by crossing out one but my father is willing I should come when I get well Give my love to all and especially remember me respectfully to your mother Your friend JASPER ELYOT KING Oh lovely lovely cried Polly flying around with the letter in her hand so he is coming Ben was just as wild as she was for no one knew but Polly just how the new friend had stepped into his heart Phronsie went to sleep happy hugging Baby And don t you think Baby dear she whispered sleepily and Polly heard her say as she was tucking her in that Jasper is really comin really and the big be you ti ful doggie too PHRONSIE PAYS A DEBT OF GRATITUDE And now I tell you said Polly the next day let s make Jasper something can t we ma Oh do do cried all the other children let s but what ll it be Polly I don t know about this interrupted missus Pepper I don t see how you could get anything to him if you could make it Oh we could mamsie said Polly eagerly running up to her for Ben knows and he says we can do it Oh well if Ben and you have had your heads together I suppose it s all right laughed missus Pepper but I don t see how you can do it Well we can mother truly put in Ben I ll tell you how and you ll say it ll be splendid You see Deacon Blodgett s goin over to Hingham to morrow I heard him tell Miss Blodgett so and he goes right past the hotel and we can do it up real nice and it ll please Jasper so do mammy And it s real dull there Jasper says put in Polly persuasively and just think mammy no brothers and sisters And Polly looked around on the others After that there was no need to say anything more her mother would have consented to almost any plan then Well go on children she said you may do it I don t see but what you can get em there well enough but I m sure I don t know what you can make Can t we said Polly and she knelt down by her mother s side and put her face in between the sewing in missus Pepper s lap and the eyes bent kindly down on her make some little cakes real cakes I mean now don t say no mammy she said alarmed for she saw a no slowly coming in the eyes above her as missus Pepper began to shake her head But we haven t any white flour Polly began her mother I know said Polly but we ll make em of brown it ll do if you ll give us some raisins you know there s some in the bowl mammy I was saving them for a nest egg said missus Pepper meaning at some future time to indulge in another plum pudding that the children so loved Well do give em to us cried Polly do ma I want em for a plum pudding sometime said missus Pepper Ow and Joel with a howl sprung up from the floor where he had been trying to make a cart for Baby out of an old box and joined missus Pepper and Polly No don t give em away ma he screamed let s have our plum pudding now Polly Pepper you re a goin to bake up all our raisins in nasty little cakes and Joey commanded missus Pepper hush what word did you say Well blubbered Joel wiping his tears away with his grimy little hand Polly s a goin to give I should rather you d never have a plum pudding than to say such words said missus Pepper sternly taking up her work again And besides do you think what Jasper has done for you and her face grew very white around the lips Well he can have plum puddings said Joel whimpering forever an ever if he wants them and and Well Joey said Polly there don t feel bad and she put her arms around him and tried to wipe away the tears that still rolled down his cheeks We won t give em if you don t want us to but Jasper s sick and there isn t anything for him to do and here she whispered slyly up into his ear don t you remember how you liked folks to send you things when you had the measles Yes I know said Joel beginning to smile through his tears wasn t it fun Polly I guess twas laughed Polly back again pleased at the return of sunshine Well Jasper ll be just as pleased as you were cause we love him and want to do somethin for him he was so good to Phronsie I will Polly I will cried Joel completely won over do let s make em for him and put em in thick oh thick as you can and determined to do nothing by halves Joel ran generously for the precious howl of raisins and after setting it on the table began to help Polly in all needful preparations missus Pepper smiled away to herself to see happiness restored to the little group And soon a pleasant hum and bustle went on around the baking table the centre of attraction Now said Phronsie coming up to the table and standing on tip toe to see Polly measure out the flour I m a goin to bake something for my sick man I am Oh no Phronsie you can t began Polly Hey asked Joel with a daub of flour on the tip of his chubby nose gained by too much peering into Polly s flour bag What did she say Polly watching her shake the clouds of flour in the sieve She said she was goin to bake something for Jasper said Polly There as she whisked in the flour now that s done No I didn t say Jasper said Phronsie I didn t say Jasper she repeated emphatically Why what did you say Pet asked Polly astonished while little Davie repeated What did you say Phronsie I said my sick man said Phronsie shaking her yellow head poor sick man Who does she mean said Polly in despair stopping a moment her violent stirring that threatened to overturn the whole cake bowl I guess she means Prince said Joel Can t I stir Polly Oh no said Polly only one person must stir cake Why asked Joel why Polly Oh I don t know said Polly cause tis so never mind now Joel Do you mean Prince Phronsie No I don t mean Princey said the child decisively I mean my sick man It s Jasper s father I guess she means said missus Pepper over in the corner but what in the world Yes yes cried Phronsie perfectly delighted at being at last understood and hopping on one toe my sick man I shall give up said Polly tumbling over in a chair with the cake spoon in her hand from which a small sticky lump fell on her apron which Joel immediately pounced upon and devoured What do you want to bake Phronsie she gasped holding the spoon sticking up straight and staring at the child A gingerbread boy said the child promptly he d like that best poor sick man and she commenced to climb up to active preparations A LETTER TO JASPER Mamsie what shall we do implored Polly of her mother I don t know said her mother however did that get into her head do you suppose I am sure I can t tell said Polly jumping up and beginning to stir briskly to make up for lost time P r aps she heard us talking about Jasper s having to take care of his sick father and how hard it must be to be sick away from home Yes said Phronsie but he ll be glad to see my gingerbread boy I guess poor sick man Oh Phronsie cried Polly in great distress you aren t ever going to make a gingerbread boy to day see we ll put in a cunning little cake for mister King full of raisins Phronsie won t that be lovely and Polly began to fill a little scalloped tin with some of the cake mixture N no said the child eying it suspiciously that isn t like a gingerbread boy Polly he ll like that best Mamsie said Polly we can t let her make a dreadful horrid gingerbread boy to send mister King he never ll let Jasper come here again Oh let her cried Joel she can bake it and Dave an I ll eat it and he picked up a raisin that had fallen under the table and began crunching it with great gusto That wouldn t be fair said Polly gloomily Do get her off from it mammy Phronsie said missus Pepper going up back of the child who sat patiently in her high chair waiting for Polly to let her begin hadn t you rather wait and give your gingerbread boy to Jasper for his father when he comes Oh no no cried Phronsie twisting in her chair in great apprehension I want to send it now I do Well Polly said her mother laughing after all it s best I think to let her it can t do any harm anyway and instead of mister King s not letting Jasper come if he s a sensible man that won t make any difference and if he isn t why then there d be sure to something come up sometime to make trouble Well said Polly I suppose she s got to and perhaps as a consoling idea struck her perhaps she ll want to eat it up herself when it s done Here Phronsie giving her a handful of the cake mixture which she stiffened with flour to the right thickness there you can call that a gingerbread boy see won t it make a beautiful one You needn t think said missus Pepper seeing Phronsie s delighted face and laughing as she went back to her work but what that gingerbread boy ll go When the little cakes were done eight of them and set upon the table for exhibition they one and all protested that they never saw so fine a lot Polly was delighted with the praise they received and her mother s commendation that she was growing a better cook every day How glad Jasper ll be won t he mamsie said she The children walked around and around the table admiring and pointing out the chief points of attraction as they appeared before their discriminating eyes I should choose that one said Joel pointing at one which was particularly plummy with a raisin standing up on one end with a festive air as if to say there s lots of us inside you better believe I wouldn t said Davie I d have that that s cracked so pretty So tis said missus Pepper they re all as light as a feather Polly But my gingerbread boy cried Phronsie running eagerly along with a particularly ugly looking specimen of a cake figure in her hand is the be yew tifullest isn t it Polly Oh dear groaned Polly it looks just awfully don t it Ben Hoh hoh laughed Joel in derision his leg is crooked see Phronsie you better let Davie an me have it No no screamed the child in terror that s my sick man s gingerbread boy it is Joe put it down said Ben Yes Phronsie you shall have it there it s all safe and he put it carefully into Phronsie s apron when she breathed easier And he hasn t but one eye still laughed Joel while little Davie giggled too He did have two said Polly but she punched the other in with her thumb don t boys she said aside you ll make her feel bad do stop laughing Now how ll we send the things Put em in a basket said Ben that s nicest But we haven t got any basket said Polly except the potato basket and they d be lost in that Can t we take your work basket mamsie asked Ben they d look so nice in that Oh said missus Pepper that wouldn t do I couldn t spare it and besides it s all broken at the side Ben that don t look nice Oh dear said Polly sitting down on one of the hard wooden chairs to think I do wish we had things nice to send to sick people And her forehead puckered up in a little hard knot We ll have to do em up in a paper Polly said Ben there isn t any other way they ll look nice in anything cause they are nice he added comfortingly If we only had some flowers said Polly that would set em off You re always a thinkin of flowers Polly said Ben I guess the cakes ll have to go without em I suppose they will said Polly stifling a little sigh Where s the paper I ve got a nice piece up stairs said Ben just right I ll get it Put my gingerbread boy on top cried Phronsie handing him up So Polly packed the little cakes neatly in two rows and laid the gingerbread boy in a fascinating attitude across the top He looks as if he d been struck by lightning said Ben viewing him critically as he came in the door with the paper Be still said Polly trying not to laugh that s because he baked so funny it made his feet stick out Children said missus Pepper how ll Jasper know where the cakes come from Why he ll know it s us said Polly of course cause it ll make him think of the baking we re going to have when he gets well Well but you don t say so said missus Pepper smiling tisn t polite to send it this way Whatever ll we do mammy said all four children in dismay while Phronsie simply stared Can t we send em at all Why yes said their mother I hope so I m sure after you ve got em baked but you might answer Jasper s letter I should think and tell him about em and the gingerbread boy Oh dear said Polly ready to fly I couldn t mamsie I never wrote a letter Well you never had one before did you said her mother composedly biting her thread Never say you can t Polly cause you don t know what you can do till you ve tried You write Ben said Polly imploringly No said Ben I think the nicest way is for all to say somethin then twon t be hard for any of us Where s the paper queried Polly coming from I wonder Joel said missus Pepper run to the bureau in the bedroom and open the top drawer and get a green box there So Joel quite important at the errand departed and presently put the designated box into his mother s hand There now I m going to give you this and she took out a small sheet of paper slightly yellowed by age but being gilt edged it looked very magnificent to the five pairs of eyes directed to it Now Ben you get the ink bottle and the pen and then go to work So Ben reached down from the upper shelf in the cupboard the ink bottle and a pen in a black wooden penholder Oh mamsie cried Polly that s where Phronsie bit it off when she was a baby isn t it holding up the stubby end where the little ball had disappeared Yes said missus Pepper and now you re going to write about her gingerbread boy with it well time goes to be sure And she bent over her work again harder than ever Poor woman if she could only scrape together enough money to get her children into school that was the earnest wish of her heart She must do it soon for Ben was twelve years old but with all her strivings and scrimpings she could only manage to put bread into their mouths and live from day to day I know I ought to be thankful for that she said to herself not taking time even to cry over her troubles But oh the learning they must have that Now said Polly how ll we do it Ben as they ranged themselves around the table on which reposed the cakes you begin How do folks begin a letter asked Ben in despair of his mother How did Jasper begin his asked missus Pepper back again Oh cried Polly running into the bedroom to get the precious missive Dear Miss Polly that s what it says Well said missus Pepper then you d better say Dear Mister Jasper or you might say Dear mister King Oh dear cried Polly that would be the father then s pose he should think we wrote to him and Polly looked horror stricken to the last degree There there tis said Ben Dear Mister Jasper now what ll we say Why say about the cakes replied Polly And the gingerbread boy cried Phronsie Oh tell about him Polly do Yes yes Phronsie said Polly we will why tell him how we wish he could have come and that we baked him some cakes and that we do so want him to come just as soon as he can All right said Ben so he went to work laboriously only his hard breathing showing what a hard task it was as the stiff old pen scratched up and down the paper There that s done he cried at length in great satisfaction holding it up for inspection Oh I do wish cried Polly in intense admiration I could write so nice and so fast as you can Ben Read it Polly said missus Pepper in pride So Polly began Dear Mister Jasper we were all dreadfully sorry that you didn t come and so we baked you some cakes You didn t say anything about his being sick Ben I forgot it said Ben but I put it in farther down you ll see if you read on Baked you some cakes that is Polly did for this is Ben that s writing You needn t said that Ben said Polly dissatisfied we all baked em I m sure And just as soon as you get well we do want you to come over and have the baking We re real sorry you re sick boneset s good for colds Oh Ben said missus Pepper I guess his father knows what to give him And oh the bitter stuff cried Polly with a wry face Well it s hard work to write said Ben yawning I d rather chop wood I wish knew how exclaimed Joel longingly Just you try every day Ben ll teach you Joe said his mother eagerly and then I ll let you write I will cried Joe then Dave you ll see how I ll write I tell you And I m goin to ma can t I said Davie unwilling to be outdone Yes you may be sure said missus Pepper delighted that ll make a man of you fast Oh boys said Polly lifting a very red face you joggle the table so I can t do anything I wasn t jogglin said Joel the old thing tipped Look he whispered to Davie see Polly she s writing crooked So while the others hung around her and looked over her shoulder while they made their various comments Polly finished her part and also held it up for inspection Let us see said Ben taking it up It s after boneset s good for colds said Polly puckering up her face again at the thought We most of us knew you were sick I m Polly now because you didn t come and we liked your letter telling us so Oh Polly we weren t glad to hear he was sick cried Ben in horror I didn t say so cried Polly starting up Why Ben Pepper I never said so and she looked ready to cry It sounds something like it don t it mammy said Ben unwilling to give her pain but appealing to missus Pepper Polly didn t mean it said her mother consolingly but if I were you I d say something to explain it I can t put anything in now said poor Polly there isn t any room nor any more paper either what shall I do I told you Ben I couldn t write And Polly looked helplessly from one to the other for comfort Yes you can said Ben there now I ll show you write it fine Polly you write so big little bits of letters like these So Polly took the pen again with a sigh Now he won t think so I guess she said much relieved as Ben began to read again I ll begin yours again Ben said We most of us knew you were sick because you didn t come and we liked your letter telling us so because we d all felt so badly and Phronsie cried herself to sleep that s good I m sure The gingerbread boy is for your father please excuse it but Phronsie would make it for him because he is sick There isn t any more to write and besides I can t write good and Ben s tired From all of us Why how s he to know cried Ben That won t do to sign it Well let s say from Ben and Polly then said Polly only all the others want to be in the letter Well they can t write said Ben We might sign their names for em suggested Polly Here s mine said Ben putting under the From all of us a big bold Ben And here s mine echoed Polly setting a slightly crooked Polly by its side Now Joe you better let Ben hold your hand said Polly warningly But Joel declaring he could write had already begun so there was no hope for it and a big drop of ink falling from the pen he spattered the J so that no one could tell what it was The children looked at each other in despair Can we ever get it out mammy said Polly running to missus Pepper with it I don t know said her mother How could you try it Joe I didn t mean to said Joel looking very downcast and ashamed The ugly old pen did it Well said Polly it s got to go we can t help it But she looked so sorrowful over it that half the pleasure was gone for Ben for Polly wanted everything just right and was very particular about things Now Dave Ben held his hand and David went down next to Joel But when it was Phronsie s turn she protested that Polly and no one else must hold her hand It s a dreadful hard name to write Phronsie is said Polly as she guided Phronsie s fat little hand that clung faithfully to the stubby old pen There it s over now she cried and I m thankful I wouldn t write another for anything Read it all over now Ben cried missus Pepper and don t speak children till he gets through Don t it sound elegant said Polly clasping her hands when he had finished I didn t think we ever could do it so nice did you Ben No indeed I didn t replied Ben in a highly ecstatic frame of mind Now oh what ll we do for an envelope he asked in dismay You ll have to do without that said missus Pepper for there isn t any in the house but see here children she added as she saw the sorry faces before her you just fold up the letter and put it inside the parcel that ll be just as good Oh dear said Polly but it would have been splendid the other way mammy just like other folks You must make believe this is like other folks said missus Pepper cheerily when you can t do any other way Yes said Ben that s so Polly tie em up quick s you can and I ll take em over to Deacon Blodgett s for he s goin to start early in the morning So after another last look all around Polly put the cakes in the paper and tied it with four or five strong knots to avoid all danger of its undoing He never ll untie it Polly said Ben that s just like a girl s knots Why didn t you tie it then said Polly I m sure it s as good as a boy s knots and they always muss up a parcel so And she gave a loving approving little pat to the top of the package which despite its multitude of knots was certainly very neat indeed Ben grasping the pen again here goes for the direction Deary yes said Polly I forgot all about that I thought twas done How d you s pose he d get it asked Ben coolly beginning the M I don t know replied Polly looking over his shoulder s pose anybody else had eaten em up Ben And she turned pale at the very thought There said Ben at last after a good many flourishes now tis done you can t think of another thing to do to it Polly Mamsie see cried Polly running with it to missus Pepper isn t that fine mister Jasper E King at the Hotel Hingham Yes said missus Pepper admiringly to the content of all the children I should think it was Let me take it in my hand screamed Joel reaching eagerly up for the tempting brown parcel Be careful then Joe said Polly with an important air So Joel took a comfortable feel and then Davie must have the same privilege At last it was off and with intense satisfaction the children watched Ben disappear with it down the long hill to Deacon Blodgett s The next day Ben came running in from his work at the deacon s Oh Polly you had em he screamed all out of breath You had em Had what asked Polly in astonishment Oh Bensie what do you mean Your flowers he panted You sent some flowers to Jasper Flowers to Jasper repeated Polly afraid Ben had gone out of his wits Yes said Ben I ll begin at the beginning You see Polly when I went down this morning Betsey was to set me to work Deacon Blodgett and missus Blodgett had started early you know and while I was a cleanin up the woodshed as she told me all of a sudden she said as she stood in the door looking on Oh Ben Mis Blodgett took some posies along with your parcel What said I I didn t know as I d heard straight Posies I said says Betsey beautiful ones they were too the best in the garding I heard her tell mister Blodgett it would be a pity if that sick boy couldn t have some flowers and she knew the Pepper children were crazy about em so she twisted em in the string around the parcel and there they stood up and looked fine I tell you as they drove away So Polly Bensie Pepper cried Polly taking hold of his jacket and spinning him round I told you so I told you so I know you did said Ben as she gave him a parting whirl an I wish you d say so about other things Polly if you can get em so easy JOLLY DAYS Oh Ben cried Jasper overtaking him by a smart run as he was turning in at the little brown gate one morning three days after do wait Halloa cried Ben turning around and setting down his load a bag of salt and a basket of potatoes and viewing Jasper and Prince with great satisfaction Yes here I am said Jasper And how I ve run that fellow on the stage was awful slow in getting here oh you re so good he said and his eyes brimful of gladness beamed on Ben The cakes were just prime and twas great fun to get your letter Did you like it asked Ben the color up all over his brown face Like it cried Jasper Why twas just splendid and the cakes were royal Isn t Polly smart though to bake like that he added admiringly I guess she is said Ben drawing himself up to his very tallest dimensions She knows how to do everything Jasper King I should think she did responded the boy quickly I wish she was my sister he finished longingly Well I don t quickly replied Ben for then she wouldn t be mine and I couldn t think of being without Polly Was your father angry about about the gingerbread boy he asked timidly trembling for an answer Oh dear cried Jasper tumbling over on the grass don t don t I shan t be good for anything if you make me laugh oh wasn t it funny and he rolled over and over shaking with glee Yes said Ben immensely relieved to find that no offence had been taken But she would send it Polly tried not to have her and she most cried when Phronsie was so determined cause she said your father never d let you come again Twas just lovely in Phronsie said the boy sitting up and wiping his eyes but oh it was so funny you ought to have seen my father Ben Pepper Oh then he was angry cried Ben No indeed he wasn t said Jasper don t you think it do you know it did him lots of good for he d been feeling real badly that morning he hadn t eaten any breakfast and when he saw that gingerbread boy here Jasper rolled over again with a peal of laughter and heard the message he just put back his head and he laughed why I never heard him laugh as he did then the room shook all over and he ate a big dinner and all that afternoon he felt as good as could be But he says he s coming to see the little girl that baked it for him before we go home Ben nearly tumbled over by the side of Jasper at these words Coming to see us he gasped Yes said Jasper who had scarcely got over his own astonishment about it for if the roof had suddenly whisked off on to the church steeple he couldn t have been more amazed than when he heard his father say cheerily Well Jasper my boy I guess I shall have to drive over and see your little girl since she s been polite enough to bake me this pointing to the wild looking gingerbread boy Come in and tell em about it cried Ben radiantly picking up his potatoes and salt It s all right Polly he said in a jubilant voice for here s Jasper and he ll tell you so himself Hush said Jasper warningly don t let Phronsie hear well here s my pet now and after bobbing lovingly to the others with eyes beaming over with fun he caught up the little girl who was screaming Oh here s Jasper and my beyew ti ful doggie Now Phronsie he cried give me a kiss you haven t any soft soap to day have you no that s a good nice one now your gingerbread boy was just splendid Did he eat it asked the child in grave delight Well no he hasn t eaten it yet said Jasper smiling on the others he s keeping it to look at Phronsie I should think so groaned Polly Never mind Polly Ben whispered Jasper s been a tellin me about it his father liked it he did truly Oh said Polly I m so glad He had eyes said Phronsie going back to the charms of the gingerbread boy I know it said Jasper admiringly so he did Rather deep sunk one of em was muttered Ben And I ll bake you one Jasper said the child as he put her down I will very truly some day Will you smiled Jasper well then and there was a whispered conference with Phronsie that somehow sent that damsel into a blissful state of delight And then while Phronsie monopolized Prince Jasper told them all about the reception of the parcel how very dull and forlorn he was feeling that morning Prince and he shut up in doors and how his father had had a miserable night and had eaten scarcely no breakfast and just at this juncture there came a knock at the door and said Jasper your parcel walked in all dressed up in flowers They weren t our flowers said Polly honestly missus Blodgett put em on Well she couldn t have if you hadn t sent the parcel said Jasper in a tone of conviction Then he launched out into a description of how they opened the package Prince looking on and begging for one of the cakes Oh didn t you give him one cried Polly at this Good old Prince Yes I did said Jasper the biggest one of all The one I guess interrupted Joel with the big raisin on top Polly spoke up quickly to save any more remarks on Joel s part Now tell us about your father and the gingerbread boy So Jasper broke out with a merry laugh into this part of the story and soon had them all in such a gale of merriment that Phronsie stopped playing out on the door step with Prince and came in to see what the matter was Never mind said Polly trying to get her breath just as Jasper was relating how mister King set up the gingerbread boy on his writing table before him while he leaned back in his chair for a hearty laugh And to make it funnier still said Jasper don t you think a little pen wiper he has made like a cap hanging on the pen rack above him tumbled off just at this very identical minute right on the head of the gingerbread boy and there it stuck Oh they all screamed if we could only have seen it What was it asked Phronsie pulling Polly s sleeve to make her hear So Jasper took her in his lap and told how funny the gingerbread boy looked with a cap on and Phronsie clapped her hands and laughed with the rest till the little old kitchen rang and rang again And then they had the baking and Polly tied one of her mother s ample aprons on Jasper as missus Pepper had left directions if he should come while she was away and he developed such a taste for cookery and had so many splendid improvements on the Peppers simple ideas that the children thought it the most fortunate thing in the world that he came and one and all voted him a most charming companion You could cook a Thanksgiving dinner in this stove just as easy as not said Jasper putting into the oven something on a little cracked plate that would have been a pie if there were any centre but lacking that necessary accompaniment probably was a short cake Just as easy as not he repeated with emphasis slamming the door to give point to his remarks No you couldn t either said Ben at the table with equal decision not a bit of it Jasper King Why Ben Pepper asked Jasper that oven s big enough I should like to know why not Cause there isn t anything to cook said Ben coolly cutting out a piece of dough for a jumble we don t keep Thanksgiving Not keep Thanksgiving said Jasper standing quite still never had a Thanksgiving well I declare and then he stopped again Yes answered Ben we had one once twas last year but that wasn t much Well then said Jasper leaning over the table I ll tell you what I should think you d do try Christmas Oh that s always worse said Polly setting down her rolling pin to think which immediately rolled away by itself off from the table We never had a Christmas said little Davie reflectively what are they like Jasper Jasper sat quite still and didn t reply to this question for a moment or two To be among children who didn t like Thanksgiving and who never had seen a Christmas and didn t know what it was like was a new revelation to him They hang up stockings said Polly softly How many many times she had begged her mother to try it for the younger ones but there was never anything to put in them and the winters were cold and hard and the strictest economy only carried them through Oh said little Phronsie in horror are their feet in em Polly No dear said Polly while Jasper instead of laughing only stared Something requiring a deal of thought was passing through the boy s mind just then They shall have a Christmas he muttered I know father ll let me But he kept his thoughts to himself and becoming his own gay kindly self he explained and told to Phronsie and the others so many stories of past Christmases he had enjoyed that the interest over the baking soon dwindled away until a horrible smell of something burning brought them all to their senses Oh the house is burning cried Polly Oh get a pail of water Tisn t either said Jasper snuffing wisely oh I know I forgot all about it I do beg your pardon And running to the stove he knelt down and drew out of the oven a black odorous mass which with a crest fallen air he brought to Polly I m no end sorry I made such a mess of it he said I meant it for you Tisn t any matter said Polly kindly And now do you go on cried Joel and David both in the same breath all about the Tree you know Yes yes said the others if you re not tired Jasper Oh no cried their accommodating friend I love to tell about it only wait let s help Polly clear up first So after all traces of the frolic had been tidied up and made nice for the mother s return they took seats in a circle and Jasper regaled them with story and reminiscence till they felt as if fairy land were nothing to it How did you ever live through it Jasper King said Polly drawing the first long breath she had dared to indulge in Such an elegant time Jasper laughed I hope I ll live through plenty more of them he said merrily We re going to sister Marian s again father and I we always spend our Christmas there you know and she s to have all the cousins and I don t know how many more and a tree but the best of all there s going to be a German carol sung by choir boys I shall like that best of all What are choir boys asked Polly who was intensely fond of music In some of the churches explained Jasper the choir is all boys and they do chant and sing anthems perfectly beautifully Polly Do you play on the piano and sing asked Polly looking at him in awe Yes said the boy simply I ve played ever since I was a little fellow no bigger n Phronsie Oh Jasper cried Polly clasping her hands her cheeks all aflame do you mean to say you do really and truly play on the piano Why yes said the boy looking into her flashing eyes Polly s always crazy about music explained Ben she ll drum on the table and anywhere to make believe it s a piano There s doctor Fisher going by said Joel who now that they had gotten on the subject of music began to find prickles running up and down his legs from sitting so still I wish he d stop Is he the one that cured your measles and Polly s eyes asked Jasper running to the window I want to see him Well there he is cried Ben as the doctor put his head out of the gig and bowed and smiled to the little group in the window He s just lovely cried Polly oh I wish you knew him If father s sick again said Jasper we ll have him he looks nice anyway for father don t like the doctor over in Hingham do you know perhaps we ll come again next summer wouldn t that be nice Oh cried the children rapturously do come Jasper do Well maybe said Jasper if father likes it and sister Marian and her family will come with us they do some summers You d like little Dick I know turning to Phronsie And I guess all of you d like all of them he added looking at the group of interested listeners They wanted to come this year awfully they said Oh grandpapa do let us go with you and Jappy and What said the children Oh said Jasper with a laugh they call me Jappy its easier to say than Jasper ever so many people do for short You may if you want to he said looking around on them all How funny laughed Polly But I don t know as it is any worse than Polly or Ben Or Phronsie said Jappy Don t you like Jappy he said bringing his head down to her level as she sat on the little stool at his feet content in listening to the merry chat Is that the same as Jasper she asked gravely Yes the very same he said When they parted Jappy and the little Peppers were sworn friends and the boy happy in his good times in the cheery little home felt the hours long between the visits that his father when he saw the change that they wrought in his son willingly allowed him to make Oh dear said missus Pepper one day in the last of September as a carriage drawn by a pair of very handsome horses stopped at their door here comes mister King I do believe we never looked worse n we do to day I don t care said Polly flying out of the bedroom Jappy s with him mamma and it ll be nice I guess At any rate Phronsie s clean as a pink she thought to herself looking at the little maiden busy with baby to whom she was teaching deportment in the corner But there was no time to fix up for a tall portly gentleman leaning on his heavy gold cane was walking up from the little brown gate to the big flat stone that served as a step Jasper and Prince followed decorously Is this little Miss Pepper he asked pompously of Polly who answered his rap on the door Now whether she was little Miss Pepper she never had stopped to consider I don t know sir I m Polly And then she blushed bright as a rose and the laughing brown eyes looked beyond to Jasper who stood on the walk and smiled encouragingly Is your mother in asked the old gentleman who was so tall he could scarcely enter the low door And then missus Pepper came forward and Jasper introduced her and the old gentleman bowed and sat down in the seat Polly placed for him And missus Pepper thanked him with a heart overflowing with gratitude through lips that would tremble even then for all that Jasper had done for them And the old gentleman said Humph but he looked at his son and something shone in his eye just for a moment Phronsie had retreated with baby in her arms behind the door on the new arrival But seeing everything progressing finely and overcome by her extreme desire to see Jappy and Prince she began by peeping out with big eyes to observe how things were going on Just then the old gentleman happened to say Well where is my little girl that baked me a cake so kindly Then Phronsie forgetting all else but her poor sick man who also was Jasper s father rushed out from behind the door and coming up to the stately old gentleman in the chair she looked up pityingly and said shaking her yellow head Poor sick man was my boy good After that there was no more gravity and ceremony In a moment Phronsie was perched upon old mister King s knee and playing with his watch while the others freed from all restraint were chatting and laughing happily till some of the cheeriness overflowed and warmed the heart of the old gentleman We go to morrow he said rising and looking at his watch Why is it possible that we have been here an hour there my little girl will you give me a kiss and he bent his handsome old head down to the childish face upturned to his confidingly Don t go said the child as she put up her little lips in grave confidence I do like you I do Oh Phronsie began missus Pepper Don t reprove her madam said the old gentleman who liked it immensely Yes we go to morrow he said looking around on the group to whom this was a blow they little expected They had surely thought Jasper was to stay a week longer I received a telegram this morning that I must be in the city on Thursday And besides madam he said addressing missus Pepper I think the climate is bad for me now as it induces rheumatism The hotel is also getting unpleasant there are many annoyances that I cannot put up with so that altogether I do not regret it missus Pepper not knowing exactly what to say to this wisely said nothing Meantime Jappy and the little Peppers were having a sorry time over in the corner by themselves Well I ll write cried Jasper not liking to look at Polly just then as he was sure he shouldn t want anyone to look at him if he felt like crying And you must answer em all Oh we will we will they cried And Jappy do come next summer said Joel If father ll only say yes we will I tell you he responded eagerly Come my boy said his father the third time and Jasper knew by the tone that there must be no delay mister King had been nervously putting his hand in his pocket during the last few moments that the children were together but when he glanced at missus Pepper s eyes something made him draw it out again hastily as empty as he put it in No twouldn t do he said to himself she isn t the kind of woman to whom one could offer money The children crowded back their tears and hastily said their last good bye some of them hanging on to Prince till the last moment And then the carriage door shut with a bang Jasper giving them a bright parting smile and they were gone And the Peppers went into their little brown house and shut the door GETTING A CHRISTMAS FOR THE LITTLE ONES And so October came and went The little Peppers were very lonely after Jasper had gone even missus Pepper caught herself looking up one day when the wind blew the door open suddenly half expecting to see the merry whole souled boy and the faithful dog come scampering in But the letters came and that was a comfort and it was fun to answer them The first one spoke of Jasper s being under a private tutor with his cousins then they were less frequent and they knew he was studying hard Full of anticipations of Christmas himself he urged the little Peppers to try for one And the life and spirit of the letter was so catching that Polly and Ben found their souls fired within them to try at least to get for the little ones a taste of Christmastide Now mammy they said at last one day in the latter part of October when the crisp fresh air filled their little healthy bodies with springing vitality that must bubble over and rush into something we don t want a Thanksgiving truly we don t But may we try for a Christmas just a little one they added timidly for the children Ben and Polly always called the three younger ones of the flock the children To their utter surprise missus Pepper looked mildly assenting and presently she said Well I don t see why you can t try twon t do any harm I m sure You see missus Pepper had received a letter from Jasper which at present she didn t feel called upon to say anything about Now said Polly drawing a long breath as she and Ben stole away into a corner to talk over and lay plans what does it mean Never mind said Ben as long as she s given us leave I don t care what it is I neither said Polly with the delicious feeling as if the whole world were before them where to choose it ll be just gorgeous Ben What s that asked Ben who was not as much given to long words as Polly who dearly loved to be fine in language as well as other things Oh it s something Jappy said one day and I asked him and he says it s fine and lovely and all that answered Polly delighted that she knew something she could really tell Ben Then why not say fine commented Ben practically with a little upward lift of his nose Oh I d know I m sure laughed Polly Let s think what ll we do for Christmas how many weeks are there anyway Ben And she began to count on her fingers That s no way said Ben I m going to get the Almanac So he went to the old clock where hanging up by its side was a Farmer s Almanac Now we ll know he said coming back to their corner So with heads together they consulted and counted up till they found that eight weeks and three days remained in which to get ready Dear me said Polly It s most a year isn t it Ben Twon t be much time for us said Ben who thought of the many hours to be devoted to hard work that would run away with the time We d better begin right away Polly Well all right said Polly who could scarcely keep her fingers still as she thought of the many things she should so love to do if she could But first Ben what let s do Would you rather hang up their stockings asked Ben as if he had unlimited means at his disposal or have a tree Why said Polly with wide open eyes at the two magnificent ideas we haven t got anything to put in the stockings when we hang em Ben That s just it said Ben Now wouldn t it be better to have a tree Polly I can get that easy in the woods you know Well interrupted Polly eagerly we haven t got anything to hang on that either Ben You know Jappy said folks hang all sorts of presents on the branches So I don t see she continued impatiently as that s any good We can t do anything Ben Pepper so there there isn t anything to do anything with and with a flounce Polly sat down on the old wooden stool and folding her hands looked at Ben in a most despairing way I know said Ben we haven t got much We haven t got anything said Polly still looking at him Why we ve got a tree replied Ben hopefully Well what s a tree retorted Polly scornfully Anybody can go out and look at a tree outdoors Well now I tell you Polly said Ben sitting down on the floor beside her and speaking very slowly and decisively we ve got to do something cause we ve begun and we might make a tree real pretty How asked Polly ashamed of her ill humor but not in the least seeing how anything could be made of a tree How Ben Pepper Well said Ben pleasantly we d set it up in the corner Oh no not in the corner cried Polly whose spirits began to rise a little as she saw Ben so hopeful Put it in the middle of the room do I don t care where you put it said Ben smiling happy that Polly s usual cheerful energy had returned but I thought twill be a little one you know and I thought twould look better in the corner What else asked Polly eager to see how Ben would dress the tree Well said Ben you know the Henderson boys gave me a lot of corn last week I don t see as that helps much said Polly still incredulous Do you mean hang the cobs on the branches Ben That would be just dreadful I should think likely laughed Ben No indeed Polly Pepper but if we should pop a lot oh a bushel and then we should string em we could wind it all in and out among the branches and Why wouldn t that be pretty cried Polly real pretty and we can do that I m sure Yes continued Ben and then don t you know there s some little candle ends in that box in the Provision Room maybe mammy d give us them I don t believe but she would cried Polly twould be just like Jappy s if she would Let s ask her now this very same minute And they scampered hurriedly to missus Pepper who to their extreme astonishment after all said yes and smiled encouragingly on the plan Isn t mammy good said Polly with loving gratitude as they seated themselves again Now we re all right exclaimed Ben and I tell you we can make the tree look perfectly splendid Polly Pepper And I ll tell you another thing Ben Polly said oh something elegant You must get ever so many hickory nuts and you know those bits of bright paper I ve got in the bureau drawer Well we can paste them on to the nuts and hang em on for the balls Jappy tells of Polly cried Ben it ll be such a tree as never was won t it Yes but dear me cried Polly springing up the children are coming Wasn t it good grandma wanted em to come over this afternoon so s we could talk Now hush as the door opened to admit the noisy little troop If you think of any new plan whispered Ben behind his hand while missus Pepper engaged their attention you ll have to come out into the wood shed to talk after this I know it whispered Polly back again oh we ve got just heaps of things to think of Bensie Such a contriving and racking of brains as Polly and Ben set up after this They would bob over at each other and smile with significant gesture as a new idea would strike one of them in the most mysterious way that if observed would drive the others almost wild And then frightened lest in some hilarious moment the secret should pop out the two conspirators would betake themselves to the wood shed as before agreed on But Joel finding this out followed them one day or as Polly said tagged so that was no good Let s go behind the wood pile she said to Ben in desperation he can t hear there if we whisper real soft Yes he will said Ben who knew Joel s hearing faculties much better We ll have to wait till they re a bed So after that when nightfall first began to make its appearance Polly would hint mildly about bedtime You hustle us so said Joel after he had been sent off to bed for two or three nights unusually early Oh Joey it s good for you to get to bed said Polly coaxingly it ll make you grow you know real fast Well I don t grow a bed grumbled Joel who thought something was in the wind You and Ben are going to talk I know and wink your eyes as soon as we re gone Well go along Joe that s a good boy said Polly laughing and you ll know some day What ll you give me asked Joel seeing a bargain his foot on the lowest stair leading to the loft say Polly Oh I haven t got much to give she said cheerily but I ll tell you what Joey I ll tell you a story every day that you go to bed Will you cried Joe hopping back into the room Begin now Polly begin now Why you haven t been to bed yet said Polly so I can t till to morrow Yes I have you ve made us go for three no I guess fourteen nights said Joel indignantly Well you were made to go laughed Polly I said if you d go good you know so run along Joe and I ll tell you a nice one to morrow It s got to be long shouted Joel when he saw he could get no more making good time up to the loft To say that Polly in the following days was Master Joel s slave was stating the case lightly However she thought by her story telling she got off easily as each evening saw the boys drag their unwilling feet to bedward and leave Ben and herself in peace to plan and work undisturbed There they would sit by the little old table around the one tallow candle while missus Pepper sewed away busily looking up to smile or to give some bits of advice keeping her own secret meanwhile which made her blood leap fast as the happy thoughts nestled in her heart of her little ones and their coming glee And Polly made the loveliest of paper dolls for Phronsie out of the rest of the bits of bright paper and Ben made windmills and whistles for the boys and a funny little carved basket with a handle for Phronsie out of a hickory nut shell and a new pink calico dress for Seraphina peered out from the top drawer of the old bureau in the bedroom whenever anyone opened it for missus Pepper kindly let the children lock up their treasures there as fast as completed I ll make Seraphina a bonnet said missus Pepper for there s that old bonnet string in the bag you know Polly that ll make it beautiful Oh do mother cried Polly she s been wanting a new one awfully And I m going to knit some mittens for Joel and David continued missus Pepper cause I can get the yarn cheap now I saw some down at the store yesterday I could have at half price I don t believe anybody ll have as good a Christmas as we shall cried Polly pasting on a bit of trimming to the gayest doll s dress no not even Jappy An odd little smile played around missus Pepper s mouth but she said not a word and so the fun and the work went on The tree was to be set up in the Provision Room that was finally decided as missus Pepper showed the children how utterly useless it would be to try having it in the kitchen I ll find the key children she said I think I know where tis and then we can keep them out Well but it looks so said Polly demurring at the prospect Oh no Polly said her mother at any rate it s clean Polly said Ben we can put evergreen around you know So we can said Polly brightly oh Ben you do think of the best things we couldn t have had them in the kitchen And don t let s hang the presents on the tree continued Ben let s have the children hang up their stockings they want to awfully for I heard David tell Joel this morning before we got up they thought I was asleep but I wasn t that he did so wish they could but says he Don t tell mammy cause that ll make her feel bad The little dears said missus Pepper impulsively they shall have their stockings too And we ll make the tree pretty enough said Polly enthusiastically we shan t want the presents to hang on we ve got so many things And then we ll have hickory nuts to eat and perhaps mammy ll let us make some molasses candy the day before she said with a sly look at her mother You may said missus Pepper smiling Oh goody they both cried hugging each other ecstatically And we ll have a frolic in the Provision Room afterwards finished Polly oh ooh And so the weeks flew by one two three four five six seven eight till only the three days remained and to think the fun that Polly and Ben had had already It s better n a Christmas they told their mother to get ready for it It s too bad you can t hang up your stockings said missus Pepper looking keenly at their flushed faces and bright eyes you ve never hung em up That isn t any matter mamsie they both said cheerily it s a great deal better to have the children have a nice time oh won t it be elegant p r aps we ll have ours next year For two days before the house was turned upside down for Joel to find the biggest stocking he could but on Polly telling him it must be his own he stopped his search and bringing down his well worn one hung it by the corner of the chimney to be ready You put yours up the other side Dave he advised There isn t any nail cried David investigating I ll drive one said Joel so he ran out to the tool house as one corner of the wood shed was called and brought in the hammer and one or two nails Phronsie s a goin in the middle he said with a nail in his mouth Yes I m a goin to hang up my stockin cried the child hopping from one toe to the other Run get it Phronsie said Joel and I ll hang it up for you Why it s two days before Christmas yet said Polly laughing how they ll look hanging there so long I don t care said Joel giving a last thump to the nail we re a goin to be ready Oh dear I wish twas to night Can t Seraphina hang up her stocking asked Phronsie coming up to Polly s side and Baby too Oh let her have part of yours said Polly that ll be best Seraphina and Baby and you have one stocking together Oh yes cried Phronsie easily pleased that ll be best So for the next two days they were almost distracted the youngest ones asking countless questions about Santa Claus and how he possibly could get down the chimney Joel running his head up as far as he dared to see if it was big enough I guess he can he said coming back in a sooty state looking very much excited and delighted Will he be black like Joey asked Phronsie pointing to his grimy face No said Polly he don t ever get black Why they all asked and then over and over they wanted the delightful mystery explained We never ll get through this day said Polly in despair as the last one arrived I wish twas to night for we re all ready Santy s coming Santy s coming sang Phronsie as the bright afternoon sunlight went down over the fresh crisp snow for it s night now Yes Santa is coming sang Polly and Santa Claus is coming rang back and forth through the old kitchen till it seemed as if the three little old stockings would hop down and join in the dance going on so merrily I m glad mine is red said Phronsie at last stopping in the wild jig and going up to see if it was all safe cause then Santy ll know it s mine won t he Polly Yes dear cried Polly catching her up Oh Phronsie you are going to have a Christmas Well I wish said Joel I had my name on mine I know Dave ll get some of my things Oh no Joe said missus Pepper Santa Claus is smart he ll know yours is in the left hand corner Will he asked Joel still a little fearful Oh yes indeed said missus Pepper confidently I never knew him to make a mistake Now said Ben when they had all made a pretence of eating supper for there was such an excitement prevailing that no one sat still long enough to eat much you must every one fly off to bed as quick as ever can be Will Santa Claus come faster then asked Joel Yes said Ben just twice as fast I m going then said Joel but I ain t going to sleep cause I mean to hear him come over the roof then I m going to get up for I do so want a squint at the reindeer I am too cried Davie excitedly Oh do come Joe and he began to mount the stairs Good night said Phronsie going up to the centre of the chimney piece where the little red stocking dangled limpsily lift me up Polly do What you want to do asked Polly running and giving her a jump What you goin to do Phronsie I want to kiss it good night said the child with eyes big with anticipation and happiness hugging the well worn toe of the little old stocking affectionately I wish I had something to give Santa Polly I do she cried as she held her fast in her arms Never mind Pet said Polly nearly smothering her with kisses if you re a good girl Phronsie that pleases Santa the most of anything Does it cried Phronsie delighted beyond measure as Polly carried her into the bedroom then I ll be good always I will CHRISTMAS BELLS In the middle of the night Polly woke up with a start What in the world said she and she bobbed up her head and looked over at her mother who was still peacefully sleeping and was just going to lie down again when a second noise out in the kitchen made her pause and lean on her elbow to listen At this moment she thought she heard a faint whisper and springing out of bed she ran to Phronsie s crib it was empty As quick as a flash she sped out into the kitchen There in front of the chimney were two figures One was Joel and the other unmistakably was Phronsie What are you doing gasped Polly holding on to a chair The two little night gowns turned around at this Why I thought it was morning said Joel and I wanted my stocking Oh as he felt the toe which was generously stuffed give it to me Polly Pepper and I ll run right back to bed again Dear me said Polly and you too Phronsie Why it s the middle of the night Did I ever and she had to pinch her mouth together tight to keep from bursting out into a loud laugh Oh dear I shall laugh don t look so scared Phronsie there won t anything hurt you For Phronsie who on hearing Joel fumbling around the precious stockings had been quite willing to hop out of bed and join him had now on Polly s saying the dire words in the middle of the night scuttled over to her protecting side like a frightened rabbit It never ll be morning said Joel taking up first one cold toe and then the other you might let us have em now Polly No said Polly sobering down you can t have yours till Davie wakes up too Scamper off to bed Joey dear and forget all about em and it ll be morning before you know it Oh I d rather go to bed said Phronsie trying to tuck up her feet in the little flannel night gown which was rather short but I don t know the way back Polly Take me Polly do and she put up her arms to be carried Oh I ain t a goin back alone either whimpered Joel coming up to Polly too Why you came down alone didn t you whispered Polly with a little laugh Yes but I thought twas morning said Joel his teeth chattering with something beside the cold Well you must think of the morning that s coming said Polly cheerily I ll tell you you wait till I put Phronsie into the crib and then I ll come back and go half way up the stairs with you I won t never come down till it s mornin again said Joel bouncing along the stairs when Polly was ready to go with him at a great rate Better not laughed Polly softly Be careful and not wake Davie nor Ben I m in announced Joel in a loud whisper and Polly could hear him snuggle down among the warm bedclothes Call us when tis mornin Polly Yes said Polly I will go to sleep Phronsie had forgotten stockings and everything else on Polly s return and was fast asleep in the old crib The result of it was that the children slept over when morning did really come and Polly had to keep her promise and go to the foot of the stairs and call MERRY CHRISTMAS oh Ben and Joel and Davie Oh oh oo h and then the sounds that answered her as with smothered whoops of expectation they one and all flew into their clothes Quick as a flash Joel and Davie were down and dancing around the chimney Mammy mammy screamed Phronsie hugging her stocking which Ben lifted her up to unhook from the big nail Santy did come he did and then she spun around in the middle of the floor not stopping to look in it Well open it Phronsie called Davie deep in the exploring of his own oh isn t that a splendid wind mill Joe Yes said that individual who having found a big piece of molasses candy was so engaged in enjoying a huge bite that regardless alike of his other gifts or of the smearing his face was getting he gave himself wholly up to its delights Oh Joey cried Polly laughingly molasses candy for breakfast That s prime cried Joel swallowing the last morsel Now I m going to see what s this oh Dave see here see here he cried in intense excitement pulling out a nice little parcel which unrolled proved to be a bright pair of stout mittens See if you ve got some look quick Yes I have said David picking up a parcel about as big No that s molasses candy Just the same as I had said Joel do look for the mittens P r aps Santa Claus thought you had some oh dear Here they are screamed Davie I have got some Joe just exactly like yours See Joe Goody said Joel immensely relieved for now he could quite enjoy his to see a pair on Davie s hands also Look at Phron he cried she hasn t got only half of her things out To tell the truth Phronsie was so bewildered by her riches that she sat on the floor with the little red stocking in her lap laughing and cooing to herself amid the few things she had drawn out When she came to Seraphina s bonnet she was quite overcome She turned it over and over and smoothed out the little white feather that had once adorned one of Grandma Bascom s chickens until the two boys with their stockings and the others sitting around in a group on the floor watching them laughed in glee to see her enjoyment Oh dear said Joel at last shaking his stocking I ve got all there is I wish there were forty Christmases coming I haven t screamed Davie there s some thing in the toe It s an apple I guess said Joel turn it up Dave Tisn t an apple exclaimed Davie tisn t round it s long and thin here tis And he pulled out a splendid long whistle on which he blew a blast long and terrible and Joel immediately following all quiet was broken up and the wildest hilarity reigned I don t know as you ll want any breakfast at last said missus Pepper when she had got Phronsie a little sobered down I do I do cried Joel Dear me after your candy said Polly That s all gone said Joel tooting around the table on his whistle What are we going to have for breakfast Same as ever said his mother it can t be Christmas all the time I wish twas said little Davie forever and ever Forever an ever echoed little Phronsie flying up her cheeks like two pinks and Seraphina in her arms with her bonnet on upside down Dear dear said Polly pinching Ben to keep still as they tumbled down the little rickety steps to the Provision Room after breakfast The children content in their treasures were holding high carnival in the kitchen Suppose they should find it out now I declare I should feel most awfully Isn t it elegant she asked in a subdued whisper going all around and around the tree magnificent in its dress of bright red and yellow balls white festoons and little candle ends all ready for lighting Oh Ben did you lock the door Yes he said That s a mouse he added as a little rustling noise made Polly stop where she stood back of the tree and prick up her ears in great distress of mind Tis elegant he said turning around in admiration and taking in the tree which as Polly said was quite gorgeous and the evergreen branches twisted up on the beams and rafters and all the other festive arrangements Even Jappy s isn t better I don t believe I wish Jappy was here said Polly with a small sigh Well he isn t said Ben come we must go back into the kitchen or all the children will be out here Look your last Polly twon t do to come again till it s time to light up Mammy says she d rather do the lighting up said Polly Had she said Ben in surprise oh I suppose she s afraid we ll set somethin a fire Well then we shan t come in till we have it I can t bear to go said Polly turning reluctantly away it s most beautiful oh Ben and she faced him for the five hundredth time with the question is your Santa Claus dress all safe Yes said Ben I ll warrant they won t find that in one hurry Such a time as we ve had to make it I know it laughed Polly don t that cotton wool look just like bits of fur Ben Yes said Ben and when the flour s shaken over me it ll be Santa himself We ve got to put back the hair into mamsie s cushion the first thing to morrow whispered Polly anxiously and we mustn t forget it Bensie I want to keep the wig awfully said Ben You did make that just magnificent Polly If you could see yourself giggled Polly did you put it in the straw bed and are you sure you pulled the ticking over it smooth Yes sir replied Ben sure s my name s Ben Pepper if you ll only keep them from seeing me when I m in it till we re ready that s all I ask Well said Polly a little relieved but I hope Joe won t look Come on they re a comin whispered Ben quick Polly rang a voice dangerously near so near that Polly speeding over the stairs to intercept it nearly fell on her nose Where you been asked one Let s have a concert put in Ben Polly was so out of breath that she couldn t speak Come now each take a whistle and we ll march round and round and see which can make the biggest noise In the rattle and laughter which this procession made all mystery was forgotten and the two conspirators began to breathe freer Five o clock The small ones of the Pepper flock being pretty well tired out with noise and excitement all gathered around Polly and Ben and clamored for a story Do Polly do begged Joel It s Christmas and twon t come again for a year I can t said Polly in such a twitter that she could hardly stand still and for the first time in her life refusing I can t think of a thing I will then said Ben we must do something he whispered to Polly Tell it good said Joel settling himself So for an hour the small tyrants kept their entertainers well employed Isn t it growing awful dark said Davie rousing himself at last as Ben paused to take breath Polly pinched Ben Mammy s a goin to let us know he whispered in reply We must keep on a little longer Don t stop said Joel lifting his head where he sat on the floor What you whisperin for Polly I m not said Polly glad to think she hadn t spoken Well do go on Ben said Joel lying down again Polly ll have to finish it said Ben I ve got to go upstairs now So Polly launched out into such an extravagant story that they all perforce had to listen All this time missus Pepper had been pretty busy in her way And now she came into the kitchen and set down her candle on the table Children she said Everybody turned and looked at her her tone was so strange and when they saw her dark eyes shining with such a new light little Davie skipped right out into the middle of the room What s the matter mammy You may all come into the Provision Room said she What for shouted Joel in amazement while the others jumped to their feet and stood staring Polly flew around like a general arranging her forces Let s march there said she Phronsie you take hold of Davie s hand and go first I m goin first announced Joel squeezing up past Polly No you mustn t Joe said Polly decidedly Phronsie and David are the youngest They re always the youngest said Joel falling back with Polly to the rear Forward MARCH sang Polly Follow mamsie Down the stairs they went with military step and into the Provision Room And then with one wild look the little battalion broke ranks and tumbling one over the other in decidedly unmilitary style presented a very queer appearance And Captain Polly was the queerest of all for she just gave one gaze at the tree and then sat right down on the floor and said Oh OH missus Pepper was flying around delightedly and saying Please to come right in and How do you do And before anybody knew it there were the laughing faces of missus Henderson and the Parson himself Doctor Fisher and old Grandma Bascom while the two Henderson boys unwilling to be defrauded of any of the fun were squeezing themselves in between everybody else and coming up to Polly every third minute and saying There aren t you surprised It s Fairyland cried little Davie out of his wits with joy Oh aren t we in Fairyland ma The whole room was in one buzz of chatter and fun and everybody beamed on everybody else and nobody knew what they said till missus Pepper called Hush Santa Claus is coming A rattle at the little old window made everybody look there just as a great snow white head popped up over the sill Oh screamed Joel tis Santy He s a comin in cried Davie in chorus which sent Phronsie flying to Polly In jumped a little old man quite spry for his years with a jolly red face and a pack on his back and flew into their midst prepared to do his duty but what should he do instead of making his speech this jolly Old Saint but first fly up to missus Pepper and say Oh mammy how did you do it It s Ben screamed Phronsie but the little Old Saint didn t hear for he and Polly took hold of hands and pranced around that tree while everybody laughed till they cried to see them go And then it all came out Order said Parson Henderson in his deepest tones and then he put into Santa Claus hands a letter which he requested him to read And the jolly Old Saint although he was very old didn t need any spectacles but piped out in Ben s loudest tones Dear Friends A Merry Christmas to you all And that you ll have a good time and enjoy it all as much as I ve enjoyed my good times at your house is the wish of your friend JASPER ELYOT KING Hurrah for Jappy cried Santa Claus pulling his beard and Hurrah for Jasper went all around the room and this ended in three good cheers Phronsie coming in too late with her little crow which was just as well however Do your duty now Santa Claus commanded doctor Fisher as master of ceremonies and everything was as still as a mouse And the first thing she knew a lovely brass cage with a dear little bird with two astonished black eyes dropped down into Polly s hands The card on it said For Miss Polly Pepper to give her music everyday in the year Mammy said Polly and then she did the queerest thing of the whole she just burst into tears I never thought I should have a bird for my very own Hulloa said Santa Claus I ve got something myself Santa Claus clothes are too old laughed doctor Fisher holding up a stout warm suit that a boy about as big as Ben would delight in And then that wonderful tree just rained down all manner of lovely fruit Gifts came flying thick and fast till the air seemed full and each one was greeted with a shout of glee as it was put into the hands of its owner A shawl flew down on missus Pepper s shoulders and a work basket tumbled on Polly s head and tops and balls and fishing poles sent Joel and David into a corner with howls of delight But the climax was reached when a large wax doll in a very gay pink silk dress was put into Phronsie s hands and doctor Fisher stooping down read in loud tones FOR PHRONSIE FROM ONE WHO ENJOYED HER GINGERBREAD BOY After that nobody had anything to say Books jumped down unnoticed and gay boxes of candy Only Polly peeped into one of her books and saw in Jappy s plain hand I hope we ll both read this next summer And turning over to the title page she saw A Complete Manual of Cookery The best is to come said missus Henderson in her gentle way When there was a lull in the gale she took Polly s hand and led her to a little stand of flowers in the corner concealed by a sheet pinks and geraniums heliotropes and roses blooming away and nodding their pretty heads at the happy sight Polly had her flowers Why didn t we know cried the children at last when everybody was tying on their hoods and getting their hats to leave the festive scene how could you keep it secret mammy They all went to missus Henderson s said missus Pepper Jasper wrote me and asked where to send em and missus Henderson was so kind as to say that they might come there And we brought em over last evening when you were all abed I couldn t have done it she said bowing to the Parson and his wife if twasn t for their kindness never in all this world And I m sure said the minister looking around on the bright group if we can help along a bit of happiness like this it is a blessed thing And here Joel had the last word You said twan t goin to be Christmas always mammy I say looking around on the overflow of treasures and the happy faces it ll be just forever EDUCATION AHEAD After that they couldn t thank Jasper enough They tried to lovingly and an elaborate letter of thanks headed by missus Pepper was drawn up and sent with a box of the results of Polly s diligent study of Jasper s book Polly stripped off recklessly her choicest buds and blossoms from the gay little stand of flowers in the corner that had already begun to blossom and tucked them into every little nook in the box that could possibly hold a posy But as for thanking him enough We can t do it mammy said Polly looking around on all the happy faces and then up at Cherry who was singing in the window and who immediately swelled up his little throat and poured out such a merry burst of song that she had to wait for him to finish No not if we tried a thousand years I m a goin said Joel who was busy as a bee with his new tools that the tree had shaken down for him to make Jappy the splendidest box you ever saw Polly I guess that ll thank him Do cried Polly he d be so pleased Joey And I said Phronsie over in the corner with her children I m goin to see my poor sick man sometime Polly I am Oh dear cried Polly whirling around and looking at her mother in dismay She ll be goin to morrow Oh no Phronsie you can t he lives miles and miles away oh ever so far Does he live as far as the moon asked little Phronsie carefully laying Seraphina down and looking up at Polly anxiously Oh I don t know said Polly giving Cherry a piece of bread and laughing to see how cunning he looked Oh no of course not but it s an awful long ways Phronsie I don t care said Phronsie determinedly giving the new doll a loving little pat I m goin sometime Polly to thank my poor sick man yes I am You ll see him next summer Phronsie sang Polly skipping around the kitchen and Jappy s sister Marian the lovely lady and all the boys Won t that be nice and Polly stopped to pat the yellow head bending in motherly attentions over her array of dolls Ye es said Phronsie slowly the whole of em Polly Yes indeed said Polly gayly the whole of em Phronsie Hooray shouted the two boys while Phronsie only gave a long sigh and clasped her hands Better not be looking for summer said missus Pepper until you do your duty by the winter then you can enjoy it and she took a fresh needleful of thread Mamsie s right said Ben smiling over at her And he threw down his book and jumped for his cap Now for a good chop he cried and snatching a kiss from Phronsie he rushed out of the door to his work whistling as he went Warn t mister Henderson good ma asked Polly watching his retreating figure to give Ben learning Yes he was replied missus Pepper enthusiastically We ve got a parson if anybody has in this world And Ben s learning said Polly swelling with pride as she sat down by her mother and began to sew rapidly so that he ll be a big man right off Oh dear as a thought made her needle pause a minute in its quick flying in and out What is it Polly missus Pepper looked keenly at the troubled face and downcast eyes Why began Polly and then she finished very slowly I shan t know anything and Ben ll be ashamed of me Yes you will cried missus Pepper energetically you keep on trying and the Lord ll send some way don t you go to bothering your head about it now Polly it ll come when it s time Will it asked Polly doubtfully taking up her needle again Yes indeed cried missus Pepper briskly come fly at your sewing that s your learning now So tis said Polly with a little laugh Now let s see which ll get their seam done first mamsie And now letters flew thick and fast from the city to the little brown house and back again warming Jasper s heart and filling the tedious months of that winter with more of jollity and fun than the lad ever enjoyed before and never was fun and jollity more needed than now for mister King having nothing to do and each year finding himself less inclined to exercise any thoughtful energy for others began to look at life something in the light of a serious bore and accordingly made it decidedly disagreeable for all around him and particularly for Jasper who was his constant companion But the boy was looking forward to summer and so held on bravely I do verily believe Polly he wrote that Badgertown ll see the gayest times it ever knew Sister Marian wants to go so that s all right Now hurrah for a good time it s surely coming But alas for Jasper as spring advanced his father took a decided aversion to Hingham Badgertown and all other places that could be mentioned in that vicinity It s a wretched climate he asserted over and over and the foundation of all my ill feelings this winter was laid I m convinced in Hingham last summer No use to urge the contrary and all Jasper s pleadings were equally vain At last sister Marian who was kind hearted to a fault sorry to see her brother s dismay and disappointment said one day Why not have one of the children come here I should like it very much do invite Ben I don t want Ben said Jasper gloomily I want Polly He added this in much the same tone as Phronsie s when she had rushed up to him the day she was lost declaring I want Polly Very well then said sister Marian laughing I m sure I didn t mean to dictate which one let it be Polly then yes I should prefer Polly myself I think as we ve enough boys now smiling to think of her own brood of wide awake youngsters If you only will father I ll try to be ever so good said Jasper turning suddenly to his father Jasper needs some change said sister Marian kindly he really has grown very pale and thin Hey said mister King sharply looking at him over his eyeglasses The boy s well enough well enough But he twisted uneasily in his chair all the same At last he flung down his paper twitched his fingers through his hair two or three times and then burst out Well why don t you send for her I m sure I don t care I ll write myself and I had better do it now Tell Thomas to be ready to take it right down it must get into this mail When mister King had made up his mind to do anything everybody else must immediately give up their individual plans and stand out of the way for him to execute his at just that particular moment Accordingly Thomas was dragged from his work to post the letter while the old gentleman occupied the time in pulling out his watch every third second until the slightly out of breath Thomas reported on his return that the letter did get in Then mister King settled down satisfied and everything went on smoothly as before But Polly didn t come A grateful appreciative letter expressed in missus Pepper s own stiff way plainly showed the determination of that good woman not to accept what was such a favor to her child In vain mister King stormed and fretted and begged offering every advantage possible Polly should have the best foundation for a musical education that the city could afford also lessons in the schoolroom under the boys private tutor it was all of no avail In vain sister Marian sent a gentle appeal fully showing her heart was in it nothing broke down missus Pepper s resolve until at last the old gentleman wrote one day that Jasper being in such failing health really depended on Polly to cheer him up That removed the last straw that made it putting one s self under an obligation which to missus Pepper s independent soul had seemed insurmountable And now it was decided that Polly was really to go and pretty soon all Badgertown knew that Polly Pepper was going to the big city And there wasn t a man woman or child but what greatly rejoiced that a sunny time was coming to one of the chicks in the little brown house With many warm words and some substantial gifts kind friends helped forward the outing Only one person doubted that this delightful chance should be grasped at once and that one was Polly herself I can t she said and stood quite pale and still when the Hendersons advised her mother s approval and even Grandma Bascom said Go I can t go and leave mammy to do all the work But don t you see Polly said missus Henderson drawing her to her side that you will help your mother twice as much as you possibly could here by getting a good education Think what your music will be only think Polly Polly drew a long breath at this and turned away Oh Polly cried Ben though his voice choked if you give this up there never ll be another chance and the boy put his arm around her and whispered something in her ear I know said Polly quietly and then she burst out oh but I can t tisn t right Polly said missus Pepper and never in all their lives had the children seen such a look in mamsie s eyes as met them then it does seem as if my heart would be broken if you didn t go And then she burst out crying right before them all Oh mammy cried Polly breaking away from everybody and flinging herself into her arms I ll go if you think I ought to But it s too good don t cry don t mammy dear and Polly stroked the careworn face lovingly and patted the smooth hair that was still so black And Polly said missus Pepper smiling through her tears just think what a comfort you ll be to me and us all she added taking in the children who were crowding around Polly as the centre of attraction Why you ll be the making of us she added hopefully I ll do something said Polly her brown eyes kindling or I shan t be worthy of you mammy O you ll do it said missus Pepper confidently now that you re going But when Polly stepped into the stage with her little hair trunk strapped on behind containing her one brown merino that missus Henderson had made over for her out of one of her own and her two new ginghams her courage failed again and she astonished everybody and nearly upset a mild faced old lady who was in the corner placidly eating doughnuts by springing out and rushing up through the little brown gate past all the family drawn up to see her off She flew over the old flat door stone and into the bedroom where she flung herself down between the old bed and Phronsie s crib in a sudden torrent of tears I can t go she sobbed oh I can t Why Polly cried missus Pepper hurrying in followed by Joel and the rest of the troops at his heels What are you thinking of Think of by and by Polly put in Ben patting her on the back with an unsteady hand while Joel varied the proceedings by running back and forth screaming at the top of his lungs The stage s going your trunk ll be taken Dear me ejaculated missus Pepper do stop it somebody there Polly come now Do as mother says I ll try again said poor Polly choking back her sobs and getting on her feet Then Polly s tears were wiped away her hat straightened after which she was kissed all round again by the whole family Phronsie waiting for the last two and then was helped again into the stage the bags and parcels and a box for Jappy which as it wouldn t go into the trunk Joel had insisted Polly should carry in her hand were again piled around her and mister Tisbett mounted to his seat and with a crack of the whip bore her safely off this time The doughnut lady viewing poor Polly with extreme sympathy immediately forced upon her acceptance three of the largest and sugariest Twill do you good she said falling to herself on another with good zeal I always eat em and then there ain t any room for homesickness And away and away and away they rumbled and jumbled to the cars Here mister Tisbett put Polly and her numerous bundles under the care of the conductor with manifold charges and explicit directions to see her safely into mister King s own hands He left her sitting straight up among her parcels her sturdy little figure drawn up to its full height and the clear brown eyes regaining a little of their dancing light for although a dreadful feeling tugged at her heart as she thought of the little brown house she was fast flying away from there was something else our Polly had begun to realize that now she was going to help mother And now they neared the big city and everybody began to bustle around and get ready to jump out and the minute the train stopped the crowd poured out from the cars making way for the crowd pouring in for this was a through train All aboard sang the conductor Oh my senses springing to Polly I forgot you here But as quick as a flash he was pushed aside and a bright boyish figure dashed up Oh Polly he said in such a ringing voice and in another second Polly and her bag and the bundle of cakes and apples that Grandma Bascom had put up for her and Joel s box were one and all bundled out upon the platform and the train whizzed on and there mister King was fuming up and down berating the departing conductor and speaking his mind in regard to all the railroad officials he could think of He pulled himself up long enough to give Polly a hearty welcome and then away again he flew in righteous indignation while Jasper rushed off into the baggage room with Polly s check However every now and then turning to look down into the little rosy face beside him the old gentleman would burst forth Bless me child I m glad you re here Polly how could the fellow forget when Oh well you know said Polly with a happy little wriggle under her brown coat I m here now So you are so you are laughed the old gentleman suddenly where can Jasper be so long They re all in the carriage answered the boy skipping back Now father now Polly He was fairly bubbling over with joy and mister King forgot his dudgeon and joined in the general glee which soon became so great that travellers gave many a glance at the merry trio who bundled away to Thomas and the waiting grays You re sure you ve got the right check asked mister King nervously getting into a handsome coach lined with dark green satin and settling down among its ample cushions with a sigh of relief Oh yes laughed Jasper Polly didn t have any one else s check I guess Over through the heart of the city down narrow noisy business streets out into wide avenues with handsome stately mansions on either side they flew along Oh said Polly and then she stopped and blushed very hard What is it my dear asked mister King kindly Polly couldn t speak at first but when Jasper stopped his merry chat and begged to know what it was she turned on him and burst out You live here Why yes laughed the boy why not Oh said Polly again her cheeks as red as two roses it s so lovely And then the carriage turned in at a brown stone gateway and winding up among some fine old trees stopped before a large stately residence that in Polly s eyes seemed like one of the castles of Ben s famous stories And then mister King got out and gallantly escorted Polly out and up the steps while Jasper followed with Polly s bag which he couldn t be persuaded to resign to Thomas A stiff waiter held the door open and then the rest was only a pleasant confused jumble of kind welcoming words smiling faces with a background of high spacious walls bright pictures and soft elegant hangings everything and all inextricably mixed till Polly herself seemed floating away away fast to the Fairyland of her dreams now mister King was handing her around like a precious parcel from one to the other now Jasper was bobbing in and out everywhere introducing her on all sides and then Prince was jumping up and trying to lick her face every minute but best of all was when a lovely face looked down into hers and Jasper s sister bent to kiss her I am very glad to have you here little Polly The words were simple but Polly lifting up her clear brown eyes looked straight into the heart of the speaker and from that moment never ceased to love her It was a good inspiraton thought missus Whitney to herself this little girl is going to be a comfort I know And then she set herself to conduct successfully her three boys into friendliness and good fellowship with Polly for each of them was following his own sweet will in the capacity of host and besides staring at her with all his might was determined to do the whole of the entertaining a state of things which might become unpleasant However Polly stood it like a veteran This little girl must be very tired said missus Whitney at last with a bright smile Besides I am going to have her to myself now Oh no no cried little Dick in alarm why she s just come we want to see her For shame Dick said Percy the eldest a boy of ten years who took every opportunity to reprove Dick in public she s come a great ways so she ought to rest you know You wanted her to come out to the greenhouse yourself 
4967_3586_000052_000003	train-clean-360	you know you did 
none	none	put in Van the next to Percy who never would be reproved or patronized only she wouldn t go You ll come down to dinner said Percy politely ignoring Van Then you won t be tired perhaps Oh I m not very tired now said Polly brightly with a merry little laugh only I ve never been in the cars before and Never been in the cars before exclaimed Van crowding up while Percy made a big round O with his mouth and little Dick s eyes stretched to their widest extent No said Polly simply never in all my life Come dear said sister Marian rising quickly and taking Polly s hand while Jasper showing unmistakable symptoms of pitching into all the three boys followed with the bag Up the broad oak staircase they went Polly holding by missus Whitney s soft hand as if for dear life and Jasper tripping up two steps at a time in front of them They turned after reaching the top down a hall soft to the foot and brightly lighted Now Polly said sister Marian I m going to have you here right next to my dressing room this is your nest little bird and I hope you ll be very happy in it And here missus Whitney turned up the gas and then just because she couldn t help it gathered Polly up in her arms without another word Jasper set down the bag on a chair and came and stood by his sister s side looking down at her as she stroked the brown wavy hair on her bosom It s so nice to have Polly here sister he said and he put his hand on missus Whitney s neck and then with the other hand took hold of both of Polly s chubby ones who looked up and smiled and in that smile the little brown house seemed to hop right out and bring back in a flash all the nice times those eight happy weeks had brought him Oh twas so perfectly splendid sister Marian he cried flinging himself down on the floor by her chair You don t know what good times we had does she Polly and then he launched out into a perfect shower of Don t you remember this or Oh Polly you surely haven t forgotten that missus Whitney good naturedly entering into it and enjoying it all with them until warned by the lateness of the hour she laughingly reminded Jasper of dinner and dismissed him to prepare for it When the three boys saw Polly coming in again they welcomed her with a cordial shout for one and all after careful measurement of her had succumbed entirely to Polly and each was unwilling that the others should get ahead of him in her regard This is your seat Polly said sister Marian touching the chair next to her own Thereupon a small fight ensued between the little Whitneys while Jasper looked decidedly discomfited Let Polly sit next to me said Van as if a seat next to him was of all things most to be desired Oh no I want her said little Dick Pshaw Dick you re too young put in Percy You d spill the bread and butter all over her I wouldn t either said little Dick indignantly and beginning to crawl into his seat I don t spill bread and butter now Percy you know See here said Jasper decidedly she s coming up here by father and me that is sister Marian he finished more politely if you re willing All this while Polly had stood quietly watching the group the big handsome table the bright lights and the well trained servants with a curious feeling at her heart what were the little brown house people doing Polly shall decide it said sister Marian laughing Now where will you sit dear she added looking down on the little quiet figure beside her Oh by Jappy please said Polly quickly as if there could be no doubt and kind mister King she added smiling at him That s right that s right my dear cried the old gentleman pleased beyond measure at her honest choice And he pulled out her chair and waited upon her into it so handsomely that Polly was happy at once while Jasper with a proud toss of his dark wavy hair marched up delightedly and took the chair on her other side And now in two or three minutes it seemed as if Polly had always been there it was the most natural thing in the world that sister Marian should smile down the table at the bright faced narrator who answered all their numerous questions and entertained them all with accounts of Ben s skill of Phronsie s cunning ways of the boys who made fun for all and above everything else of the dear mother whom they all longed to help and of all the sayings and doings in the little brown house No wonder that the little boys forgot to eat and for once never thought of the attractions of the table And when as they left the table at last little Dick rushed impulsively up to Polly and flinging himself into her arms declared I love you and you re my sister Nothing more was needed to make Polly feel at home Yes said missus Whitney and nodded to herself in the saying it was a good thing and a comfort I believe has come to this house this day BRAVE WORK AND THE REWARD And on the very first morrow came Polly s music teacher The big drawing room with its shaded light and draped furniture with its thick soft carpet on which no foot fall could be heard with all its beauty and loveliness on every side was nothing to Polly s eyes only the room that contained the piano That was all she saw And when the teacher came he was simply the Fairy an ugly little one it is true but still a most powerful being who was to unlock its mysteries and conduct her into Fairyland itself He was a homely little Frenchman with a long curved nose and an enormous black moustache magnificently waxed who bowed elaborately and called her Mademoiselle Pep paire but he had music in his soul and Polly couldn t reverence him too much And now the big piano gave out new sounds sounds that told of a strong purpose and steady patience Every note was struck for mother and the home brood Monsieur Tourtelotte after watching her keenly out of his little black eyes would nod to himself like a mandarin and the nod would be followed by showers of extra politeness as his appreciation of her patient energy and attention Every chance she could get Polly would steal away into the drawing room from Jappy and the three boys and all the attractions they could offer and laboriously work away over and over at the tedious scales and exercises that were to be stepping stones to so much that was glorious beyond Never had she sat still for so long a time in her active little life and now with her arms at just such an angle with the stiff chubby fingers kept under training and restraint well Polly realized years after that only her love of the little brown house could ever have kept her from flying up and spinning around in perfect despair She likes it said Percy in absolute astonishment one day when Polly had refused to go out driving with all the other children in the park and had gone resolutely instead into the drawing room and shut the door She likes those hateful old exercises and she don t like anything else Much you know about it said Jappy she s perfectly aching to go now Percy Whitney Well why don t she then said Percy opening his eyes to their widest extent Cause said Jasper stopping on his way to the door to look him full in the face she s commenced to learn to play and there won t anything stop her I m going to try said Percy gleefully I know lots of ways I can do to try anyway See here now said Jasper turning back you let her alone Do you hear he added and there must have been something in his eye to command attention for Percy instantly signified his intention not to tease this young music student in the least Come on then old fellow and Jasper swung his cap on his head Thomas will be like forty bears if we keep him waiting much longer And Polly kept at it steadily day after day getting through with the lessons in the schoolroom as quickly as possible to rush to her music until presently the little Frenchman waxed enthusiastic to that degree that as day after day progressed and swelled into weeks and each lesson came to an end he would skip away on the tips of his toes his nose in the air and the waxed ends of his moustache fairly trembling with delight Ah such patience as Mademoiselle Pep paire has I know no other such little Americane I think said Jasper one evening after dinner when all the children were assembled as usual in their favorite place on the big rug in front of the fire in the library Prince in the middle of the group his head on his paws watching everything in infinite satisfaction that Polly s getting on in music as I never saw anyone do and that s a fact I mean to begin said Van ambitiously sitting up straight and staring at the glowing coals I guess I will to morrow which announcement was received with a perfect shout Van s taste being anything rather than of a musical nature If you do said Jappy when the merriment had a little subsided I shall go out of the house at every lesson there won t anyone stay in it Van I can bang all I want to then said Van noways disturbed by the reflection and pulling one of Prince s long ears you think you re so big Jappy just because you re thirteen He s only three ahead of me Van bristled Percy who never could forgive Jappy for being his uncle much less the still greater sin of having been born three years earlier than himself Three s just as bad as four said Van Let s tell stories began Polly who never could remember such goings on in the little brown house we must each tell one she added with the greatest enthusiasm and see which will be the biggest and the best Oh no said Van who perfectly revelled in Polly s stories and who now forgot his trials in the prospect of one You tell Polly you tell alone Yes do Polly said Jasper we d rather So Polly launched out into one of her gayest and finest and soon they were in such a peal of laughter and had reached such heights of enjoyment that mister King popped his head in at the door and then came in and took a seat in a big rocking chair in the corner to hear the fun go on Oh dear said Van leaning back with a long sigh and wiping his flushed face as Polly wound up with a triumphant flourish how ever do you think of such things Polly Pepper That isn t anything said Jappy bringing his handsome face out into the strong light why it s just nothing to what she has told time and again in the little brown house in Badgertown and then he caught sight of Polly s face which turned a little pale in the firelight as he spoke and the brown eyes had such a pathetic droop in them that it went to the boy s very heart Was Polly homesick and so soon POLLY IS COMFORTED 
4116_3582_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Yes it must be confessed 
4116_3582_000002_000001	train-clean-360	Polly was homesick 
4116_3582_000002_000002	train-clean-360	All her imaginations of her mother s hard work increased by her absence loomed up before her till she was almost ready to fly home without a minute s warning 
none	none	At night when no one knew it the tears would come racing over the poor forlorn little face and would not be squeezed back 
4116_3582_000002_000004	train-clean-360	It got to be noticed finally and one and all redoubled their exertions to make everything twice as pleasant as ever 
4116_3582_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The only place except in front of the grand piano where Polly approached a state of comparative happiness was in the greenhouse 
4116_3582_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Here she would stay comforted and soothed among the lovely plants and rich exotics rejoicing the heart of Old Turner the gardener who since Polly s first rapturous entrance had taken her into his good graces for all time 
4116_3582_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Every chance she could steal after practice hours were over and after the clamorous demands of the boys upon her time were fully satisfied was seized to fly on the wings of the wind to the flowers 
none	none	But even with the music and flowers the dancing light in the eyes went down a little and Polly growing more silent and pale moved around with a little droop to the small figure that had only been wont to fly through the wide halls and spacious rooms with gay and springing step
4116_3582_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Polly don t like us at last said Van one day in despair 
none	none	Then dear said missus Whitney you must be kinder to her than ever think what it would be for one of you to be away from home even among friends I d like it first rate to be away from Percy said Van reflectively I wouldn t come back in three no six weeks My son said his mamma just stop and think how badly you would feel if you really couldn t see Percy
4116_3582_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said Van and he showed signs of relenting a little at that but Percy is perfectly awful mamma you don t know and he feels so smart too he said vindictively 
4116_3582_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said missus Whitney softly let s think what we can do for Polly it makes me feel very badly to see her sad little face 
none	none	I don t know said Van running over in his mind all the possible ways he could think of for entertaining anybody unless she d like my new book of travels or my velocipede he added
4116_3582_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid those wouldn t quite answer the purpose said his mamma smiling especially the last yet we must think of something 
none	none	But just here mister King thought it about time to take matters into his hands 
4116_3582_000014_000001	train-clean-360	So with a great many chucklings and shruggings when no one was by he had departed after breakfast one day simply saying he shouldn t be back to lunch 
none	none	Polly sat in the drawing room near the edge of the twilight practicing away bravely Somehow of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer 
4116_3582_000015_000002	train-clean-360	If she could only see Phronsie for just one moment 
4116_3582_000015_000003	train-clean-360	 I shall have to give up she moaned 
4116_3582_000015_000004	train-clean-360	 I can t bear it and over went her head on the music rack 
none	none	Where is she said a voice over in front of the piano in the gathering dusk unmistakably mister King s
4116_3582_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh she s always at the piano said Van 
4116_3582_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 She must be there now somewhere and then somebody laughed 
none	none	Then came in the loudest of whispers from little Dick Oh Jappy what ll she say Hush said one of the other boys do be still Dick 
4116_3582_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Polly sat up very straight and whisked off the tears quickly 
4116_3582_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Up came mister King with an enormous bundle in his arms and he marched up to the piano puffing with his exertions 
4116_3582_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Here Polly hold your arms he had only strength to gasp 
none	none	And then he broke out into a loud burst of merriment in which all the troop joined until the big room echoed with the sound 
4116_3582_000021_000000	train-clean-360	At this the bundle opened suddenly and out popped Phronsie 
none	none	Here I m 
4116_3582_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I m here Polly 
4116_3582_000023_000000	train-clean-360	But Polly couldn t speak and if Jasper hadn t caught her just in time she would have tumbled over backward from the stool Phronsie and all 
4116_3582_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Aren t you glad I ve come Polly asked Phronsie with her little face close to Polly s own 
none	none	That brought Polly to
4116_3582_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh Phronsie she cried and strained her to her heart while the boys crowded around and plied her with sudden questions 
4116_3582_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Now you ll stay cried Van say Polly won t you 
4116_3582_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Weren t you awfully surprised cried Percy say Polly awfully 
4116_3582_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Is her name Phronsie put in Dick unwilling to be left out and not thinking of anything else to ask 
4116_3582_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Boys whispered their mother warningly she can t answer you just look at her face 
4116_3582_000030_000000	train-clean-360	And to be sure our Polly s face was a study to behold 
none	none	All its old sunniness was as nothing to the joy that now transfigured it Oh she cried coming out of her rapture a little and springing over to mister King with Phronsie still in her arms Oh you are the dearest and best mister King I ever saw but how did you make mammy let her come
4116_3582_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Isn t he splendid cried Jasper in intense pride swelling up 
4116_3582_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Father knew how to do it 
none	none	But Polly s arms were around the old gentleman s neck so she didn t hear
4116_3582_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 There there he said soothingly patting her brown fuzzy head Something was going down the old gentleman s neck that wet his collar and made him whisper very tenderly in her ear don t give way now Polly Phronsie ll see you 
4116_3582_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I know gasped Polly controlling her sobs I won t only I can t thank you 
4116_3582_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Phronsie said Jasper quickly what do you suppose Prince said the other day 
4116_3582_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 What asked Phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of Polly s arms and crowding up close to Jasper s side 
4116_3582_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 What did he Jasper 
none	none	Oh ho how funny laughed Van while little Dick burst right out Japser
4116_3582_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Be still said Jappy warningly while Phronsie stood surveying them all with grave eyes 
none	none	Well I asked him Don t you want to see Phronsie Pepper Prince And do you know he just stood right upon his hind legs Phronsie and said 
4116_3582_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Bark 
none	none	yes Bark Bark Did he really Jasper cried Phronsie delighted beyond measure and clasping her hands in rapture all alone by himself
4116_3582_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes all alone by himself asserted Jasper vehemently and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing he did now truly Phronsie 
none	none	Then mustn t I go and see him now Jasper 
4116_3582_000042_000001	train-clean-360	yes pretty soon now 
none	none	So you must cried Jasper enchanted at his success in amusing and I ll go with you Oh no cried Phronsie shaking her yellow head Oh no Jasper I must go by my very own self There Jap you ve caught it laughed Percy while the others screamed at the sight of Jasper s face Oh Phronsie cried Polly turning around at the last words how could you
4116_3582_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t mind it Polly whispered Jasper twasn t her fault 
4116_3582_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Phronsie said missus Whitney smilingly stooping over the child would you like to see a little pussy I have for you 
4116_3582_000049_000000	train-clean-360	But the chubby face didn t look up brightly as usual and the next moment without a bit of warning Phronsie sprang past them all even Polly and flung herself into mister King s arms in a perfect torrent of sobs 
none	none	Oh let s go back was all they heard Dear me ejaculated the old gentleman in the utmost amazement and such a time as I ve had to get her here too he added staring around on the astonished group none of whom had a word to say But Polly stood like a statue 
4116_3582_000051_000001	train-clean-360	All Jasper s frantic efforts at comfort utterly failed 
4116_3582_000051_000002	train-clean-360	To think that Phronsie had left her for any one even good mister King 
none	none	The room seemed to buzz and everything to turn upside down and just then she heard another cry Oh I want Polly I do With a bound Polly was at mister King s side with her face on his coat close to the little tear stained one 
4116_3582_000052_000001	train-clean-360	The fat little arms unclasped their hold and transferred themselves willingly to Polly s neck and Phronsie hugged up comfortingly to Polly s heart who poured into her ear all the loving words she had so longed to say 
none	none	Just then there was a great rush and a scuffling noise and something rushed up to Phronsie Oh And then the next minute she had her arms around Prince s neck too who was jumping all over her and trying as hard as he could to express his overwhelming delight
4116_3582_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 She s the cunningest little thing I ever saw said missus Whitney enthusiastically afterward aside to mister King 
none	none	Such lovely yellow hair and such exquisite brown eyes the combination is very striking How did her mother ever let her go she asked impulsively I didn t believe you could persuade her father
4116_3582_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I didn t have any fears if I worked it rightly said the old gentleman complacently 
4116_3582_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 I wasn t coming without her Marian if it could possibly be managed 
none	none	The truth is that Phronsie had been pining for Polly to such an extent that there was no other way but for her to have Polly and her mother was just on the point although it almost killed her of sending for Polly as if we should have let her go he cried in high dudgeon just as if he owned the whole of the Peppers and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy
4116_3582_000055_000003	train-clean-360	 So you see I was just in time in the very nick of time in fact 
4116_3582_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 So her mother was willing asked his daughter curiously 
none	none	Oh she couldn t help it cried mister King beginning to walk up and down the floor and beaming as he recalled his successful strategy there wasn t the smallest use in thinking of anything else I told her twould just stop Polly from ever being a musician if she broke off now and so twould you know yourself Marian for we should never get the child here again if we let her go now and I talked well I had to talk some but well the upshot is I did get her and I did bring her and here she is And the old gentleman was so delighted with his success that he had to burst out into a series of short happy bits of laughter that occupied quite a space of time 
4116_3582_000056_000003	train-clean-360	At last he came out of them and wiped his face vigorously 
none	none	And to think how fond the little girl is of you father said missus Whitney who hadn t yet gotten over her extreme surprise at the old gentleman s complete subjection to the little Peppers he whom all children had by instinct always approached so carefully and whom every one found it necessary to conciliate
4116_3582_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Well she s a nice child he said a very nice child and straightening himself up to his fullest height and looking so very handsome that his daughter could not conceal her admiration I shall always take care of Phronsie Pepper Marian 
4116_3582_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 So I hope said missus Whitney and father I do believe they ll repay you for I do think there s good blood there these children have a look about them that shows them worthy to be trusted 
4116_3582_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 So they have so they have assented mister King and then the conversation dropped 
none	none	PHRONSIE Phronsie was toiling up and down the long oak staircase the next morning slowly going from one step to the other drawing each little fat foot into place laboriously but with a pleased expression on her face that only gave some small idea of the rapture within Up and down she had been going for a long time perfectly fascinated seeming to care for nothing else in the world but to work her way up to the top of the long flight only to turn and come down again She had been going on so for some time till at last Polly who was afraid she would tire herself all out sat down at the foot and begged and implored the little girl who had nearly reached the top to stop and rest You ll be tired to death Phronsie she said looking up at the small figure on its toilsome journey Why you must have gone up a million times Do sit down pet we re all going out riding Phronsie this afternoon and you can t go if you re all tired out I won t be tired Polly said Phronsie turning around and looking at her do let me go just once more Well said Polly who never could refuse her anything just once Phronsie and then you must stop So Phronsie kept on her way rejoicing while Polly still sat on the lowest stair and drummed impatiently on the stair above her waiting for her to get through Jappy came through the hall and found them thus Halloa Polly he said stopping suddenly what s the matter Oh Phronsie s been going so said Polly looking up at the little figure above them which had nearly reached the top in delight that I can t stop her She has really Jappy almost all the morning you can t think how crazy she is over it Is that so said Jasper with a little laugh Hulloa Phronsie is it nice and he tossed a kiss to the little girl and then sat down by Polly Oh said Phronsie turning to come down it s the beyew tiflest place I ever saw Jasper the very be yew tiflest I wish she could have her picture painted whispered Jasper enthusiastically Look at her now Polly quick Yes said Polly isn t she sweet Sweet said Jasper I should think she was The sunlight through an oriel window fell on the childish face and figure glinting the yellow hair and lighting up the radiant face that yet had a tender loving glance for the two who waited for her below One little foot was poised just in the act of stepping down to the next lower stair and the fat hand grasped the polished railing expressive of just enough caution to make it truly childish In after years Jasper never thought of Phronsie without bringing up this picture on that April morning when Polly and he sat at the foot of the stairs and looked up and saw it Where s Jap called one of the boys and then there was a clatter out into the hall What are you doing and Van came to a full stop of amazement and stared at them Resting said Jappy concisely what do you want Van I want you said Van we can t do anything without you Jappy you know that Very well said Jasper getting up Come on Polly we must go And Phronsie said Van anxiously looking up to Phronsie who had nearly reached them by this time we want her too Of course said Polly running up and meeting her to give her a hug I don t go unless she does Where are we going Polly asked Phronsie looking back longingly to her beloved stairs as she was borne off To the greenhouse chick said Jasper to help Turner and it ll be good fun won t it Polly What is a greenhouse asked the child wonderingly All green Jasper Oh dear me said Van doubling up do you suppose she thinks it s painted green It s green inside Phronsie dear said Jasper kindly and that s the best of all When Phronsie was really let loose in the greenhouse she thought it decidedly best of all and she went into nearly as much of a rapture as Polly did on her first visit to it In a few moments she was cooing and jumping among the plants while old Turner staid and particular as he was laughed to see her go She s your sister Miss Mary ain t she at last he asked as Phronsie bent lovingly over a little pot of heath and just touched one little leaf carefully with her finger Yes said Polly but she don t look like me She is like you said Turner respectfully if she don t look like you and the flowers know it too he added and they ll love to see her coming just as they do you For Polly had won the old gardener s heart completely by her passionate love for flowers and nearly every morning a little nosegay fresh and beautiful came up to the house for Miss Mary And now nobody liked to think of the time or to look back to it when Phronsie hadn t been in the house When the little feet went pattering through halls and over stairs it seemed to bring sunshine and happiness into every one s heart just to hear the sounds Polly and the boys in the schoolroom would look up from their books and nod away brightly to each other and then fall to faster than ever on their lessons to get through the quicker to be with her again One thing Phronsie always insisted on and kept to it pertinaciously and that was to go into the drawing room with Polly when she went to practice and there with one of her numerous family of dolls to sit down quietly in some corner and wait till she got through Day after day she did it until Polly who was worried to think how tedious it must be for her would look around and say Oh childie do run out and play I want to stay Phronsie would beg in an injured tone please let me Polly So Polly would jump and give her a kiss and then delighted to know that she was there would go at her practicing with twice the vigor and enthusiasm But Phronsie s chief occupation at least when she wasn t with Polly was the entertainment and amusement of mister King And never was she very long absent from his side which so pleased the old gentleman that he could scarcely contain himself as with a gravity befitting the importance of her office she would follow him around in a happy contented way that took with him immensely And now a days no one ever saw the old gentleman going out of a morning when Jasper was busy with his lessons without Phronsie by his side and many people turned to see the portly figure with the handsome head bent to catch the prattle of a little sunny haired child who trotted along clasping his hand confidingly And nearly all of them stopped to gaze the second time before they could convince themselves that it was really that queer stiff old mister King of whom they had heard so much And now the accumulation of dolls in the house became something alarming for mister King observing Phronsie s devotion to her family thought there couldn t possibly be too many of them so he scarcely ever went out without bringing home one at least to add to them until Phronsie had such a remarkable collection as would have driven almost any other child nearly crazy with delight She however regarded them something in the light of a grave responsibility to be taken care of tenderly to be watched over carefully as to just the right kind of bringing up and to have small morals and manners taught in just the right way Phronsie was playing in the corner of missus Whitney s little boudoir engaged in sending out invitations for an elaborate tea party to be given by one of the dolls when Polly rushed in with consternation in her tones and dismay written all over her face What is it dear asked missus Whitney looking up from her embroidery Why said Polly how could I I don t see but I ve forgotten to write to mamsie to day it s Wednesday you know and there s Monsieur coming And poor Polly looked out in despair to see the lively little music teacher advancing towards the house at an alarming rate of speed That is because you were helping Van so long last evening over his lessons said missus Whitney I am so sorry Oh no cried Polly honestly I had plenty of time but I forgot twas mamsie s day What will she do You will have to let it go now till the afternoon dear there s no other way it can go in the early morning mail Oh dear sighed Polly I suppose I must And she went down to meet Monsieur with a very distressed little heart Phronsie laid down the note of invitation she was scribbling and stopped to think and a moment or two after at a summons from a caller missus Whitney left the room I know I ought to said Phronsie to herself and the dolls yes I know I had mamsie will feel oh so bad when she don t get Polly s letter and I know the way I do truly She got up and went to the window where she thought a minute and then coming back she took up her little stubby pencil and bending over a small bit of paper she commenced to trace with laborious efforts and much hard breathing some very queer hieroglyphics that to her seemed to be admirable as at last she held them up with great satisfaction Good bye she said then getting up and bowing to the dolls who sat among the interrupted invitations I won t be gone but a little bit of one minute and she went out determinedly and shut the door Nobody saw the little figure going down the carriage drive so of course nobody could stop her When Phronsie got to the gateway she looked up and down the street carefully either way Yes she said at last it was down here I m very sure I went with grandpa and immediately turned down the wrong way and went on and on grasping carefully her small and by this time rather soiled bit of paper At last she reached the business streets and although she didn t come to the Post Office she comforted herself by the thought it must be coming soon I guess it s round this corner She kept turning corner after corner until at last a little anxious feeling began to tug at her heart and she began to think I wish I could see Polly And now she had all she could do to get out of the way of the crowds of people who were pouring up and down the thoroughfare Everybody jostled against her and gave her a push Oh dear thought Phronsie there s such a many big people and then there was no time for anything else but to stumble in and out to keep from being crushed completely beneath their feet At last an old huckster woman in passing along knocked off her bonnet with the end of her big basket which flew around and struck Phronsie s head Not stopping to look into the piteous brown eyes she strode on without a word Phronsie turned in perfect despair to go down a street that looked as if there might be room enough for her in it Thoroughly frightened she plunged over the crossing to reach it Look out cried a ringing voice Stop The little girl ll be killed said others with bated breath as a powerful pair of horses whose driver could not pull them up in time dashed along just in front of her With one cry Phronsie sprang between their feet and reached the opposite curbstone in safety The plunge brought her up against a knot of gentlemen who were standing talking on the corner What s this asked one whose back being next to the street hadn t seen the commotion as the small object dashed into their midst and fell up against him Didn t you see that narrow escape asked a second whose face had paled in witnessing it This little girl was nearly killed a moment ago careless driving enough And he put out his hand to catch the child Bless me cried a third whirling around suddenly Bless me you don t say so why With a small cry but gladsome and distinct in its utterance Phronsie gave one look Oh grandpa was all she could say Oh where mister King couldn t possibly have uttered another word for then his breath gave out entirely as he caught the small figure I went to the Post Office said the child clinging to him in delight her tangled hair waving over the little white face into which a faint pink color was quickly coming back Only it wouldn t come and I walked and walked where is it grandpa And Phronsie gazed up anxiously into the old gentleman s face She went to the Post Office turning around on the others fiercely as if they had contradicted him Why my child what were you going to do Mamsie s letter said Phronsie holding up for inspection the precious bit which by this time was decidedly forlorn Polly couldn t write and Mamsie d feel so bad not to get one she would really said the child shaking her head very soberly for Polly said so And you ve been oh I can t think of it said mister King tenderly taking her up on his shoulder well we must get home now or I don t know what Polly will do And without stopping to say a word to his friends he hailed a passing carriage and putting Phronsie in he commanded the driver to get them as quickly as possible to their destination In a few moments they were home mister King pushed into the house with his burden Don t anybody know he burst out puffing up the stairs and scolding furiously at every step enough to take better care of this child than to have such goings on What is the matter father asked missus Whitney coming up the stairs after him What has happened out of the way Out of the way roared the old gentleman irascibly well if you want Phronsie racing off to the Post Office by herself and nearly getting killed poor child yes Marian I say nearly killed he continued What do you mean gasped missus Whitney Why where have you been asked the old gentleman who wouldn t let Phronsie get down out of his arms under any circumstances so there she lay poking up her head like a little bird and trying to say she wasn t in the least hurt where s everybody been not to know she d gone he exclaimed where s Polly and Jasper and all of em Polly s taking her music lesson said missus Whitney Oh Phronsie darling and she bent over the child in her father s arms and nearly smothered her with kisses Twas a naughty horse said Phronsie sitting up straight and looking at her or I should have found the Post Office and I lost off my bonnet too she added for the first time realizing her loss putting her hand to her head a bad old woman knocked it off with a basket and now mamsie won t get her letter and she waved the bit which she still grasped firmly between her thumb and finger sadly towards missus Whitney Oh dear groaned that lady how could we talk before her But who would have thought it Darling and she took the little girl from her father s arms who at last let her go don t think of your mamma s letter we ll tell her how it was and she sat down in the first chair that she could reach while Phronsie put her tumbled little head down on the kind shoulder and gave a weary little sigh It was so long she said and my shoes hurt and she thrust out the dusty little boots that spoke pathetically of the long and unaccustomed tramp Poor little lamb said mister King getting down to unbutton them What a shame he mumbled pulling off half of the buttons in his frantic endeavors to get them off quickly But Phronsie never heard the last of his observations for in a minute she was fast asleep The tangled hair fell off from the tired little face the breathing came peaceful and regular and with her little hand fast clasped in missus Whitney s she slept on and on Polly came flying up stairs two or three at a time and humming a scrap of her last piece that she had just conquered Phronsie she called with a merry little laugh where Hush said mister King warningly and then just because he couldn t explain there without waking Phronsie up he took hold of Polly s two shoulders and marched her into the next room where he carefully closed the door and told her the whole thing using his own discretion about the very narrow escape she had passed through He told enough however for Polly to see what had been so near them and she stood there so quietly alternately paling and flushing as he proceeded till at last when he finished mister King was frightened almost to death at the sight of her face Oh goodness me Polly he said striding up to her and then fumbling around on the table to find a glass of water you are not going to faint are you Phronsie s all well now she isn t hurt in the least I assure you I assure you where is a glass of water Marian ought to see that there s some here that stupid Jane and in utter bewilderment he was fussing here and there knocking down so many things in general that the noise soon brought Polly to with a little gasp Oh don t mind me dear mister King I m all well So you are said the old gentleman setting up a toilet bottle that he had knocked over so you are I didn t think you d go and tumble over Polly I really didn t and he beamed admiringly down on her And then Polly crept away to missus Whitney s side where she threw herself down on the floor to watch the little sleeping figure Her hand was gathered up into the kind one that held Phronsie s and there they watched and watched and waited Oh dear said Phronsie suddenly turning over with a little sigh and bobbing up her head to look at Polly I m so hungry I haven t had anything to eat in ever an ever so long Polly and she gazed at her with a very injured countenance So you must be said missus Whitney kissing the flushed little face Polly must ring the bell for Jane to bring this little bird some crumbs Can I have a great many asked Phronsie lifting her eyes with the dewy look of sleep still lingering in them as many as two birdies Yes dear said missus Whitney laughing I think as many as three little birdies could eat Phronsie Oh said Phronsie and leaned back satisfied while Polly gave the order which was presently followed by Jane with a well filled tray Now said Jappy when he heard the account of the adventure I say that letter ought to go to your mother Polly Oh said Polly it would scare mamsie most to death Jappy Don t tell her the whole said Jasper quickly I didn t mean that about the horses and all that but only enough to let her see how Phronsie tried to get it to her And I m going to write to your brother Joel said Van drawing up to the library table I ll scare him Polly I guess he won t tell your mother Your crow tracks ll scare him enough without anything else said Percy pleasantly who really could write very nicely while Polly broke out in an agony Oh no Van you mustn t you mustn t If Van does said Jasper decidedly it ll be the last time he ll write to the brown house I can tell him and besides he ll go to Coventry This had the desired effect Let s all write said Polly So a space on the table was cleared and the children gathered around it when there was great scratching of pens and clearing of ideas which presently resulted in a respectable budget of letters into which Phronsie s was lovingly tucked in the centre and then they all filed out to put it into the letterbox in the hall for Thomas to mail with the rest in the morning GETTING READY FOR MAMSIE AND THE BOYS And I ll tell you Marian what I am going to do mister King s voice was pitched on a higher key than usual and extreme determination was expressed in every line of his face He had met missus Whitney at the foot of the staircase dressed for paying visits Oh are you going out he said glancing impatiently at her attire And I d just started to speak to you on a matter of great importance Of the greatest importance indeed he repeated irritably as he stood with one gloved hand resting on the balustrade Oh it s no matter father she replied pleasantly if it s really important I can postpone going for another day and Really important repeated the old gentleman irascibly Haven t I just told you it s of the greatest importance There s no time to be lost and with my state of health too it s of the utmost consequence that I shouldn t be troubled It s very bad for me I should think you would realize that Marian I ll tell Thomas to take the carriage directly back said missus Whitney stepping to the door Or stay father I ll just run up and send the children out for a little drive The horses ought to be used too you know she said lightly preparing to run up to carry out the changed plan Never mind that now said mister King abruptly I want you to give me your attention directly And walking towards the library door getting a fresh accession of impatience with every step he beckoned her to follow But his progress was somewhat impeded by little Dick or rather little Dick and Prince who were standing at the top of the stairs to see missus Whitney off When he saw his mother retrace her steps supposing her yielding to the urgent entreaties that he was sending after her to stay at home the child suddenly changed his Good byes to vociferous howls of delight and speedily began to plunge down the stairs to welcome her But the staircase was long and little Dick was in a hurry and besides Prince was in the way The consequence was nobody knew just how that a bumping noise struck into the conversation that made the two below in the hall look up quickly to see the child and dog come rolling over the stairs at a rapid rate Zounds cried the old gentleman Here Thomas Thomas But as that individual was waiting patiently outside the door on the carriage box there was small hope of his being in time to catch the boy who was already in his mother s arms not quite clear by the suddenness of the whole thing as to how he came there Oh oh Dicky s hurt cried somebody up above followed by every one within hearing distance and all came rushing to the spot to ask a thousand questions all in the same minute There sat missus Whitney in one of the big carved chairs with little Dick in her lap and Prince walking gravely around and around him with the greatest expression of concern on his noble face mister King was storming up and down and calling on everybody to bring a bowl of water and some brown paper and be quick interpolated with showers of blame on Prince for sitting on the stairs and tripping people up while Dick meanwhile was laughing and chatting and enjoying the distinction of making so many people run and of otherwise being the object of so much attention I don t think he was sitting on the stairs father said Jasper who when he saw that Dicky was really unhurt began to vindicate his dog He never does that do you Sir he said patting the head that was lifted up to him as if to be defended And I expect we shall all be killed some day Jasper said mister King warming with his subject and forgetting all about the brown paper and water which he had ordered and which was now waiting for him at his elbow just by that creature He s the noblest began Jasper throwing his arms around his neck an example which was immediately followed by the Whitney boys and the two little Peppers When Dick saw this he began to struggle to get down to add himself to the number Where s the brown paper began mister King seeing this and whirling around suddenly Hasn t any body brought it yet Here tis sir said Jane handing him a generous supply Oh I don t want to cried little Dick in dismay seeing his grandfather advance with an enormous piece of paper which previously wet in the bowl of water was now unpleasantly clammy and wet oh no I don t want to be all stuck up with old horrid wet paper Hush dear said his mamma soothingly Grandpapa wants to put it on there as mister King dropped it scientifically on his head and then proceeded to paste another one over his left eye And I hope they ll all drop off cried Dick savagely shaking his head to facilitate matters Yes I do every single one of em he added with an expression that seen under the brown bits was anything but benign Was Prince on the stairs Dick asked Jasper coming up and peering under his several adornments Tell us how you fell No said little Dick crossly and giving his head another shake He was up in the hall oh dear I want to get down and he began to stretch his legs and to struggle with so much energy that two or three pieces fell off and landed on the floor to his intense delight And how did you fall then said Jasper perseveringly Can t you remember Dicky boy I pushed Princey said Dick feeling with freedom from some of his encumbrances more disposed for conversation and made him go ahead and then I fell on top of him that s all I guess Prince has saved him father cried Jasper turning around with eyes full of pride and love on the dog who was trying as hard as he could to tell all the children how much he enjoyed their caresses And so it all came about that the consultation so summarily interrupted was never held For as missus Whitney was about retiring that evening mister King rapped at her door on his way to bed Oh he said popping in his head in response to her invitation to come in it s nothing only I thought I d just tell you a word or two about what I ve decided to do Do you mean what you wanted to see me about this afternoon asked missus Whitney who hadn t thought of it since Do come in father It s no consequence said the old gentleman no consequence at all he repeated waving his hand emphatically because I ve made up my mind and arranged all my plans it s only about the Peppers The Peppers repeated missus Whitney Yes Well the fact of it is I m going to have them here for a visit the whole of them you understand that s all there is to it And I shall go down to see about all the arrangements Jasper and I day after to morrow said the old gentleman as if he owned the whole Pepper family inclusive and was the only responsible person to be consulted about their movements Will they come asked missus Whitney doubtfully Come of course said mister King sharply there isn t any other way or else missus Pepper will be sending for her children and of course you know Marian we couldn t allow that well that s all so good night and the door closed on his retreating footsteps And so Polly and Phronsie soon knew that mamsie and the boys were to be invited And then the grand house big as it was didn t seem large enough to contain them I declare said Jasper next day when they had been laughing and planning till they were all as merry as grigs if this old dungeon don t begin to seem a little like the little brown house Polly Twon t answered Polly hopping around on one toe followed by Phronsie till mamsie and the boys get here Jasper King Well they ll be here soon said Jappy pleased at Polly s exultation over it for we re going to morrow to do the inviting And Polly s to write a note to slip into Marian s said mister King putting his head in at the door And if you want your mother to come child why you d better mention it as strong as you can I m going to write said Phronsie pulling up after a prolonged skip all out of breath I m going to write and beg mamsie dear Then she ll come I guess I guess she will said mister King looking at her You go on Phronsie and write and that letter shall go straight in my coat pocket alone by itself Shall it asked Phronsie coming up to him and nobody will take it out till you give it to mamsie No nobody shall touch it said the old gentleman stooping to kiss the upturned face till I put it into her own hand Then said Phronsie in the greatest satisfaction I m going to write this very one minute and she marched away to carry her resolve into immediate execution Before they got through they had quite a bundle of invitations and pleadings for each of the three boys insisted on doing his part so that when they were finally done up in an enormous envelope and put into mister King s hands he told them with a laugh that there was no use for Jappy and himself to go as those were strong enough to win almost anybody s consent However the next morning they set off happy in their hopes and bearing the countless messages which the children would come up every now and then to intrust to them declaring that they had forgotten to put them in the letters You d had to have had an express wagon to carry the letters if you had put them all in at last cried Jasper You ve given us a bushel of things to remember And oh don t forget to ask Ben to bring Cherry cried Polly the last minute as they were driving off although she had put it in her letter at least a dozen times and oh dear of course the flowers can t come We ve got plenty here said Jasper You would not know what to do with them Polly Well I do wish mamsie would give some to kind missus Henderson then said Polly on the steps clasping her hands anxiously while Jasper told Thomas to wait till he heard the rest of the message and to grandma you know Grandma Bascom she was so good to us she said impulsively And oh don t let her forget to carry some to dear dear doctor Fisher and don t forget to give him our love Jappy don t forget that and Polly ran down the steps to the carriage door where she gazed up imploringly to the boy s face I guess I won t cried Jasper when I think how he saved your eyes Polly He s the best fellow I know he finished in an impulsive burst And don t let mamsie forget to carry some in to good old mister and missus Beebe in town where Phronsie got her shoes you know that is if mamsie can she added remembering how very busy her mother would be I ll carry them myself said Jasper we re going to stay over till the next day you know O cried Polly radiant as a rose will you really Jappy you re so good Yes I will said Jasper everything you want done Polly anything else he asked quickly as mister King impatient to be off showed unmistakable symptoms of hurrying up Thomas Oh no said Polly only do look at the little brown house Jasper as much as you can and Polly left the rest unfinished Jasper seemed to understand however for he smiled brightly as he said looking into the brown eyes I ll do it all Polly every single thing And then they were off Mamsie and the boys could Polly ever wait till the next afternoon that would bring the decision Long before it was possibly time for the carriage to come back from the depot Polly with Phronsie and the three boys who improving Jasper s absence had waited upon her with the grace and persistence of cavaliers of the olden time were drawn up at the old stone gateway Oh dear said Van with an impatient fling they never will come Won t they Polly asked Phronsie anxiously and standing quite still Dear me yes said Polly with a little laugh Van only means they ll be a good while Phronsie They re sure to come some time Oh said Phronsie quite relieved and she commenced her capering again in extreme enjoyment I m going said little Dick to run down and meet them Accordingly off he went and was immediately followed by Percy who started with the laudable desire of bringing him back but finding it so very enjoyable he stayed himself and frolicked with Dick till the others hearing the fun all took hold of hands and flew off to join them Now said Polly when they recovered their breath a little let s all turn our backs to the road and the minute we hear the carriage we must whirl round and the one who sees em first can ask first Is mamsie coming All right cried the boys Turn round Dick said Percy with a little shove for Dick was staring with all his might right down the road And so they all flew around till they looked like five statues set up to grace the sidewalk Suppose a big dog should come suggested Van pleasantly and snap at our backs At this little Dick gave a small howl and turned around in a fright There isn t any dog coming said Polly What does make you say such awful things Van I hear a noise said Phronsie and so they all whirled around in expectation But it proved to be only a market wagon coming at a furious pace down the road with somebody s belated dinner So they all had to whirl back again as before The consequence was that when the carriage did come nobody heard it Jasper looking out was considerably astonished to see drawn up in solemn array with their backs to the road five children who stood as if completely petrified What in the world he began and called to Thomas to stop whose energetic Whoa reaching the ears of the frozen line caused it to break ranks and spring into life at an alarming rate Oh is she coming Jappy Is she Is she they all screamed together swarming up to the carriage door and over the wheels Yes said Jasper looking at Polly At that Phronsie made a little cheese and sat right down on the pavement in an ecstasy Get in here all of you said Jasper merrily help Polly in first For shame Dick don t scramble so Dick always shoves said Percy escorting Polly up with quite an air I don t either said Dick you pushed me awful just a little while ago he added indignantly Do say awfully corrected Van crowding up to get in You leave off your lys so he finished critically I don t know anything about any lees said little Dick who usually so good natured was now thoroughly out of temper I want to get in and go home and he showed evident symptoms of breaking into a perfect roar There said Polly lilting him up there he goes now one two three and little Dick was spun in so merrily that the tears changed into a happy laugh Now then bundle in all the rest of you put in mister King who seemed to be in the best of spirits That s it go on Thomas When are they coming Polly found time to ask in the general jumble In three weeks from to morrow said Jasper And everything s all right Polly and the whole of them Cherry and all will be here then Oh said Polly Here we are cried Van jumping out almost before the carriage door was open Mamma mamma he shouted to missus Whitney in the doorway the Peppers are coming and the little brown house too everything and everybody They are said Percy as wild as his brother and everything s just splendid Jappy said so Everything s coming said little Dick tumbling up the steps and the bird and and And mamsie finished Phronsie impatient to add her part while Polly didn t say anything only looked Three weeks I can t wait thought Polly at first in counting over the many hours before the happy day would come But on Jasper s suggesting that they should all do something to get ready for the visitors and have a general trimming up with vines and flowers beside the time passed away much more rapidly than was feared Polly chose a new and more difficult piece of music to learn to surprise mamsie Phronsie had aspired to an elaborate pin cushion that was nearly done made of bits of worsted and canvas over whose surface she had wandered according to her own sweet will in a way charming to behold I don t know what to do said Van in despair cause I don t know what she d like Can t you draw her a little picture asked Polly She d like that Does she like pictures asked Van with the greatest interest Yes indeed said Polly I guess you d think so if you could see her I know what I shall do with a dignified air said Percy who couldn t draw and therefore looked down on all Van s attempts with the greatest scorn And it won t be any old pictures either he added What is it old fellow asked Jasper tell on now your grand plan No I m not going to tell said Percy with the greatest secrecy until the very day What will you do sir asked Jasper pulling one of Dick s ears who stood waiting to speak as if his mind was made up and wouldn t be changed for anyone I shall give Ben one of my kitties the littlest and the best he said with heroic self sacrifice A perfect shout greeted this announcement Fancy Ben going round with one of those awful little things whispered Jappy to Polly who shook at the very thought Don t laugh oh it s dreadful to laugh at him Jappy she said when she could get voice enough No I sha n t tell said Percy when the fun had subsided who finding that no one teased him to divulge his wonderful plan kept trying to harrow up their feelings by parading it You needn t then screamed Van who was nearly dying to know I don t believe it s so very dreadful much anyway What s yours Jappy asked Polly I know yours will be just splendid Oh no it isn t said Jasper smiling brightly but as I didn t know what better I could do I m going to get a little stand and then beg some flowers of Turner to fill it and Why that s mine screamed Percy in the greatest disappointment That s just what I was going to do Hoh hoh shouted Van I thought you wouldn t tell mister Percy hoh hoh Hoh hoh echoed Dick Hush said Jappy Why Percy I didn t know as you had thought of that he said kindly Well then you do it and I ll take something else I don t care as long as missus Pepper gets em I didn t exactly mean that began Percy mine was roots and little flowers growing He means what he gets in the woods said Polly explaining don t you Percy Yes said the boy And then I was going to put stones and things in among them to make them look pretty And they will cried Jasper Go ahead Percy they ll look real pretty and then Turner will give you some flowers for the stand I know I ll ask him to morrow Will you cried Percy that ll be fine Mine is the best said Van just at this juncture but it was said a little anxiously as he saw how things were prospering with Percy for my flowers in the picture will always be there and your old roots and things will die What will yours be then Jappy asked Polly very soberly The stand of flowers would have been just lovely and you do fix them so nice she added sorrowfully Oh I ll find something else said Jappy cheerfully who had quite set his heart on giving the flowers Let me see I might carve her a bracket Do cried Polly clapping her hands enthusiastically And do carve a little bird like the one you did on your father s I will said Jasper just exactly like it Now we ve got something to do before we welcome the little brown house people so let s fly at it and the time won t seem so long And at last the day came when they could all say To morrow they ll be here Well the vines were all up and pots of lovely climbing ferns and all manner of pretty green things had been arranged and re arranged a dozen times till everything was pronounced perfect and a big green Welcome over the library door made of laurel leaves by the patient fingers of all the children stared down into their admiring eyes as much as to say I ll do my part Oh dear said Phronsie when evening came and the children were as usual assembled on the rug before the fire their tongues running wild with anticipation and excitement I don t mean to go to bed at all Polly I don t truly Oh yes you do said Polly laughing then you ll be all fresh and rested to see mammy when she does come Oh no said Phronsie shaking her head soberly and speaking in an injured tone I m not one bit tired Polly not one bit You needn t go yet Phronsie said Polly You can sit up half an hour yet if you want to But I don t want to go to bed at all said the child anxiously for then I may be asleep when mamsie comes Polly She s afraid she won t wake up said Percy laughing Oh there ll be oceans of time before they come Phronsie What is oceans asked Phronsie coming up and looking at him doubtfully He means mamsie won t get here till afternoon said Polly catching her up and kissing her then I guess you ll be awake Phronsie pet So Phronsie allowed herself to be persuaded at the proper time to be carried off and inducted into her little nightgown And when Polly went up to bed she found the little pin cushion with its hieroglyphics that she had insisted on taking to bed with her still tightly grasped in the little fat hand She ll roll over and muss it thought Polly and then she ll feel bad in the morning I guess I d better lay it on the bureau So she drew it carefully away without awaking the little sleeper and placed it where she knew Phronsie s eyes would rest on it the first thing in the morning It was going on towards the middle of the night when Phronsie whose exciting dreams of mamsie and the boys wouldn t let her rest quietly woke up and in the very first flash she thought of her cushion Why where she said in the softest little tones only half awake why Polly where is it and she began to feel all around her pillow to see if it had fallen down there But Polly s brown head with its crowd of anticipations and busy plans was away off in dreamland and she breathed on and on perfectly motionless I guess I better said Phronsie to herself now thoroughly awake and sitting up in bed not wake her up Poor Polly s tired I can find it myself I know I can So she slipped out of bed and prowling around on the floor felt all about for the little cushion Tisn t here oh no it isn t she sighed at last and getting up she stood still a moment lost in thought Maybe Jane s put it out in the hall she said as a bright thought struck her I can get it there and out she pattered over the soft carpet to the table at the end of the long hall where Jane often placed the children s playthings over night As she was coming back after her fruitless search she stopped to peep over the balustrade down the fascinating flight of stairs now so long and dark Just then a little faint ray of light shot up from below and met her eyes Why she said in gentle surprise they re all down stairs I guess they re making something for mamsie I m going to see So carefully picking her way over the stairs with her little bare feet and holding on to the balustrade at every step she went slowly down guided by the light which as she neared the bottom of the flight she saw came from the library door Oh isn t it funny and she gave a little happy laugh They won t know I m comin and now the soft little feet went pattering over the thick carpet until she stood just within the door There she stopped perfectly still Two dark figures big and powerful were bending over something that Phronsie couldn t see between the two big windows A lantern on the floor flung its rays over them as they were busily occupied and the firelight from the dying coals made the whole stand out distinctly to the gaze of the motionless little figure Why what are you doing with my grandpa s things The soft clear notes fell like a thunderbolt upon the men With a start they brought themselves up and stared only to see a little white robed figure with its astonished eyes uplifted with childlike earnest gaze as she waited for her answer For an instant they were powerless to move and stood as if frozen to the spot till Phronsie moving one step forward piped forth Naughty men to touch my dear grandpa s things With a smothered cry one of them started forward with arm uplifted but the other sprang like a cat and intercepted the blow Stop was all he said A noise above the stairs a rushing sound through the hall Something will save Phronsie for the household is aroused The two men sprang through the window having no time to catch the lantern or their tools as Polly followed by one and another rushed in and surrounded the child What gasped Polly and got no further STOP THIEF roared mister King hurrying over the stairs The children frightened at the strange noises began to cry and scream as they came running through the halls to the spot Jasper rushed for the men servants And there stood Phronsie surrounded by the pale group Twas two naughty men she said lifting her little face with the grieved astonished look still in the big brown eyes and they were touching my grandpa s things Polly I should think they were said Jasper running over amongst the few scattered tools and the lantern to the windows where on the floor was a large table cover hastily caught up by the corners into which a vast variety of silver jewelry and quantities of costly articles were gathered ready for flight They ve broken open your safe father he cried in excitement see And they put up their hand one man did went on Phronsie And the other said Stop oh Polly you hurt me she cried as Polly unable to bear the strain any longer held her so tightly she could hardly breathe Go on said Jasper how did they look All black said the child pushing back her wavy hair and looking at him very all black Jasper And their faces Phronsie said mister King getting down on his old knees on the floor beside her Bless me somebody else ask her I can t talk How did their faces look Phronsie dear asked Jasper taking one of the cold hands in his Can t you think Oh said Phronsie and then she gave a funny little laugh two big holes Jasper that s all they had She means they were masked whispered Jasper What did you get up for missus Whitney asked Dear child what made you get out of bed Why my cushion pin said Phronsie looking worried at once I couldn t find it and But just at this without a bit of warning Polly tumbled over in a dead faint And then it was all confusion again And so on the following afternoon it turned out that the Peppers about whose coming there had been so many plans and expectations just walked in as if they had always lived there The greater excitement completely swallowed up the less WHICH TREATS OF A GOOD MANY MATTERS Phooh said Joel a few mornings after the emptying of the little brown house into the big one when he and Van were rehearsing for the fiftieth time all the points of the eventful night phooh if I d been here they wouldn t have got away I guess What would you have done asked Van bristling up at this reflection on their courage and squaring up to him What would you have done Joel Pepper I d a pitched right into em like everything said Joel valiantly and a caught em Yes every single one of the Bunglers The what said Van bursting into a loud laugh The Bunglers said Joel with a red face That s what you said they were anyway he added positively I said Burglars said Van doubling up with amusement while Joel stood a little sturdy figure regarding him with anything but a sweet countenance Well anyway I d a caught em so there he said as Van at last showed signs of coming out of his fit of laughter and got up and wiped his eyes How d you have caught em asked Van scornfully surveying the square little country figure before him You can t hit any Can t said Joel the black eyes flashing volumes and coming up in front of Van You better believe I can Van Whitney Come out in the back yard and try then said Van hospitably perfectly delighted at the prospect and flying alone towards the door Come right out and try All right said Joel following sturdily equally delighted to show his skill There said Van taking off his jacket and flinging it on the grass while Joel immediately followed suit with his little homespun one Now we can begin perfectly splendid I won t hit hard he added patronizingly as both boys stood ready Hit as hard as you ve a mind to said Joel I m a going to Oh you may said Van politely because you re company All right now So at it they went Before very many minutes were over Van relinquished all ideas of treating his company with extra consideration and was only thinking how he could possibly hold his own with the valiant little country lad Oh if he could only be called to his lessons anything that would summon him into the house Just then a window above their heads was suddenly thrown up and his mamma s voice in natural surprise and distress called quickly Children what are you doing Oh Van how could you Both contestants turned around suddenly Joel looked up steadily We re a hitting ma am he said I couldn t and so we came out and Oh Vanny said missus Whitney reproachfully to treat a little guest in this way I wanted to said Joel cheerfully twas great fun Let s begin again Van We mustn t said Van readily giving up the charming prospect and beginning to edge quickly towards the house Mamma wouldn t like it you know He hits splendidly mamma he added generously looking up He does really And so does Van cried Joel his face glowing at the praise We ll come out every day he added slipping into his jacket and turning enthusiastically back to Van And perhaps he could have pitched into the Burglars finished Van ignoring the invitation and tumbling into his jacket with alarming speed I know I could cried Joel scampering after him into the house If I d only a been here Where s Ben said Van bounding into the hall and flinging himself down on one of the chairs Oh dear I m so hot Say Joe where do you s pose Ben is I don t know replied Joel who didn t even puff I saw him a little while ago with master Percy said Jane who was going through the hall There now and they ve gone off somewhere cried Van in extreme irritation and starting up quickly I know they have Which way did they go Jane And how long ago Oh I don t know replied Jane carelessly half an hour maybe and they didn t go nowhere as I see at least they were talking at the door and I was going up stairs Right here cried Van and stamping with his foot to point out the exact place at this door Jane Yes yes said Jane at that very door and then she went into the dining room to her work Oh dear me cried Van and flying out on the veranda he began to peer wildly up and down the drive And they ve gone to some splendid place I know and wouldn t tell us That s just like Percy he added vindictively he s always stealing away don t you see em Joel oh do come out and look Tisn t any use said Joel coolly sitting down on the chair Van had just vacated and swinging his feet comfortably they re miles away if they ve been gone half an hour I m goin up stairs and he sprang up and energetically pranced to the stairs They aren t up stairs screamed Van in scorn bounding into the hall Don t go I know that they ve gone down to the museum The what exclaimed Joel nearly at the top peering over the railing What s that you said what is it A museum shouted Van and it s a perfectly elegant place Joel Pepper and Percy knows I like to go and now he s taken Ben off and he ll show him all the things and they ll all be old when I take him and and oh I hope the snakes will bite him he added trying to think of something bad enough Do they have snakes there asked Joel staring Yes they do snapped out Van They have everything Well they shan t bite Ben cried Joel in terror Oh do you suppose they will and he turned right straight around on the stairs and looked at Van No said Van they won t bite what s the matter Joe Oh they may said Joel his face working and screwing both fists into his eyes at last he burst right out into a torrent of sobs Oh don t let em Van don t Why they can t said Van in an emphatic voice running up the stairs to Joel s side frightened to death at his tears Then he began to shake his jacket sleeve violently to bring him back to reason Wait Joe oh do stop oh dear what shall I do I tell you they can t bite he screamed as loud as he could into his ear You said you hoped they would said Joel s voice in smothered tones Well they won t anyway said Van decidedly Cause they re all stuffed so there now Ain t they alive nor anythin asked Joel bringing one black eye into sight from behind his chubby hands No said Van they re just as dead as anything Joel Pepper been dead years and there s old crabs there too old dead crabs and they re just lovely Oh such a lots of eggs as they ve got And there are shells and bugs and stones and an awful old crocodile and Oh dear sighed Joel perfectly overcome at such a vision and sitting down on the stairs to think Well mamsie ll know where Ben is he said springing up And then I tell you Van we ll just tag em So she will cried Van Why didn t we think of that before I wanted to think I did said Joel That was where I was goin Without any more ado they rushed into missus Pepper s big sunny room there to see seated at the square table between the two large windows the two lost ones bending over what seemed to be an object of the greatest importance for Polly was hanging over Ben s shoulder with intense pride and delight which she couldn t possibly conceal and Davie was crowded as near as he could get to Percy s elbow Phronsie and little Dick were perched comfortably on the corner of the table surveying the whole scene in quiet rapture and missus Pepper with her big mending basket was ensconced over by the deep window seat just on the other side of the room underneath Cherry s cage and looking up between quick energetic stitches over at the busy group with the most placid expression on her face Oh what you doin cried Joel flying up to them Let us see do Ben What is it exclaimed Van squeezing in between Percy and Ben Don t began Percy There see you ve knocked his elbow and spoilt it Oh no he hasn t said Ben putting down his pencil and taking up a piece of rubber There see it all comes out as good as ever Isn t it just elegant said Percy in the most pleased tone and wriggling his toes under the table to express his satisfaction Yes said Van craning his neck to get a better view of the picture now nearly completed It s perfectly splendid How d you do it Ben I don t know replied Ben with a smile carefully shading in a few last touches It just drew itself Tisn t anything to what he can do said Polly standing up as tall as she could and beaming at Ben He used to draw most beautiful at home Better than this asked Van with great respect and taking up the picture after some demur on Percy s part and examining it critically I don t believe it Polly Phooh he did exclaimed Joel looking over his shoulder at a wonderful view of a dog in an extremely excited state of mind running down an interminable hill to bark at a locomotive and train of cars whizzing along a curve in the foreground Lots better n that Ben can do anything he added in an utterly convincing way Now give it back cried Percy holding out his hand in alarm I m going to ask mamma to have it framed and then I m going to hang it right over my bed he finished as Van reluctantly gave up the treasure Did you draw all the time in the little brown house asked Van lost in thought How I wish I d been there Dear no cried Polly with a little skip turning away to laugh He didn t have hardly any time and Why not asked Percy Cause there was things to do said Polly But sometimes when it rained and he couldn t go out and work and there wasn t anything to do in the house then we d have oh and she drew a long breath at the memory such a time you can t think Didn t you wish it would always rain asked Van still gazing at the picture Dear no began Polly I didn t broke in Joel in horror I wouldn t a had it rain for anything only once in a while he added as he thought of the good times that Polly had spoken of Twas nice outdoors said little Davie reflectively and nice inside too And then he glanced over to his mother who gave him a smile in return And twas nice always Well said Van returning to the picture I do wish you d tell me how to draw Ben I can t do anything but flowers he said in a discouraged way Flowers aren t anything said Percy pleasantly That s girls work but dogs and horses and cars those are just good Will you Ben asked Van looking down into the big blue eyes so kindly turned up to his Yes indeed I will cried Ben that is all I know tisn t much but everything I can I ll tell you Then I can learn can t I cried Van joyfully Oh tell me too Ben cried Percy will you I want to learn too And me cried Dick bending forward nearly upsetting Phronsie as he did so Yes say I may Ben do You re too little began Percy But Ben nodded his head at Dick which caused him to clap his hands and return to his original position satisfied Well I guess we re going to too said Joel Dave an me there isn t anybody goin to learn without us Of course not said Polly Ben wouldn t leave you out Joey Phronsie sat quite still all this time on the corner of the table her feet tucked up under her and her hands clasped in her lap and never said a word But Ben looking up saw the most grieved expression settling on her face as the large eyes were fixed in wonder on the faces before her And there s my pet he cried in enthusiasm and reaching over the table he caught hold of one of the little fat hands Why we couldn t think of getting along without her She shall learn to draw she shall Really Bensie said Phronsie the sunlight breaking all over the gloomy little visage and setting the brown eyes to dancing Real true splendid pictures Yes the splendidest said Ben the very splendidest pictures Phronsie Pepper you ever saw Oh cried Phronsie and before any one knew what she was about she tripped right into the middle of the table over the papers and everything and gave a happy little whirl Dear me Phronsie cried Polly catching her up and hugging her you mustn t dance on the table I m going to learn said Phronsie coming out of Polly s embrace to draw whole pictures all alone by myself Ben said so I know it said Polly and then you shall draw one for mamsie you shall I will said Phronsie dreadfully excited I ll draw her a cow and two chickens Polly just like Grandma Bascom s Yes whispered Polly but don t you tell her yet till you get it done Phronsie I won t said Phronsie in the loudest of tones but putting her mouth close to Polly s ear And then she ll be so s prised Polly won t she Just then came Jasper s voice at the door Can I come in Oh do Jappy cried Polly rushing along with Phronsie in her arms to open the door We re so glad you ve got home So am I said Jasper coming in his face flushed and his eyes sparkling I thought father never would be through downtown Polly We re going to learn to draw said Percy over by the table who wouldn t on any account leave his seat by Ben though he was awfully tired of sitting still so long for fear somebody else would hop into it Ben s going to teach us Yes he is put in Van bounding up to Jasper and pulling at all the buttons on his jacket he could reach to command attention And us said Joel coming up too You forgot us Van The whole of us every single one in this room said Van decidedly all except missus Pepper Hulloa said Jasper that is a class Well Professor Ben you ve got to teach me then for I m coming too You said Ben turning around his chair and looking at him I can t teach you anything Jappy You know everything already Let him come anyway said Polly hopping up and down Oh I m coming Professor laughed Jasper Never you fear Polly I ll be on hand when the rest of the class comes in And Van said missus Pepper pausing a minute in her work and smiling over at him in a lull in the chatter I think flowers are most beautiful and she pointed to a little framed picture on the mantel of the bunch of buttercups and one huge rose that Van had with infinite patience drawn and then colored to suit his fancy Do you cried Van perfectly delighted and leaving the group he rushed up to her side Do you really think they re nice missus Pepper Of course I do said missus Pepper briskly and beaming on him I think everything of them and I shall keep them as long as I live Van Well then said Van very much pleased I shall paint you ever so many more just as many as you want Do said missus Pepper taking up her work again And I ll hang them every one up Yes I will said Van and I ll go right to work on one to morrow What you mending our jackets for he asked abruptly as a familiar hole caught his attention Because they re torn said missus Pepper cheerfully an they won t mend themselves Why don t you let Jane he persisted She always does them Jane s got enough to do replied missus Pepper smiling away as hard as she could and I haven t so I m going to look around and pick up something to keep my hands out of mischief as much as I can while I m here Do you ever get into mischief asked little Dick coming up and looking into missus Pepper s face wonderingly Why you re a big woman Dear me yes said missus Pepper The bigger you are the more mischief you can get into You ll find that out Dickey And then do you have to stand in a corner asked Dick determined to find out just what were the consequences and reverting to his most dreaded punishment No said missus Pepper laughing Corners are for little folks but when people who know better do wrong there aren t any corners they can creep into or they d get into them pretty quick I wish said little Dick you d let me get into your lap That would be a nice corner Do mamsie said Polly coming up that s just the way I used to feel and I ll finish the mending So missus Pepper put down her work and moved the big basket for little Dick to clamber up when he laid his head contentedly back in her motherly arms with a sigh of happiness Phronsie regarded him with a very grave expression At last she drew near I m tired do mamsie take me So mamsie will said missus Pepper opening her arms when Phronsie immediately crawled up into their protecting shelter with a happy little crow Oh now tell us a story missus Pepper cried Van please please do No no exclaimed Percy scuttling out of his chair and coming up let s talk of the little brown house Do tell us what you used to do there that s best So tis cried Van ALL the nice times you used to have in it Wait just a minute do And he ran back for a cricket which he placed at missus Pepper s feet and then sitting down on it he leaned on her comfortable lap in order to hear better Wait for me too till I get a chair called Percy starting Don t begin till I get there Here let me Percy said Ben and he drew forward a big easy chair that the boy was tugging at with all his might Now I m ready too said Polly setting small finishing stitches quickly with a merry little flourish and drawing her chair nearer her mother s as she spoke Now begin please said Van all the nice times you know She couldn t tell all the nice times if she had ten years to tell them in could she Polly said Jasper Well in the first place then said missus Pepper clearing her throat the little brown house had got to be you know so we made up our minds to make it just the nicest brown house that ever was And it was declared Jasper with an emphatic ring to his voice The very nicest place in the whole world Oh dear broke in Van enviously Jappy s always said so I wish we d been there too We didn t want anybody but Jappy said Joel not very politely Oh Joey for shame cried Polly Jappy used to bake cried little Davie an we all made pies an then we sat round an ate em an then told stories Oh what fun cried Percy Do tell us So the five little Peppers and Jasper flew off into reminiscences and accounts of the funny doings and missus Pepper joined in heartily till the room got very merry with the glee and enthusiasm called forth so much so that nobody heard missus Whitney knock gently at the door and nobody answering she was obliged to come in by herself Well well she cried merrily looking at the swarm of little ones around missus Pepper and the big chair You are having a nice time May I come and listen Oh if you will sister cried Jasper springing off from his arm of the chair while Ben flew from the other side to hurry and get her a chair Percy and Van rushed too knocking over so many things that they didn t help much and little Dick poked his head out from missus Pepper s arms when he saw his mamma sitting down to stay and began to scramble down to get into her lap There now said missus Whitney smiling over at missus Pepper who was smiling at her You have your baby and I have mine Now children what s it all about What has missus Pepper been telling you Oh the little brown house cried Dicky his cheeks all a flame The dearest little house mamma I wish I could live in one Twouldn t be the same without the Peppers in it said Jasper Not a bit of it And they had such perfectly elegant times cried Percy enviously drawing up to her side Oh you can t think mamma Well now said his mamma do go on and let me hear some of the nice times So away they launched again and missus Whitney was soon enjoying it as hugely as the children when a heavy step sounded in the middle of the room and a voice spoke in such a tone that everybody skipped Well I should like to know what all this means I ve been all over the house and not a trace of anybody could I find Oh father cried missus Whitney Van dear get up and get grandpapa a chair No no said the old gentleman waving him off impatiently I m not going to stay I must go and lie down My head is in a bad condition to day very bad indeed he added Oh said Phronsie popping up her head and looking at him I must get right down What s the matter Phronsie asked missus Pepper trying to hold her back Oh but I must said Phronsie energetically wriggling My poor sick man wants me he does And flying out of her mother s arms she ran up to mister King and standing on tiptoe said softly I ll rub your head grandpa dear poor sick man yes I will And you re the best child cried the old gentleman catching her up and marching over to the other side of the room where there was a lounging chair There now you and I Phronsie will stay by ourselves Then my head will feel better And he sat down and drew her into his arms Does it ache very bad said Phronsie in a soft little voice Then reaching up she began to pat and smooth it gently with one little hand Very bad dear grandpa It won t said the old gentleman if you only keep on taking care of it little Phronsie Then said the child perfectly delighted I m going to take all care of you grandpa always So you shall so you shall cried mister King no less delighted than she was missus Pepper Sir said missus Pepper trying to answer which she couldn t do very well surrounded as she was by the crowd of little chatterers Yes Sir excuse me what is it sir We ve got to come to an understanding about this thing said the old gentleman and I can t talk much to day because my headache won t allow it Here the worried look came into Phronsie s face again and she began to try to smooth his head with both little hands And so I must say it all in as few words as possible he continued What is it sir again asked missus Pepper wonderingly Well the fact is I ve got to have somebody who will keep this house Now Marian not a word as he saw symptoms of missus Whitney s joining in the conversation You ve been good just as good as can be under the circumstances but Mason will be home in the fall and then I suppose you ll have to go with him Now I said the old gentleman forgetting all about his head and straightening himself up suddenly in the chair am going to get things into shape so that the house will be kept for all of us so that we can come or go And how can I do it better than to have the Peppers you missus Pepper and all your children come here and live and Oh father cried Jasper rushing up to him and flinging his arms around his neck he gave him such a hug as he hadn t received for many a day Goodness Jasper cried his father feeling of his throat How can you express your feelings so violently And besides you interrupt Beg pardon sir said Jasper swallowing his excitement and trying to control his eagerness Do you say yes missus Pepper queried the old gentleman impatiently I must get this thing fixed up to day I m really too ill to be worried ma am Why sir stammered missus Pepper I don t know what to say I couldn t think of imposing all my children on you and Imposing Who s talking of imposing said mister King in a loud key I want my house kept will you live here and keep it That is the question But sir began missus Pepper again you don t think I do think I tell you ma am I do think snapped the old gentleman It s just because I have thought that I ve made up my mind Will you do it missus Pepper What are you goin to do mamsie asked Joel quickly I don t know as I m going to do anything yet said poor missus Pepper who was almost stunned To come here and live cried Jasper unable to keep still any longer and springing to the children Don t you want to Joe To live screamed Joel
5400_3587_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh whickety 
none	none	yes Do ma do come here and live do To live echoed Phronsie over in the old gentleman s lap In this be yew ti ful place Oh oh Oh mamsie that was all Polly could say And even Ben had his arms around his mother s neck whispering Do into her ear while little Davie got into her lap and teased her with all his might What shall I do cried the poor woman Did ever anybody see the like It s the very best thing you could possibly do cried the old gentleman Don t you see it s for the children s advantage They ll get such educations missus Pepper as you want for them And it accommodates me immensely What obstacle can there be to it If I was only sure twas best said missus Pepper doubtfully Oh dear missus Pepper said missus Whitney laying her hand on hers Can you doubt it Then said mister King getting up but still holding on to Phronsie we ll consider it settled This is your home children he said waving his hand at the five little Peppers in a bunch And having thus summarily disposed of the whole business he marched out with Phronsie on his shoulder POLLY S DISMAL MORNING 
4967_3586_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Everything had gone wrong with Polly that day 
4967_3586_000003_000001	train-clean-360	It began with her boots 
4967_3586_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Of all things in the world that tried Polly s patience most were the troublesome little black buttons that originally adorned those useful parts of her clothing and that were fondly supposed to be there when needed 
4967_3586_000004_000001	train-clean-360	But they never were 
none	none	The little black things seemed to be invested with a special spite for one by one they would hop off on the slightest provocation and go rolling over the floor just when she was in her most terrible hurry compelling her to fly for needle and thread on the instant 
4967_3586_000004_000003	train-clean-360	For one thing missus Pepper was very strict about and that was Polly should do nothing else till the buttons were all on again and the boots buttoned up firm and snug 
4967_3586_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear said Polly sitting down on the floor and pulling on her stockings 
none	none	There now see that hateful old shoe mamsie And she thrust out one foot in dismay
4967_3586_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 What s the matter with it said missus Pepper straightening the things on the bureau 
4967_3586_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 You haven t worn it out already Polly 
none	none	Oh no said Polly with a little laugh I hope not yet but it s these dreadful hateful old buttons And she twitched the boot off from her foot with such an impatient little pull that three or four more went flying under the bed There now there s a lot more 
4967_3586_000007_000003	train-clean-360	I don t care I wish they d all go they might as well she cried tossing that boot on the floor in intense scorn while she investigated the state of the other one 
none	none	Are they all off asked Phronsie pulling herself up out of a little heap in the middle of the bed and leaning over the side where she viewed Polly sorrowfully
4967_3586_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 Every one Polly 
4967_3586_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Polly but I wish they were mean old things when I was going down to play a duet with Jasper 
none	none	We should have had a good long time before breakfast Oh mayn t I go just once mamsie Nobody ll see me if I tuck my foot under the piano and I can sew em on afterwards there ll be plenty of time Do just once mamsie
4967_3586_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 No said missus Pepper firmly there isn t any time but now 
4967_3586_000010_000001	train-clean-360	And piano playing isn t very nice when you ve got to stick your toes under it to keep your shoes on 
none	none	Well then grumbled Polly hopping around in her stocking feet where is the work basket mamsie 
4967_3586_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Oh here it is on the window seat A rattle of spools scissors and necessary utensils showed plainly that Polly had found it followed by a jumble of words and despairing ejaculations as she groped hurriedly under chairs and tables to collect the scattered contents 
4967_3586_000012_000000	train-clean-360	When she got back with a very red face she found Phronsie who had crawled out of bed sitting down on the floor in her little nightgown and examining the boot with profound interest 
none	none	I can sew em Polly she said holding up her hand for the big needle that Polly was trying to thread I can now truly let me Polly do Dear no said Polly with a little laugh beginning to be very much ashamed What could you do with your little mites of hands pulling this big thread through that old leather There scamper into bed again you ll catch cold out here
4967_3586_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Tisn t very cold said Phronsie tucking up her toes under the night gown but Polly hurried her into bed where she curled herself up under the clothes watching her make a big knot 
none	none	But the knot didn t stay for when Polly drew up the long thread triumphantly to the end out it flew and away the button hopped again as if glad to be released 
4967_3586_000015_000002	train-clean-360	And then the thread kinked horribly and got all twisted up in disagreeable little snarls that took all Polly s patience to unravel 
none	none	It s because you re in such a hurry said missus Pepper who was getting Phronsie s clothes And coming over across the room she got down on one knee and looked over Polly s shoulder
4967_3586_000016_000002	train-clean-360	 There now let mother see what s the matter 
none	none	Oh dear said Polly resigning the needle with a big sigh and leaning back to take a good stretch followed by Phronsie s sympathizing eyes they never ll be on And there goes the first bell as the loud sounds under Jane s vigorous ringing pealed up over the stairs There won t be time anyway now 
4967_3586_000017_000003	train-clean-360	I wish there wasn t such a thing as shoes in the world And she gave a flounce and sat up straight in front of her mother 
none	none	Polly said missus Pepper sternly deftly fastening the little buttons tightly into place with quick firm stitches better be glad you ve got them to sew at all 
4967_3586_000018_000001	train-clean-360	There now here they are 
none	none	Those won t come off in a hurry
4967_3586_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mamsie cried Polly ignoring for a moment the delights of the finished shoe to fling her arms around her mother s neck and give her a good hug 
none	none	You re just the splendidest goodest mamsie in all the world And I m a hateful cross old bear so I am she cried remorsefully buttoning herself into her boots 
4967_3586_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Which done she flew at the rest of her preparations and tried to make up for lost time 
4967_3586_000020_000000	train-clean-360	But twas all of no use 
4967_3586_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The day seemed to be always just racing ahead of her and turning a corner before she could catch up to it and Ben and the other boys only caught dissolving views of her as she flitted through halls or over stairs 
4967_3586_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Where s Polly said Percy at last coming with great dissatisfaction in his voice to the library door 
none	none	We ve called her I guess a million times and she won t hurry What do you want to have her do asked Jasper looking up from the sofa where he had flung himself with a book Why she said she d make Van and me our sails you know said Percy holding up a rather forlorn looking specimen of a boat but which the boys had carved with the greatest enthusiasm and we want her now Can t you let her alone till she s ready to come said Jasper quickly You re always teasing her to do something he added
4967_3586_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I didn t tease said Percy indignantly coming up to the sofa boat in hand to enforce his words 
none	none	She said she d love to do em so there Jasper King Coming coming sang Polly over the stairs and bobbing into the library Oh here you are Percy I couldn t come before mamsie wanted me 
4967_3586_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Now says I for the sails And she began to flap out a long white piece of cotton cloth on the table to trim into just the desired shape 
4967_3586_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 That isn t the way said Percy crowding up the brightness that had flashed over his face at Polly s appearance beginning to fade 
none	none	Hoh those won t be good for anything those ain t sails
4967_3586_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I haven t finished said Polly snipping away vigorously and longing to get back to mamsie 
4967_3586_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Wait till they re done then they ll be good as good as can be 
4967_3586_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 And it s bad enough to have to make them put in Jasper flinging aside his book and rolling over to watch them without having to be found fault with every second Percy 
4967_3586_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 They re too big said Percy surveying them critically and then looking at his boat 
4967_3586_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh that corner s coming off cried Polly cheerfully giving it a sharp cut that sent it flying on the floor 
none	none	And they won t be too big when they re done Percy all hemmed and everything 
4967_3586_000031_000002	train-clean-360	There as she held one up for inspection that s just the way I used to make Ben s and mine when we sailed boats 
4967_3586_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it asked Percy looking with more respect at the piece of cloth Polly was waving alluringly before him 
4967_3586_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Just exactly like it Polly 
none	none	Yes said Polly laying it down again for a pattern oh how does this go oh that s it there yes this is just exactly like Bensie s and mine that was when I was ever so little and then I used to make Joel s and Davie s afterwards and
4967_3586_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 And were theirs just like this asked Percy laying his hand on the sail she had finished cutting out 
4967_3586_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Pre cisely said Polly with a pin in her mouth 
4967_3586_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 Just as like as two peas Percy Whitney 
none	none	Then I like them cried Percy veering round and regarding them with great satisfaction as Van bounded in with a torrent of complaints and great disappointment in every line of his face
4967_3586_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh now that s too bad he cried seeing Polly fold up the remaining bits of cloth and pick up the scraps on the floor 
none	none	And you ve gone and let her cut out every one of em and never told me a word You re a mean old hateful thing Percy Whitney Oh don t said Polly on her knees on the floor
4967_3586_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I forgot began Percy and she cut em so quick and 
4967_3586_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 And I ve been waiting said Van in a loud wrathful key and waiting and waiting 
none	none	Never mind Van said Jasper consolingly getting off from the sofa and coming up to the table
4967_3586_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 They re done and done beautifully aren t they he said holding up one 
4967_3586_000043_000000	train-clean-360	But this only proved fresh fuel for the fire of Van s indignation 
none	none	And you shan t have em so he cried making a lunge at the one on the table for I made most of the boat there Oh no you didn t cried Percy in the greatest alarm hanging on to the boat in his hand
4967_3586_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 I cut all the keel and the bow and 
4967_3586_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear said Polly in extreme dismay looking at Jasper 
4967_3586_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 Come I ll tell you what I ll do boys 
4967_3586_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 What said Van cooling off a little and allowing Percy to edge into a corner with the beloved boat and one sail 
4967_3586_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 What will you Polly 
none	none	I ll make you another pair of sails said Polly groaning within herself as she thought of the wasted minutes and then you can see me cut em Van Will you really he said delight coming all over his flushed face Yes I will cried Polly wait a minute till I get some more cloth And she started for the door Oh now that s too bad said Jasper To have to cut more of those tiresome old things Van let her off Oh no I won t I won t he cried in the greatest alarm running up to her as she stood by the door
4967_3586_000052_000002	train-clean-360	 You did say so Polly 
none	none	You know you did
4967_3586_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course I did Vanny said Polly smiling down into his eager face and we ll have a splendid pair in just one minute she sang 
4967_3586_000054_000000	train-clean-360	And so the sails were cut out and the hems turned down and basted and tucked away into Polly s little work basket ready for the sewing on the morrow 
none	none	And then mister King came in and took Jasper off with him and the two Whitney boys went up to mamma for a story and Polly sat down in mamsie s room to tackle her French exercise POLLY S BIG BUNDLE 
5400_3587_000001_000000	train-clean-360	The room was very quiet but presently Phronsie strayed in and seeing Polly studying climbed up in a chair by the window to watch the birds hop over the veranda and pick up worms in the grass beside the carriage drive 
5400_3587_000001_000001	train-clean-360	And then came missus Pepper with the big mending basket and ensconced herself opposite by the table and nothing was to be heard but the tick tick of the clock and an occasional dropping of a spool of thread or scissors from the busy hands flying in and out among the stockings 
none	none	All of a sudden there was a great rustling in Cherry s cage that swung in the big window on the other side of the room 
5400_3587_000002_000001	train-clean-360	And then he set up a loud and angry chirping flying up and down and opening his mouth as if he wanted to express his mind but couldn t and otherwise acting in a very strange and unaccountable manner 
5400_3587_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear me said missus Pepper what s that 
5400_3587_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 It s Cherry said Polly lifting up her head from Fasquelle and oh dear me and flinging down the pile of books in her lap on a chair she rushed across the room and flew up to the cage and began to wildly gesticulate and explain and shower down on him every endearing name she could think of 
5400_3587_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 What is the matter asked her mother turning around in her chair in perfect astonishment 
5400_3587_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 What upon earth Polly 
5400_3587_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 How could I cried Polly in accents of despair not heeding her mother s question 
5400_3587_000006_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh mamsie will he die do you think 
5400_3587_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I guess not said missus Pepper laying down her work and coming up to the cage while Phronsie scrambled off from her chair and hurried to the scene 
5400_3587_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Why he does act queer don t he 
5400_3587_000007_000002	train-clean-360	P raps he s been eating too much 
5400_3587_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Eating said Polly oh mamsie he hasn t had anything And she pointed with shame and remorse to the seed cup with only a few dried husks in the very bottom 
5400_3587_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Polly began missus Pepper but seeing the look on her face she changed her tone for one more cheerful 
none	none	Well hurry and get him some now he ll be all right poor little thing in a minute 
5400_3587_000009_000002	train-clean-360	There there she said nodding persuasively at the cage you pretty creature you 
5400_3587_000009_000003	train-clean-360	so you sha n t be starved 
5400_3587_000010_000000	train-clean-360	At the word starved Polly winced as though a pin had been pointed at her 
5400_3587_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 There isn t any mamsie in the house she stammered he had the last yesterday 
5400_3587_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 And you forgot him to day asked missus Pepper with a look in her black eyes Polly didn t like 
none	none	Yes m said poor Polly in a low voice
5400_3587_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Well he must have something right away said missus Pepper decidedly That s certain 
5400_3587_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll run right down to Fletcher s and get it cried Polly 
5400_3587_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Twon t take me but a minute mamsie Jasper s gone and Thomas too so I ve got to go she added as she saw her mother hesitate 
none	none	If you could wait till Ben gets home said missus Pepper slowly
5400_3587_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 I m most afraid it will rain Polly 
5400_3587_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no mamsie cried Polly feeling as if she could fly to the ends of the earth to atone and longing beside for the brisk walk down town Going up to the window she pointed triumphantly to the little bit of blue sky still visible 
5400_3587_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 There now see it can t rain yet awhile 
5400_3587_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said missus Pepper while Phronsie standing in a chair with her face pressed close to the cage was telling Cherry through the bars not to be hungry please don t which he didn t seem to mind in the least but went on screaming harder than ever 
5400_3587_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 And besides tisn t much use to wait for Ben 
none	none	Nobody knows where he ll get shoes to fit himself and Joe and Davie in one afternoon 
5400_3587_000019_000003	train-clean-360	But be sure Polly to hurry for it s getting late and I shall be worried about you 
5400_3587_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mamsie said Polly turning back just a minute I know the way to Fletcher s just as easy as anything 
5400_3587_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I couldn t get lost 
5400_3587_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I know you do said missus Pepper but it ll be dark early on account of the shower 
5400_3587_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Well she said pulling out her well worn purse from her pocket if it does sprinkle you get into a car Polly remember 
none	none	Oh yes I will she cried taking the purse
5400_3587_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 And there s ten cents for your bird seed in that pocket said missus Pepper pointing to a coin racing away into a corner by itself 
5400_3587_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes m said Polly wild to be off 
5400_3587_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 And there s a five cent piece in that one for you to ride up with said her mother tying up the purse carefully 
5400_3587_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Remember for you to ride up with 
5400_3587_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Well I guess you better ride up anyway Polly come to think and then you ll get home all the quicker 
5400_3587_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Where you going asked Phronsie who on seeing the purse knew there was some expedition on foot and beginning to clamber down out of the chair 
5400_3587_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh I want to go too I do 
none	none	Take me Polly
5400_3587_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no Pet I can t cried Polly I ve got to hurry like everything 
5400_3587_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I can hurry too cried Phronsie drawing her small figure to its utmost height oh so fast Polly 
5400_3587_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 And it s ever so far cried Polly in despair as she saw the small under lip of the child begin to quiver 
none	none	Oh dear me mamsie what shall I do
5400_3587_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Run right along said missus Pepper briskly 
none	none	Now Phronsie you and I ought to take care of Cherry poor thing 
5400_3587_000031_000000	train-clean-360	At this Phronsie turned and wiped away two big tears while she gazed up at the cage in extreme commiseration 
5400_3587_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I guess I ll give him a piece of bread said missus Pepper to herself At this word bread Polly who was half way down the hall came running back 
5400_3587_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh mamsie don t she said 
5400_3587_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 It made him sick before don t you know it did so fat and stuffy 
5400_3587_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 Well hurry along then said missus Pepper and Polly was off 
none	none	Over the ground she sped only intent on reaching the bird store her speed heightened by the dark and rolling bank of cloud that seemed to shut right down suddenly over her and envelop her warningly It s good I ve got the money to ride up with she thought to herself hurrying along through the busy streets filled now with anxious crowds homeward rushing to avoid the threatening shower
5400_3587_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 Well here I am she said with a sigh of relief as she at last reached mister Fletcher s big bird store 
5400_3587_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Here she steadily resisted all temptations to stop and look at the new arrivals of birds and to feed the carrier pigeons who seemed to be expecting her and who turned their soft eyes up at her reproachfully when she failed to pay her respects to them 
5400_3587_000037_000001	train-clean-360	Even the cunning blandishments of a very attractive monkey that always had entertained the children on their numerous visits failed to interest her now Mamsie would be worrying she knew and besides the sight of so many birds eating their suppers out of generously full seed cups only filled her heart with remorse as she thought of poor Cherry and his empty one 
5400_3587_000038_000000	train-clean-360	So she put down her ten cents silently on the counter and took up the little package of seed and went out 
5400_3587_000039_000000	train-clean-360	But what a change 
5400_3587_000039_000001	train-clean-360	The cloud that had seemed but a cloud when she went in was now fast descending in big ominous sprinkles that told of a heavy shower to follow 
none	none	Quick and fast they came making everybody fly to the nearest shelter
5400_3587_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t care said Polly to herself holding fast her little package I ll run and get in the car then I ll be all right 
5400_3587_000041_000000	train-clean-360	So she went on with nimble footsteps dodging the crowd and soon came to the corner 
5400_3587_000041_000001	train-clean-360	A car was just in sight that was fine 
none	none	Polly put her hand in her pocket for her purse to have it all ready but as quickly drew it out again and stared wildly at the car which she allowed to pass by 
5400_3587_000041_000003	train-clean-360	Her pocket was empty 
none	none	Oh dear she said to herself as a sudden gust of wind blew around the corner and warned her to move on now what shall I do 
5400_3587_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Well I must hurry 
5400_3587_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Nothing for it but to run now 
none	none	And secretly glad at the chance for a good hearty run along the hard pavements a thing she had been longing to do ever since she came to the city Polly gathered her bundle of seed up under her arm and set out for a jolly race She was enjoying it hugely when a sudden turn of the corner brought her up against a gentleman who having his umbrella down to protect his face hadn t seen her till it was too late Polly never could tell how it was done but the first thing she knew she was being helped up from the wet slippery pavement by a kind hand and a gentleman s voice said in the deepest concern
5400_3587_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I beg your pardon it was extremely careless in me 
5400_3587_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 It s no matter said Polly hopping up with a little laugh and straightening her hat 
5400_3587_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 Only and she began to look for her parcel that had been sent spinning 
none	none	What is it said the gentleman bending down and beginning to explore too in the darkness My bundle began Polly Oh dear 
5400_3587_000049_000000	train-clean-360	No need to ask for it now 
5400_3587_000049_000001	train-clean-360	There lay the paper wet and torn down at their feet 
5400_3587_000049_000002	train-clean-360	The seed lay all over the pavement scattered far and wide even out to the puddles in the street 
5400_3587_000049_000003	train-clean-360	And not a cent of money to get any more with 
5400_3587_000049_000004	train-clean-360	The rain that was falling around them as they stood there sent with the sound of every drop such a flood of misery into Polly s heart 
5400_3587_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 What was it child asked the gentleman peering sharply to find out what the little shiny things were 
5400_3587_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Bird seed gasped Polly 
5400_3587_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that all said the gentleman with a happy laugh 
5400_3587_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 I m very glad 
5400_3587_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 All Polly s heart stood still as she thought of Cherry stark and stiff in the bottom of his cage if he didn t get it soon 
5400_3587_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 Now said the kind tones briskly come little girl we ll make this all right speedily 
5400_3587_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Let s see here s a bird store 
none	none	Now then
5400_3587_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 But sir began Polly holding back 
none	none	Even Cherry had better die than to do anything her mother wouldn t like But the gentleman already had her in the shop and was delighting the heart of the shop keeper by ordering him to do up a big package of all kinds of seed 
5400_3587_000055_000001	train-clean-360	And then he added a cunning arrangement for birds to swing in and two or three other things that didn t have anything to do with birds at all 
5400_3587_000055_000002	train-clean-360	And then they came out on the wet slippery street again 
5400_3587_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Now then little girl said the gentleman tucking the bundle under his arm and opening the umbrella then he took hold of Polly s hand who by this time was glad of a protector 
none	none	Where do you live 
5400_3587_000056_000002	train-clean-360	For I m going to take you safely home this time where umbrellas can t run into you 
5400_3587_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh said Polly with a little skip 
none	none	Thank you sir 
5400_3587_000057_000002	train-clean-360	It s up to mister King s and 
5400_3587_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 What said the gentleman stopping short in the midst of an immense puddle and staring at her mister 
5400_3587_000058_000001	train-clean-360	Jasper King s 
none	none	I don t know sir said Polly what his other name is Yes it must be Jasper that s what Jappy s is anyway she added with a little laugh wishing very much that she could see Jappy at that identical moment
5400_3587_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Jappy said the stranger still standing as if petrified 
none	none	And are there little Whitney children in the same house
5400_3587_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes said Polly raising her clear brown eyes up at him 
none	none	The gas lighter was just beginning his rounds and the light from a neighboring lamp flashed full on Polly s face as she spoke showing just how clear and brown the eyes were
5400_3587_000061_000002	train-clean-360	 There s Percy and Van and little Dick oh he s so cunning she cried impulsively 
5400_3587_000062_000000	train-clean-360	The gentleman s face looked very queer just then but he merely said 
5400_3587_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Why you must be Polly 
5400_3587_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir I am said Polly pleased to think he knew her 
5400_3587_000064_000001	train-clean-360	And then she told him how she d forgotten Cherry s seed and all about it 
5400_3587_000064_000002	train-clean-360	 And oh sir she said and her voice began to tremble Mamsie ll be so frightened if I don t get there soon 
5400_3587_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 I m going up there myself so that it all happens very nicely said the gentleman commencing to start off briskly and grasping her hand tighter 
5400_3587_000065_000001	train-clean-360	 Now then Polly 
none	none	So off they went at a very fast pace she skipping through the puddles that his long even strides carried him safely over chattered away by his side under the umbrella and answered his many questions and altogether got so very well acquainted that by the time they turned in at the old stone gateway she felt as if she had known him for years And there the first thing they either of them saw down in a little corner back of the tall evergreens was a small heap that rose as they splashed up the carriage drive and resolved itself into a very red dress and a very white apron as it rushed impulsively up and flung itself into Polly s wet arms And I was so tired waiting Polly
5400_3587_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear me Phronsie cried Polly huddling her up from the dark wet ground 
5400_3587_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 You ll catch your death 
none	none	What will mamsie say 
5400_3587_000070_000000	train-clean-360	The stranger amazed at this new stage of the proceedings was vainly trying to hold the umbrella over both till the procession could move on again 
none	none	Oh cried Phronsie shaking her yellow head decidedly they re all looking for you Polly She pointed one finger solemnly up to the big carved door as she spoke 
5400_3587_000071_000001	train-clean-360	At that Polly gathered her up close and began to walk with rapid footsteps up the path 
5400_3587_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Do let me carry you little girl said Polly s kind friend persuasively bending down to the little face on Polly s neck 
none	none	Oh no no no said Phronsie at each syllable grasping Polly around the throat in perfect terror and waving him off with a very crumpled mangy bit of paper that had already done duty to wipe off the copious tears during her anxious watch
5400_3587_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t let him Polly don t 
5400_3587_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 There sha n t anything hurt you said Polly kissing her reassuringly and stepping briskly off with her burden just as the door burst open and Joel flew out on the veranda steps followed by the rest of the troop in the greatest state of excitement 
none	none	Oh whickety 
5400_3587_000075_000001	train-clean-360	she s come he shouted springing up to her over the puddles and crowding under the umbrella 
5400_3587_000075_000002	train-clean-360	 Where d you get Phronsie he asked standing quite still at sight of the little feet tucked up to get out of the rain 
none	none	And without waiting for an answer he turned and shot back into the house proclaiming in stentorian tones Ma Polly s come an she s got Phronsie an an awful big man and they re out by the gate
5400_3587_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 Phronsie said missus Pepper springing to her feet why I thought she was up stairs with Jane 
none	none	Now somebody exclaimed old mister King who sat by the library table vainly trying to read a newspaper which he now threw down in extreme irritation as he rose quickly and went to the door to welcome the wanderers somebody ought to watch that poor child whose business it is to know where she is 
5400_3587_000077_000001	train-clean-360	She s caught her death cold no doubt no doubt 
none	none	Outside in the rain the children revolved around and around Polly and Phronsie hugging and kissing them until nobody could do much more than breathe not seeming to notice the stranger who stood quietly waiting till such time as he could be heard At last in a lull in the scramble as they were dragging Polly and her burden up the steps each wild for the honor of escorting her into the house he cried out in laughing tones
5400_3587_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Isn t anybody going to kiss me I wonder 
5400_3587_000081_000000	train-clean-360	The two little Whitneys who were eagerly clutching Polly s arms turned around and Percy rubbed his eyes in a puzzled way as Joel said stopping a minute to look up at the tall figure 
5400_3587_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 We don t ever kiss strangers mamsie s told us not to 
5400_3587_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 For shame Joey cried Polly feeling her face grow dreadfully red in the darkness the gentleman s been so kind to me 
none	none	You re right my boy said the stranger laughing and bending down to Joel s upturned sturdy countenance at the same instant that missus Pepper flung open the big door and a bright warm light fell straight across his handsome face 
5400_3587_000084_000001	train-clean-360	And then well then Percy gave a violent bound and upsetting Joel as he did so wriggled his way down the steps at the same time that Van on Polly s other side rushed up to the gentleman 
5400_3587_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Papa oh papa 
none	none	Polly half way up the steps turned around and then at the rush of feeling that gathered at her heart sat right down on the wet slippery step
5400_3587_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Polly Pepper exclaimed Joel not minding his own upset 
none	none	You re right in all the slush mother won t like it I tell you
5400_3587_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 Hush cried Polly catching his arm he s come oh Joel he s come 
5400_3587_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 Who cried Joel staring around blindly who Polly Polly had just opened her lips to explain when mister King s portly handsome figure appeared in the doorway 
5400_3587_000089_000001	train-clean-360	 Do come in children why good gracious Mason 
none	none	Yes cried the stranger lightly dropping his big bundle and umbrella as he passed in the door with his little sons clinging to him Where is Marian Why didn t you write asked the old gentleman testily These surprises aren t the right sort of things and he began to feel vigorously of his heart
5400_3587_000091_000002	train-clean-360	 Here missus Pepper be so good as to call missus Whitney 
none	none	Pepper 
5400_3587_000092_000001	train-clean-360	Pepper repeated mister Whitney perplexedly 
none	none	She s coming I hear her up stairs cried Van Whitney
5400_3587_000093_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh let me tell her He struggled to get down from his father s arms as he said this 
5400_3587_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 No I shall I heard her first cried Percy 
none	none	Oh dear me 
5400_3587_000094_000002	train-clean-360	Grandpapa s going to 
5400_3587_000095_000000	train-clean-360	mister King advanced to the foot of the staircase as his daughter all unconscious ran down with a light step and a smile on her face 
5400_3587_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Has Polly come she asked seeing only her father 
5400_3587_000096_000001	train-clean-360	 Yes replied the old gentleman shortly and she s brought a big bundle Marian 
5400_3587_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 A big bundle she repeated wonderingly and gazing at him 
none	none	A very big bundle he said and taking hold of her shoulders he turned her around on her husband 
5400_3587_000099_000000	train-clean-360	So Polly and Phronsie crept in unnoticed after all 
5400_3587_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish Ben was here said little Davie capering around the Whitney group an Jappy I do 
5400_3587_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 Where are they asked Polly 
none	none	Don t know said Joel tugging at his shoe string
5400_3587_000102_000001	train-clean-360	 See aren t these prime 
5400_3587_000102_000002	train-clean-360	He held up a shining black shoe fairly bristling with newness for Polly to admire 
5400_3587_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 Splendid she cried heartily but where are the boys 
5400_3587_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 They went after you said Davie after we came home with our shoes 
5400_3587_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 No they didn t contradicted Joel flatly and sitting down on the floor he began to tie and untie his new possessions 
none	none	When we came home Ben drew us pictures lots of em don t you know
5400_3587_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes said Davie nodding his head so he did that was when we all cried cause you weren t home Polly 
5400_3587_000107_000000	train-clean-360	 He drawed me a be yew tiful one cried Phronsie holding up her mangy bit see Polly see 
5400_3587_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the little brown house said Davie looking over her shoulder as Phronsie put it carefully into Polly s hand 
5400_3587_000109_000000	train-clean-360	 It s all washed out said Polly smoothing it out when you staid out in the rain 
5400_3587_000110_000000	train-clean-360	Phronsie s face grew very grave at that 
5400_3587_000111_000000	train-clean-360	 Bad naughty old rain she said and then she began to cry as hard as she could 
none	none	Oh dear don t cried Polly in dismay trying her best to stop her oh Phronsie do stop she implored pointing into the next room whence the sound of happy voices issued they ll all hear you But Phronsie in her grief didn t care but wailed on steadily Who is it anyway cried Joel tired of admiring his precious shoes and getting up to hear them squeak that great big man you know Polly that came in with you
5400_3587_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I thought I told you said Polly at her wit s end over Phronsie It s Percy and Van s father Joey 
5400_3587_000116_000000	train-clean-360	 Whockey cried Joel completely stunned really and truly Polly Pepper 
none	none	Really and truly cried Polly bundling Phronsie up in her arms to lay the little wet cheek against hers
5400_3587_000118_000000	train-clean-360	 Then I m going to peek cried Joel squeaking across the floor to carry his threat into execution 
none	none	Oh you mustn t Joe cried Polly frightened lest he should
5400_3587_000119_000001	train-clean-360	 Come right back or I ll tell mamsie 
none	none	They re all comin in anyway cried little Davie delightedly and scuttling over to Polly s side
5400_3587_000121_000000	train-clean-360	 And here are the little friends I ve heard so much about cried mister Whitney coming in amongst them 
5400_3587_000121_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh you needn t introduce me to Polly she brought me home 
5400_3587_000122_000000	train-clean-360	 They re all Pepperses said Percy waving his hand and doing the business up at one stroke 
5400_3587_000123_000000	train-clean-360	 Only the best of em isn t here observed Van rather ungallantly he draws perfectly elegant papa 
none	none	I like Polly best I do cried little Dick tumbling after
5400_3587_000124_000001	train-clean-360	 Peppers again repeated mister Whitney in a puzzled way 
5400_3587_000125_000000	train-clean-360	 And here is missus Pepper said old mister King pompously drawing her forward the children s mother and 
none	none	But here missus Pepper began to act in a very queer way rubbing her eyes and twisting one corner of her black apron in a decidedly nervous manner that as the old gentleman looked up he saw with astonishment presently communicated itself to the gentleman opposite Is it said mister Whitney putting out his hand and grasping the hard toil worn one in the folds of the apron is it cousin Mary And aren t you cousin John she asked the tears in her bright black eyes Of all things in this world cried the old gentleman waving his head helplessly from one to the other Will somebody have the extreme goodness to tell us what all this means At this the little Peppers crowded around their mother and into all the vacant places they could find to get near the fascinating scene
5400_3587_000131_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said mister Whitney sitting down and drawing his wife to his side it s a long story 
5400_3587_000131_000001	train-clean-360	You see when I was a little youngster and 
5400_3587_000132_000000	train-clean-360	 You were John Whitney then put in missus Pepper slyly 
none	none	That s the reason I never knew when they were all talking of Mason Whitney John Whitney I was said mister Whitney laughing or rather Johnny and Jack But Grandmother Mason when I grew older wanted me called by my middle name to please grandfather 
5400_3587_000133_000002	train-clean-360	But to go back when I was a little shaver about as big as Percy here 
5400_3587_000134_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh papa began Percy deprecatingly 
5400_3587_000134_000001	train-clean-360	To be called a little shaver before all the others 
5400_3587_000135_000000	train-clean-360	 He means dearie said his mamma reassuringly when he was a boy like you 
5400_3587_000135_000001	train-clean-360	Now hear what papa is going to say 
5400_3587_000136_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I was sent up into Vermont to stay at the old place 
5400_3587_000136_000001	train-clean-360	There was a little girl there a bright black eyed little girl 
none	none	She was my cousin and her name was Mary Bartlett
5400_3587_000137_000000	train-clean-360	 Who s Mary Bartlett asked Joel interrupting 
5400_3587_000138_000000	train-clean-360	 There she is sir said mister Whitney pointing to missus Pepper who was laughing and crying together 
5400_3587_000139_000000	train-clean-360	 Where said Joel utterly bewildered 
5400_3587_000139_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t see any Mary Bartlett What does he mean Polly 
none	none	I don t know said Polly
5400_3587_000140_000001	train-clean-360	 Wait Joey she whispered he s going to tell us all about it 
5400_3587_000141_000000	train-clean-360	 Well this little cousin and I went to the district school and had many good times together 
5400_3587_000141_000001	train-clean-360	And then my parents sent for me and I went to Germany to school and when I came back I lost sight of her 
5400_3587_000141_000002	train-clean-360	All I could find out was that she had married an Englishman by the name of Pepper 
5400_3587_000142_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh cried all the children together 
none	none	And I always supposed she had gone to England for despite all my exertions I could find no trace of her Ah Mary he said reproachfully why didn t you let me know where you were
5400_3587_000144_000000	train-clean-360	 I heard said missus Pepper that you d grown awfully rich and I couldn t 
5400_3587_000145_000000	train-clean-360	 You always were a proud little thing he said laughing 
5400_3587_000145_000001	train-clean-360	 Well but broke in mister King unable to keep silence any longer I d like to inquire Mason why you didn t find all this out before in Marian s letters when she mentioned missus Pepper 
5400_3587_000146_000000	train-clean-360	 She didn t ever mention her said mister Whitney turning around to face his questioner not as missus Pepper never once by name 
5400_3587_000146_000001	train-clean-360	It was always either Polly s mother or Phronsie s mother Just like a woman he added with a mischievous glance at his wife not to be explicit 
5400_3587_000147_000000	train-clean-360	 And just like a man she retorted with a happy little laugh not to ask for explanations 
none	none	I hear Jappy cried Polly in a glad voice and Ben oh good as a sound of rushing footsteps was heard over the veranda steps and down the long hall 
5400_3587_000149_000000	train-clean-360	The door was thrown suddenly open and Jasper plunged in his face flushed with excitement and after him Ben looking a little as he did when Phronsie was lost while Prince squeezed panting in between the two boys 
5400_3587_000150_000000	train-clean-360	 Has Polly got began Jasper 
5400_3587_000151_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes I m here cried Polly springing up to them oh Ben 
5400_3587_000152_000000	train-clean-360	 She has cried Joel disentangling himself from the group don t you see Jappy 
5400_3587_000153_000000	train-clean-360	 She s all home echoed Phronsie flying up 
5400_3587_000153_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh Ben do draw me another little house 
5400_3587_000154_000000	train-clean-360	 And see see cried the little Whitneys pointing with jubilant fingers to their papa see what she brought 
5400_3587_000155_000000	train-clean-360	Jasper turned around at that and then rushed forward 
5400_3587_000156_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh brother Mason 
none	none	Well Jasper said mister Whitney a whole wealth of affection beaming on the boy how you have stretched up in six months Haven t I said Jasper laughing and drawing himself up to his fullest height
5400_3587_000159_000000	train-clean-360	 He s a standin on tip toe said Joel critically who was hovering near 
none	none	I most know he is and he bent down to examine the position of Jasper s heels
5400_3587_000160_000000	train-clean-360	 Not a bit of it Joe cried Jasper with a merry laugh and setting both feet with a convincing thud on the floor 
5400_3587_000161_000000	train-clean-360	 Well anyway I ll be just as big cried Joel when I m thirteen so 
5400_3587_000162_000000	train-clean-360	Just then a loud and quick rap on the table made all the children skip and stopped everybody s tongue 
5400_3587_000162_000001	train-clean-360	It came from mister King 
none	none	Phronsie said he come here child I can t do anything without you and held out his hand Phronsie immediately left Ben who was hanging over Polly as if he never meant to let her go out of his sight again and went directly over to the old gentleman s side Now then He swung her upon his shoulder where she perched like a little bird gravely surveying the whole group One little hand stole around the old gentleman s neck and patted his cheek softly which so pleased him that for a minute or two he stood perfectly still so that everybody might see it Now Phronsie you must tell all these children so that they ll understand say everything just as I tell you mind
5400_3587_000166_000000	train-clean-360	 I will said Phronsie shaking her small head wisely every single thing 
5400_3587_000167_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then now begin 
5400_3587_000168_000000	train-clean-360	 Well then now begin said Phronsie looking down on the faces with an air as much like mister King s as was possible and finishing up with two or three little nods 
5400_3587_000169_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no dear that isn t it cried the old gentleman I ll tell you Say Phronsie you are all cousins every one 
none	none	You are all cousins every one repeated little Phronsie simply shaking her yellow head into the very middle of the group
5400_3587_000171_000000	train-clean-360	 Does she mean it grandpapa 
5400_3587_000171_000001	train-clean-360	Does she mean it cried Percy in the greatest excitement 
5400_3587_000172_000000	train-clean-360	 As true as everything demanded Joel crowding in between them 
none	none	As true as truth said the old gentleman solemnly patting the child s little fat hand
5400_3587_000173_000001	train-clean-360	 So make the most of it 
none	none	Oh said Polly with a long sigh 
5400_3587_000174_000001	train-clean-360	And then Jasper and she took hold of hands and had a good spin 
none	none	Joel turned around with two big eyes on Percy
5400_3587_000176_000000	train-clean-360	 We re cousins he said 
5400_3587_000177_000000	train-clean-360	 I know it said Percy and so s Van 
5400_3587_000178_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Van flying up and I m cousin to Polly too that s best 
none	none	Can t I be a Cousin cried little Dick crowding up with two red cheeks Isn t anybody going to be a cousin to me too Everybody but Jasper said the old gentleman laughing heartily at them
5400_3587_000180_000001	train-clean-360	 You and I my boy he turned to his son are left out in the cold 
5400_3587_000181_000000	train-clean-360	At this a scream loud and terrible to hear struck upon them all as Joel flung himself flat on the floor 
5400_3587_000182_000000	train-clean-360	 Isn t Jappy our cousin 
5400_3587_000182_000001	train-clean-360	I want Jappy 
5400_3587_000183_000000	train-clean-360	 Goodness exclaimed the old gentleman in the greatest alarm what is the matter with the boy 
5400_3587_000183_000001	train-clean-360	Do somebody stop him 
5400_3587_000184_000000	train-clean-360	 Joel said Jasper leaning over him and trying to help Polly lift him up 
5400_3587_000184_000001	train-clean-360	 I ll tell you how we ll fix it 
none	none	I ll be your brother That s best of all brother to Polly and Ben and the whole of you then we ll see 
5400_3587_000185_000000	train-clean-360	Joel bolted up at that and began to smile through the tears running down the rosy face 
5400_3587_000186_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you really he said just like Ben and everything 
5400_3587_000187_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t be as good as Ben said Jappy laughing but I ll be a real brother like him 
5400_3587_000188_000000	train-clean-360	 Phoo phoo 
none	none	Then I don t care cried Joel wiping off the last tear on the back of his chubby hand Now I guess we re better n you he exclaimed with a triumphant glance over at the little Whitneys as he began to make the new shoes skip at a lively pace up and down the long room
5400_3587_000189_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh dear they both cried in great distress 
5400_3587_000190_000000	train-clean-360	 Now papa Jappy s going to be Joey s brother and he isn t anything but our old uncle 
5400_3587_000190_000001	train-clean-360	Make him be ours more papa do 
5400_3587_000191_000000	train-clean-360	And then Polly sprang up 
none	none	Oh oh deary me And she rushed out into the hall and began to tug violently at the big bundle tossed down in a corner
5400_3587_000192_000001	train-clean-360	 Cherry ll die Cherry ll die she cried do somebody help me off with the string 
none	none	But Polly already had it off by the time Jasper s knife was half out of his pocket and was kneeling down on the floor scooping out a big handful of the seed
5400_3587_000194_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t hurry so Polly said Jasper as she jumped up to fly up stairs He s had some a perfect age he s all right 
none	none	What said Polly stopping so suddenly that two or three little seeds flew out of the outstretched hand and went dancing away to the foot of the stairs by themselves Oh I heard him scolding away there when I first came home said Jasper so I just ran down a block or two and got him some
5400_3587_000197_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that all there is in that big bundle said Joel in a disappointed tone who had followed with extreme curiosity to see its contents Phoo that s no fun old bird seed 
5400_3587_000198_000000	train-clean-360	 I know said Polly with a gay little laugh pointing with the handful of seed into the library but I shouldn t have met the other big bundle if it hadn t have been for this Joe
