THE MOONFLOWER DICKIE lived at New Cross At least the address was New Cross but really the house where he lived was one of a row of horrid little houses built on the slope where once green fields ran down the hill to the river and the old houses of the Deptford merchants stood stately in their pleasant gardens and fruitful orchards All those good fields and happy gardens are built over now It is as though some wicked giant had taken a big brush full of yellow ochre paint and another full of mud color and had painted out the green in streaks of dull yellow and filthy brown and the brown is the roads and the yellow is the houses Miles and miles and miles of them and not a green thing to be seen except the cabbages in the greengrocers shops and here and there some poor trails of creeping jenny drooping from a dirty window sill There is a little yard at the back of each house this is called the garden and some of these show green but they only show it to the houses back windows You cannot see it from the street These gardens are green because green is the color that most pleases and soothes men s eyes and however you may shut people up between bars of yellow and mud color and however hard you may make them work and however little wage you may pay them for working there will always be found among those people some men who are willing to work a little longer and for no wages at all so that they may have green things growing near them But there were no green things growing in the garden at the back of the house where Dickie lived with his aunt There were stones and bones and bits of brick and dirty old dish cloths matted together with grease and mud worn out broom heads and broken shovels a bottomless pail and the mouldy remains of a hutch where once rabbits had lived But that was a very long time ago and Dickie had never seen the rabbits A boy had brought a brown rabbit to school once buttoned up inside his jacket and he had let Dickie hold it in his hands for several minutes before the teacher detected its presence and shut it up in a locker till school should be over So Dickie knew what rabbits were like And he was fond of the hutch for the sake of what had once lived there And when his aunt sold the poor remains of the hutch to a man with a barrow who was ready to buy anything and who took also the pails and the shovels giving threepence for the lot Dickie was almost as unhappy as though the hutch had really held a furry friend And he hated the man who took the hutch away all the more because there were empty rabbit skins hanging sadly from the back of the barrow It is really with the going of that rabbit hutch that this story begins Because it was then that Dickie having called his aunt a Beast and hit at her with his little dirty fist was well slapped and put out into the bereaved yard to come to himself as his aunt said He threw himself down on the ground and cried and wriggled with misery and pain and wished ah many things Wot s the bloomin row now the Man Next Door suddenly asked been hittin of you They ve took away the utch said Dickie Well there warn t nothin in it I diden want it took away wailed Dickie Leaves more room said the Man Next Door leaning on his spade It was Saturday afternoon and the next door garden was one of the green ones There were small grubby daffodils in it and dirty faced little primroses and an arbor beside the water butt bare at this time of the year but still a real arbor And an elder tree that in the hot weather had flat white flowers on it big as tea plates And a lilac tree with brown buds on it Beautiful Say matey just you chuck it Chuck it I say How in thunder can I get on with my digging with you owlin yer ead off inquired the Man Next Door You get up and peg along in an arst your aunt if she d be agreeable for me to do up her garden a bit I could do it odd times You d like that Not arf said Dickie getting up Come to yourself eh sneered the aunt You mind and let it be the last time you come your games with me my beauty You and your tantrums Dickie said what it was necessary to say and got back to the garden She says she ain t got no time to waste an if you ave she don t care what you does with it There s a dirty mug you ve got on you said the Man Next Door leaning over to give Dickie s face a rub with a handkerchief hardly cleaner Now I ll come over and make a start He threw his leg over the fence You just peg about an be busy pickin up all them fancy articles and nex time your aunt goes to Buckingham Palace for the day we ll have a bonfire Fifth o November said Dickie sitting down and beginning to draw to himself the rubbish that covered the ground Fifth of anything you like so long as she ain t about said he driving in the spade Ard as any old door step it is Never mind we ll turn it over and we ll get some little seedses and some little plantses and we shan t know ourselves I got a apenny said Dickie Well I ll put one to it and you leg long and buy seedses That s wot you do Dickie went He went slowly because he was lame And he was lame because his aunt had dropped him when he was a baby She was not a nice woman and I am glad to say that she goes out of this story almost at once But she did keep Dickie when his father died and she might have sent him to the work house For she was not really his aunt but just the woman of the house where his father had lodged It was good of her to keep Dickie even if she wasn t very kind to him And as that is all the good I can find to say about her I will say no more With his little crutch made out of a worn out broom cut down to his little height he could manage quite well in spite of his lameness Illustration GIMME SAID DICKIE GIMME A PENN ORTH O THAT THERE He found the corn chandler s a really charming shop that smelled like stables and had deep dusty bins where he would have liked to play Above the bins were delightful little square fronted drawers labelled Rape Hemp Canary Millet Mustard and so on and above the drawers pictures of the kind of animals that were fed on the kind of things that the shop sold Fat oblong cows that had eaten Burley s Cattle Food stout pillows of wool that Ovis s Sheep Spice had fed and brightest and best of all an incredibly smooth plumaged parrot rainbow colored cocking a black eye bright with the intoxicating qualities of Perrokett s Artistic Bird Seed Gimme said Dickie leaning against the counter and pointing a grimy thumb at the wonder gimme a penn orth o that there Got the penny the shopman asked carefully Dickie displayed it parted with it and came home nursing a paper bag full of rustling promises Why said the Man Next Door that ain t seeds It s parrot food that is It said the Ar something Bird Seed said Dickie downcast I thought it ud come into flowers like birds same colors as wot the poll parrot was dontcherknow And so it will like as not said the Man Next Door comfortably I ll set it along this end soon s I ve got it turned over I lay it ll come up something pretty So the seed was sown And the Man Next Door promised two more pennies later for real seed Also he transplanted two of the primroses whose faces wanted washing It was a grand day for Dickie He told the whole story of it that night when he went to bed to his only confidant from whom he hid nothing The confidant made no reply but Dickie was sure this was not because the confidant didn t care about the story The confidant was a blackened stick about five inches long with little blackened bells to it like the bells on dogs collars Also a rather crooked bit of something whitish and very hard good to suck or to stroke with your fingers or to dig holes in the soap with Dickie had no idea what it was His father had given it to him in the hospital where Dickie was taken to say good bye to him Good bye had to be said because of father having fallen off the scaffolding where he was at work and not getting better You stick to that father had said looking dreadfully clean in the strange bed among all those other clean beds it s yourn your very own My dad give it to me and it belonged to his dad Don t you let any one take it away Some old lady told the old man it ud bring us luck So long old chap Dickie remembered every word of that speech and he kept the treasure There had been another thing with it tied on with string But Aunt Maud had found that and taken it away to take care of and he had never seen it again It was brassy with a white stone and some sort of pattern on it He had the treasure and he had not the least idea what it was with its bells that jangled such pretty music and its white spike so hard and smooth He did not know but I know It was a rattle a baby s old fashioned rattle or if you would rather call it that a coral and bells And we shall ave the fairest flowers of hill and dale said Dickie whispering comfortably in his dirty sheets and greensward Oh Tinkler dear twill indeed be a fair scene The gayest colors of the rainbow amid the Ague Able green of fresh leaves I do love the Man Next Door He has indeed a art of gold That was how Dickie talked to his friend Tinkler You know how he talked to his aunt and the Man Next Door I wonder whether you know that most children can speak at least two languages even if they have never had a foreign nurse or been to foreign climes or whether you think that you are the only child who can do this Believe me you are not Parents and guardians would be surprised to learn that dear little Charlie has a language quite different from the one he uses to them a language in which he talks to the cook and the housemaid And yet another language spoken with the real accent too in which he converses with the boot boy and the grooms Dickie however had learned his second language from books The teacher at his school had given him six Children of the New Forest Quentin Durward Hereward the Wake and three others all paper backed They made a new world for Dickie And since the people in books talked in this nice if odd way he saw no reason why he should not to a friend whom he could trust I hope you re not getting bored with all this You see I must tell you a little about the kind of boy Dickie was and the kind of way he lived or you won t understand his adventures And he had adventures no end of adventures as you will see presently Dickie woke gay as the spring sun that was trying to look in at him through his grimy windows Perhaps he ll do some more to the garden to day he said and got up very quickly He got up in the dirty comfortless room and dressed himself But in the evening he was undressed by kind clean hands and washed in a big bath half full of hot silvery water with soap that smelled like the timber yard at the end of the street Because going along to school with his silly little head full of Artistic Bird Seeds and flowers rainbow colored he had let his crutch slip on a banana skin and had tumbled down and a butcher s cart had gone over his poor lame foot So they took the hurt foot to the hospital and of course he had to go with it and the hospital was much more like the heaven he read of in his books than anything he had ever come across before He noticed that the nurses and the doctors spoke in the kind of words that he had found in his books and in a voice that he had not found anywhere so when on the second day a round faced smiling lady in a white cap said Well Tommy and how are we to day he replied My name is far from being Tommy and I am in Lux Ury and Af Fluence I thank you gracious lady At which the lady laughed and pinched his cheek When she grew to know him better and found out where he had learned to talk like that she produced more books And from them he learned more new words They were very nice to him at the hospital but when they sent him home they put his lame foot into a thick boot with a horrid clumpy sole and iron things that went up his leg His aunt and her friends said How kind but Dickie hated it The boys at school made game of it they had got used to the crutch and that was worse than being called Old Dot and go one which was what Dickie had got used to so used that it seemed almost like a pet name And on that first night of his return he found that he had been robbed They had taken his Tinkler from the safe corner in his bed where the ticking was broken and there was a soft flock nest for a boy s best friend He knew better than to ask what had become of it Instead he searched and searched the house in all its five rooms But he never found Tinkler Instead he found next day when his aunt had gone out shopping a little square of cardboard at the back of the dresser drawer among the dirty dusters and clothes pegs and string and corks and novelettes It was a pawn ticket Rattle One shilling Dickie knew all about pawn tickets You of course don t Well ask some grown up person to explain I haven t time I want to get on with the story Illustration IT IS A MOONFLOWER OF COURSE HE SAID Page thirteen Until he had found that ticket he had not been able to think of anything else He had not even cared to think about his garden and wonder whether the Artistic Bird Seeds had come up parrot colored He had been a very long time in the hospital and it was August now And the nurses had assured him that the seeds must be up long ago he would find everything flowering you see if he didn t And now he went out to look There was a tangle of green growth at the end of the garden and the next garden was full of weeds For the Man Next Door had gone off to look for work down Ashford way where the hop gardens are and the house was to let A few poor little pink and yellow flowers showed stunted among the green where he had sowed the Artistic Bird Seed And towering high above everything else oh three times as high as Dickie himself there was a flower a great flower like a sunflower only white Why said Dickie it s as big as a dinner plate It was It stood up beautiful and stately and turned its cream white face towards the sun The stalk s like a little tree said Dickie and so it was It had great drooping leaves and a dozen smaller white flowers stood out below it on long stalks thinner than that needed to support the moonflower itself It is a moonflower of course he said if the other kind s sunflowers I love it I love it I love it He did not allow himself much time for loving it however for he had business in hand He had somehow or other to get a shilling Because without a shilling he could not exchange that square of cardboard with Rattle on it for his one friend Tinkler And with the shilling he could This is part of the dismal magic of pawn tickets which some grown up will kindly explain to you I can t get money by the sweat of my brow said Dickie to himself nobody would let me run their errands when they could get a boy with both legs to do them Not likely I wish I d got something I could sell He looked round the yard dirtier and nastier than ever now in the parts that the Man Next Door had not had time to dig There was certainly nothing there that any one would want to buy especially now the rabbit hutch was gone Except why of course the moonflowers He got the old worn down knife out of the bowl on the back kitchen sink where it nestled among potato peelings like a flower among foliage and carefully cut half a dozen of the smaller flowers Then he limped up to New Cross Station and stood outside leaning on his crutch and holding out the flowers to the people who came crowding out of the station after the arrival of each train thick black crowds of tired people in too great a hurry to get home to their teas to care much about him or his flowers Everybody glanced at them for they were wonderful flowers as white as water lilies only flat the real sunflower shape and their centres were of the purest yellow gold color Pretty ain t they one black coated person would say to another And the other would reply No Yes I dunno Hurry up can t you It was no good Dickie was tired and the flowers were beginning to droop He turned to go home when a sudden thought brought the blood to his face He turned again quickly and went straight to the pawnbroker s You may be quite sure he had learned the address on the card by heart He went boldly into the shop which had three handsome gold balls hanging out above its door and in its window all sorts of pretty things rings and chains and brooches and watches and china and silk handkerchiefs and concertinas Well young man said the stout gentleman behind the counter what can we do for you I want to pawn my moonflowers said Dickie The stout gentleman roared with laughter and slapped a stout leg with a stout hand Well that s a good un he said as good a one as ever I heard Why you little duffer they d be dead long before you came back to redeem them that s certain You d have them while they were alive you know said Dickie gently What are they Don t seem up to much Though I don t know that I ever saw a flower just like them come to think of it said the pawnbroker who lived in a neat villa at Brockley and went in for gardening in a gentlemanly you needn t suppose I can t afford a real gardener if I like sort of way They re moonflowers said Dickie and I want to pawn them and then get something else out with the money Got the ticket said the gentleman cleverly seeing that he meant get out of pawn Yes said Dickie and it s my own Tinkler that my daddy gave me before he died and my aunt Missa propagated it when I was in hospital The man looked carefully at the card All right he said at last hand over the flowers They are not so bad he added more willing to prize them now that they were his things do look different when they are your own don t they Here Humphreys put these in a jug of water till I go home And get this out Illustration HERE HUMPHREYS PUT THESE IN A JUG OF WATER TILL I GO HOME Page sixteen A pale young man in spectacles appeared from a sort of dark cave at the back of the shop took flowers and ticket and was swallowed up again in the darkness of the cave Oh thank you said Dickie fervently I shall live but to repay your bounteous general rosity None of your cheek said the pawnbroker reddening and there was an awkward pause It s not cheek I meant it said Dickie at last speaking very earnestly You ll see some of these days I read an interesting Nar Rataive about a Lion the King of Beasts and a Mouse that small and Ty Morous animal which if you have not heard it I will now Pur seed to relite You re a rum little kid I don t think said the man Where do you learn such talk It s the wye they talk in books said Dickie suddenly returning to the language of his aunt You bein a toff I thought you d unnerstand My mistike No fense Mean to say you can talk like a book when you like and cut it off short like that I can Con vers like Lords and Lydies said Dickie in the accents of the gutter and your noble benefacteriness made me seek to express my feelinks with the best words at me Command Fond of books I believe you said Dickie and there were no more awkward pauses When the pale young man came back with something wrapped in a bit of clean rag he said a whispered word or two to the pawnbroker who unrolled the rag and looked closely at the rattle So it is he said and it s a beauty too let alone anything else Isn t he said Dickie touched by this praise of his treasured Tinkler I ve got something else here that s got the same crest as your rattle Crest said Dickie isn t that what you wear on your helmet in the heat and press of the Tower Nament The pawnbroker explained that crests no longer live exclusively on helmets but on all sorts of odd things And the queer little animal drawn in fine scratches on the side of the rattle was it seemed a crest Here Humphreys he added give it a rub up and bring that seal here The pale young man did something to Tinkler with some pinky powder and a brush and a wash leather while his master fitted together the two halves of a broken white cornelian It came out of a seal he said and I don t mind making you a present of it Oh said Dickie you are a real rightern And he rested his crutch against the counter expressly to clasp his hands in ecstasy as boys in books did My young man shall stick it together with cement the pawnbroker went on and put it in a little box Don t you take it out till to morrow and it ll be stuck fast Only don t go trying to seal with it or the sealing wax will melt the cement It ll bring you luck I shouldn t wonder It did and such luck as the kind pawnbroker never dreamed of But that comes further on in the story Dickie left the shop without his moonflowers indeed but with his Tinkler now whitely shining and declared to be real silver and mind you take care of it my lad his white cornelian seal carefully packed in a strong little cardboard box with metal corners Also a broken backed copy of Ingoldsby Legends and one of missus Markham s English History which had no back at all You must go on trying to improve your mind said the pawnbroker fussily He was very pleased with himself for having been so kind And come back and see me say next month I will said Dickie A thousand blessings from a grateful heart I will come back I say you are good Thank you thank you I will come back next month and tell you everything I have learned from the Perru Sal of your books Perusal said the pawnbroker that s the way to pernounce it Good bye my man and next month But next month found Dickie in a very different place from the pawnbroker s shop and with a very different person from the pawnbroker who in his rural retirement at Brockley gardened in such a gentlemanly way Dickie went home his aunt was still out His books told him that treasure is best hidden under loose boards unless of course your house has a secret panel which his had not There was a loose board in his room where the man saw to the gas He got it up and pushed his treasures as far in as he could along the rough crumbly surface of the lath and plaster Not a moment too soon For before the board was coaxed quite back into its place the voice of the aunt screamed up Come along down can t you I can hear you pounding about up there Come along down and fetch me a ha porth o wood I can t get the kettle to boil without a fire can I When Dickie came down his aunt slightly slapped him and he took the halfpenny and limped off obediently It was a very long time indeed before he came back Because before he got to the shop with no window to it but only shutters that were put up at night where the wood and coal were sold he saw a Punch and Judy show He had never seen one before and it interested him extremely He longed to see it unpack itself and display its wonders and he followed it through more streets than he knew and when he found that it was not going to unpack at all but was just going home to its bed in an old coach house he remembered the fire wood and the halfpenny clutched tight and close in his hand seemed to reproach him warmly He looked about him and knew that he did not at all know where he was There was a tall thin ragged man lounging against a stable door in the yard where the Punch and Judy show lived He took his clay pipe out of his mouth to say What s up matey Lost your way Dickie explained It s Lavender Terrace where I live he ended Lavender Terrace Rosemary Street Deptford I m going that way myself said the man getting away from the wall We ll go back by the boat if you like Ever been on the boat No said Dickie Like to Don t mind if I do said Dickie It was very pleasant with the steamboat going along in such a hurry pushing the water out of the way and puffing and blowing and something beating inside it like a giant s heart The wind blew freshly and the ragged man found a sheltered corner behind the funnel It was so sheltered and the wind had been so strong that Dickie felt sleepy When he said Ave I bin asleep the steamer was stopping at a pier at a strange place with trees Here we are said the man Ave you been asleep Not alf Stir yourself my man we get off here Is this Deptford Dickie asked And the people shoving and crushing to get off the steamer laughed when he said it Not exackly said the man but it s all right This ere s where we get off You ain t had yer tea yet my boy It was the most glorious tea Dickie had ever imagined Fried eggs and bacon he had one egg and the man had three bread and butter and if the bread was thick so was the butter and as many cups of tea as you liked to say thank you for When it was over the man asked Dickie if he could walk a little way and when Dickie said he could they set out in the most friendly way side by side I like it very much and thank you kindly said Dickie presently And the tea and all An the egg And this is the prettiest place ever I see But I ought to be getting ome I shall catch it a fair treat as it is She was waitin for the wood to boil the kettle when I come out Mother Aunt Not me real aunt Only I calls her that She any good Ain t bad when she s in a good temper That ain t what she ll be in when you gets back Seems to me you ve gone and done it mate Why it s hours and hours since you and me got acquainted Look the sun s just going It was over trees more beautiful than anything Dickie had ever seen for they were now in a country road with green hedges and green grass growing beside it in which little round faced flowers grew daisies they were even Dickie knew that I got to stick it said Dickie sadly I d best be getting home I wouldn t go ome not if I was you said the man I d go out and see the world a bit I would What me said Dickie Why not Come I ll make you a fair offer Ye come alonger me an see life I m a goin to tramp as far as Brighton and back all alongside the sea Ever seed the sea No said Dickie Oh no no I never Well you come alonger me I ain t it yer have I like what yer aunt do I give yer a ride in a pleasure boat only you went to sleep and I give you a tea fit for a hemperor Ain t I You ave that said Dickie Well that ll show you the sort of man I am So now I make you a fair offer You come longer me and be my little un and I ll be your daddy and a better dad I lay nor if I d been born so What do you say matey The man s manner was so kind and hearty the whole adventure was so wonderful and new Is it country where you going said Dickie looking at the green hedge All the way pretty near said the man We ll tramp it taking it easy all round the coast where gents go for their outings They ve always got a bit to spare then I lay you ll get some color in them cheeks o yours They re like putty now Come now What you say Is it a bargain Illustration HE LAY FACE DOWNWARD ON THE ROAD AND TURNED UP HIS BOOT Page twenty five It s very kind of you said Dickie but what call you got to do it It ll cost a lot my victuals I mean What call you got to do it The man scratched his head and hesitated Then he looked up at the sky and then down at the road they were resting on a heap of stones At last he said You re a sharp lad you are bloomin sharp Well I won t deceive you matey I want company Tramping alone ain t no beano to me An as I gets my living by the sweat of charitable ladies an gents it don t do no harm to ave a little nipper alongside They comes down andsomer if there s a nipper An I like nippers Some blokes don t but I do Dickie felt that this was true But We ll be beggars you mean he said doubtfully Oh don t call names said the man we ll take the road and if kind people gives us a helping hand well so much the better for all parties if wot they learned me at Sunday school s any good Well there it is Take it or leave it The sun shot long golden beams through the gaps in the hedge A bird paused in its flight on a branch quite close and clung there swaying A real live bird Dickie thought of the kitchen at home the lamp that smoked the dirty table the fender full of ashes and dirty paper the dry bread that tasted of mice and the water out of the broken earthenware cup That would be his breakfast when he had gone to bed crying after his aunt had slapped him I ll come said he and thank you kindly Mind you said the man carefully this ain t no kidnapping I ain t ticed you away You come on your own free wish eh Oh yes Can you write Yes said Dickie if I got a pen I got a pencil hold on a bit He took out of his pocket a new envelope a new sheet of paper and a new pencil ready sharpened by machinery It almost looked Dickie thought as though he had brought them out for some special purpose Perhaps he had Now said the man you take an write make it flat agin the sole of me boot He lay face downward on the road and turned up his boot as though boots were the most natural writing desks in the world Now write what I say mister Beale Dear Sir Will you please take me on tramp with you I ave no father nor yet mother to be uneasy Can you spell uneasy That s right you are a scholar an I asks you let me come alonger you Got that All right I ll stop a bit till you catch up Then you say If you take me along I promise to give you all what I earns or gets anyhow and be a good boy and do what you say And I shall be very glad if you will Your obedient servant What s your name eh Dickie Harding Get it wrote down then Done I m glad I wasn t born a table to be wrote on Don t it make yer legs stiff neither He rolled over took the paper and read it slowly and with difficulty Then he folded it and put it in his pocket Now we re square he said That ll stand true and legal in any police court in England that will And don t you forget it To the people who live in Rosemary Terrace the words police court are very alarming indeed Dickie turned a little paler and said Why police I ain t done nothing wrong writin what you telled me No my boy said the man you ain t done no wrong you done right But there s bad people in the world police and such as might lay it up to me as I took you away against your will They could put a man away for less than that But it ain t agin my will said Dickie I want to That s what I say said the man cheerfully So now we re agreed upon it if you ll step it we ll see about a doss for to night and to morrow we ll sleep in the bed with the green curtains I see that there in a book said Dickie charmed He Reward the Wake the last of the English and I wunnered what it stood for It stands for laying out said the man and so it does though that s not at all what the author of Hereward meant it to mean laying out under a edge or a aystack or such and lookin up at the stars till you goes by by An jolly good business too fine weather An then you oofs it a bit and resties a bit and some one gives you something to elp you along the road and in the evening you as a glass of ale at the Publy Kows and finds another set o green bed curtains An on Saturday you gets in a extra lot of prog and a Sunday you stays where you be and washes of your shirt Do you have adventures asked Dick recognizing in this description a rough sketch of the life of a modern knight errant Ventures I believe you said the man Why only last month a brute of a dog bit me in the leg at a back door Sutton way An once I see a elephant Wild asked Dickie thrilling Not azackly wild with a circus e was But big Wild ones ain t alf the size I lay And you meets soldiers and parties in red coats ridin on horses with spotted dawgs and motors as run you down and take your ead off afore you know you re dead if you don t look alive Adventures I should think so Ah said Dickie and a full silence fell between them Tired asked mister Beale presently Just a tiddy bit p raps said Dickie bravely but I can stick it We ll get summat with wheels for you to morrow said the man if it s only a sugar box an I can tie that leg of yours up to make it look like as if it was cut off It s this ere nasty boot as makes me tired said Dickie Hoff with it said the man obligingly down you sets on them stones and hoff with it T other too if you like You can keep to the grass The dewy grass felt pleasantly cool and clean to Dickie s tired little foot and when they crossed the road where a water cart had dripped it was delicious to feel the cool mud squeeze up between your toes That was charming but it was pleasant too to wash the mud off on the wet grass Dickie always remembered that moment It was the first time in his life that he really enjoyed being clean In the hospital you were almost too clean and you didn t do it yourself That made all the difference Yet it was the memory of the hospital that made him say I wish I could ave a bath So you shall said mister Beale a reg ler wash all over this very night I always like a wash meself Some blokes think it pays to be dirty But it don t If you re clean they say Honest Poverty an if you re dirty they say Serve you right We ll get a pail or something this very night You are good said Dickie I do like you mister Beale looked at him through the deepening twilight rather queerly Dickie thought Also he sighed heavily Oh well all s well as has no turning and things don t always What I mean to say you be a good boy and I ll do the right thing by you I know you will said Dickie with enthusiasm I know ow good you are Bless me said mister Beale uncomfortably Well there Step out sonny or we ll never get there this side Christmas Now you see that mister Beale may be a cruel wicked man who only wanted to get hold of Dickie so as to make money out of him and he may be going to be very unkind indeed to Dickie when once he gets him away into the country and is all alone with him and his having that paper and envelope and pencil all ready looks odd doesn t it Or he may be a really benevolent person Well you ll know all about it presently And here we are said mister Beale stopping in a side street at an open door from which yellow light streamed welcomingly Now mind you don t contradict anything wot I say to people And don t you forget you re my nipper and you got to call me daddy I ll call you farver said Dickie I got a daddy of my own you know Why said mister Beale stopping suddenly you said he was dead So he is said Dickie but e s my daddy all the same Oh come on said mister Beale impatiently And they went in CHAPTER II BURGLARS DICKIE fell asleep between clean coarse sheets in a hard narrow bed for which fourpence had been paid Put yer clobber under yer bolster likewise yer boots was the last instruction of his new friend and father There had been a bath or something equally cleansing in a pail near a fire where ragged but agreeable people were cooking herrings sausages and other delicacies on little gridirons or pans that they unrolled from the strange bundles that were their luggage One man who had no gridiron cooked a piece of steak on the kitchen tongs Dickie thought him very clever A very fat woman asked Dickie to toast a herring for her on a bit of wood and when he had done it she gave him two green apples He laid in bed and heard jolly voices talking and singing in the kitchen below And he thought how pleasant it was to be a tramp and what jolly fellows the tramps were for it seemed that all these nice people were on the road and this place where the kitchen was and the good company and the clean bed for fourpence was a Tramps Hotel one of many that are scattered over the country and called Common Lodging Houses The singing and laughing went on long after he had fallen asleep and if later in the evening there were loud voiced arguments or quarrels even Dickie did not hear them Next morning quite early they took the road From some mysterious source mister Beale had obtained an old double perambulator which must have been made Dickie thought for very fat twins it was so broad and roomy Artfully piled on the front part was all the furniture needed by travellers who mean to sleep every night at the Inn of the Silver Moon That is the inn where they have the beds with the green curtains What s all that there Dickie asked pointing to the odd knobbly bundles of all sorts and shapes tied on to the perambulator s front All our truck what we ll want on the road said Beale And that pillowy bundle on the seat That s our clothes I ve bought you a little jacket to put on o nights if it s cold or wet An when you want a lift why here s your carriage and you can sit up ere and ride like the Lord Mayor and I ll be yer horse the bundles ll set on yer knee like a fat babby Tell yer what mate looks to me as if I d took a fancy to you I ave to you I know that said Dickie settling his crutch firmly and putting his hand into mister Beale s mister Beale looked down at the touch Swelp me he said helplessly Then Does it hurt you walking Not like it did fore I went to the orspittle They said I d be able to walk to rights if I wore that there beastly boot But that urts worsen anythink Well said mister Beale you sing out when you get tired and I ll give yer a ride Oh look said Dickie the flowers They re only weeds said Beale They were in fact convolvuluses little pink ones with their tendrils and leaves laid flat to the dry earth by the wayside and in a water meadow below the road level big white ones twining among thick growing osiers and willows Dickie filled his hands with the pink ones and mister Beale let him They ll die directly he said But I shall have them while they re alive said Dickie as he had said to the pawnbroker about the moonflowers It was a wonderful day All the country sights and sounds that you hardly notice because you have known them every year as long as you can remember were wonderful magic to the little boy from Deptford The green hedge the cows looking over them the tinkle of sheep bells the baa of the sheep the black pigs in a sty close to the road their breathless rooting and grunting and the shiny blackleaded cylinders that were their bodies the stubbly fields where barley stood in sheaves real barley like the people next door but three gave to their hens the woodland shadows and the lights of sudden water shoulders of brown upland pressed against the open sky the shrill thrill of the skylark s song like canary birds got loose the splendor of distance you never see distance in Deptford the magpie that perched on a stump and cocked a bright eye at the travellers the thing that rustled a long length through dead leaves in a beech coppice and was it appeared a real live snake all these made the journey a royal progress to Dickie of Deptford He forgot that he was lame forgot that he had run away a fact that had cost him a twinge or two of fear or conscience earlier in the morning He was happy as a prince is happy new come to his inheritance and it was mister Beale after all who was the first to remember that there was a carriage in which a tired little boy might ride In you gets he said suddenly you ll be fair knocked You can look about you just as well a sittin down he added laying the crutch across the front of the perambulator Never see such a nipper for noticing neither Hi there goes a rabbit See im Crost the road there See him Dickie saw and the crown was set on his happiness A rabbit Like the ones that his fancy had put in the mouldering hutch at home It s got loose said Dickie trying to scramble out of the perambulator let s catch im and take im along E ain t loose e s wild mister Beale explained e ain t never bin caught Lives out ere with is little friendses he added after a violent effort of imagination in oles in the ground Gets is own meals and larks about on is own How beautiful said Dickie wriggling with delight This life of the rabbit as described by mister Beale was the child s first glimpse of freedom I d like to be a rabbit You much better be my little nipper said Beale Steady on mate Ow m I to wheel the bloomin pram if you goes on like as if you was a bag of eels They camped by a copse for the midday meal sat on the grass made a fire of sticks and cooked herrings in a frying pan produced from one of the knobbly bundles It s better n Fiff of November said Dickie and I do like you I like you nexter my own daddy and mister Baxter next door That s all right said mister Beale awkwardly It was in the afternoon that half way up a hill they saw coming over the crest a lady and a little girl Hout yer gets said mister Beale quickly walk as oppy as you can and if they arsts you you say you ain t ad nothing to eat since las night and then it was a bit o dry bread Right you are said Dickie enjoying the game An mind you call me father Yuss said Dickie exaggerating his lameness in the most spirited way It was acting you see and all children love acting mister Beale went more and more slowly and as the lady and the little girl drew near he stopped altogether and touched his cap Dickie quick to imitate touched his Could you spare a trifle mum said Beale very gently and humbly to elp us along the road My little chap e s lame like wot you see It s a ard life for the likes of im mum He ought to be at home with his mother said the lady Beale drew his coat sleeve across his eyes E ain t got no mother he said she was took bad sudden a chill it was and struck to her innards She died in the infirmary Three months ago it was mum And us not able even to get a bit of black for her Dickie sniffed Poor little man said the lady you miss your mother don t you Yuss said Dickie sadly but farver e s very good to me I couldn t get on if it wasn t for farver Oh well done little un said mister Beale to himself We lay under a aystack last night he said aloud and where we ll lie to night gracious only knows without some kind soul lends us a elping and The lady fumbled in her pocket and the little girl said to Dickie Where are all your toys I ain t got but two said Dickie and they re at ome one of them s silver real silver my grandfarver ad it when e was a little boy But if you ve got silver you oughtn t to be begging said the lady shutting up her purse Beale frowned It only pawns for a shilling said Dickie and farver knows what store I sets by it A shillin s a lot I grant you that said Beale eagerly but I wouldn t go to take away the nipper s little bit o pleasure not for no shilling I wouldn t he ended nobly with a fond look at Dickie Illustration IT ONLY PAWNS FOR A SHILLIN SAID DICKIE Page thirty seven You re a kind father said the lady Yes isn t he mother said the little girl May I give the little boy my penny The two travellers were left facing each other the richer by a penny and oh wonderful good fortune a whole half crown They exchanged such glances as might pass between two actors as the curtain goes down on a successful dramatic performance You did that bit fine said Beale fine you did You been there before ain t ye No I never said Dickie ere s the steever You stick to that said Beale radiant with delight you re a fair masterpiece you are you earned it honest if ever a kid done Pats you on the napper she does and out with arf a dollar A bit of all right I call it They went on up the hill as happy as any one need wish to be They had told lies you observe and had by these lies managed to get half a crown and a penny out of the charitable and far from being ashamed of their acts they were bubbling over with merriment and delight at their own cleverness Please do not be too shocked Remember that neither of them knew any better To the elder tramp lies and begging were natural means of livelihood To the little tramp the whole thing was a new and entrancing game of make believe By evening they had seven and sixpence Us ll ave a fourpenny doss outer this said Beale Swelp me Bob we ll be ridin in our own moty afore we know where we are at this rate But you said the bed with the green curtains urged Dickie Well p rhaps you re right Lay up for a rainy day eh Which this ain t not by no means There s a aystack a bit out of the town if I remember right Come on mate And Dickie for the first time slept out of doors Have you ever slept out of doors The night is full of interesting little sounds that will not at first let you sleep the rustle of little wild things in the hedges the barking of dogs in distant farms the chirp of crickets and the croaking of frogs And in the morning the birds wake you and you curl down warm among the hay and look up at the sky that is growing lighter and lighter and breathe the chill sweet air and go to sleep again wondering how you have ever been able to lie of nights in one of those shut up boxes with holes in them which we call houses The new game of begging and inventing stories to interest the people from whom it was worth while to beg went on gaily day by day and week by week and Dickie by constant practice grew so clever at taking his part in the acting that mister Beale was quite dazed with admiration Blessed if I ever see such a nipper he said over and over again And when they got nearly to Hythe and met with the red whiskered man who got up suddenly out of the hedge and said he d been hanging off and on expecting them for nigh on a week mister Beale sent Dickie into a field to look for mushrooms which didn t grow there expressly that he might have a private conversation with the red whiskered man a conversation which began thus Couldn t get ere afore Couldn t get a nipper E s oppy e is e ain t no good No good said Beale That s all you know E s a wunner and no bloomin error Turns the ladies round is finger as easy as kiss yer and Clever as a traindawg e is an all outer is own ead And to ear the way e does the patter to me on the road It s as good as a gaff any day to ear im My word I ain t sure as I adn t better stick to the road and keep away from old ands like you Jim Doin well eh said Jim Not so dusty said mister Beale cautiously we mugger along some ow An e s got so red in the face and plumped out so they ll soon say e doesn t want their dibs Starve im a bit said the red whiskered man cheerfully mister Beale laughed Then he spat thoughtfully Then he said It s rum I likes to see the little beggar stokin up for all it spoils the market If e gets a bit fat e makes it up in cleverness You should ear im and so forth and so on till the red whiskered man said quite crossly Seems to me you re a bit dotty about this ere extry double nipper I never knew you took like it afore Fact is said Beale with an air of great candor it s is cleverness does me It ain t as I m silly about im but e s that clever I ope e s clever enough to do wot e s told Keep is mug shut that s all He s clever enough for hanythink said Beale and close as wax E s got a silver toy idden away somewhere it only pops for a bob and d you think e ll tell me where it s stowed Not im and us such pals as never was and is jaw wagging all day long But e s never let it out Oh stow it said the other impatiently I don t want to ear no more

train it Abrams e ll be there Monday And see ere He sank his voice to a whisper When Dickie came back without mushrooms the red whiskered man was gone See that bloke just now said mister Beale Yuss said Dickie Well you never see im If any one arsts you if you ever see im you never set eyes on im in all your born not to remember im Might a passed im in a crowd see Yuss said Dickie again Tasn t been arf a panto neither Us two on the road mister Beale went on Not arf Well now we re a goin in the train like dooks an after that we re a goin to ave a rare old beano I give you my word Dickie was full of questions but mister Beale had no answers for them You jes wait hold on a bit them as lives longest sees most these were the sort of remarks which were all that Dickie could get out of him It was not the next day which was a Saturday that they took the train like dukes Nor was it Sunday on which they took a rest and washed their shirts according to mister Beale s rule of life They took the train on Monday and it landed them in a very bright town by the sea Its pavements were of red brick and its houses of white stone and its bow windows and balconies were green and Dickie thought it was the prettiest town in the world They did not stay there but walked out across the downs where the skylarks were singing and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone walls and towers very strong and gray What s that there said Dickie It s a carstle like wot the King s got at Windsor Is it a king as lives ere then Dickie asked No Nobody don t live ere mate said mister Beale It s a ruin this is Only howls and rats lives in ruins Did any one ever live in it I shouldn t wonder said mister Beale indifferently Yes course they must ave come to think of it But you learned all that at school It s what they call ist ry Dickie after some reflection said D jever ear of Here Ward I knowed a Jake Ward wunst Here Ward the Wake He ain t a bloke you d know e s in istry Tell you if you like The tale of Hereward the Wake lasted till the jolting perambulator came to anchor in a hollow place among thick furze bushes The bare thick stems of the furze held it up like a roof over their heads as they sat It was like a little furze house Next morning mister Beale shaved a thing he had not done since they left London Dickie held the mug and the soap It was great fun and afterwards mister Beale looked quite different That was great fun too And he got quite a different set of clothes out of his bundles and put them on And that was the greatest fun of all Now then he said we re a goin to lay low ere all d y we are And then come evening we re a goin to ave our beano That red eaded chap wot you never see e ll lift you up to a window what s got bars to it and you ll creep through you being so little and you ll go soft s a mouse the way I ll show you and undo the side door There s a key and a chain and a bottom bolt The top bolt s cut through and all the others is oiled That won t frighten you will it No said Dickie What should it frighten me for Well it s like this said mister Beale a little embarrassed Suppose you was to get pinched What ud pinch me A dawg There won t be no dawg A man or a lady or somebody in the ouse Supposen they was to nab you what ud you say Dickie was watching his face carefully Whatever you tells me to say he said The man slapped his leg gently If that ain t the nipper all over Well if they was to nab you you just say what I tells you to And then first chance you get you slip away from em and go to the station An if they comes arter you you say you re a goin to your father at Dover And first chance you get you slip off and you come to that ouse where you and me slep at Gravesend I ve got the dibs for yer ticket done up in this ere belt I m a goin to put on you But don t you let on to any one it s Gravesend you re a coming to See An if I don t get pinched Then you just opens the door and me and that redheaded bloke we comes in What for asked Dickie To look for some tools e mislaid there a year ago when e was on a plumbing job and they won t let im ave them back not by fair means they won t That s what for Rats said Dickie briefly I ain t a baby It s burgling that s what it is You ll a jolly sight too fond of calling names said Beale anxiously Never mind what it is You be a good boy matey and do what you re told That s what you do You know ow to stick it on if you re pinched If you ain t you just lay low till we comes out with the the plumber s tools See And if I m nabbed what is it I am to say You must let on as a strange chap collared you on the road a strange chap with a black beard and a red ankercher and give you a licking if you didn t go and climb in at the window Say you lost your father in the town and this chap said he knew where e was and if you see me you don t know me Nor yet that redheaded chap wot you never see He looked down at the small earnest face turned up to his own You are a little nipper he said affectionately I don t know as I ever noticed before quite wot a little un you was Think you can stick it You shan t go without you wants to matey There It s splendid said Dickie it is an adventure for a bold knight I shall feel like Here Ward when he dressed in the potter s clothes and went to see King William He spoke in the book voice There you go said mister Beale but don t you go and talk to em like that if they pinches you they d never let you loose again Think they d got a marquis in disguise so they would Dickie thought all day about this great adventure He did not tell mister Beale so but he was very proud of being so trusted If you come to think of it burgling must be a very exciting profession And Dickie had no idea that it was wrong It seemed to him a wholly delightful and sporting amusement While he was exploring the fox runs among the thick stems of the grass mister Beale lay at full length and pondered I don t more n arf like it he said to himself Ho yuss I know that s wot I got him for all right But e s such a jolly little nipper I wouldn t like anything to appen to im so I wouldn t Dickie took his boots off and went to sleep as usual and in the middle of the night mister Beale woke him up and said It s time There was no moon that night and it was very very dark mister Beale carried Dickie on his back for what seemed a very long way along dark roads under dark trees and over dark meadows A dark bush divided itself into two parts and one part came surprisingly towards them It turned out to be the red whiskered man and presently from a ditch another man came And they all climbed a chill damp park fence and crept along among trees and shrubs along the inside of a high park wall Dickie still on mister Beale s shoulders was astonished to find how quietly this big clumsy looking man could move Through openings in the trees and bushes Dickie could see the wide park like a spread shadow dotted with trees that were like shadows too And on the other side of it the white face of a great house showed only a little paler than the trees about it There were no lights in the house They got quite close to it before the shelter of the trees ended for a little wood lay between the wall and the house Dickie s heart was beating very fast Quite soon now his part in the adventure would begin Ere catch old mister Beale was saying and the red whiskered man took Dickie in his arms and went forward The other two crouched in the wood Dickie felt himself lifted and caught at the window sill with his hands It was a damp night and smelled of earth and dead leaves The window sill was of stone very cold Dickie knew exactly what to do mister Beale had explained it over and over again all day He settled himself on the broad window ledge and held on to the iron window bars while the red whiskered man took out a pane of glass with treacle and a handkerchief so that there should be no noise of breaking or falling glass Then Dickie put his hand through and unfastened the window which opened like a cupboard door Then he put his feet through the narrow space between two bars and slid through He hung inside with his hands holding the bars till his foot found the table that he had been told to expect just below and he got from that to the floor Now I must remember exactly which way to go he told himself But he did not need to remember what he had been told For quite certainly and most oddly he knew exactly where the door was and when he had crept to it and got it open he found that he now knew quite well which way to turn and what passages to go along to get to that little side door that he was to open for the three men It was exactly as though he had been there before in a dream He went as quietly as a mouse creeping on hands and knee the lame foot dragging quietly behind him I will not pretend that he was not frightened He was very But he was more brave than he was frightened which is the essence of bravery after all He found it difficult to breathe quietly and his heart beat so loudly that he felt almost sure that if any people were awake in the house they would hear it even up stairs in their beds But he got to the little side door and feeling with sensitive quick fingers found the well oiled bolt and shot it back Then the chain holding the loose loop of it in his hand so that it should not rattle he slipped its ball from the socket Only the turning of the key remained and Dickie accomplished that with both hands for it was a big key kneeling on his one sound knee Then very gently he turned the handle and pulled and the door opened and he crept from behind it and felt the cool sweet air of the night on his face It seemed to him that he had never known what silence was before or darkness For the door opened into a close box arbor and no sky could be seen or any shapes of things Dickie felt himself almost bursting with pride What an adventure And he had carried out his part of it perfectly He had done exactly what he had been told to do and he had done it well He stood there on his one useful foot clinging to the edge of the door and it was not until something touched him that he knew that mister Beale and the other men were creeping through the door that he had opened And at that touch a most odd feeling came to Dickie the last feeling he would have expected a feeling of pride mixed with a feeling of shame Pride in his own cleverness and another kind of pride that made that cleverness seem shameful He had a feeling very queer and very strong that he Dickie was not the sort of person to open doors for the letting in of burglars He felt as you would feel if you suddenly found your hands covered with filth not good honest dirt but slimy filth and would not understand how you could have let it get there He caught at the third shape that brushed by him Father he whispered don t do it Go back and I ll fasten it all up again Oh don t father Shut your mug whispered the red whiskered man Dickie knew his voice even in that velvet black darkness Shut your mug or I ll give you what for Don t father said Dickie and said it all the more for that threat I can t go back on my pals matey said mister Beale you see that don t yer Dickie did see The adventure was begun it was impossible to stop It was helped and had to be eaten as they say in Norfolk He crouched behind the open door and heard the soft pad pad of the three men s feet on the stones of the passage grow fainter and fainter They had woolen socks over their boots which made their footsteps sound no louder than those of padded pussy feet Then the soft rustle pad died away and it was perfectly quiet perfectly dark Dickie was tired it was long past his proper bedtime and the exertion of being so extra clever had been very tiring He was almost asleep when a crack like thunder brought him stark staring awake there was a noise of feet on the stairs boots a blundering hurried rush People came rushing past him There was another sharp thunder sound and a flash like lightning only much smaller Some one tripped and fell there was a clatter like pails and something hard and smooth hit him on the knee Then another hurried presence dashed past him into the quiet night Another No there was a woman s voice Edward you shan t Let them go You shan t no And suddenly there was a light that made one wink and blink A tall lady in white carrying a lamp swept down the stairs and caught at a man who sprang into being out of the darkness into the lamplight Take the lamp she said and thrust it on him Then with unbelievable quickness she bolted and chained the door locked it and turning saw Dickie What s this she said Oh Edward quick here s one of them Why it s a child Some more people were coming down the stairs with candles and excited voices Their clothes were oddly bright Dickie had never seen dressing gowns before They moved in a very odd way and then began to go round and round like tops The next thing that Dickie remembers is being in a room that seemed full of people and lights and wonderful furniture with some one holding a glass to his lips a little glass that smelled of public houses very nasty No said Dickie turning away his head Better asked a lady and Dickie was astonished to find that he was on her lap Yes thank you he said and tried to sit up but lay back again because that was so much more pleasant He had had no idea that any one s lap could be so comfortable Now young man said a stern voice that was not a lady s just you tell us how you came here and who put you up to it I got in said Dickie feebly through the butler s pantry window and as he said it he wondered how he had known that it was the butler s pantry It is certain that no one had told him What for asked the voice which Dickie now perceived came from a gentleman in rumpled hair and a very loose pink flannel suit with cordy things on it such as soldiers have To let Dickie stopped This was the moment he had been so carefully prepared for He must think what he was saying Yes said the lady gently it s all right poor little chap don t be frightened nobody wants to hurt you I m not frightened said Dickie not now To let reminded the lady persuasively To let the man in What man I dunno There were three or four of them said the gentleman in pink four or five What man dear the lady asked again The man as said e knew w ere my farver was said Dickie remembering what he had been told to say so I went along of im an then in the wood e said e d give me a dressing down if I didn t get through the winder and open the door e said e d left some tools ere and you wouldn t let im ave them You see said the lady the child didn t know He s perfectly innocent And she kissed Dickie s hair very softly and kindly Dickie did not understand then why he suddenly felt as though he were going to choke His head felt as though it were going to burst His ears grew very hot and his hands and feet very cold I know d right enough he said suddenly and hoarsely an I needn t a gone if I adn t wanted to He s feverish said the lady he doesn t know what he s saying Look how flushed he is I wanted to said Dickie I thought it ud be a lark And it was too He expected to be shaken and put down He wondered where his crutch was mister Beale had had it under his arm How could he get to Gravesend without a crutch But he wasn t shaken or put down instead the lady gathered him up in her arms and stood up holding him I shall put him to bed she said you shan t ask him any more questions to night There s time enough in the morning She carried Dickie out of the drawing room and away from the other people to a big room with blue walls and blue and gray curtains and beautiful furniture There was a high four post bed with blue silk curtains and more pillows than Dickie had ever seen before The lady washed him with sweet smelling water in a big basin with blue and gold flowers on it dressed him in a lace trimmed nightgown which must have been her own for it was much too big for any little boy Then she put him into the soft warm bed that was like a giant s pillow tucked him up and kissed him Dickie put thin arms round her neck I do like you he said but I want farver Where is he No you must tell me that in the morning Drink up this milk she had it ready in a glass that sparkled in a pattern and then go sound asleep Everything will be all right dear May Heavens said Dickie sleepily bless you generous Bean Factress A most extraordinary child said the lady returning to her husband I can t think who it is that he reminds me of Where are the others I packed them off to bed There s nothing to be done said her husband We ought to have gone after those men They didn t get anything she said No dropped it all when I fired Come on let s turn in Poor Eleanor you must be worn out Edward said the lady I wish we could adopt that little boy I m sure he comes of good people he s been kidnapped or something Don t be a dear silly one said Sir Edward That night Dickie slept in sheets of the finest linen scented with lavender He was sunk downily among pillows and over him lay a down quilt covered with blue flowered satin On the foot board of the great bed was carved a shield and a great dog on it Dickie s clothes lay a dusty forlorn little heap in a stately tapestry covered chair And he slept and dreamed of mister Beale and the little house among the furze and the bed with the green curtains CHAPTER III THE ESCAPE WHEN Lady Talbot leaned over the side of the big bed to awaken Dickie Harding she wished with all her heart that she had just such a little boy of her own and when Dickie awoke and looked in her kind eyes he felt quite sure that if he had had a mother she would have been like this lady Only about the face he told himself not the way she s got up nor yet her hair nor nuffink of that sort Did you sleep well she asked him stroking his hair with extraordinary gentleness A fair treat said he Was your bed comfortable Ain t it soft neither he answered I don t know as ever I felt of anythink quite as soft without it was the geese as angs up along the Broadway Christmas time Why the bed s made of goose feathers she said and Dickie was delighted by the coincidence Ave you got e er a little boy he asked pursuing his first waking thought No dear if I had I could lend you some of his clothes As it is we shall have to put you into your own She spoke as though she were sorry Dickie saw no matter for regret My father e bought me a little coat for when it was cold of a night lying out Lying out Where In the bed with the green curtains said Dickie This led to Here Ward and Dickie would willingly have told the whole story of that hero in full detail but the lady said after breakfast and now it was time for our bath And sure enough there was a bath of steaming water before the fireplace which was in quite another part of the room so that Dickie had not noticed the cans being brought in by a maid in a pink print dress and white cap and apron Come said the lady turning back the bed clothes Somehow Dickie could not bear to let that lady see him crawl clumsily across the floor as he had to do when he moved without his crutch It was not because he thought she would make fun of him perhaps it was because he knew she would not And yet without his crutch how else was he to get to that bath And for no reason that he could have given he began to cry The lady s arms were round him in an instant What is it dear Whatever is it she asked and Dickie sobbed out I ain t got my crutch and I can t go to that there barf without I got it Anything ud do if twas only an old broom cut down to me eighth I m a cripple they call it you see I can t walk like wot you can She carried him to the bath There was scented soap there was a sponge and a warm fluffy towel I ain t had a barf since Gravesend said Dickie and flushed at the indiscretion Since when dear Since Wednesday said Dickie anxiously He and the lady had breakfast together in a big room with long windows that the sun shone in at and outside a green garden There were a lot of things to eat in silver dishes and the very eggs had silver cups to sit in and all the spoons and forks had dogs scratched on them like the one that was carved on the foot board of the bed up stairs All except the little slender spoon that Dickie had to eat his egg with And on that there was no dog but something quite different Why said he his face brightening with joyous recognition my Tinkler s got this on it just the very moral of it so e as Then he had to tell all about Tinkler and the lady looked thoughtful and interested and when the gentleman came in and kissed her and said How were we this morning Dickie had to tell about Tinkler all over again and then the lady said several things very quickly beginning with I told you so Edward and ending with I knew he wasn t a common child Dickie missed the middle part of what she said because of the way his egg behaved suddenly bursting all down one side and running over into the salt which of course had to be stopped at all costs by some means or other The tongue was the easiest The gentleman laughed Weh don t eat the egg cup he said We shall want it again Have another egg But Dickie s pride was hurt and he wouldn t The gentleman must be very stupid he thought not to know the difference between licking and eating And as if anybody could eat an egg cup anyhow He was glad when the gentleman went away After breakfast Dickie was measured for a crutch that is to say a broom was held up beside him and a piece cut off its handle Then the lady wrapped flannel around the hairy part of the broom and sewed black velvet over that It was a beautiful crutch and Dickie said so Also he showed his gratitude by inviting the lady to look ow spry e was on is pins but she only looked a very little while and then turned and gazed out of the window So Dickie had a good look at the room and the furniture it was all different from anything he ever remembered seeing and yet he couldn t help thinking he had seen them before these high backed chairs covered with flowers like on carpets the carved bookcases with rows on rows of golden beaded books the bow fronted shining sideboard with handles that shone like gold and the corner cupboard with glass doors and china inside red and blue and goldy It was a very odd feeling I don t think that I can describe it better than by saying that he looked at all these things with a double pleasure the pleasure of looking at new and beautiful things and the pleasure of seeing again things old and beautiful which he had not seen for a very long time His limping survey of the room ended at the windows when the lady turned suddenly knelt down put her hand under his chin and looked into his eyes Dickie she said how would you like to stay here and be my little boy I d like it right enough said he only I got to go back to father But if father says you may E won t said Dickie with certainty an besides there s Tinkler Well you re to stay here and be my little boy till we find out where father is We shall let the police know They re sure to find him The pleece Dickie cried in horror Why father e ain t done nothing No no of course not said the lady in a hurry but the police know all sorts of things about where people are I know and what they re doing even when they haven t done anything The pleece knows a jolly sight too much said Dickie in gloom And now all Dickie s little soul was filled with one longing all his little brain awake to one only thought the police were to be set on the track of Beale the man whom he called father the man who had been kind to him had wheeled him in a perambulator for miles and miles through enchanted country the man who had bought him a little coat to put on o nights if it was cold or wet the man who had shown him the wonderful world to which he awakens who has slept in the bed with the green curtains The lady s house was more beautiful than anything he had ever imagined yet not more beautiful than certain things that he almost imagined that he remembered The lady was better than beautiful she was dear Her eyes were the eyes to which it is good to laugh her arms were the arms in which it is good to cry The tree dotted parkland was to Dickie the Land of Heart s Desire But father Beale who had been kind whom Dickie loved The lady left him alone with a book beautiful beyond his dreams three great volumes with pictures of things that had happened and been since the days of Hereward himself The author s charming name was Green and recalled curtains and nights under the stars But even those beautiful pictures could not keep Dickie s thoughts from mister Beale father by adoption and love If the police were set to find out where he was and what he was doing Somehow or other Dickie must get to Gravesend to that house where there had been a bath or something like it in a pail and where kindly tramp people had toasted herrings and given apples to little boys who helped He had helped then And by all the laws of fair play there ought to be some one now to help him The beautiful book lay on the table before him but he no longer saw it He no longer cared for it All he cared for was to find a friend who would help him And he found one And the friend who helped him was an enemy The smart pink frocked white capped white aproned maid who unseen by Dickie had brought the bath water and the bath came in with a duster She looked malevolently at Dickie Shovin yourself in she said rudely I ain t said he If she wants to make a fool of a kid ain t I got clever brothers and sisters inquired the maid her chin in the air Nobody says you ain t and nobody ain t makin a fool of me said Dickie Ho no Course they ain t the maid rejoined People comes ere without e er a shirt to their backs and makes fools of their betters That s the way it is ain t it Ain t she arst you to stay and be er little boy Yes said Dickie Ah I thought she ad said the maid triumphantly and you ll stay But if I m expected to call you Master Whatever your silly name is I gives a month s warning so I tell you straight I don t want to stay said Dickie at least Oh tell me another said the girl impatiently and left him without having made the slightest use of the duster Dickie was taken for a drive in a little carriage drawn by a cream colored pony with a long tail a perfect dream of a pony and the lady allowed him to hold the reins But even amid this delight he remembered to ask whether she had put the police on to father yet and was relieved to hear that she had not It was Markham who was told to wash Dickie s hands when the drive was over and Markham was the enemy with the clever brothers and sisters Wash em yourself she said among the soap and silver and marble and sponges It ain t my work You d better said Dickie or the lady ll know the difference It ain t my work neither and I ain t so used to washing as what you are and that s the truth So she washed him not very gently It s no use your getting your knife into me he said as the towel was plied I didn t arst to come ere did I No you little thief Stow that said Dickie and after a quick glance at his set lips she said Well next door to anyhow I should be ashamed to show my face ere if I was you after last night There you re dry now Cut along down to the dining room The servants hall s good enough for honest people as don t break into houses All through that day of wonder which included real roses that you could pick and smell and real gooseberries that you could gather and eat as well as picture books a clockwork bear a musical box and a doll s house almost as big as a small villa an idea kept on hammering at the other side of a locked door in Dickie s mind and when he was in bed it got the door open and came out and looked at him And he recognized it at once as a really useful idea Markham will bring you some warm milk Drink it up and sleep well darling said the lady and with the idea very near and plain he put his arms round her neck and hugged her Good bye he said you are good I do love you The lady went away very pleased When Markham came with the milk Dickie said You want me gone don t you Markham said she didn t care Well but how am I to get away with my crutch Mean to say you d cut and run if you was the same as me about the legs I mean Yes said Dickie And not nick anything Not a bloomin thing said he Well said Markham you ve got a spirit I will say that You see said Dickie I wants to get back to farver Bless the child said Markham quite affected by this Why don t you help me get out Once I was outside the park I d do all right Much as my place is worth said Markham don t you say another word getting me into trouble But Dickie said a good many other words and fell asleep quite satisfied with the last words that had fallen from Markham These words were We ll see It was only just daylight when Markham woke him She dressed him hurriedly and carried him and his crutch down the back stairs and into that very butler s pantry through whose window he had crept at the bidding of the red haired man No one else seemed to be about Now she said the gardener he has got a few hampers ready fruit and flowers and the like and he drives em to the station fore any one s up They d only go to waste if e wasn t to sell em See An he s a particular friend of mine and he won t mind an extry hamper more or less So out with you Joe she whispered you there Joe outside whispered that he was And Markham lifted Dickie to the window As she did so she kissed him Cheer oh old chap she said I m sorry I was so short An you do want to get out of it don t you No error said Dickie an I ll never split about him selling the vegetables and things You re too sharp to live Markham declared and next moment he was through the window and Joe was laying him in a long hamper half filled with straw that stood waiting I ll put you in the van along with the other hampers whispered Joe as he shut the lid Then when you re in the train you just cut the string with this ere little knife I ll make you a present of and out you gets I ll make it all right with the guard He knows me And he ll put you down at whatever station you say Here don t forget is breakfast said Markham reaching her arm through the window It was a wonderful breakfast Five cold rissoles a lot of bread and butter two slices of cake and a bottle of milk And it was fun eating agreeable and unusual things lying down in the roomy hamper among the smooth straw The jolting of the cart did not worry Dickie at all He was used to the perambulator and he ate as much as he wanted to eat and when that was done he put the rest in his pocket and curled up comfortably in the straw for there was still quite a lot left of what ordinary people consider night and also there was quite a lot left of the sleepiness with which he had gone to bed at the end of the wonderful day It was not only just body sleepiness the kind you get after a long walk or a long play day It was mind sleepiness Dickie had gone through so much in the last thirty six hours that his poor little brain felt quite worn out He fell asleep among the straw fingering the clasp knife in his pocket and thinking how smartly he would cut the string when the time came Illustration THREE OR FOUR FACES LOOKED DOWN AT DICKIE Page seventy And he slept for a very long time Such a long time that when he did wake up there was no longer any need to cut the string of the hamper Some one else had done that and the lid of the basket was open and three or four faces looked down at Dickie and a girl s voice said Why it s a little boy And a crutch oh dear Dickie sat up The little crutch which was lying corner wise above him in the hamper jerked out and rattled on the floor Well I never did never said another voice Come out dearie don t be frightened How kind people are Dickie thought and reached his hands to slender white hands that were held out to him A lady in black her figure was as slender as her hands drew him up put her arms round him and lifted him on to a black bentwood chair His eyes turning swiftly here and there showed him that he was in a shop a shop full of flowers and fruit mister Rosenberg said the slender lady oh do come here please This extra hamper A dark handsome big nosed man came towards them It s a dear little boy said the slender lady who had a pale kind face dark eyes and very red lips It th a practical joke I shuppothe said the dark man Our gardening friend wanth a liththon and I ll thee he getth it It wasn t his fault said Dickie wriggling earnestly in his high chair it was my fault I fell asleep The girls crowded round him with questions and caresses I ought to have cut the string in the train and told the guard he s a friend of the gardener s he said but I was asleep I don t know as ever I slep so sound afore Like as if I d had sleepy stuff you know Like they give me at the orspittle I should not like to think that Markham had gone so far as to put sleepy stuff in that bottle of milk but I am afraid she was not very particular and she may have thought it best to send Dickie to sleep so that he could not betray her or her gardener friend until he was very far away from both of them But why asked the long nosed gentleman why put boyth in bathketth Upthetting everybody like thith he added crossly It was said Dickie slowly a sort of joke I don t want to go upsetting of people If you ll lift me down and give me me crutch I ll ook it But the young ladies would not hear of his hooking it We may keep him mayn t we mister Rosenberg they said and he judged that mister Rosenberg was a kind man or they would not have dared to speak so to him let s keep him till closing time and then one of us will see him home He lives in London He says so Dickie had indeed murmured words to this effect as policemen call it when they are not quite sure what people really have said Ath you like said mister Rosenberg only you muthn t let him interfere with bithneth thath all They took him away to the back of the shop They were dear girls and they were very nice to Dickie They gave him grapes and a banana and some Marie biscuits and they folded sacks for him to lie on And Dickie liked them and was grateful to them and watched his opportunity Because however kind people were there was one thing he had to do to get back to the Gravesend lodging house as his father had told him to do The opportunity did not come till late in the afternoon when one of the girls was boiling a kettle on a spirit lamp and one had gone out to get cakes in Dickie s honor which made him uncomfortable but duty is duty and over the Gravesend lodging house the star of duty shone and beckoned The third young lady and mister Rosenberg were engaged in animated explanations with a fair young gentleman about a basket of roses that had been ordered and had not been sent Cath mister Rosenberg was saying cath down enthureth thpeedy delivery And the young lady was saying I am extremely sorry sir it was a misunderstanding And to the music of their two voices Dickie edged along close to the grapes and melons holding on to the shelf on which they lay so as not to attract attention by the tap tapping of his crutch He passed silently and slowly between the rose filled window and the heap of bananas that adorned the other side of the doorway turned the corner threw his arm over his crutch and legged away for dear life down a sort of covered Arcade turned its corner and found himself in a wilderness of baskets and carts and vegetables threaded his way through them in and out among the baskets over fallen cabbage leaves under horses noses found a quiet street a still quieter archway pulled out the knife however his adventure ended he was that knife to the good and prepared to cut the money out of the belt mister Beale had buckled round him And the belt was not there Had he dropped it somewhere Or had he and Markham in the hurry of that twilight dressing forgotten to put it on He did not know All he knew was that the belt was not on him and that he was alone in London without money and that at Gravesend his father was waiting for him waiting waiting Dickie knew what it meant to wait He went out into the street and asked the first good natured looking loafer he saw the way to Gravesend Way to your grandmother said the loafer don t you come saucing of me But which is the way said Dickie The man looked hard at him and then pointed with a grimy thumb over his shoulder It s thirty mile if it s a yard he said Got any chink I lost it said Dickie My farver s there awaitin for me Garn said the man you don t kid me so easy I ain t arstin you for anything except the way said Dickie More you ain t said the man hesitated and pulled his hand out of his pocket Ain t kiddin Sure Father at Gravesend Take your Bible Yuss said Dickie Then you take the first to the right and the first to the left and you ll get a blue bus as ll take you to the Elephant That s a bit of the way Then you arst again And ere this ll pay for the bus He held out coppers This practical kindness went to Dickie s heart more than all the kisses of the young ladies in the flower shop The tears came into his eyes Well you are a pal and no error he said Do the same for you some day he added The lounging man laughed I ll hold you to that matey he said when you re a ridin in yer carriage an pair p raps you ll take me on ter be yer footman When I am I will said Dickie quite seriously And then they both laughed The Elephant and Castle marks but a very short stage of the weary way between London and Gravesend When he got out of the tram Dickie asked the way again this time of a woman who was selling matches in the gutter She pointed with the blue box she held in her hand It s a long way she said in a tired voice nigh on thirty mile Thank you missis said Dickie and set out quite simply to walk those miles nearly thirty The way lay down the Old Kent Road and presently Dickie was in familiar surroundings For the Old Kent Road leads into the New Cross Road and that runs right through the yellow brick wilderness where Dickie s aunt lived He dared not follow the road through those well known scenes At any moment he might meet his aunt And if he met his aunt he preferred not to think of it Outside the Marquis of Granby stood a van and the horses heads were turned away from London If one could get a lift Dickie looked anxiously to right and left in front and behind There were wooden boxes in the van a lot of them and on the canvas of the tilt was painted in fat white letters FRY S TONIC THE ONLY CURE There would be room on the top of the boxes they did not reach within two feet of the tilt Should he ask for a lift when the carter came out of the Marquis Or should he if he could climb up and hide on the boxes and take his chance of discovery on the lift He laid a hand on the tail board Hi Dickie said a voice surprisingly in his ear that you Dickie owned that it was with the feeling of a trapped wild animal and turned and faced a boy of his own age a schoolfellow the one in fact who had christened him Dot and go one Oh what a turn you give me he said thought you was my aunt Don t you let on you seen me Where you been asked the boy curiously Oh all about Dickie answered vaguely Don t you tell me aunt Yer aunt Don t you know The boy was quite contemptuous with him for not knowing Know No Know what She shot the moon old Hurle moved her says he don t remember where to She give him a pint to forget s what I say Who s livin there now Dickie asked interest in his aunt s address swallowed up in a sudden desperate anxiety No one don t live there It s shut up to let apply Roberts seven hundred ninety six Broadway said the boy I say what ll you do I don t know said Dickie turning away from the van which had abruptly become unimportant Which way you goin Down home go past your old shop Coming No said Dickie So long see you again some day I got to go this way And he went it All the same the twilight saw him creeping down the old road to the house whose back yard had held the rabbit hutch the garden where he had sowed the parrot food and where the moonflowers had come up so white and beautiful What a long time ago It was only a month really but all the same what a long time The news of his aunt s departure had changed everything The steadfast desire to get to Gravesend to find his father had given way at any rate for the moment to a burning anxiety about Tinkler and the white stone Had his aunt found them and taken them away If she hadn t and they were still there would it not be wise to get them at once Because of course some one else might take the house and find the treasures Yes it would certainly be wise to go to night to get in by the front window the catch had always been broken to find his treasures or at any rate to make quite sure whether he had lost them or not No one noticed him as he came down the street very close to the railings There are so many boys in the streets in that part of the world And the front window went up easily He climbed in dragging his crutch after him He got up stairs very quickly on hands and knees went straight to the loose board dislodged it felt in the hollow below Oh joy His hands found the soft bundle of rags that he knew held Tinkler and the seal He put them inside the front of his shirt and shuffled down It was not too late to do a mile or two of the Gravesend road But the moonflower he would like to have one more look at that He got out into the garden there stood the stalk of the flower very tall in the deepening dusk He touched the stalk It was dry and hard three or four little dry things fell from above and rattled on his head Seeds o course said Dickie who knew more about seeds now than he had done when he saved the parrot seeds One does not tramp the country for a month at Dickie s age without learning something about seeds He got out the knife that should have cut the string of the basket in the train opened it and cut the stalk of the moonflower very carefully so that none of the seeds should be and only a few were lost He crept into the house holding the stalk upright and steady as an acolyte carries a processional cross Illustration HE MADE WITH TRIPLE LINES OF SILVERY SEEDS A SIX POINTED STAR Page eighty one The house was quite dark now but a street lamp threw its light into the front room bare empty and dusty There was a torn newspaper on the floor He spread a sheet of it out kneeled by it and shook the moonflower head over it The seeds came rattling out dozens and dozens of them They were bigger than sunflower seeds and flatter and rounder and they shone like silver or like the pods of the plant we call honesty Oh beautiful beautiful said Dickie letting the smooth shapes slide through his fingers Have you ever played with mother of pearl card counters The seeds of the moonflower were like those He pulled out Tinkler and the seal and laid them on the heap of seeds And then knew quite suddenly that he was too tired to travel any further that night I ll doss here he said there s plenty papers he knew by experience that as bed clothes newspapers are warm if noisy and get on in the morning afore people s up He collected all the paper and straw there was a good deal littered about in the house and made a heap in the corner out of the way of the window He did not feel afraid of sleeping in an empty house only very lordly and magnificent because he had a whole house to himself The food still left in his pockets served for supper and you could drink quite well at the wash house tap by putting your head under and turning it on very slowly And for a final enjoyment he laid out his treasures on the newspaper Tinkler and the seal in the middle and the pearly counters arranged in patterns round them circles and squares and oblongs The seeds lay very flat and fitted close together They were excellent for making patterns with And presently he made with triple lines of silvery seeds a six pointed star something like this Illustration \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ v with the rattle and the seal in the middle and the light from the street lamp shone brightly on it all That s the prettiest of the lot said Dickie Harding alone in the empty house And then the magic began CHAPTER IV WHICH WAS THE DREAM THE two crossed triangles of white seeds in the midst Tinkler and the white seal lay on the floor of the little empty house grew dim and faint before Dickie s eyes and his eyes suddenly smarted and felt tired so that he was very glad to shut them He had an absurd fancy that he could see through his closed eyelids something moving in the middle of the star that the two triangles made But he knew that this must be nonsense because of course you cannot see through your eyelids His eyelids felt so heavy that he could not take the trouble to lift them even when a voice spoke quite near him He had no doubt but that it was the policeman come to take him up for being in a house that was not his Let him said Dickie to himself He was too sleepy to be afraid But for a policeman who is usually of quite a large pattern the voice was unusually soft and small It said briskly Now then where do you want to go to I ain t particular said Dickie who supposed himself to be listening to an offer of a choice of police stations There were whispers two small and soft voices They made a sleepy music He s more yours than mine said one You re more his than I am said the other You re older than I am said the first You re stronger than I am said the second Let s spin for it said the first voice and there was a humming sound ending in a little tinkling fall That settles it said the second voice here And when Three s a good number Then everything was very quiet and sleep wrapped Dickie like a soft cloak When he awoke his eyelids no longer felt heavy so he opened them That was a rum dream he told himself as he blinked in broad daylight He lay in bed a big strange bed in a room that he had never seen before The windows were low and long with small panes and the light was broken by upright stone divisions The floor was of dark wood strewn strangely with flowers and green herbs and the bed was a four post bed like the one he had slept in at Talbot House and in the green curtains was woven a white pattern very like the thing that was engraved on Tinkler and on the white seal On the coverlet lavender and other herbs were laid And the wall was hung with pictures done in needlework tapestry in fact though Dickie did not know that this was its name All the furniture was heavily built of wood heavily carved An enormous dark cupboard or wardrobe loomed against one wall High backed chairs with tapestry seats were ranged in a row against another The third wall was almost all window and in the fourth wall the fireplace was set with a high hooded chimney and wide open hearth Near the bed stood a stool or table with cups and bottles on it and on the necks of the bottles parchment labels were tied that stuck out stiffly A stout woman in very full skirts sat in a large armchair at the foot of the bed She wore a queer white cap the like of which Dickie had never seen and round her neck was a ruff which reminded him of the cut paper frills in the ham and beef shops in the New Cross Road What a curious dream said Dickie The woman looked at him So thou saint found thy tongue she said folk must look to have curious dreams who fall sick of the fever But thou saint found thy tongue at last thine own tongue not the wandering tongue that has wagged so fast these last days But I thought I was in the front room at Dickie began Thou rt here said she the other is the dream Forget it And do not talk of it To talk of such dreams brings misfortune And tis time for thy posset She took a pipkin from the hearth where a small fire burned though it was summer weather as Dickie could see by the green tree tops that swayed and moved outside in the sun poured some gruel out of it into a silver basin It had wrought roses on it and Drink me and drink again in queer letters round the rim but this Dickie only noticed later She poured white wine into the gruel and having stirred it with a silver spoon fed Dickie as one feeds a baby blowing on each spoonful to cool it The gruel was very sweet and pleasant Dickie stretched in the downy bed felt extremely comfortable and fell asleep again Next time he awoke it was with many questions How d I come ere Ave I bin run over agen Is it a hospital Who are you Now don t you begin to wander again said the woman in the cap You re here at home in the best bed in your father s house at Deptford And you ve had the plague fever And you re better Or ought to be But if you don t know your own old nurse I never ad no nurse said Dickie old nor new So there You re a takin me for some other chap that s what it is Where did you get hold of me I never bin here before Don t wander I tell you repeated the nurse briskly You lie still and think and you ll see you ll remember me very well Forget your old nurse why you will tell me next that you ve forgotten your own name No I haven t said Dickie What is it then the nurse asked laughing a fat comfortable laugh Dickie s reply was naturally Dickie Harding Why said the nurse opening wide eyes at him under gray brows you have forgotten it They do say that the fever hurts the memory but this beats all Dost mean to tell me the fever has mazed thy poor brains till thou don t know that thy name s Richard And Dickie heard her name a name that did not sound to him at all like Harding Is that my name he asked It is indeed she answered Dickie felt an odd sensation of fixedness He had expected when he went to sleep that the dream would in sleep end and that he would wake to find himself alone in the empty house at New Cross But he had wakened to the same dream once more and now he began to wonder whether he really belonged here and whether this were the real life and the other the old sordid dirty New Cross life merely a horrid dream the consequence of his fever He lay and thought and looked at the rich pleasant room the kind clear face of the nurse the green green branches of the trees the tapestry and the rushes At last he spoke Nurse said he Ah I thought you d come to yourself she said What is it my dearie If I am really the name you said I ve forgotten it Tell me all about myself will you Nurse I thought as much she muttered and then began to tell him wonderful things She told him how his father was Sir Richard the King had made him a knight only last year and how this place where they now were was his father s country house It lies said the nurse among the pleasant fields and orchards of Deptford And how he Dickie had been very sick of the pestilential fever but was now thanks to the blessing and to the ministrations of good doctor Carey on the highroad to health And when you are strong enough said she and the house purged of the contagion your cousins from Sussex shall come and stay a while here with you and afterwards you shall go with them to their town house and see the sights of London And now she added looking out of the window I spy the good doctor a coming Make the best of thyself dear heart lest he bleed thee and drench thee yet again which I know in my heart thou rt too weak for it But what do these doctors know of babes Their medicines are for strong men The idea of bleeding was not pleasant to Dickie though he did not at all know what it meant He sat up in bed and was surprised to find that he was not nearly so tired as he thought The excitement of all these happenings had brought a pink flush to his face and when the doctor in a full black robe and black stockings and a pointed hat stood by his bedside and felt his pulse the doctor had to own that Dickie was almost well We have wrought a cure Goody he said thou and I we have wrought a cure Now kitchen physic it is that he needs good broth and gruel and panada and wine the Rhenish and the French and the juice of the orange and the lemon or failing those fresh apple juice squeezed from the fruit when you shall have brayed it in a mortar Ha my cure pleases thee Well smell to it then Tis many a day since thou hadst the heart to He reached the gold knob of his cane to Dickie s nose and Dickie was surprised to find that it smelled sweet and strong something like grocers shops and something like a chemist s There were little holes in the gold knob such as you see in the tops of pepper castors and the scent seemed to come through them What is it Dickie asked He has forgotten everything said the nurse quickly tis the good doctor s pomander with spices and perfumes in it to avert contagion As it warms in the hand the perfumes give forth said the doctor Now the fever is past there must be a fumigatory Make a good brew Goody make a good brew amber and nitre and wormwood vinegar and quinces and myrrh with wormwood camphor and the fresh flowers of the camomile And musk forget not musk a strong thing against contagion Let the vapor of it pass to and fro through the chamber burn the herbs from the floor and all sweepings on this hearth strew fresh herbs and flowers and set all clean and in order and give thanks that you are not setting all in order for a burying With which agreeable words the black gowned doctor nodded and smiled at the little patient and went out And now Dickie literally did not know where he was It was all so difficult Was he Dickie Harding who had lived at New Cross and sown the Artistic Parrot Seed and taken the open road with mister Beale Or was he that boy with the other name whose father was a knight and who lived in a house in Deptford with green trees outside the windows He could not remember any house in Deptford that had green trees in its garden And the nurse had said something about the pleasant fields and orchards Those at any rate were not in the Deptford he knew Perhaps there were two Deptfords He knew there were two Bromptons and two Richmonds one in Yorkshire There was something about the way things happened at this place that reminded him of that nice Lady Talbot who had wanted him to stay and be her little boy Perhaps this new boy whose place he seemed to have taken had a real mother of his own as nice as that nice lady The nurse had dropped all sorts of things into an iron pot with three legs and had set it to boil in the hot ashes Now it had boiled and two maids were carrying it to and fro in the room as the doctor had said Puffs of sweet strong spicy steam rose out of it as they jerked it this way and that Nurse Dickie called and she came quickly Nurse have I got a mother She hugged him Indeed thou hast she said but she lies sick at your father s other house And you have a baby brother Richard Then said Dickie I think I will stay here and try to remember who I am I mean who you say I am and not try to dream any more about New Cross and mister Beale If this is a dream it s a better dream than the other I want to stay here Nurse Let me stay here and see my mother and my little brother And shalt my lamb and shalt the nurse said And after that there was more food and more sleep and nights and days and talks and silences and very gradually yet very quickly Dickie learned about this new boy who was and wasn t himself He told the nurse quite plainly that he remembered nothing about himself and after he had told her she would sit by his side by the hour and tell him of things that had happened in the short life of the boy whose place he filled the boy whose name was not Dickie Harding And as soon as she had told him a thing he found he remembered it not as one remembers a tale that is told but as one remembers a real thing that has happened And days went on and he became surer and surer that he was really this other Richard and that he had only dreamed all that old life in New Cross with his aunt and in the pleasant country roads with mister Beale And he wondered how he could ever have dreamed such things Quite soon came the day when the nurse dressed him in clothes strange but strangely comfortable and fine and carried him to the window from which as he sat in a big oak chair he could see the green fields that sloped down to the river and the rigging and the masts of the ships that went up and down The rigging looked familiar but the shape of the ships was quite different They were shorter and broader than the ships that Dickie Harding had been used to see and they most of them rose up much higher out of the water I should like to go and look at them closer he told the nurse Once thou rt healed she said thou lieutenant be forever running down to the dockyard Thy old way I know thee hearing the master mariners tales and setting thy purpose for a galleon of thine own and the golden South Americas What s a galleon said Dickie And was told The nurse was very patient with his forgettings He was very happy There seemed somehow to be more room in this new life than in the old one and more time No one was in a hurry and there was not another house within a quarter of a mile All green fields Also he was a person of consequence The servants called him Master Richard and he felt as he heard them that being called Master Richard meant not only that the servants respected him as their master s son but that he was somebody from whom great things were expected That he had duties of kindness and protection to the servants that he was expected to grow up brave and noble and generous and unselfish to care for those who called him master He felt now very fully what he had felt vaguely and dimly at Talbot Court that he was not the sort of person who ought to do anything mean and dishonorable such as being a burglar and climbing in at pantry windows that when he grew up he would be expected to look after his servants and laborers and all the men and women whom he would have under him that their happiness and well being would be his charge And the thought swelled his heart and it seemed that he was born to a great destiny He little lame Dickie Harding of Deptford he would hold these people s lives in his hand Well he knew what poor people wanted he had been poor or he had dreamed that he was poor it was all the same Dreams and real life were so very much alike So Dickie changed every hour of every day and every moment of every hour from the little boy who lived at New Cross among the yellow houses and the ugliness who tramped the white roads and slept at the Inn of the Silver Moon to Richard of the other name who lived well and slept softly and knew himself called to a destiny of power and helpful kindness For his nurse had told him that his father was a rich man and that father s riches would be his one day to deal with for the good of the men under him for their happiness and the glory of God It was a great and beautiful thought and Dickie loved it He loved indeed everything in this new life the shapes and colors of furniture and hangings the kind old nurse the friendly laughing maids the old doctor with his long speeches and short smiles his bed his room the ships the river the trees the gardens the very sky seemed cleaner and brighter than the sky that had been over the Deptford that Dickie Harding had known And then came the day when the nurse having dressed him bade him walk to the window instead of being carried as so far he had been Where he asked hesitatingly where s my Where have you put the crutch Then the old nurse laughed Crutch she said Come out of thy dreams Thou silly boy Thou wants no crutch with two fine straight strong legs like thou s got Come use them and walk Dickie looked down at his feet In the old New Cross days he had not liked to look at his feet He had not looked at them in these new days Now he looked Hesitated Come said the nurse encouragingly He slid from the high bed One might as well try Nurse seemed to think He touched the ground with both feet felt the floor firm and even under them as firm and even under the one foot as under the other He stood up straight moved the foot that he had been used to move then the other the one that he had never moved He took two steps three four and then he turned suddenly and flung himself against the side of the bed and hid his face in his arms What weeping my lamb the nurse said and came to him Oh Nurse he cried clinging to her with all his might I dreamed that I was lame And I thought it was true And it isn t it isn t it isn t Quite soon Dickie was able to walk down stairs and out into the garden along the grassy walks and long alleys where fruit trees trained over trellises made such pleasant green shade and even to try to learn to play at bowls on the long bowling green behind the house The house was by far the finest house Dickie had ever been in and the garden was more beautiful even than the garden at Talbot Court But it was not only the beauty of the house and garden that made Dickie s life a new and full delight To limp along the leafy ways to crawl up and down the carved staircase would have been a pleasure greater than any Dickie had ever known but he could leap up and down the stairs three at a time he could run in the arched alleys run and jump as he had seen other children do and as he had never thought to do himself Imagine what you would feel if you had lived wingless all your life among people who could fly That is how lame people feel among us who can walk and run And now Dickie was lame no more His feet seemed not only to be strong and active but clever on their own account They carried him quite without mistake to the blacksmith s at the village on the hill to the centre of the maze of clipped hedges that was the centre of the garden and best of all they carried him to the dockyard Girls like dolls and tea parties and picture books but boys like to see things made and done else how is it that any boy worth his salt will leave the newest and brightest toys to follow a carpenter or a plumber round the house fiddle with his tools ask him a thousand questions and watch him ply his trade Dickie at New Cross had spent many an hour watching those interesting men who open square trap doors in the pavement and drag out from them yards and yards of wire I do not know why the men do this but every London boy who reads this will know And when he got to the dockyard his obliging feet carried him to a man in a great leather apron busy with great beams of wood and tools that Dickie had never seen And the man greeted him as an old friend kissed him on both cheeks which he didn t expect and felt much too old for and spread a sack for him that he might sit in the sun on a big baulk of timber Thou rt a sight for sore eyes Master Richard he said it s many a long day since thou was here to pester me with thy questions And all s strong again no bones broken And now I ll teach thee to make a galleon like as I promised Will you indeed said Dickie trembling with joy and pride That will I said the man and threw up his pointed beard in a jolly laugh And see what I ve made thee while thou saint been lazying in bed a real English ship of war He laid down the auger he held and went into a low rough shed and next moment came out with a little ship in his hand a perfect model of the strange high built ships Dickie could see on the river Illustration TIS THE PICTURE SAID HE PROUDLY OF MY OLD SHIP THE GOLDEN VENTURE Page ninety seven Tis the picture said he proudly of my old ship The Golden Venture that I sailed in with Master Raleigh and help to sink the accursed Armada and clip the King of Spain his wings and singe his beard The Armada said Dickie with a new and quite strange feeling rather like going down unexpectedly in a lift The Spanish Armada What other asked the ship builder Thou saint heard the story a thousand times I want to hear it again Dickie said And heard the story of England s great danger and her great escapes It was just the same story as the one you read in your history book and yet how different when it was told by a man who had been there who had felt the danger known the escape Dickie held his breath And so the story ended the breath of the Lord went forth and the storm blew and fell on the fleet of Spain and scattered them and they went down in our very waters they and their arms and their treasure their guns and their gunners their mariners and their men of war And the remnant was scattered and driven northward and some were wrecked on the rocks and some our ships met and dealt with and some poor few made shift to get back across the sea trailing home like wounded mallards to tell the King their master what the Lord had done for England How long ago was it all this Dickie asked If his memory served it was hundreds of years ago three five he could not remember how many but hundreds Could this man whose hair was only just touched with gray be hundreds of years old How long a matter of twenty years or thereabouts said the ship builder See the pretty little ship and thy very own for I made it for thee It was indeed a pretty little ship being a perfect model of an Elizabethan ship built up high at bow and stern for as Sebastian explained majesty and terror of the enemy and with deck and orlop waist and poop hold and masts all complete with forecastle and cabin masts and spars port holes and guns sails anchor and carved figure head The woodwork was painted in white and green and red and at bow and stern was richly carved and gilded For me Dickie said really for me And you made it yourself Truth to tell I began it long since in the long winter evenings said his friend and now tis done and tis thine See I shall put an apron on thee and thou shalt be my prentice and learn to build another quaint ship like her to be her consort and we will sail them together in the pond in thy father s garden Dickie still devouring the little Golden Venture with his eyes submitted to the leather apron and felt in his hand the smooth handle of the tool Sebastian put there But he said I don t understand You remember the Armada twenty years ago I thought it was hundreds and hundreds Twenty years ago or nearer eighteen said Sebastian thou lieutenant have to learn to reckon better than that if thou saint to be my prentice Twas in the year of grace fifteen eighty eight and we are now in the year sixteen oh six This makes it eighteen years to my reckoning It was nineteen oh six in my dream said Dickie I mean in my fever In fever Sebastian said folk travel far Now hold the wood so and the knife thus Then every day Dickie went down to the dockyard when lessons were done For there were lessons now with a sour faced tutor in a black gown whom Dickie disliked extremely The tutor did not seem to like Dickie either The child hath forgot in his fever all that ever he learned of me he complained to the old nurse who nodded wisely and said he would soon learn all afresh And he did very quickly learn a great deal and always it was more like remembering than learning And a second tutor very smart in red velvet and gold with breeches like balloons and a short cloak and a ruff who was an extremely jolly fellow came in the mornings to teach him to fence to dance and to run and to leap and to play bowls and promised in due time to teach him wrestling catching archery pall mall rackets riding tennis and all sports and games proper for a youth of gentle blood And weeks went by and still his father and mother had not come and he had learned a little Greek and more Latin could carve a box with the arms of his house on the lid and make that lid fit could bow like a courtier and speak like a gentleman and play a simple air on the viol that hung in the parlor for guests to amuse themselves with while they waited to see the master or mistress And then came the day when old nurse dressed him in his best a suit of cut velvet purple slashed with gold color and a belt with a little sword to it and a flat cap and Master Henry the games master took him in a little boat to a gilded galley full of gentlemen and ladies all finely dressed who kissed him and made much of him and said how he was grown since the fever And one gentleman very fine indeed appeared to be his uncle and a most charming lady in blue and silver seemed to be his aunt and a very jolly little boy and girl who sat by him and talked merrily all the while were his little cousins Cups of wine and silver dishes of fruit and cakes were handed round the galley was decked with fresh flowers and from another boat quite near came the sound of music The sun shone overhead and the clear river sparkled and more and more boats all gilded and flower wreathed appeared on the water Then there was a sound of shouting the river suddenly grew alive with the glitter of drawn swords the butterfly glitter of ladies waved scarves and handkerchiefs and a great gilded barge came slowly down stream followed by a procession of smaller craft Every one in the galley stood up the gentlemen saluted with their drawn swords the ladies fluttered their scarves Illustration THE GALLEY WAS DECKED WITH FRESH FLOWERS Page one hundred two His Majesty and the Queen the little cousins whispered as the State Barge went by Then all the galleys fell into place behind the King s barge and the long beautiful procession went slowly on down the river Dickie was very happy The little cousins were so friendly and jolly the grown up people so kind everything so beautiful and so clean It was a perfect day The river was very beautiful it ran between banks of willows and alders where loosestrife and meadowsweet and willow herb and yarrow grew tall and thick There were water lilies in shady back waters and beautiful gardens sloping down to the water At last the boats came to a pretty little town among trees This is where we disembark said the little girl cousin The King lies here to night at Sir Thomas Bradbury s And we lie at our grandfather s house And to morrow it is the Masque in Sir Thomas s Park And we are to see it I am glad thou saint well of thy fever Richard I shouldn t have liked it half so well if thou hadn t been here she said smiling And of course that was a very nice thing to have said to one And then we go home to Deptford with thee said the boy cousin We are to stay a month And we ll see thy galleon and get old Sebastian to make me one too Yes said Dickie as the boat came against the quay What is this place Gravesend thou knowest that said the little cousins or hadst thou forgotten that too in thy fever Gravesend Dickie repeated in quite a changed voice Come children said the aunt oh what a different aunt to the one who had slapped Dickie in Deptford sold the rabbit hutch and shot the moon you boys remember how I showed you to carry my train And my girl will not forget how to fling the flowers from the gilt basket as the King and Queen come down the steps The grandfather s house and garden the stately white haired grandfather whom they called My Lord and who was it seemed the aunt s father the banquet the picture gallery the gardens lit up by little colored oil lamps hung in festoons from tree to tree the blazing torches the music the Masque a sort of play without words in which every one wore the most wonderful and beautiful dresses and the Queen herself took a part dressed all in gauze and jewels and white swan s feathers all these things were like a dream to Dickie and through it all the words kept on saying themselves to him very gently very quietly and quite without stopping Gravesend That s where the lodging house is where Beale is waiting for you the man you called father You promised to go there as soon as you could Why haven t you gone Gravesend That s where the lodging house is where Beale And so on over and over again And how can any one enjoy anything when this sort of thing keeps on saying itself under and over and through and between everything he sees and hears and feels and thinks And the worst of it was that now for the first time since he had found that he was not lame he felt more than felt he knew that the old New Cross life had not been a fever dream and that Beale who had been kind to him and taken him through the pleasant country and slept with him in the bed with the green curtains was really waiting for him at Gravesend And this is all a dream said Dickie and I must wake up But he couldn t wake up And the trees and grass and lights and beautiful things the kindly great people with their splendid dresses the King and Queen the aunts and uncles and the little cousins all these things refused to fade away and jumble themselves up as things do in dreams They remained solid and real He knew that this must be a dream and that Beale and Gravesend and New Cross and the old lame life were the real thing and yet he could not wake up All the same the light had gone out of everything and it is small wonder that when he got home at last very tired indeed to his father s house at Deptford he burst into tears as nurse was undressing him What ails my lamb she asked I can t explain you wouldn t understand said Dickie Try said she very earnestly He looked round the room at the tapestries and the heavy furniture I can t he said Try she said again It s don t laugh Nurse There s a dream that feels real about a dreadful place oh so different from this But there s a man waiting there for me that was good to me when I was when I wasn t that was good to me he s waiting in the dream and I want to get back to him And I can t Thou rt better here than in that dreadful place said the nurse stroking his hair Yes but Beale I know he s waiting there I wish I could bring him here Not yet said the nurse surprisingly tis not easy to bring those we love from one dream to another One dream to another Didst never hear that all life is a dream she asked him But thou shalt go Heaven forbid that one of thy race should fail a friend Look there are fresh sheets on thy bed Lie still and think of him that was good to thee He lay there very still He had decided to wake up to wake up to the old hard cruel life to poverty dulness lameness There was no other thing to be done He must wake up and keep his promise to Beale But it was hard hard hard The beautiful house the beautiful garden the games the boat building the soft clothes the kind people the uplifting sense that he was Somebody yet he must go Yes if he could he would The nurse had taken burning wood from the hearth and set it on a silver plate Now she strewed something on the glowing embers Lie straight and still she said and wish thyself where thou wast when thou leftest that dream He did so A thick sweet smoke rose from the little fire in the silver plate and the nurse was chanting something in a very low voice Men die Man dies not Times fly Time flies not That was all he heard though he heard confusedly that there was more He seemed to sink deep into a soft sea of sleep to be rocked on its tide and then to be flung by its waves roughly suddenly on some hard shore of awakening He opened his eyes He was in the little bare front room in New Cross Tinkler and the white seal lay on the floor among white moonflower seeds confusedly scattered and the gas lamp from the street shone through the dirty panes on the newspapers and sacking What a dream said Dickie shivering and very sleepy Oh what a dream He put Tinkler and the seal in one pocket gathered up the moon seeds and put them in the other drew the old newspapers over him and went to sleep The morning sun woke him How odd said he to dream all that weeks and weeks in just a little bit of one little night If it had only been true He jumped up eager to start for Gravesend Since he had wakened out of that wonderful dream on purpose to go to Gravesend he might as well start at once But his jump ended in a sickening sideways fall and his head knocked against the wainscot I had forgotten he said slowly I shouldn t have thought any dream could have made me forget about my foot For he had indeed forgotten it had leaped up eagerly confidently as a sound child leaps and the lame foot had betrayed him thrown him down He crawled across to where the crutch lay the old broom cut down that Lady Talbot had covered with black velvet for him And now he said I must get to Gravesend He looked out of the window at the dismal sordid street I wonder he said if Deptford was ever really like it was in my dream the gardens and the clean river and the fields He got out of the house when no one was looking and went off down the street Clickety clack went the crutch on the dusty pavement His back ached his lame foot hurt his good leg was tired and stiff and his heart too was very tired About this time in the dream he had chosen to awaken from for the sake of Beale a bowl of porridge would be smoking at the end of a long oak table and a great carved chair be set for a little boy who was not there Dickie strode on manfully but the pain in his back made him feel sick I don t know as I can do it he said Then he saw the three gold balls above the door of the friendly pawnbroker He looked hesitated shrugged his shoulders and went in Hullo said the pawnbroker here we are again Want to pawn the rattle eh No said Dickie but what ll you give me on the seal you gave me The pawnbroker stared frowned and burst out laughing If you don t beat all he said I give you a present and you come to pledge it with me You should have been one of our people So you want to pledge the seal Well well I d much rather not said Dickie seriously because I love it very much But I must have my fare to Gravesend My father s there waiting for me And I don t want to leave Tinkler behind He showed the rattle What s the fare to Gravesend Don t know I thought you d know Will you give me the fare for the seal The pawnbroker hesitated and looked hard at him No he said no The seal s not worth it Not but what it s a very good seal he added very good indeed See here said Dickie suddenly I know what honor is now and the word of a gentleman You will not let me pledge the seal with you Then let me pledge my word my word of honor Lend me the money to take me to Gravesend and by the honor of a gentleman I will repay you within a month The voice was firm the accent though strange was not the accent of Deptford street boys It was the accent of the boy who had had two tutors and a big garden a place in the King s water party and a knowledge of what it means to belong to a noble house The pawnbroker looked at him With the unerring instinct of his race he knew that this was not play acting that there was something behind it something real The sense of romance of great things all about them transcending the ordinary things of life this in the Jews has survived centuries of torment shame cruelty and oppression This inherited sense of romance in the pawnbroker now leaped to answer Dickie s appeal And I do hope I am not confusing you stick to it read it again if you don t understand What I mean is that the Jews always see the big beautiful things they don t just see that gray is made of black and white they see how incredibly black black can be and that there may be a whiteness transcending all the whitest dreams in the world You re a rum little chap was what the pawnbroker said but I like your pluck Every man s got to make a fool of himself one time or the other he added apologizing to the spirit of business You mean you will said Dickie eagerly More fool me said the Jew feeling in his pocket You won t be sorry not in the end you won t said Dickie as the pawnbroker laid certain monies before him on the mahogany counter You ll lend me this You ll trust me Looks like it said the Jew Then some day I shall do something for you I don t know what but something We never forget we He stopped He remembered that he was poor little lame Dickie Harding with no right to that other name which had been his in the dream He picked up the coins put them in his pocket felt the moon seeds I cannot repay your kindness he said though some day I will repay your silver But these seeds the moon seeds he pulled out a handful You liked the flowers He handed a generous score across the red brown polished wood Thank you my lad said the pawnbroker I ll raise them in gentle heat I think they grow best by moonlight said Dickie So he came to Gravesend and the common lodging house and a weary sad and very anxious man rose up from his place by the fire when the clickety clack of the crutch sounded on the threshold It s the nipper he said and came very quickly to the door and got his arm round Dickie s shoulders The little nipper so it ain t I thought you d got pinched No I didn t I knew your clever ways I knew you was bound to turn up Yes said Dickie looking round the tramps kitchen and remembering the long clean tapestry hung dining hall of his dream Yes I was bound to turn up You wanted me to didn t you he added Wanted you to Beale answered holding him close and looking at him as men look at some rare treasure gained with much cost and after long seeking Wanted you Not arf I don t think and drew him in and shut the door Then I m glad I came said Dickie But in his heart he was not glad In his heart he longed for that pleasant house where he was the young master and was not lame any more But in his soul he was glad because the soul is greater than the heart and knows greater things And now Dickie loved Beale more than ever because for him he had sacrificed his dream So he had gained something Because loving people is the best thing in the world better even than being loved Just think this out will you and see if I am not right There were herrings for tea And in the hard bed with his clothes and his boots under the pillows Dickie slept soundly But he did not dream Yet when he woke in the morning remembering many things he said to himself Is this the dream Or was the other the dream And it seemed a foolish question with the feel of the coarse sheets and the smell of the close room and mister Beale s voice saying Rouse up nipper there s sossingers for breakfast CHAPTER V TO GET YOUR OWN LIVING NO said mister Beale we ain t a goin to crack no more cribs It s low that s what it is I quite grant you it s low So I s pose we ll ave to take the road again Dickie and he were sitting in the sunshine on a sloping field They had been sitting there all the morning and Dickie had told mister Beale all his earthly adventures from the moment the redheaded man had lifted him up to the window of Talbot Court to the time when he had come in by the open door of the common lodging house What a nipper it is though said mister Beale regretfully For the burgling I mean sharp clever no one to touch him But I don t cotton to it myself he added quickly not the burgling I don t You re always liable to get yourself into trouble over it one way or the other that s the worst of it I don t know how it is he ended pensively but somehow it always leads to trouble Dickie picked up seven straws from among the stubble and idly plaited them together the nurse had taught him this in the dream when he was still weak from the fever That s very flash that what you re doing said Beale who learned you that I learned it in a dream said Dickie slowly I dreamed I ad a fever and I ll tell you if you like it s a good yarn good as Here Ward very near Beale lay back on the dry stubble his pipe between his teeth Fire away he said and Dickie fired away When the long tale ended the sun was beginning to go down towards its bed in the west There was a pause You d make a tidy bit on the alls said Beale quite awestruck The things you think of When did you make all that up I dreamed it I tell you said Dickie You always could stick it on said mister Beale admiringly I ain t goin to stick it on never no more said Dickie They called it lying and cheating where I was in my dream I mean Once let a nipper out of yer sight said mister Beale sadly and see what comes of it No two a goin to stick it on no more Then how s us to get a honest living Answer me that young chap I don t know said Dickie but we got to do it som ow It ain t to be done not with all the unemployed there is about said mister Beale Besides you ve got a regular gift for sticking it on a talent I call it And now you want to throw it away But you can t We got to live In the dream said Dickie there didn t seem to be no unemployed Every one was prenticed to a trade I wish it was like that here Well it ain t said mister Beale shortly I wasn t never prenticed to no trade no more n what you ll be Worse luck said Dickie But I started learning a lot of things games mostly in the dream I did and I started making a boat a galleon they called it All the names is different there And I carved a little box a fair treat it was with my father s arms on it Yer father s what Coat of arms Gentlemen there all has different things patterns like they calls em coats of arms and they put it on their silver and on their carriages and their furniture Put what Beale asked again The blazon All gentlepeople have it Don t you come the blazing toff over me said Beale with sudden fierceness cause I won t ave it See It s them bloomin Talbots put all this rot into your head The Talbots said Dickie Oh the Talbots ain t been gentry more than a couple of hundred years Our family s as old as King Alfred Stow it I say said Beale more fiercely still I see what you re after you want us to part company that s what you want Well go Go back to yer old Talbots and be the nice lady s little boy with velvet kicksies and a clean anky once a week That s what you do Dickie looked forlornly out over the river I can t elp what I dreams can I he said In the dream I d got lots of things Uncles and aunts an a little brother I never seen him though An a farver and muvver an all It s different ere I ain t got nobody but you ere farver Well then said Beale more gently what do you go settin of yourself up agin me for I ain t said Dickie I thought you liked me to tell you everythink Silence Dickie could not help noticing the dirty shirt the dirty face the three days beard the filthy clothes of his friend and he thought of his other friend Sebastian of the Docks He saw the pale blue reproachful eyes of Beale looking out of that dirty face and he spoke aloud quite without meaning to All that don t make no difference he said Eh said Beale with miserable angry eyes Look ere said Dickie desperately I m a goin to show you This ere s my Tinkler what I told you about what pawns for a bob I wouldn t show it to no one but you swelp me I wouldn t He held the rattle out Beale took it It s a fancy bit I will say he owned Look ere said Dickie what I mean to say He stopped What was the use of telling Beale that he had come back out of the dream just for his sake Beale who did not believe in the dream did not understand it hated it Don t you go turning agin me he said whether I dream or not you and me ll stand together I m not goin to do things wot s wrong low dirty tricks so I ain t But I knows we can get on without that What would you like to do for your living if you could choose I warn t never put to no trade said Beale cept being andy with a orse I was a wagoner s mate when I was a boy I likes a orse Or a dawg he added I ain t no good wiv me ands not at working you know not to say working Dickie suppressed a wild notion he had had of getting into that dream again learning some useful trade there waking up and teaching it to mister Beale Ain t there nothing else you d like to do he asked I don t know as there is said mister Beale drearily without it was pigeons Then Dickie wondered whether things that you learned in dreams would stay learned Things you learned to do with your hands The Greek and the Latin stayed learned right enough and sang in his brain encouragingly Don t you get shirty if I talks about that dream he said You dunno what a dream it was I wasn t kidding you I did dream it honor bright I dreamed I could carve wood make boxes and things I wish I ad a bit of fine grained wood I d like to try I ve got the knife they give me to cut the string of the basket in the train It s jolly sharp What sort o wood Beale asked It was mahogany I dreamed I made my box with said Dickie I would like to try Off is poor chump Beale murmured with bitter self reproach my doin too puttin im on to a job like Talbot Court the nipper is He stretched himself and got up I ll get yer a bit of mahogany from somewheres he said very gently I didn t mean nothing old chap You keep all on about yer dreams I don t mind I likes it Let s get a brace o kippers and make a night of it So they went back to the Gravesend lodging house Next day mister Beale produced the lonely leg of a sofa mahogany a fat round turned leg old and seasoned This what you want he asked Dickie took it eagerly I do wonder if I can he said I feel just exactly like as if I could I say farver let s get out in the woods somewheres quiet and take our grub along Somewheres where nobody can t say What you up to and make a mock of me They found a place such as Dickie desired a warm sunny nest in the heart of a green wood and all through the long warm hours of the autumn day mister Beale lay lazy in the sunshine while Dickie very pale and determined sliced chipped and picked at the sofa leg with the knife the gardener had given him It was hard to make him lay the work down even for dinner which was of a delicious and extravagant kind new bread German sausage and beer in a flat bottle For from the moment when the knife touched the wood Dickie knew that he had not forgotten and that what he had done in the Deptford dockyard under the eyes of Sebastian the shipwright who had helped to sink the Armada he could do now alone in the woods beyond Gravesend It was after dinner that mister Beale began to be interested Swelp me he said but you ve got the hang of it somehow A box ain t it A box said Dickie smoothing a rough corner a box with a lid that fits And I ll carve our arms on the top see I ve left that bit stickin up a purpose It was the hardest day s work Dickie had ever done He stuck to it and stuck to it and stuck to it till there was hardly light left to see it by But before the light was wholly gone the box had wholly come with the carved coat of arms and the lid that fitted Well said mister Beale striking a match to look at it if that ain t a fair treat There s many a swell bloke ud give arf a dollar for that to put is baccy in You ve got a trade my son that s sure Why didn t you let on before as you could Blow the beastly match It s burned me finger The match went out and Beale and Dickie went back to supper in the crowded gas lit room When supper was over it was tripe and onions and fried potatoes very luxurious Beale got up and stood before the fire I m a goin to ave a hauction I am he said to the company at large Here s a thing and a very pretty thing a baccy box or a snuff box or a box to shut yer gold money in or yer diamonds What offers And it round said a black browed woman with a basket covered in American cloth no blacker than her eyes That I will said Beale readily I ll and it round in me and And I ll do the andin meself He took it round from one to another showed the neat corners the neat carving the neat fit of the square lid Where d yer nick that asked a man with a red handkerchief The nipper made it Pinched it more likely some one said I see im make it said Beale frowning a little Let me ave a squint said a dingy gray old man sitting apart For some reason of his own Beale let the old man take the box into his hand But he kept very close to him and he kept his eyes on the box All outer one piece said the old man I dunno oo made it an I don t care but that was made by a workman as know d his trade I was a cabinet maker once though you wouldn t think it to look at me There ain t nobody here to pay what that little hobjec s worth Hoil it up with a drop of cold linseed and leave it all night and then in the morning you rub it on yer trouser leg to shine it and then rub it in the mud to dirty it and then hoil it again and dirty it again and you ll get arf a thick un for it as a genuwine hold antique That s wot you do Thankee daddy said Beale an so I will He slipped the box in his pocket When Dickie next saw the box it looked as old as any box need look Now we ll look out for a shop where they sells these ere hold antics said Beale They were on the road and their faces were set towards London Dickie s face looked pinched and white Beale noticed it You don t look up to much he said warn t your bed to your liking The bed was all right said Dickie thinking of the bed in the dream I diden sleep much though Any more dreams Beale asked kindly enough No said Dickie I think p raps it was me wanting so to dream it again kep me awake I dessey said Beale picking up a straw to chew Dickie limped along in the dust the world seemed very big and hard It was a long way to London and he had not been able to dream that dream again Perhaps he would never be able to dream it He stumbled on a big stone and would have fallen but that Beale caught him by the arm and as he swung round by that arm Beale saw that the boy s eyes were thick with tears Ain t urt yerself ave yer he said for in all their wanderings these were the first tears Dickie had shed No said Dickie and hid his face against Beale s coat sleeve It s only What is it then said Beale in the accents of long disused tenderness tell your old farver then It s silly sobbed Dickie Never you mind whether it s silly or not said Beale You out with it In that dream said Dickie I wasn t lame Think of that now said Beale admiringly You best dream that every night Then you won t mind so much of a daytime But I mind more said Dickie sniffing hard much much more Beale without more words made room for him in the crowded perambulator and they went on Dickie s sniffs subsided Silence Presently I say farver I m sorry I acted so silly You never see me blub afore and you won t again he said and Beale said awkwardly That s all right mate You pretty flush the boy asked later on Not so dusty said the man Cause I wanter give that there little box to a chap I know wot lent me the money for the train to come to you at Gravesend Pay im some other day when we re flusher I d rather pay im now said Dickie I could make another box There s a bit of the sofer leg left ain t there There was and Dickie worked away at it in the odd moments that cluster round meal times the half hours before bed and before the morning start mister Beale begged of all likely foot passengers but he noted that the nipper no longer stuck it on For the most part he was quite silent Only when Beale appealed to him he would say Farver s very good to me I don t know what I should do without farver And so at last they came to New Cross again and mister Beale stepped in for half a pint at the Railway Hotel while Dickie went clickety clack along the pavement to his friend the pawnbroker Here we are again said that tradesman come to pawn the rattle Dickie laughed Pawning the rattle seemed suddenly to have become a very old and good joke between them Look ere mister he said that chink wot you lent me to get to Gravesend with He paused and added in his other voice It was very good of you sir I m not going to lend you any more if that s what you re after said the Jew who had already reproached himself for his confiding generosity It s not that I m after said Dickie with dignity I wish to repay you Got the money said the Jew laughing not unkindly No said Dickie but I ve got this He handed the little box across the counter Where d you get it I made it The pawnbroker laughed again Well well I ll ask no questions and you ll tell me no lies eh I shall certainly tell you no lies said Dickie with the dignity of the dream boy who was not a cripple and was heir to a great and gentle name will you take it instead of the money The pawnbroker turned the box over in his hands while kindness and honesty struggled fiercely within him against the habits of a business life Dickie eyed the china vases and concertinas and teaspoons tied together in fan shape and waited silently It s worth more than what I lent you the man said at last with an effort and it isn t every one who would own that mind you I know it isn t said Dickie will you please take it to pay my debt to you and if it is worth more accept it as a grateful gift from one who is still gratefully your debtor You d make your fortune on the halls said the man as Beale had said the way you talk beats everything All serene I ll take the box in full discharge of your debt But you might as well tell me where you got it I made it said Dickie and put his lips together very tightly You did did you Then I ll tell you what I ll give you four bob for every one of them you make and bring to me You might do different coats of arms see I was only taught to do one said Dickie Just then a customer came in a woman with her Sunday dress and a pair of sheets to pawn because her man was out of work and the children were hungry Run along now said the Jew I ve nothing more for you to day Dickie flushed and went Three days later the crutch clattered in at the pawnbroker s door and Dickie laid two more little boxes on the counter Here you are he said The pawnbroker looked and exclaimed and questioned and wondered and Dickie went away with eight silver shillings in his pocket the first coins he had ever carried in his life They seemed to have been coined in some fairy mint they were so different from any other money he had ever handled mister Beale waiting for him by New Cross Station put his empty pipe in his pocket and strolled down to meet him Dickie drew him down a side street and held out the silver Two days work he said We ain t no call to take the road cept for a pleasure trip I got a trade I ave Ow much a week s four bob a day Twenty four bob I make it Lor said mister Beale with his mouth open Now I tell you what you get old of some more old sofy legs and a stone and a strap to sharpen my knife with And there we are Twenty four shillings a week for a chap an is nipper ain t so dusty farver is it I ve thought it all up and settled it all out So long as the weather holds we ll sleep in the bed with the green curtains and I ll ave a green wood for my workshop and when the nights get cold we ll rent a room of our very own and live like toffs won t us The child s eyes were shining with excitement Pon my sam I believe you like work said mister Beale in tones of intense astonishment I like it better n cadgin said Dickie They did as Dickie had said and for two days mister Beale was content to eat and doze and wake and watch Dickie s busy fingers and eat and doze again But on the third day he announced that he was getting the fidgets in his legs I must do a prowl he said I ll be back afore sundown Don t you forget to eat your dinner when the sun comes level the top of that high tree So long matey mister Beale slouched off in the sunshine in his filthy old clothes and Dickie was left to work alone in the green and golden wood It was very still Dickie hardly moved at all and the chips that fell from his work fell more softly than the twigs and acorns that dropped now and then from some high bough A goldfinch swung on a swaying hazel branch and looked at him with bright eyes unafraid a grass snake slid swiftly by it was out on particular business of its own so it was not afraid of Dickie nor he of it A wood pigeon swept rustling wings across the glade where he sat and once a squirrel ran right along a bough to look down at him and chatter thickening its tail as a cat does hers when she is angry It was a long and very beautiful day the first that Dickie had ever spent alone He worked harder than ever and when by the lessening light it was impossible to work any longer he lay back against a tree root to rest his tired back and to gloat over the thought that he had made two boxes in one day eight shillings in one single day eight splendid shillings The sun was quite down before mister Beale returned He looked unnaturally fat and as he sat down on the moss something inside the front of his jacket moved and whined Oh what is it Dickie asked sitting up alert in a moment not a dawg Oh farver you don t know how I ve always wanted a dawg Well you ve a got yer want now three times over you ave said Beale and unbuttoning his jacket took out a double handful of soft fluffy sprawling arms and legs and heads and tails three little fat white puppies Oh the jolly little beasts said Dickie ain t they fine Where did you get them They was give me said mister Beale re knotting his handkerchief by a lady in the country He fixed his eyes on the soft blue of the darkening sky Try another said Dickie calmly Ah it ain t no use trying to deceive the nipper that sharp he is said Beale with a mixture of pride and confusion Well then not to deceive you mate I bought em What with said Dickie lightning quick With with money mate with money of course How d you get it No answer You didn t pinch it No on my sacred sam I didn t said Beale eagerly pinching leads to trouble I ve ad my lesson You cadged it then said Dickie Well said Beale sheepishly what if I did You ve spoiled everything said Dickie furious and he flung the two newly finished boxes violently to the ground and sat frowning with eyes downcast Beale on all fours retrieved the boxes Two he said in awestruck tones there never was such a nipper It doesn t matter said Dickie in a heartbroken voice you ve spoiled everything and you lie to me too It s all spoiled I wish I d never come back outer the dream so I do Now lookee here said Beale sternly don t you come this over us cause I won t stand it d y ear Am I the master or is it you D ye think I m going to put up with being bullied and druv by a little nipper like as I could lay out with one and as easy as what I could one of them pups He moved his foot among the soft strong little things that were uttering baby growls and biting at his broken boot with their little white teeth Do said Dickie bitterly lay me out if you want to I don t care Now now matey Beale s tone changed suddenly to affectionate remonstrance I was only kiddin Don t take it like that You know I wouldn t urt a air of yer ed so I wouldn t I wanted us to live honest by our work we was doing it And you ve lowered us to the cadgin again That s what I can t stick said Dickie It wasn t I didn t have to do a single bit of patter for it anyhow It was a wedding and I stopped to ave a squint and there d been a water cart as ad stopped to ave a squint too and made a puddle as big as a tea tray and all the path wet An the lady in her white she looks at the path and the gent e looks at er white boots an I off s with me coat like that there Rally gent you yarned me about and flops it down in the middle of the puddle right in front of the gal And she tips me a smile like a hangel and olds out er hand in er white glove and all and yer know what my ands is like matey Illustration AN I OFF S WITH ME COAT AND FLOPS IT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PUDDLE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GAL Page one hundred thirty three Yes said Dickie go on And she just touched me and and walks across me coat And the people laughed and clapped silly apes And the gent e tipped me a thick un and I spotted the pups a month ago and I knew I could have em for five bob so I got em And I ll sell em for thribble the money you see if I don t An I thought you d be as pleased as pleased me actin so silly like as if I was one of them yarns o yourn an all And then first minute I gets ere you sets on to me But that s always the way Please please forgive me father said Dickie very much ashamed of himself I am so sorry And it was nice of you and I am pleased and I do love the pups and we won t sell all three will us I would so like to have one I d call it True One of the dogs in my dream was called that You do forgive me don t you father Oh that s all right said Beale Next day again a little boy worked alone in a wood and yet not alone for a small pup sprawled and yapped and scrapped and grunted round him as he worked No squirrels or birds came that day to lighten Dickie s solitude but True was more to him than many birds or squirrels A woman they had overtaken on the road had given him a bit of blue ribbon for the puppy s neck in return for the lift which mister Beale had given her basket on the perambulator She was selling ribbons and cottons and needles from door to door and made a poor thing of it she told them An my grandfather e farmed is own land in Sussex she told them looking with bleared eyes across the fields Dickie only made a box and a part of a box that day And while he sat making it far away in London a respectable looking man was walking up and down Regent Street among the shoppers and the motors and carriages with a fluffy little white dog under each arm And he sold both the dogs One was a lady in a carriage he told Dickie later on Arst er two thick uns I did Never turned a hair no more I didn t She didn t care what its price was bless you Said it was a dinky darling and she wanted it Gent said he d get her plenty better No she wanted that An she got it too A fool and his money s soon parted s what I say And t other one I let im go cheap for fourteen bob to a black clergyman black as your hat he was from foreign parts So now we re bloomin toffs an I ll get a pair of reach me downs this very bloomin night And what price that there room you was talkin about It was the beginning of a new life Dickie wrote out their accounts on a large flagstone near the horse trough by the Chequers with a bit of billiard chalk that a man gave him It was like this Got Box four Box four Box four Box four Dog forty Dog fourteen seventy Spent Dogs four Grub nineteen Tram four Leg two twenty nine and he made out before he rubbed the chalk off the stone that the difference between twenty nine shillings and seventy was about two pounds and that was more than Dickie had ever had or Beale either for many a long year Then Beale came wiping his mouth and they walked idly up the road Lodgings Or rather a lodging A room But when you have had what is called the key of the street for years enough you hardly know where to look for the key of a room Where d you like to be Beale asked anxiously You like country best don t yer Yes said Dickie But in the winter time Beale urged Well town then said Dickie who was trying to invent a box of a new and different shape to be carved next day I could keep a lookout for likely pups said Beale there s a plenty here and there all about and you with your boxes We might go to three bob a week for the room I d like a ouse with a garden said Dickie Go back to yer Talbots said Beale No but look ere said Dickie if we was to take a ouse just a little ouse and let half of it We ain t got no sticks to put in it Ain t there some way you get furniture without payin for it Ire systim But that s for toffs on three quid a week reg lar wages They wouldn t look at us We ll get three quid right enough afore we done said Dickie firmly and if you want London I d like our old house because of the seeds I sowed in the garden I lay they ll keep on a coming up forever and ever That s what annuals means The chap next door told me It means flowers as comes up fresh every year Let s tramp up and I ll show it to you where we used to live And when they had tramped up and Dickie had shown mister Beale the sad faced little house mister Beale owned that it would do em a fair treat But we must ave some bits of sticks or else nobody won t let us have no ouses They flattened their noses against the front window The newspapers and dirty sackings still lay scattered on the floor as they had fallen from Dickie when he had got up in the morning after the night when he had had The Dream The sight pulled at Dickie s heart strings He felt as a man might feel who beheld once more the seaport from which in old and beautiful days he had set sail for the shores of romance the golden splendor of The Fortunate Islands I could doss ere again he said wistfully it ud save fourpence Both ouses both sides is empty Nobody wouldn t know We don t need to look to our fourpences so sharp s all that said Beale I d like to Wonder you ain t afeared I m used to it said Dickie it was our own ouse you see You come along to yer supper said Beale don t be so flash with yer own ouses They had supper at a coffee shop in the Broadway Two mugs four billiard balls and arf a dozen door steps was mister Beale s order You or I more polite if less picturesque would perhaps have said Two cups of tea four eggs and some thick bread and butter It was a pleasant meal Only just at the end it turned into something quite different The shop was one of those old fashioned ones divided by partitions like the stalls in a stable and over the top of this partition there suddenly appeared a head Dickie s mug paused in air half way to his mouth which remained open What s up Beale asked trying to turn on the narrow seat and look up which he couldn t do It s im whispered Dickie setting down the mug That red eaded chap wot I never see And then the redheaded man came round the partition and sat down beside Beale and talked to him and Dickie wished he wouldn t He heard little of the conversation only better luck next time from the redheaded man and I don t know as I m taking any from Beale and at the parting the redheaded man saying I ll doss same shop as wot you do and Beale giving the name of the lodging house where on the way to the coffee shop Beale had left the perambulator and engaged their beds Tell you all about it in the morning were the last words of the redheaded one as he slouched out and Dickie and Beale were left to finish the door steps and drink the cold tea that had slopped into their saucers When they went out Dickie said What did he want farver that redheaded chap Beale did not at once answer I wouldn t if I was you said Dickie looking straight in front of him as they walked Wouldn t what Whatever he wants to Why I ain t told you yet what he does want E ain t up to no good I know that E s full of notions that s wot e is said Beale If some of is notions come out right e ll be a ridin in is own cart and orse afore we know where we are and us a tramping in is dust Ridin in Black Maria more like said Dickie Well I ain t askin you to do anything am I said Beale No you ain t But whatever you re in I m a goin to be in that s all Don t you take on said Beale comfortably I ain t said I ll be in anything yet ave I Let s ear what e says in the morning If is lay ain t a safe lay old Beale won t be in it you may lay to that Don t let s said Dickie earnestly Look ere father let us go both two of us and sleep in that there old ouse of ours I don t want that red eaded chap He ll spoil everything I know e will just as we re a gettin along so straight and gay Don t let s go to that there doss let s lay in the old ouse Ain t I never to ave never a word with nobody without it s you said Beale but not angrily Not with im e ain t no class said Dickie firmly and oh farver I do so wanter sleep in that ouse that was where I ad The Dream you know Oh well come on then said Beale lucky we ve got our thick coats on It was quite easy for Dickie to get into the house just as he had done before and to go along the passage and open the front door for mister Beale who walked in as bold as brass They made themselves comfortable with the sacking and old papers but one at least of the two missed the luxury of clean air and soft moss and a bed canopy strewn with stars mister Beale was soon asleep and Dickie lay still his heart beating to the tune of the hope that now at last in this place where it had once come his dream would come again But it did not come even sleep plain restful dreamless sleep would not come to him At last he could lie still no longer He slipped from under the paper whose rustling did not disturb mister Beale s slumbers and moved into the square of light thrown through the window by the street lamp He felt in his pockets pulled out Tinkler and the white seal set them on the floor and moved by memories of the great night when his dream had come to him arranged the moon seeds round them in the same pattern that they had lain in on that night of nights And the moment that he had lain the last seed completing the crossed triangles the magic began again All was as it had been before The tired eyes that must close the feeling that through his closed eyelids he could yet see something moving in the centre of the star that the two triangles made Where do you want to go to said the same soft small voice that had spoken before But this time Dickie did not reply that he was not particular Instead he said Oh there I want to go there feeling quite sure that whoever owned that voice would know as well as he or even better where there was and how to get to it And as on that other night everything grew very quiet and sleep wrapped Dickie round like a soft garment When he awoke he lay in the big four post bed with the green and white curtains about him were the tapestry walls and the heavy furniture of The Dream Oh he cried aloud I ve found it again I ve found it I ve found it And then the old nurse with the hooped petticoats and the queer cap and the white ruff was bending over him her wrinkled face was alight with love and tenderness So thou rt awake at last she said Did saint thou find thy friend in thy dreams Dickie hugged her I ve found the way back he said I don t know which is the dream and which is real but you know Yes said the old nurse I know The one is as real as the other He sprang out of bed and went leaping round the room jumping on to chairs and off them running and dancing What ails the child the nurse grumbled get thy hose on for shame taking a chill as like as not What ails thee to act so It s the not being lame Dickie explained coming to a standstill by the window that looked out on the good green garden You don t know how wonderful it seems just at first you know not to be lame CHAPTER VI BURIED TREASURE AND then as he stood there in the sunshine he suddenly knew Having succeeded in dreaming once again the dream which he had so longed to dream Dickie Harding looked out of the window of the dream house in Deptford into the dream garden with its cut yew trees and box avenues and bowling greens and perceived without doubt that this was no dream but real as real as the other Deptford where he had sown Artistic Bird Seed and gathered moonflowers and reaped the silver seeds of magic for it was magic Dickie was sure of it now He had not lived in the time of the First James be sure without hearing magic talked of And it seemed quite plain to him that if this that had happened to him was not magic then there never was and never would be any magic to happen to any one He turned from the window and looked at the tapestry hung room the big bed the pleasant wrinkled face of the nurse and he knew that all this was as real as anything that had happened to him in that other life where he was a little lame boy who took the road with a dirty tramp for father and lay in the bed with green curtains Was thy friend well in thy dream the nurse asked Yes oh yes said Dickie and I carved boxes in my dream and sold them and I want to learn a lot more things so that when I go back again I mean when I dream that dream again I shall be able to earn more money Tis shame that one of thy name should have to work for money said the nurse It isn t my name there said Dickie and old Sebastian told me every one ought to do some duty to his country or he wasn t worth his meat and ale And you don t know how good it is having money that you ve earned yourself I ought to she said I ve earned mine long enough Now haste and dress and then breakfast and thy fencing lesson When the fencing lesson was over Dickie hesitated He wanted of course to hurry off to Sebastian and to go on learning how to make a galleon But also he wanted to learn some trade that he could teach Beale at Deptford and he knew quite as surely as any master craftsman could have known it that nothing which required delicate handling such as wood carving or the making of toy boats could ever be mastered by Beale But Beale was certainly fond of dogs Dickie remembered how little True had cuddled up to him and nestled inside his coat when he lay down to sleep under the newspapers and the bits of sacking in Lavender Terrace Rosemary Lane So Dickie went his way to the kennels to talk to the kennelman He had been there before with Master Roger Fry his fencing master but he had never spoken to the kennelman And when he got to the kennels he knocked on the door of the kennelman s house and called out What ho within there just as people do in old plays And the door was thrown open by a man in a complete suit of leather and when Dickie looked in that man s face he saw that it was the face of the man who had lived next door in Lavender Terrace Rosemary Lane the man who dug up the garden for the parrot seed Why said Dickie it s you Who would it be but me little master the man asked with a respectful salute and Dickie perceived that though this man had the face of the Man Next Door he had not the Man Next Door s memories Do you live here he asked cautiously always I mean Where else should I live the man asked that have served my lord your father all my time boy and man and know every hair of every dog my lord owns Dickie thought that was a good deal to know and so it was He stayed an hour at the kennels and came away knowing very much more about dogs than he did before though some of the things he learned would surprise a modern veterinary surgeon very much indeed But the dogs seemed well and happy though they were doctored with herb tea instead of stuff from the chemist s and the charms that were said over them to make them swift and strong certainly did not make them any the less strong and swift When Dickie had learned as much about dogs as he felt he could bear for that day he felt free to go down to the dockyard and go on learning how ships were built Sebastian looked up at the voice and ceased the blows with which his axe was smoothing a great tree trunk that was to be a mast and smiled in answer to his smile Oh what a long time since I have seen thee Dickie cried And Sebastian gently mocking him answered A great while indeed two whole long days And those thou saint spent merrymaking in the King s water pageant Two days a great while a great great while I want you to teach me everything you know said Dickie picking up an awl and feeling its point Illustration OH WHAT A LONG TIME SINCE I HAVE SEEN THEE DICKIE CRIED Page one hundred forty seven Have patience with me laughed Sebastian I will teach thee all thou canst learn but not all in one while Little by little slow and sure You must not think said Dickie that it s only play and that I do not need to learn because I am my father s son Should I think so Sebastian asked I that have sailed with Captain Drake and Captain Raleigh and seen how a gentleman venturer needs to turn his hand to every guess craft If thou s so pleased to learn as Sebastian is to teach then he ll be as quick to teach as thou to learn And so to work He fetched out from the shed the ribs of the little galleon that he and Dickie had begun to put together and the two set to work on it It was a happy day And one happiness was to all the other happinesses of that day as the sun is to little stars and that happiness was the happiness of being once more a little boy who did not need to use a crutch And now the beautiful spacious life opened once more for Dickie and he learned many things and found the days all good and happy and all the nights white and peaceful in the big house and the beautiful garden on the slopes above Deptford And the nights had no dreams in them and in the days Dickie lived gaily and worthily the life of the son of a great and noble house and now he had no prickings of conscience about Beale left alone in the little house in Deptford Because one day he said to his nurse How long did it take me to dream that dream about making the boxes and earning the money in the ugly place I told you of Dreams about that place she answered him take none of our time here And dreams about this place take none of what is time in that other place But my dream endured all night objected Dickie Not so said the nurse smiling between her white cap frills It was after the dream that sleep came a whole good nightful of it So Dickie felt that for Beale no time at all had passed and that when he went back which he meant to do he would get back to Deptford at the same instant as he left it Which is the essence of this particular kind of white magic And thus it happened that when he did go back to mister Beale he went because his heart called him and not for any other reason at all Days and weeks and months went by and it was autumn and the apples were ripe on the trees and the grapes ripe on the garden walls and trellises And then came a day when all the servants seemed suddenly to go mad a great rushing madness of mops and brooms and dusters and pails and everything in the house already perfectly clean was cleaned anew and everything that was already polished was polished freshly and when Dickie had been turned out of three rooms one after the other had tumbled over a pail and had a dish cloth pinned to his doublet by an angry cook he sought out the nurse very busy in the linen room and asked her what all the fuss was about It can t be a spring cleaning he said because it s the wrong time of year Never say I did not tell thee she answered unfolding a great embroidered cupboard cloth and holding it up critically To morrow thy father and mother come home and thy baby brother and to day sennight thy little cousins come to visit thee How perfectly glorious said Dickie But you didn t tell me If I didn t twas because you never asked I I didn t dare to he said dreamily I was so afraid You see I ve never seen them Afraid she said laying away the folded cloth and taking out another from the deep press oaken with smooth worn brown iron hinges and lock never seen thy father and mother forsooth Perhaps it was the fever said Dickie feeling rather deceitful You said it made me forget things I don t remember them Not at all I don t Do not say that to them the nurse said looking at him very gravely I won t Unless they ask me he added Oh nurse let me do something too What can I do to help Thou canst gather such flowers as are left in the garden to make a nosegay for thy mother s room and set them in order in fair water And bid thy tutor teach thee a welcome song to say to them when they come in Gathering the flowers and arranging them was pleasant and easy Asking so intimate a favor from the sour faced tutor whom he so much disliked was neither easy nor pleasant But Dickie did it And the tutor was delighted to set him to learn a particularly hard and uninteresting piece of poetry beginning Happy is he Who to sweet home retired Shuns glory so admired And to himself lives free While he who strives with pride to climb the skies Falls down with foul disgrace before he dies Dickie could not help thinking that the father and mother who were to be his in this beautiful world might have preferred something simpler and more affectionate from their little boy than this difficult piece whose last verse was the only one which seemed to Dickie to mean anything in particular In this verse Dickie was made to remark that he hoped people would say of him He died a good old man which he did not hope and indeed had never so much as thought of The poetry he decided would have been nicer if it had been more about his father and mother and less about fame and trees and burdens He felt this so much that he tried to write a poem himself and got as far as They say there is no other Can take the place of mother I say there is no one I d rather See than my father But he could not think of any more to say and besides he had a haunting idea that the first two lines which were quite the best were not his own make up So he abandoned the writing of poetry deciding that it was not his line and painfully learned the dismal verses appointed by his tutor But he never got them said When the bustle of arrival had calmed a little Dickie his heart beating very fast indeed found himself led by his tutor into the presence of the finest gentleman and the dearest lady he had ever beheld The tutor gave him a little push so that he had to go forward two steps and to stand alone on the best carpet which had been spread in their honor and hissed in a savage whisper Recite your song of welcome Happy the man began Dickie in tones of gloom and tremblingly pronounced the first lines of that unpleasing poem But he had not got to strive with pride before the dear lady caught him in her arms exclaiming Bless my dear son how he has grown and the fine gentleman thumped him on the back and bade him bear himself like a gentleman s son and not like a queasy square toes And they both laughed and he cried a little and the tutor seemed to be blotted out and there they were all three as jolly as if they had known each other all their lives And a stout young nurse brought the baby and Dickie loved it and felt certain it loved him though it only said Goo ga goo exactly as your baby brother does now and got hold of Dickie s hair and pulled it and would not let go There was a glorious dinner and Dickie waited on this new father of his changed his plate and poured wine out of a silver jug into the silver cup that my lord drank from And after dinner the dear lady mother must go all over the house to see everything because she had been so long away and Dickie walked in the garden among the ripe apples and grapes with his father s hand on his shoulder the happiest proudest boy in all Deptford or in all Kent either His father asked what he had learned and Dickie told dwelling perhaps more on the riding and the fencing and the bowls and the music than on the sour faced tutor s side of the business But I ve learned a lot of Greek and Latin too he added in a hurry and poetry and things like that I fear said the father thou dost not love thy book I do sir yet I love my sports better said Dickie and looked up to meet the fond proud look of eyes as blue as his own Thou rt a good modest lad said his father when they began their third round of the garden not once to ask for what I promised thee Dickie could not stand this I might have asked he said presently but I have forgot what the promise was the fever Ay ay poor lad And of a high truth too Owned he had forgot Come jog that poor peaked remembrance Dickie could hardly believe the beautiful hope that whispered in his ear I almost think I remember he said Father did you promise I promised if thou wast a good lad and biddable and constant at thy book and thy manly exercises to give thee so soon as thou should saint have learned to ride him A little horse said Dickie breathlessly oh father not a little horse It was good to hear one s father laugh that big jolly laugh to feel one s father s arm laid like that across one s shoulders The little horse turned round to look at them from his stall in the big stables It was really rather a big horse What colored horse would you choose if a horse were to be yours for the choosing Dickie would have chosen a gray and a gray it was What is his name Dickie asked when he had admired the gray s every point had had him saddled and had ridden him proudly round the pasture in his father s sight We call him Rosinante said his father because he is so fat and he laughed but Dickie did not understand the joke He had not read Don Quixote as you no doubt have I should like said Dickie sitting square on the gray to call him Crutch May I Crutch the father repeated Because his paces are so easy Dickie explained He got off the horse very quickly and came to his father I mean even a lame boy could ride him Oh father I am so happy he said and burrowed his nose in a velvet doublet and perhaps snivelled a little I am so glad I am not lame Fancy full as ever said his father come come Thou rt weak yet from the fever Be a man Remember of what blood thou art And thy mother she also hath a gift for thee from thy grandfather Hast thou forgotten that It hangs to the book learning A reward and thou hast earned it I ve forgotten that too said Dickie You aren t vexed because I forget I can t help it father That I ll warrant thou cannot Come now to thy mother My little son The Earl of Scilly chid me but this summer for sparing the rod and spoiling the child But thy growth in all things bears out in what I answered him I said The boys of our house my lord take that pride in it that they learn of their own free will what many an earl s son must be driven to with rods He took me His own son is little better than an idiot and naught but the rod to blame for it I verily believe They found the lady mother and her babe by a little fire in a wide hearth Our son comes to claim the guerdon of learning the father said And the lady stood up with the babe in her arms Call the nurse to take him she said But Dickie held out his arms Oh mother he said and it was the first time in all his life that he had spoken that word to any one Mother do let me hold him A warm stiff bundle was put into his careful arms and his little brother instantly caught at his hair It hurt but Dickie liked it The lady went to one of the carved cabinets and with a bright key from a very bright bunch unlocked one of the heavy panelled doors She drew out of the darkness within a dull colored leather bag embroidered in gold thread and crimson silk He has forgot said Sir Richard in an undertone what it was that the grandfather promised him Though he has well earned the same Tis the fever The mother put the bag in Dickie s hands Count it out she said taking her babe from him and Dickie untied the leathern string and poured out on to the polished long table what the bag held Twenty gold pieces And all with the image of our late dear Queen said the mother the image of that incomparable virgin Majesty whose example is a beacon for all time to all virtuous ladies Illustration IT HURT BUT DICKIE LIKED IT Page one hundred fifty seven Ah yes indeed said the father put them up in the bag boy They are thine own to thee to spend as thou wilt Not unwisely said the mother gently As he wills the father firmly said wisely or unwisely As he wills And none he added shall ask how they be spent The lady frowned she was a careful housewife and twenty gold pieces were a large sum I will not waste it said Dickie Mother you may trust me not to waste it It was the happiest moment of his life to Dickie The little horse the gold pieces Yes but much more the sudden good safe feeling of father and mother and little brother of a place where he belonged where he loved and was loved And by his equals For he felt that as far as a child can be the equal of grown people he was the equal of these And Beale was not his equal either in the graces of the body or in the inner treasures of mind and heart And hitherto he had loved only Beale had only so far as he could remember been loved by Beale and by that shadowy father his Daddy who had died in hospital and dying had given him the rattle his Tinkler that was Harding s Luck And in the very heart of that happiest moment came like a sharp dagger prick the thought of Beale What wonders could be done for Beale with those twenty five gold sovereigns For Dickie thought of them just as sovereigns and so they were And as these people who loved him who were his own drew nearer and nearer to his heart his heart quickened by love of them felt itself drawn more and more to mister Beale mister Beale the tramp who had been kind to him when no one else was mister Beale the tramp and housebreaker So when the nurse took him tired with new happinesses to that beautiful tapestried room of his he roused himself from his good soft sleepiness to say Nurse you know a lot of things don t you I know what I know she answered undoing buttons with speed and authority You know that other dream of mine that dream of mine I mean the dream of a dreadful place And then Could I take anything out of this dream I mean out of this time into the other one You could but you must bring it back when you come again And you could bring things thence Certain things your rattle your moon seeds your seal He stared at her You do know things he said but I want to take things there and leave them there She knitted thoughtful brows There s three hundred thick years between now and then she said Oh yes I know And if you held it in your hand you d lose it like as not in some of the years you go through Money s mortal heavy and travels slow Slower than the soul of you my lamb Some one would have time to see it and snatch it and hold to it Isn t there any way Dickie asked insisting to himself that he wasn t sleepy There s the way of everything the earth she said bury it and lie down on the spot where it s buried and then when you get back into the other dream the kind thick earth will have hid your secret and you can dig it up again It will be there unless other hands have dug there in the three hundred years You must take your chance of that Will you help me Dickie asked I shall need to dig it very deep if I am to cheat three hundred years And suppose he added struck by a sudden and unpleasing thought there s a house built on the place I should be mixed up with the house Two things can t be in the same place at the same time My tutor told me that And the house would be so much stronger than me it would get the best of it and where should I be then I ll ask where thou d be was the very surprising answer I ll ask some one who knows But it ll take time put thy money in the great press and I ll keep the key And next Friday as ever is come your little cousins They came It was more difficult with them than it was with the grown ups to conceal the fact that he had not always been the Dickie he was now but it was not so difficult as you might suppose It was no harder than not talking about the dreams you had last night And now he had indeed a full life head work bodily exercises work home life and joyous hours of play with two children who understood play as the poor little dirty Deptford children do not and cannot understand it He lived and learned and felt more and more that this was the life to which he really belonged And days and weeks and months went by and nothing happened and that is the happiest thing that can happen to any one who is already happy Then one night the nurse said I have asked You are to bury your treasure under the window of the solar parlor and lie down and sleep on it You ll take no harm and when you re asleep I will say the right words and you ll wake under the same skies and not under a built house like as you feared She wrapped him in a warm cloth mantle of her own when she took him from his bed that night after all the family were asleep and put on his shoes and led him to the hole she had secretly dug in below the window They had put his embroidered leather bag of gold in a little wrought iron coffer that Sebastian had given him and the nurse had tightly fastened the join of lid and box with wax and resin The box was wrapped in a silk scarf and the whole packet put into a big earthenware jar with a lid and the join of lid and jar was smeared with resin and covered with clay The nurse had shown him how to do all this Against the earth spirits and the three hundred years she said Now she lifted the jar into the hole and together they filled the hole with earth treading it in with their feet And when you would return said the nurse you know the way Do I You lay the rattle the seal and the moon seeds as before and listen to the voices And then Dickie lay down in the cloth cloak and the nurse sat by him and held his hand till he fell asleep It was June now and the scent of the roses was very sweet and the nightingales kept him awake awhile But the sky overhead was an old friend of his and as he lay he could see the shining of the dew among the grass blades of the lawn It was pleasant to lie again in the bed with the green curtains When he awoke there was his old friend the starry sky and for a moment he wondered Then he remembered He raised himself on his elbow There were houses all about little houses with lights in some of the windows A broken paling was quite close to him There was no grass near only rough trampled earth the smell all about him was not of roses but of dust bins and there were no nightingales but far away he could hear that restless roar that is the voice of London and near at hand the foolish song and unsteady footfall of a man going home from the Cat and Whistle He scratched a cross on the hard ground with a broken bit of a plate to mark the spot got up and crept on hands and knees to the house climbed in and found the room where Beale lay asleep Father said Dickie next morning as mister Beale stretched and grunted and rubbed sleepy eyes with his unwashed fists in the cold daylight that filled the front room of fifteen Lavender Terrace Rosemary Lane You got to take this house that s what you got to do you remember Can t say I do said Beale scratching his head but if the nipper says so it is so Let s go and get a mug and a door step and then we ll see You get it if you re hungry said Dickie I d rather wait here in case anybody else was to take the house You go and see im now E ll think you re a man in reg lar work by your being up so early P raps said Beale thoughtfully running his hand over the rustling stubble of his two days beard p raps I d best get a wash and brush up first eh It might be worth it in the end I ll ave to go to the doss to get our pram and things any ow The landlord of the desired house really thought mister Beale a quite respectable working man and mister Beale accounted for their lack of furniture by saying quite truthfully that he and his nipper had come up from Gravesend doing a bit of work on the way I could he added quite untruthfully give you the gentleman I worked with for me reference Talbott is name is a bald man with a squint and red ears but p raps this ll do as well He pulled out of one pocket all their money two pounds eighteen shillings except six pennies which he had put in the other pocket to rattle He rattled them now I m anxious he said confidentially to get settled on account of the nipper I don t deceive you we oofed it up not to waste our little bit and he s a hoppy chap That s odd said the landlord there was a lame boy lived there along of the last party that had it It s a cripple s home by rights I should think Beale had not foreseen this difficulty and had no story ready So he tried the truth It s the same lad mister he said that s why I m rather set on the ouse You see it s ome to im like he added sentimentally You is father said the landlord sharply And again Beale was inspired to truthfulness quite a lot of it No he said cautiously wish I was The fact is the little chap s aunt wasn t much class An I found im wandering An not avin none of my own I sort of adopted im Like Wandering Hares at the theatre said the landlord who had been told by Dickie s aunt that the ungrateful little warmint had run away I see And e s a jolly little chap said Beale warming to his subject and forgetting his caution as knowing as a dog ferret and his patter enough to make a cat laugh e is sometimes And I ll pay a week down if you like mister and we ll get our bits of sticks in to day Well said the landlord taking a key from a nail on the wall let s go down and have a look at the ouse Where s the kid E s there awaitin for me said Beale couldn t get im away Dickie was very polite to the landlord at whom in unhappier days he had sometimes made faces and when the landlord went he had six of their shillings and they had the key So now we ve got a ome of our own said Beale rubbing his hands when they had gone through the house together an Englishman s ome is is castle and what with the boxes you ll cut out and the dogs what I ll pick up Buckingham Palace ll look small alongside of us eh matey They locked up the house and went to breakfast Beale gay as a lark and Dickie rather silent He was thinking over a new difficulty It was all very well to bury twenty sovereigns and to know exactly where they were And they were his own beyond a doubt But if any one saw those sovereigns dug up those sovereigns would be taken away from him No one would believe that they were his own And the earthenware pot was so big And so many windows looked out on the garden No one could hope to dig up a big thing like that from his back garden without attracting some attention Besides he doubted whether he were strong enough to dig it up even if he could do so unobserved He had not thought of this when he had put the gold there in that other life He was so much stronger then He sighed Got the ump mate asked Beale with his mouth full No I was just a thinkin We d best buy the sticks first thing said Beale it s a cruel world No sticks no trust is the landlord s motto Do you want to know what sticks they bought I will tell you They bought a rusty old bedstead very big with laths that hung loose like a hammock and all its knobs gone and only bare screws sticking up spikily Also a flock mattress and pillows of a dull dust color to go on the bed and some blankets and sheets all matching the mattress to a shade They bought a table and two chairs and a kitchen fender with a round steel moon only it was very rusty and a hand bowl for the sink and a small zinc bath to wash your shirt in said mister Beale Four plates two cups and saucers two each of knives forks and spoons a tin teapot a quart jug a pail a bit of Kidderminster carpet half a pound of yellow soap a scrubbing brush and broom two towels a kettle a saucepan and a baking dish and a pint of paraffin Also there was a tin lamp to hang on the wall with a dazzling crinkled tin reflector This was the only thing that was new and it cost tenpence halfpenny All the rest of the things together cost twenty six shillings and sevenpence halfpenny and I think they were cheap But they seemed very poor and very little of them when they were dumped down in the front room The bed especially looked far from its best a mere heap of loose iron And we ain t got our droring room suit neither said mister Beale Lady s and gent s easy chairs four hoccasionals pianner and foomed oak booreau Curtains said Dickie white curtains for the parlor and short blinds everywhere else I ll go and get em while you clean the winders That old shirt of mine It won t hang through another washing Clean em with that You don t give your orders neither said Beale contentedly The curtains and a penn orth of tacks a hammer borrowed from a neighbor and an hour s cheerful work completed the fortification of the Englishman s house against the inquisitiveness of passers by But the landlord frowned anxiously as he went past the house Don t like all that white curtain he told himself not much be ind it if you ask me People don t go to that extreme in Nottingham lace without there s something to hide a house full of emptiness most likely Inside Dickie was telling a very astonished mister Beale that there was money buried in the garden It was give me said he for learning of something and we ve got to get it up so as no one sees us I can t think of nothing but build a chicken house and then dig inside of it I wish I was cleverer Here Ward would have thought of something first go off Don t you worry said Beale you re clever enough for this poor world You re all right Come on out and show us where you put it Just peg with yer foot on the spot looking up careless at the sky They went out And Dickie put his foot on the cross he had scratched with the broken bit of plate It was close to the withered stalk of the moonflower This ere garden s in a poor state said Beale in a loud voice wants turning over s what I think against the winter I ll get a spade and ave a turn at it this very day so I will This ere old artichook s got some roots I lay The digging began at the fence and reached the moonflower whose roots were indeed deep Quite a hole mister Beale dug before the tall stalk sloped and fell with slow dignity like a forest tree before the axe Then the man and the child went in and brought out the kitchen table and chairs and laid blankets over them to air in the autumn sunlight Dickie played at houses under the table it was not the sort of game he usually played but the neighbors could not know that The table happened to be set down just over the hole that had held the roots of the moonflower Dickie dug a little with a trowel in the blanket house After dark they carried the blankets and things in Then one of the blankets was nailed up over the top floor window and on the iron bedstead s dingy mattress the resin was melted from the lid of the pot that mister Beale had brought in with the other things from the garden Also it was melted from the crack of the iron casket mister Beale s eyes always rather prominent almost resembled the eyes of the lobster or the snail as their gaze fell on the embroidered leather bag And when Dickie opened this and showered the twenty gold coins into a hollow of the drab ticking he closed his eyes and sighed and opened them again and said Give you They give you that I don t believe you You got to believe me said Dickie firmly I never told you a lie did I Come to think of it I don t know as you ever did Beale admitted Well said Dickie they was give me see We ll never change em though said Beale despondently We d get lagged for a cert They d say we pinched em No they won t Cause I ve got a friend as ll change em for me and then we ll ave new clobber and some more furniture and a carpet and a crockery basin to wash our hands and faces in stead of that old tin thing And a bath we ll ave And you shall buy some more pups And I ll get some proper carving tools And our fortune s made See You nipper said Beale slowly and fondly the best day s work ever I done was when I took up with you You re straight you are one of the best Many s the boy would ave done a bunk and took the shiners along with him But you stuck to old Beale and he ll stick to you That s all right said Dickie beginning to put the bright coins back into the bag But it ain t all right Beale insisted stubbornly it ain t no good I must ave it all out or bust I didn t never take you along of me cause I fancied you like what I said I was just a looking out for a nipper to shove through windows see along of that redheaded chap what you never set eyes on I ve known that a long time said Dickie gravely watching the candle flicker on the bare mantel shelf I didn t mean no good to you not at first I didn t said Beale when you wrote on the sole of my boot I d bought that bit of paper and pencil a purpose There You ain t done me no arm anyway said Dickie No I know I ain t Cause why Cause I took to you the very first day I allus been kind to you you can t say I ain t mister Beale was confused by the two desires which make it difficult to confess anything truthfully the desire to tell the worst of oneself and the desire to do full justice to oneself at the same time It is so very hard not to blacken the blackness or whiten the whiteness when one comes to trying to tell the truth about oneself But I been a beast all the same said mister Beale helplessly Oh stow it Dickie said now you ve told me it s all square You won t keep a down on me for it Now should I said Dickie exasperated and very sleepy Now all is open as the day and we can pursue our career as honorable men and comrades in all high emprise I mean he explained noticing mister Beale s open mouth and eyes more lobster like than ever I mean that s all right farver and you see it don t make any difference to me I knows you re straight now even if it didn t begin just like that Let s get to bed shan t us mister Beale dreamed that he was trying to drown Dickie in a pond full of stewed eels Dickie didn t dream at all You may wonder why since going to the beautiful other world took no time and was so easy Dickie did not do it every night or even at odd times during the day Well the fact was he dared not He loved the other life so much that he feared that once again there he might not have the courage to return to mister Beale and Deptford and the feel of dirty clothes and the smell of dust bins It was no light thing to come back from that to this And now he made a resolution that he would not set out the charm of Tinkler and seal and moon seeds until he had established mister Beale in an honorable calling and made a life for him in which he could be happy A great undertaking for a child Yes But then Dickie was not an ordinary child or none of these adventures would ever have happened to him The pawnbroker always a good friend to Dickie had the wit to see that the child was not lying when he said that the box and the bag and the gold pieces had been given to him He changed the gold pieces stamped with the image of Queen Elizabeth for others stamped with the image of Queen Victoria And he gave five pounds for the wrought iron box and owned that he should make a little a very little out of it And if your grand society friends give you any more treasures you know the house to come to the fairest house in the trade though I say it Thank you very much said Dickie you ve been a good friend to me I hope some day I shall do you a better turn than the little you make out of my boxes and things The Jew sold the wrought iron box that very week for twenty guineas And Dickie and mister Beale now possessed twenty seven pounds New clothes were bought more furniture Twenty two pounds of the money was put in the savings bank Dickie bought carving tools and went to the Goldsmiths Institute to learn to use them The front bedroom was fitted with a bench for Dickie The back sitting room was a kennel for the dogs which mister Beale instantly began to collect The front room was a parlor a real parlor A decent young woman Amelia by name was engaged to come in every day and do for them The clothes they wore were clean the food they ate was good Dickie s knowledge of an ordered life in a great house helped him to order life in a house that was little And day by day they earned their living The new life was fairly started And now Dickie felt that he might dare to go back through the three hundred years to all that was waiting for him there But I will only stay a month he told himself a month here and a month there that will keep things even Because if I were longer there than I am here I should not be growing up so fast here as I should there And everything would be crooked And how silly if I were a grown man in that life and had to come back and be a little boy in this I do not pretend that the idea did not occur to Dickie Now that Beale is fairly started he could do very well without me But Dickie knew better He dismissed the idea Besides Beale had been good to him and he loved him The white curtains had now no sordid secrets to keep and when the landlord called for the rent mister Beale was able to ask him to step in into a comfortable room with a horsehair sofa and a big worn easy chair a carpet four old mahogany chairs and a table with a clean blue and red checked cloth on it There was a bright clock on the mantelpiece and vases with chrysanthemums in them and there were red woollen curtains as well as the white lace ones You re as snug as snug in here said the landlord Not so dusty said Beale shining from soap ave a look at my dawgs He succeeded in selling the landlord a pup for ten shillings and came back to Dickie sitting by the pleasant firelight It s all very smart he said but don t you never feel the fidgets in your legs I ve kep steady and keep steady I will But in the spring when the weather gets a bit open what d you say to shutting up the little ouse and taking the road for a bit Gentlemen do it even he added wistfully Walking towers they call em I d like it said Dickie but what about the dogs Oh Amelia d do for them a fair treat all but Fan and Fly as ud go along of us I dunno what it is he said makes me anker so after the road I was always like it from a boy Couldn t get me to school so they couldn t allus after birds nests or rabbits or the like Not but what I liked it well enough where I was bred I didn t tell you did I we passed close longside our old ome that time we slep among the furze bushes I don t s pose my father s alive now But e was a game old chap shouldn t wonder but what he d stuck it out Let s go and see him some day said Dickie I dunno said Beale you see I was allus a great hanxiety to im And besides I shouldn t like to find im gone Best not know nothing That s what I say But he sighed as he said it and he filled his pipe in a thoughtful silence CHAPTER VII DICKIE LEARNS MANY THINGS THAT night Dickie could not sleep And as he lay awake a great resolve grew strong within him He would try once more the magic of the moon seeds and the rattle and the white seal and try to get back into that other world So he crept down into the parlor where a little layer of clear red fire still burned And now the moon seeds and the voices and the magic were over and Dickie awoke thrilled to feel how cleverly he had managed everything moved his legs in the bed rejoicing that he was no longer lame Then he opened his eyes to feast them on the big light tapestried room But the room was not tapestried It was panelled And it was rather dark And it was so small as not to be much better than a cupboard This surprised Dickie more than anything else that had ever happened to him and it frightened him a little too If the spell of the moon seeds and the rattle and the white seal was not certain to take him where he wished to be nothing in the world was certain He might be anywhere where he didn t wish to be he might be any one whom he did not wish to be I ll never try it again he said if I get out of this I ll stick to the wood carving and not go venturing about any more among dreams and things He got up and looked out of a narrow window From it he saw a garden but it was not a garden he had ever seen before It had marble seats balustrades and the damp dews of autumn hung chill about its almost unleafed trees It might have been worse it might have been a prison yard he told himself Come keep your heart up Wherever I ve come to it s an adventure He turned back to the room and looked for his clothes There were no clothes there But the shirt he had on was like the shirt he had slept in at the beautiful house He turned to open the door and there was no door All was dark even panelling He was not shut in a room but in a box Nonsense boxes did not have beds in them and windows And then suddenly he was no longer the clever person who had managed everything so admirably who was living two lives with such credit in both who was managing a grown man for that grown man s good but just a little boy rather badly frightened The little shirt was the only thing that helped and that only gave him the desperate courage to beat on the panels and shout Nurse Nurse Nurse A crack of light split and opened between two panels they slid back and between them the nurse came to him the nurse with the ruff and the frilled cap and the kind wrinkled face He got his arms round her big comfortable waist There there my lamb she said petting him His clothes hung over her arm his doublet and little fat breeches his stockings and the shoes with rosettes Oh I am here oh I am so glad I thought I d got to somewhere different She sat down on the bed and began to dress him soothing him back to confidence with gentle touches and pet names Listen she said when it came to the silver sugar loaf buttons of the doublet You must listen carefully It is a month since you went away But I thought time didn t move I thought It was the money upset everything she said it always does upset everything I ought to have known Now attend carefully No one knows you have been away You ve seemed to be here learning and playing and doing everything like you used And you re on a visit now to your cousins at your uncle s town house And you all have lessons together thy tutor gives them And thy cousins love him no better than thou dost All thou hast to do is to forget thy dream and take up thy life here and be slow to speak for a day or two till thou hast grown used to thine own place Thou lieutenant have lessons alone to day One of the cousins goes with his mother to be her page and bear her train at the King s revels at Whitehall and the other must sit and sew her sampler Her mother says she hath run wild too long So Dickie had lessons alone with his detested tutor and his relief from the panic fear of the morning raised his spirits to a degree that unfortunately found vent in what was for him extreme naughtiness He drew a comic picture of his tutor it really was rather like with a scroll coming out of his mouth and on the scroll the words Because I am ugly I need not be hateful His tutor who had a nasty way of creeping up behind people came up behind him at the wrong moment Dickie was caned on both hands and kept in Also his dinner was of bread and water and he had to write out two hundred times I am a bad boy and I ask the pardon of my good tutor The fifth day of November sixteen oh eight So he did not see his aunt and cousin in their Whitehall finery and it was quite late in the afternoon before he even saw his other cousin who had been sampler sewing He would not have written out the lines he felt sure he would not only he thought of his cousin and wanted to see her again For she was the only little girl friend he had When the last was done he rushed into the room where she was he was astonished to find that he knew his way about the house quite well though he could not remember ever having been there before and cried out Thy task done Mine is too Old Parrot nose kept me hard at it but I thought of thee and for this once I did all his biddings So now we are free Come play ball in the garden His cousin looked up from her sampler set the frame down and jumped up I am so glad she said I do hate this horrid sampler And as she said it Dickie had a most odd feeling rather as if a clock had struck or had stopped striking a feeling of sudden change But he could not wait to wonder about it or to question what it was that he really felt His cousin was waiting Come Elfrida he said and held out his hand They went together into the garden Now if you have read a book called The House of Arden you will already know that Dickie s cousins were called Edred and Elfrida and that their father Lord Arden had a beautiful castle by the sea as well as a house in London and that he and his wife were great favorites at the Court of King James the First If you have not read that book and didn t already know these things well you know them now And Arden was Dickie s own name too in this old life and his father was Sir Richard Arden of Deptford and Aylesbury And his tutor was mister Parados called Parrot nose for short by his disrespectful pupils Dickie and Elfrida played ball and they played hide and seek and they ran races He preferred play to talk just then he did not want to let out the fact that he remembered nothing whatever of the doings of the last month Elfrida did not seem very anxious to talk either The garden was most interesting and the only blot on the scene was the black figure of the tutor walking up and down with a sour face and his thumbs in one of his dull looking books The children sat down on the step of one of the stone seats and Dickie was wondering why he had felt that queer clock stopping feeling when he was roused from his wonderings by hearing Elfrida say Please to remember The Fifth of November The gunpowder treason and plot I see no reason Why gunpowder treason Should ever be forgot How odd he thought I didn t know that was so old as all this And he remembered hearing his father Sir Richard Arden say Treason s a dangerous word to let lie on your lips these days So he said Tis not a merry song cousin nor a safe one Tis best not to sing of treason But it didn t come off you know and he s always burnt in the end So already Guy Fawkes burnings went on Dickie wondered whether there would be a bonfire to night It was the Fifth of November He had had to write the date two hundred times so he was fairly certain of it He was afraid of saying too much or too little And for the life of him he could not remember the date of the Gunpowder Plot Still he must say something so he said Are there more verses No said Elfrida I wonder he said trying to feel his way what treason the ballad deals with He felt it had been the wrong thing to say when Elfrida answered in surprised tones Don t you know I know And I know some of the names of the conspirators and who they wanted to kill and everything Tell me seemed the wisest thing to say and he said it as carelessly as he could The King hadn t been fair to the Catholics you know said Elfrida who evidently knew all about the matter so a lot of them decided to kill him and the Houses of Parliament They made a plot there were a whole lot of them in it The clock stopping feeling came on again Elfrida was different somehow The Elfrida who had gone on the barge to Gravesend and played with him at the Deptford house had never used such expressions as a whole lot of them in it He looked at her and she went on They said Lord Arden was in it but he wasn t and some of them were to pretend to be hunting and to seize the Princess Elizabeth and proclaim her Queen and the rest were to blow the Houses of Parliament up when the King went to open them I never heard this tale from my tutor said Dickie And without knowing why he felt uneasy and because he felt uneasy he laughed Then he said Proceed cousin Elfrida went on telling him about the Gunpowder Plot but he hardly listened The stopped clock feeling was growing so strong But he heard her say mister Tresham wrote to his relation Lord Monteagle that they were going to blow up the King and he found himself saying What King though he knew the answer perfectly well Why King James the First said Elfrida and suddenly the horrible tutor pounced and got Elfrida by the wrist Then all in a moment everything grew confused mister Parados was asking questions and little Elfrida was trying to answer them and Dickie understood that the Gunpowder Plot had not happened y et and that Elfrida had given the whole show away How did she know And the verse Tell me all every name every particular the loathsome tutor was saying or it will be the worse for thee and thy father Elfrida was positively green with terror and looked appealingly at Dickie Come sir he said in as manly a voice as he could manage you frighten my cousin It is but a tale she told She is always merry and full of many inventions But the tutor would not be silenced And it s in history he heard Elfrida say What followed was a mist of horrible things When the mist cleared Dickie found himself alone in the house with mister Parados the nurse and the servants for the Earl and Countess of Arden Edred and Elfrida were lodged in the Tower of London on a charge of high treason For this was it seemed the Fifth of November the day on which the Gunpowder Plot should have been carried out and Elfrida it was and not mister Tresham Lord Monteagle s cousin who had given away the whole business But how had Elfrida known Could it be that she had dreams like his and in those dreams visited later times when all this was matter of history Dickie s brain felt fat swollen as though it would burst and he was glad to go to bed even in that cupboardy place with the panels But he begged the nurse to leave the panel open And when he woke next day it was all true His aunt and uncle and his two cousins were in the Tower and gloom hung over Arden House in Soho like a black thunder cloud over a mountain And the days went on and lessons with mister Parados were a sort of Inquisition torture to Dickie For the tutor never let a day pass without trying to find out whether Dickie had shared in any way that guilty knowledge of Elfrida s which had so mister Parados insisted overthrown the fell plot of the Papists and preserved to a loyal people His Most Gracious Majesty James the First And then one day quite as though it were the most natural thing in the world his cousin Edred and Lady Arden his aunt were set free from the Tower and came home The King had suddenly decided that they at least had had nothing to do with the plot Lady Arden cried all the time and as Dickie owned to himself there was enough to make her But Edred was full of half thought out plans and schemes for being revenged on old Parrot nose And at last he really did arrange a scheme for getting Elfrida out of the Tower a perfectly workable scheme And what is more it worked If you want to know how it was done ask some grown up to tell you how Lady Nithsdale got her husband out of the Tower when he was a prisoner there and in danger of having his head cut off and you will readily understand the kind of scheme it was A necessary part of it was the dressing up of Elfrida in boy s clothes and her coming out of the Tower pretending to be Edred who with Richard had come in to visit Lord Arden Then the guard at the Tower gateway was changed and another Edred came out and they all got into a coach and there was Elfrida under the coach seat among the straw and other people s feet and they all hugged each other in the dark coach as it jolted through the snowy streets to Arden House in Soho Dickie feeling very small and bewildered among all these dangerous happenings found himself suddenly caught by the arm The nurse s hand it was Now she said Master Richard will go take off his fine suit and He did not hear the end for he was pushed out of the room Very discontentedly he found his way to his panelled bed closet and took off the smart velvet and fur which he had worn in his visit to the Tower and put on his every day things You may be sure he made every possible haste to get back to his cousins He wanted to talk over the whole wonderful adventure with them He found them whispering in a corner What is it he asked We re going to be even with old Parrot nose said Edred but you mustn t be in it because we re going away and you ve got to stay here and whatever we decide to do you ll get the blame of it I don t see said Richard why I shouldn t have a hand in what I ve wanted to do these four years He had not known that he had known the tutor for four years but as he said the words he felt that they were true There is a reason said Edred You go to bed Richard Not me said Dickie of Deptford firmly If we tell you said Elfrida explaining affectionately you won t believe us You might at least said Richard Arden catching desperately at the grand manner that seemed to suit these times of ruff and sword and cloak and conspiracy you might at least make the trial Very well I will said Elfrida abruptly No Edred he has a right to hear He s one of us He won t give us away Will you Dickie dear You know I won t Dickie assured her Well then said Elfrida slowly we are You listen hard and believe with both hands and with all your might or you won t be able to believe at all We are not what we seem Edred and I We don t really belong here at all I don t know what s become of the real Elfrida and Edred who belong to this time Haven t we seemed odd to you at all Different I mean from the Edred and Elfrida you ve been used to The remembrance of the stopped clock feeling came strongly on Dickie and he nodded Well that s because we re not them We don t belong here We belong three hundred years later in history Only we ve got a charm because in our time Edred is Lord Arden and there s a white mole who helps us and we can go anywhere in history we like Not quite said Edred No but there are chests of different clothes and whatever clothes we put on we come to that time in history I know it sounds like silly untruths she added rather sadly and I knew you wouldn t believe it but it is true And now we re going back to our times Queen Alexandra you know and King Edward the Seventh and electric light and motors and nineteen oh eight Don t try to believe it if it hurts you Dickie dear I know it s most awfully rum but it s the real true truth Richard said nothing Had never thought it possible but that he was the only one to whom things like this happened You don t believe it said Edred complacently I knew you wouldn t Dickie felt a swimming sensation It was impossible that this wonderful change should happen to any one besides himself This just meant that the whole thing was a dream And he said nothing Never mind said Elfrida in comforting tones don t try to believe it I know you can t Forget it Or pretend we were just kidding you Well it doesn t matter Edred said What can we do to pay out old Parrot nose Then Richard found a voice and words I don t like it he said It s never been like this before It makes it seem not real It s only a dream really I suppose And I d got to believe that it was really real I don t understand a word you re saying said Edred and darting to a corner produced a photographic camera of the kind called Brownie Look here he said you ve never seen anything like this before This comes from the times we belong to Richard knew it well A boy at school had had one And he had borrowed it once And the assistant master had had a larger one of the same kind It was horrible to him this intrusion of the scientific attainments of the ugly times in which he was born into the beautiful times that he had grown to love Oh stow it he said I know now it s all a silly dream But it s not worth while to pretend I don t know a Kodak when I see it That s a Brownie If you ve dreamed about our time said Elfrida Did you ever dream of fire carriages and fire boats and Richard explained that he was not a baby that he knew all about railways and steamboats and the triumphs of civilization And added that Kent made six hundred fifteen against Derbyshire last Thursday Edred and Elfrida began to ask questions Dickie was much too full of his own questionings to answer theirs I shan t tell you anything more he said But I ll help you to get even with old Parrot nose And suggested shovelling the snow off the roof into the room of that dismal tyrant through the skylight conveniently lighting it But Edred wanted that written down about Kent and Derbyshire so that they might see when they got back to their own times whether it was true And Dickie found he had a bit of paper in his doublet on which to write it It was a bill he had had it in his hand when he made the magic moon seed pattern and it had unaccountably come with him It was a bill for three ship s guns and compasses and six flags which mister Beale had bought for him in London for the fitting out of a little ship he had made to order for the small son of the amiable pawnbroker He scribbled on the back of this bill gave it to Edred and then they all went out on the roof and shovelled snow in on to mister Parados and when he came out on the roof very soon and angry they slipped round the chimney stacks and through the trap door and left him up on the roof in the snow and shut the trap door and hasped it 
5152-29465-0000	train-other-500	And then the nurse caught them and Richard was sent to bed But he did not go There was no sleep in that house that night Sleepiness filled it like a thick fog
5152-29465-0001	train-other-500	Dickie put out his rushlight and stayed quiet for a little while but presently it was impossible to stay quiet another moment so very softly and carefully he crept out and hid behind a tall press at the end of the passage
5152-29465-0002	train-other-500	He felt that strange things were happening in the house and that he must know what they were Presently there were voices below voices coming up the stairs
5152-29465-0003	train-other-500	the nurse s voice his cousins and another voice Where had he heard that other voice The stopped clock feeling was thick about him as he realized that this was one of the voices
none	none	 he had heard on that night of the first magic 
5152-29465-0004	train-other-500	the voice that had said He is more yours than mine The light the nurse carried gleamed and disappeared up the second flight of stairs Dickie followed
5152-29465-0005	train-other-500	He had to follow He could not be left out of this the most mysterious of all the happenings that had so wonderfully come to him He saw when he reached the upper landing that the others were by the window
none	none	 and that the window was open A keen wind rushed through it and by the blown candle s light he could see snowflakes whirled into the house through the window s dark star studded square 
5152-29465-0006	train-other-500	There was whispering going on He heard her words Here So Jump
none	none	 And then a little figure 
5152-29465-0007	train-other-500	Edred it must be no Elfrida climbed up on
none	none	 to the window ledge 
5152-29465-0008	train-other-500	And jumped out Out of the third floor window undoubtedly jumped Another followed it that was Edred It is a dream said Dickie to himself
none	none	 but if they ve been made to jump out to punish them for getting even with old Parrot nose or anything I ll jump too He rushed past the nurse past her voice and the other voice that was talking with hers 
5152-29465-0009	train-other-500	made one bound to the window
none	none	 set his knee on it 
5152-29465-0010	train-other-500	stood up and jumped and he heard as his knee touched the icy window sill the strange voice say Another and then he was in the air falling falling
5152-29465-0011	train-other-500	I shall wake when I reach the ground Dickie told himself
none	none	 and then I shall know it s all only a dream a silly dream But he never reached the ground 
5152-29465-0012	train-other-500	He had not fallen a couple of yards before he was caught by something soft as heaped feathers or drifted snow it moved and shifted under him took shape it was a chair no a carriage
none	none	 And there were reins in his hand white reins And a horse No a swan with wide white wings He grasped the reins and guided 
5152-29465-0013	train-other-500	the strange steed to a low swoop that should bring him near the flare of torches in the street outside the great front door And as the swan laid its long neck low in downward flight
none	none	 he saw his cousins in a carriage like his own 
5152-29465-0014	train-other-500	rise into the sky and sail away towards the south Quite without meaning to do it he pulled on the reins the swan rose He pulled again and the carriage stopped at the landing window
5152-29465-0015	train-other-500	Hands dragged him in The old nurse s hands
none	none	 The swan glided away between snow and stars 
5152-29465-0016	train-other-500	and on the landing inside the open window the nurse held him fast in her arms My lamb she said my dear foolish brave lamb Dickie was pulling himself together
5152-29465-0017	train-other-500	If it s a dream he said slowly I ve had enough I want to wake up If it s real real with magic in it you ve got to explain it all to me every bit
5152-29465-0018	train-other-500	I can t go on like this It s not fair Oh tell him and have done said the voice that had begun all the magic
none	none	 and it seemed to him that something small and white slid along the wainscot of the corridor 
5152-29465-0019	train-other-500	and vanished quite suddenly just as a candle flame does when you blow the candle out I will said the nurse Come love I will tell you everything She took him down into a warm curtained room
5152-29465-0020	train-other-500	blew to flame the gray ashes on the open hearth gave him elder wine to drink hot and spiced and kneeling before him rubbing his cold bare feet she told him There are certain children
5152-29465-0021	train-other-500	born now and then it does not often happen
none	none	 but now and then it does 
5152-29465-0022	train-other-500	children who are not bound by time as other people are And if the right bit of magic comes their way those children have the power to go back and forth in time just as other children go back and forth in space
5152-29465-0023	train-other-500	the space of a room a playing field or a garden alley Often children lose this power when they are quite young Sometimes it comes to them gradually so that they hardly know when it begins
5152-29465-0024	train-other-500	and leaves them as gradually like a dream when you wake and stretch yourself Sometimes it comes by the saying of a charm That is how Edred and Elfrida found it They came from the time that you were born in
5152-29465-0025	train-other-500	and they have been living in this time with you and now they have gone back to their own time
none	none	 Didn t you notice any difference in them 
5152-29465-0026	train-other-500	From what they were at Deptford
none	none	 I should think I did said Dickie at least 
5152-29465-0027	train-other-500	it wasn t that I noticed any difference so much as that I felt something queer I couldn t understand it it felt stuffy as if something was going to burst That was because
none	none	 they were not the cousins you knew at Deptford But where have the real cousins I knew at Deptford been then all this time 
5152-29465-0028	train-other-500	while those other kids were here pretending to be them Dickie asked Oh they were somewhere else in Julius Caesar s time to be exact
none	none	 but they don t know it and never will know it 
5152-29465-0029	train-other-500	They haven t the charm To them it will be like a dream that they have forgotten
none	none	 But the swans and the carriages and the voice 
5152-29465-0030	train-other-500	and jumping out of the window Dickie urged The swans were white magic the white Mouldiwarp of Arden did all that
none	none	 Then she told him all about the white Mouldiwarp of Arden 
5152-29465-0031	train-other-500	and how it was the badge of Arden s house its picture being engraved on Tinkler
none	none	 and how it had done all sorts of magic for Edred and Elfrida and would do still more 
5152-29465-0032	train-other-500	Dickie and the nurse sat most of the night talking by the replenished fire for the tale seemed endless Dickie learned that the Edred and Elfrida who belonged to his own times had a father
5152-29465-0033	train-other-500	who was supposed to be dead I am forbidden to tell them said the nurse but thou canst help them and shalt I should like that said Dickie but can t I see the white Mouldiwarp
5152-29465-0034	train-other-500	I dare not even I dare not call it again to night the nurse owned But maybe I will teach thee a little spell to bring it on another day It is an angry little beast at times but kindly and hard working
none	none	 Then Dickie told her about the beginnings of the magic and how he had heard two voices one of them the Mouldiwarp s There are three white Mouldiwarps friends 
5152-29465-0035	train-other-500	to thy house she told him the Mouldiwarp who is the badge and the Mouldiwarp who is the crest and the Great Mouldiwarp
none	none	 who sits on the green and white checkered field of the Ardens shield of arms It was the first two 
5152-29465-0036	train-other-500	who talked of thee And how can I find my cousins
none	none	 and help them to find their father 
5152-29465-0037	train-other-500	Lay out the moon seeds and the other charms and wish to be where they are going Then thou canst speak with them Wish to be there a week before they come
5152-29465-0038	train-other-500	that thou mayst know the place and the folk Now Dickie asked
none	none	 but not eagerly for he was very tired Not now my lamb she said and so at last Dickie went to bed his weary brain full of new things more dream like than any dreams he had ever had After this 
5152-29465-0039	train-other-500	he talked with the nurse every day and learned more and more wonders of which there is no time now for me to tell you But they are all written in the book of The House of Arden In that book too
5152-29465-0040	train-other-500	it is written how Dickie went back from the First James s time to the time
none	none	 of the Eighth Henry 
5152-29465-0041	train-other-500	and took part in the merry country life of those days and there found the old nurse herself Edred and Elfrida and helped them to recover their father from a far country
none	none	 There also you may read of the marvels of the white clock 
5152-29465-0042	train-other-500	and the cliff that none could climb and the children who were white cats and the Mouldiwarp who became as big as a polar bear with other wonders And when all this was over
5152-29465-0043	train-other-500	Elfrida and Edred wanted Dickie to come back with them to their own time But he would not He went back instead to the time he loved when James the First was King And when he woke
5152-29465-0044	train-other-500	in the little panelled room it seemed to him that all this was only dreams and fancies
none	none	 In the course of this adventure he met the white Mouldiwarp and it was just a white mole 
5152-29465-0045	train-other-500	very funny and rather self important The second Mouldiwarp he had not yet met I have told you all these things very shortly because they were so dream like to Dickie
none	none	 and not at all real like the double life he had been leading 
5152-29465-0046	train-other-500	That always happens said the nurse if you stumble into some one else s magic it never feels real But if you bring them into yours it s quite another pair of sleeves
none	none	 Those children can t get any more magic of their own now but you could take them into yours Only for that you d have to meet them in your own time that you were born in and you ll have to wait till it s summer 
5152-29465-0047	train-other-500	because that s where they are now They re seven months ahead of you in your own time But said Dickie very much bewildered as I am myself and as I am afraid you too must be
5152-29465-0048	train-other-500	if they re seven months ahead won t they always be seven months ahead Odds bodikins said the nurse impatiently how often am I to tell you that there s no such thing as time But there s seasons
none	none	 and the season they came out of was summer 
5152-29465-0049	train-other-500	and the season you ll go back to tis autumn so you must live the seven months in their time and then it ll be summer and you ll meet them And what about Lord Arden in the Tower
5152-29465-0050	train-other-500	Will he be beheaded for treason Dickie asked Oh that s part of their magic It isn t in your magic at all Lord Arden will be safe enough And now my lamb I ve more to tell thee
5152-29465-0051	train-other-500	But come into thy panelled chamber where thy tutor cannot eavesdrop and betray us and have thee given over to him wholly and me burned for a witch These terrible words kept Dickie silent
5152-29465-0052	train-other-500	till he and the nurse were safe in his room and then he said Come with me to my time nurse they don t burn people for witches there No said the nurse
5152-29465-0053	train-other-500	but they let them live such lives in their ugly towns that my life here with all its risks is far better worth living Thou knowest how folk live in Deptford in thy time how all the green trees are gone
5152-29465-0054	train-other-500	and good work is gone and people do bad work for just so much as will keep together their worn bodies and desolate souls And sometimes they starve to death And they won t burn me
none	none	 if thou lieutenant only keep a still tongue 
5152-29465-0055	train-other-500	Now listen She sat down on the edge of the bed and Dickie cuddled up against her stiff bodice Edred and Elfrida first went into the past to look for treasure
5152-29465-0056	train-other-500	It is a treasure buried in Arden Castle by the sea which is their home They want the treasure to restore the splendor of the old Castle
none	none	 which in your time is fallen into ruin and decay 
5152-29465-0057	train-other-500	and to mend the houses of the tenants and to do good to the poor and needy But you know that now they have used their magic to get back their father
none	none	 and can no longer use it to look for treasure 
5152-29465-0058	train-other-500	But your magic will hold And if you lay out your moon seeds round them in the old shape and stand with them in the midst holding your Tinkler and your white seal you will all go
5152-29465-0059	train-other-500	whithersoever you choose
none	none	 I shall choose to go straight to the treasure of course said practical Dickie swinging his feet in their rosetted shoes 
5152-29465-0060	train-other-500	That thou canst not Thou canst only choose
none	none	 some year in the past any year 
5152-29465-0061	train-other-500	go into it and then seek for the treasure there and then I ll do it Dickie said and then
none	none	 I may come back to you mayn t I If thou rt not needed elsewhere 
5152-29465-0062	train-other-500	The Ardens stay where duty binds them and go where duty calls
none	none	 But I m not an Arden there said Dickie sadly 
5152-29465-0063	train-other-500	Thou rt Richard Arden there as here she said thy grandfather s name got changed by breathing hard on it from Arden to Harden and that again to Harding
5152-29465-0064	train-other-500	Thus names are changed ever and again And Dickie of Deptford
none	none	 has the honor of the house of Arden to uphold there as here then as now I shall call myself Arden when I go back said Dickie proudly Not yet she said wait If you say so said Dickie rather discontentedly 
5152-29465-0065	train-other-500	The time is not ripe for thee to take up all thine honors there she said And now dear lamb since thy tutor is imagining unkind things in his heart for thee go quickly
5152-29465-0066	train-other-500	Set out thy moon seeds and when thou hearest the voices say I would see both Mouldiwarps and thou shalt see them both Thank you said Dickie I do want to see them both
5152-29465-0067	train-other-500	See them he did
none	none	 in a blue gray mist in which he could feel nothing solid 
5152-29465-0068	train-other-500	not even the ground under his feet or the touch of his clenched fingers against his palms They were very white the Mouldiwarps outlined distinctly against the gray blueness
5152-29465-0069	train-other-500	and the Mouldiwarp he had seen in that wonderful adventure in the far country smiled as well as a mole can and said Thou rt a fair sprig of de old tree Muster Dickie so e be
5152-29465-0070	train-other-500	in the thick speech of the peasant people round about Talbot house where
none	none	 Dickie had once been a little burglar He is indeed a worthy scion of the great house we serve said the other Mouldiwarp with precise and gentle utterance As Mouldierwarp to the Ardens I can but own that I am proud of him The Mouldierwarp had as well as a gentle voice a finer nose than the Mouldiwarp his fur was more even and his claws sharper Eh you be a gentleman you be 
5152-29465-0071	train-other-500	said the Mouldiwarp so s e so there s two of ye sure enough It was very odd to see and hear these white moles talking like real people
5152-29465-0072	train-other-500	and looking like figures on a magic lantern screen But Dickie did not enjoy it as much as perhaps you or I would have done It was not his pet kind of magic
5152-29465-0073	train-other-500	He liked the good straightforward old fashioned kind of magic that he was accustomed to the kind that just took you out of one life into another life and made both lives as real one as the other Still
5152-29465-0074	train-other-500	one must always be polite So he said
none	none	 I am very glad to see you both 
5152-29465-0075	train-other-500	There s purty manners the Mouldiwarp said The pleasure is ours said the Mouldierwarp instantly Dickie could not help seeing that both these old creatures were extremely pleased with him
5152-29465-0076	train-other-500	When shall I see the other Mouldiwarp he asked to keep up the conversation the one on our shield of arms You mean the Mouldiestwarp said the Mouldier
5152-29465-0077	train-other-500	as I will now call him for short
none	none	 you will not see him till the end of the magic 
5152-29465-0078	train-other-500	He is very great I work the magic of space my brother here works the magic of time and the Great Mouldiestwarp controls us and many things beside You must only call on him
5152-29465-0079	train-other-500	when you wish to end our magics and to work a magic greater than ours What could be greater Dickie asked and both the creatures looked very pleased
5152-29465-0080	train-other-500	He is a worthier Arden than those little black and white chits of thine
none	none	 the Mouldier said to the Mouldy 
5152-29465-0081	train-other-500	which is what to save time we will now call the Mouldiwarp
none	none	 An so should be 
5152-29465-0082	train-other-500	an so should be said the Mouldy shortly All s for the best and the end s to come Where d ye want to go my lord I m not my lord
none	none	 I m only Richard Arden said Dickie 
5152-29465-0083	train-other-500	and I want to go back to mister Beale and stay with him for seven months and then to find my cousins Back thou goes then
none	none	 said the Mouldy 
5152-29465-0084	train-other-500	that part s easy And for the second half of thy wish no magic is needed but the magic of steadfast heart and the patient purpose and these thou hast
5152-29465-0085	train-other-500	without any helping or giving of ours said the courtly Mouldierwarp They waved their white paws on the gray blue curtain of mist and behold they were not there any more
none	none	 and the blue gray mist was only the night s darkness 
5152-29465-0086	train-other-500	turning to dawn and Dickie was able again to feel solid things the floor under him his hand on the sharp edge of the armchair and the soft breathing comfortable weight of True
5152-29465-0087	train-other-500	asleep against his knee He moved the dog awoke and Dickie felt its soft nose nuzzled into his hand And now for seven months work
none	none	 and not one good dream 
5152-29465-0088	train-other-500	said Dickie got up put Tinkler and the seal and the moon seeds into a very safe place and crept back to bed He felt rather heroic
5152-29465-0089	train-other-500	He did not want the treasure It was not for him He was going to help Edred and Elfrida to get it He did not want the life at Lavender Terrace
none	none	 He was going to help mister Beale to live it 
5152-29465-0090	train-other-500	So let him feel a little bit of a hero
none	none	 since that was what indeed he was even though of course all right minded children are modest and humble and fully sensible of their own intense unimportance no matter how heroically they may happen to be behaving CHAPTER VIII GOING HOME IN Deptford the seven months had almost gone by Dickie had worked much learned much and earned much mister Beale a figure of cleanly habit and increasing steadiness seemed like a plant growing quickly towards the sun of respectability or a lighthouse rising bright and important out of a swirling sea of dogs For the dog trade prospered exceedingly and mister Beale had grown knowing in thoroughbreeds and the prize bench had learned all about distemper and doggy fits and when you should give an ailing dog sal volatile and when you should merely give it less to eat And the money in the bank grew till it so to speak burst the bank book and had to be allowed to overflow into a vast sea called Consols The dogs also grew in numbers as well as in size and the neighbors who had borne a good deal very patiently began as mister Beale said to pass remarks It ain t so much the little uns they jib at said mister Beale taking his pipe out of his mouth and stretching his legs in the back yard though to my mind they yaps far more aggravatin It s the cocker spannel and the Great Danes upsets them The cocker spannel has got rather a persevering bark said Dickie looking up at the creeping jenny in the window boxes No flowers would grow in the garden now trampled hard by the india rubber soled feet of many dogs but Dickie did his best with window boxes and every window was underlined by a bright dash of color creeping jenny Brompton stocks stonecrop and late tulips and all bought from the barrows in the High Street made a brave show I don t say as they re actin unneighborly in talking about the pleece so long as they don t do no more than talk said Beale with studied fairness and moderation What I do say is I wish we ad more elbow room for em An as for exercisin of em all every day like the books say well ow s one pair of ands to do it let alone legs and you in another line of business and not able to give yer time to em I wish we had a bigger place too said Dickie we could afford one now Not but what I should be sorry to leave the old place too We ve ad some good times here in our time farver ain t us He sighed with the air of an old man looking back on the long ago days of youth You lay to it we as said mister Beale but this ere back yard it ain t a place where dogs can what you call exercise not to call it exercise Now is it Well then said Dickie let s get a move on us Ah said mister Beale laying his pipe on his knee now you re talkin Get a move on us That s what I oped you d say Member what I says to you in the winter time that night mister Fuller looked in for his bit o rent about me gettin of the fidgets in my legs An I says Why not take to the road a bit now and again an you says We ll see about that come summer And ere is come summer What if we was to take the road a bit mate where there s room to stretch a chap s legs without kickin a dog or knockin the crockery over There s the ole pram up stairs in the back room as lively as ever she was only wants a little of paint to be fit for a dook she does An ere s me an ere s you an ere s the pick of the dogs Think of it matey the bed with the green curtains and the good smell of the herrings you toasts yerself and the fire you makes outer sticks and the little starses a comin out and a winkin at you and all so quiet a smokin yer pipe till it falls outer yer mouth with sleepiness and no fear o settin the counterpin afire What you say matey eh Dickie looked lovingly at the smart back of the little house its crisp white muslin blinds its glimpses of neat curtains its flowers and then another picture came to him he saw the misty last light fainting beyond the great shoulders of the downs and the little starses shining so bright and new through the branches of fir trees that interlaced above a sweet scented bed of soft fallen brown pine needles What say mate mister Beale repeated and Dickie answered Soon as ever you like s what I say And what I say is the sooner the better Having made up his mind to go mister Beale at once found a dozen reasons why he could not leave home and all the reasons were four footed and wagged loving tails at him He was anxious in fact about the dogs Could he really trust Amelia Dunno oo you can trust then said Amelia tossing a still handsome head Anybody ud think the dogs was babbies to hear you So they are to me as precious as anyway Look here you just come and live ere Melia see An we ll give yer five bob a week An the nipper e shall write it all down in lead pencil on a bit o paper for you what they re to ave to eat an about their physic and which of em s to have what This took some time to settle and some more time to write down And then when the lick of paint was nearly dry on the perambulator and all their shirts and socks were washed and mended and lying on the kitchen window ledge ready for packing what did mister Beale do but go out one morning and come back with a perfectly strange dachshund An I can t go and leave the little beast till he knows imself a bit in is noo place said mister Beale an ave im boltin off gracious knows where and being pinched or carted off to the Dogs Home or that Can I now The new dog was very long very brown very friendly and charming When it had had its supper it wagged its tail turned a clear and gentle eye on Dickie and without any warning stood on its head Well said mister Beale if there ain t money in that beast A trick dog e is E s wuth wot I give for im so e is Knows more tricks than that ere I ll be bound He did He was a singularly well educated dog Next morning mister Beale coming down stairs was just in time to bang the front door in the face of Amelia coming in pail laden from doing the steps and this to prevent the flight of the new dog The door of one of the dog rooms was open and a fringe of inquisitive dogs ornamented the passage What you open that door at all for mister Beale asked Amelia I didn t she said and stuck to it That afternoon Beale smoking in the garden got up as he often did to look through the window at the dogs He gazed a moment muttered something and made one jump to the back door It was closed Amelia was giving the scullery floor a thorough scrub over and had fastened the door to avoid having it opened with suddenness against her steaming pail or her crouching form But mister Beale got in at the back door and out at the front just in time to see the dachshund disappearing at full speed like a bit of brown toffee stick as he said round the end of the street They never saw that dog again Trained to it mister Beale used to say sadly whenever he told the story trained to it from a pup you may lay your life I see im as plain as I see you E listens an e looks and e doesn t ear nor see nobody An e ups on his ind legs and turns the andle with is little twisty front pawses clever as a monkey and hout e goes like a harrow in a bow Trained to it ye see I bet his master wot taught im that s sold him time and again makin a good figure every time for e was a andsome dawg as ever I see Trained the dawg to open the door and bunk ome See Clever I call it It s a mean trick said Dickie when Beale told him of the loss of the dog that s what I call it I m sorry you ve lost the dog I ain t exactly pleased myself said Beale but no use crying over broken glass It s the cleverness I think of most he said admiringly Now I d never a thought of a thing like that myself not if I d lived to a hundred so I wouldn t You might ave he told Dickie flatteringly but I wouldn t myself We don t need to said Dickie hastily We earns our livings We don t need to cheat to get our livings No no dear boy said mister Beale more hastily still course we don t That s just what I m a saying ain t it We shouldn t never ave thought o that No need to as you say The cleverness of it This admiration of the cleverness by which he himself had been cheated set Dickie thinking He said very gently and quietly after a little pause This ere walking tower of ours We pays our own way No cadging I should ope you know me better than that said Beale virtuously not a patter have I done since I done the Rally and started in the dog line Nor yet no dealings with that redheaded chap what I never see Now is it likely Beale asked reproachfully I should ope we re a cut above a low chap like wot e is The pram s dry as a bone and shiny as yer at and we ll start the first thing in the morning And in the early morning which is fresh and sweet even in Deptford they bade farewell to Amelia and the dogs and set out Amelia watched them down the street and waved a farewell as they turned the corner It ll be a bit lonesome she said One thing I shan t be burgled with all them dogs in the house The voices of the dogs as she went in and shut the door seemed to assure her that she would not even be so very lonely And now they were really on the road And they were going to Arden to that place by the sea where Dickie s uncle in the other life had a castle and where Dickie was to meet his cousins after his seven months of waiting You may think that Dickie would be very excited by the thought of meeting in this workaday nowadays world the children with whom he had had such wonderful adventures in the other world the dream world too excited perhaps to feel really interested in the little every day happenings of the road But this was not so The present was after all the real thing The dreams could wait The knowledge that they were there waiting made all the ordinary things more beautiful and more interesting The feel of the soft dust underfoot the bright dewy grass and clover by the wayside the lessening of houses and the growing wideness of field and pasture all contented and delighted Dickie He felt to the full all the joy that mister Beale felt in oofing it and when as the sun was sinking they overtook a bent slow going figure it was with a thrill of real pleasure that Dickie recognized the woman who had given him the blue ribbon for True True himself now grown large and thick of coat seemed to recognize a friend gambolled round her dreadful boots sniffed at her withered hand Give her a lift with her basket shall us Dickie whispered to mister Beale and climbed out of the perambulator I can make shift to do this last piece So the three went on together in friendly silence As they neared Orpington the woman said Our road parts here and thank you kindly A kindness is never wasted so they say That ain t nothing said Beale besides there s the blue ribbon That the dog the woman asked Same ole dawg said Beale with pride A pretty beast she said Well so long She looked back to smile and nod to them when she had taken her basket and the turning to the right and Dickie suddenly stiffened all over as a pointer does when it sees a partridge I say he cried you re the nurse I ve nursed a many in my time she called back But in the dream you know Dreams is queer things said the woman And she added least said is soonest mended But said Dickie Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut s a good motto said she nodded again and turned resolutely away Not very civil I don t think said Beale considerin Oh she s all right said Dickie wondering very much and very anxious that Beale should not wonder May I ride in the pram farver My foot s a bit blistered I think We ain t done so much walkin lately ave us Ain t tired in yourself are you mister Beale asked cause there s a place called Chevering Park pretty as a picture I thought we might lay out there I m a bit ot in the oof meself but I can stick it if you can Dickie could and when they made their evening camp in a deep gully soft with beech leaves and he looked out over the ridge cautiously because of keepers at the smoothness of a mighty slope green gray in the dusk where rabbits frisked and played he was glad that he had not yielded to his tiredness and stopped to rest the night anywhere else Chevering Park is a very beautiful place I would have you to know And the travellers were lucky The dogs were good and quiet and no keeper disturbed their rest or their masters Dickie slept with True in his arms and it was like a draught of soft magic elixir to lie once more in the still cool night and look up at the stars through the trees Can t think why they ever invented houses he said and then he fell asleep By short stages enjoying every step of every day s journey they went slowly and at their ease through the garden land of Kent Dickie loved every minute of it every leaf in the hedge every blade of grass by the roadside And most of all he loved the quiet nights when he fell asleep under the stars with True in his arms It was all good all And it was worth waiting and working for seven long months to feel the thrill that Dickie felt when Beale as they topped a ridge of the great South Downs said suddenly There s the sea and a dozen yards further on There s Arden Castle There it lay gray and green with its old stones and ivy the same Castle which Dickie had seen on the day when they lay among the furze bushes and waited to burgle Talbot Court There were red roofs at one side of the Castle where a house had been built among the ruins As they drew nearer and looked down at Arden Castle Dickie saw two little figures in its green courtyard and wondered whether they could possibly be Edred and Elfrida the little cousins whom he had met in King James the First s time and who the nurse said really belonged to the times of King Edward the Seventh or Nowadays just as he did himself It seemed as though it could hardly be true but if it were true how splendid What games he and they could have And what a play place it was that spread out before him green and glorious with the sea on one side and the downs on the other and in the middle the ruins of Arden Castle But as they went on through the furze bushes Dickie perceived that mister Beale was growing more and more silent and uneasy What s up Dickie asked at last Out with it farver It ain t nothing said mister Beale You ain t afraid those Talbots will know you again Not much I ain t They never see my face and I adn t a beard that time like what I ve got now Well then said Dickie Well if you must ave it said Beale we re a gettin very near my ole dad s place and I can t make me mind up I thought we was settled we d go to see im I dunno If e s under the daisies I shan t like it I tell you straight I shan t like it But we re a long lived stock p raps e s all right I dunno Shall I go up by myself to where he lives and see if he s all right Not much said mister Beale if I goes I goes and if I stays away I stays away It s just the not being able to make me mind up If he s there said Dickie don t you think you ought to go just on the chance of him being there and wanting you If you come to oughts said Beale I oughter gone ome any time this twenty year Only I ain t See Well said Dickie it s your lookout I know what I should do if it was me Remembrance showed him the father who had leaned on his shoulder as they walked about the winding walks of the pleasant garden in old Deptford the father who had given him the little horse and insisted that his twenty gold pieces should be spent as he chose I dunno said Beale What you think Eh matey I think let s said Dickie I lay if he s alive it ud be as good as three Sundays in the week to him to see you You was his little boy once wasn t you Ay said Beale he was wagoner s mate to one of Lord Arden s men E used to ride me on the big cart horses E was a fine set up chap To hear the name of Arden on Beale s lips gave Dickie a very odd half pleasant half frightened feeling It seemed to bring certain things very near Let s he said again All right said Beale only if it all goes wrong it ain t my fault an there used to be a foot path a bit further on You cut through the copse and cater across the eleven acre medder and bear along to the left by the hedge an it brings you out under Arden Knoll where my old man s place is So they cut and catered and bore along and came out under Arden Knoll and there was a cottage with a very neat garden full of gay flowers and a brick pathway leading from the wooden gate to the front door And by the front door sat an old man in a Windsor chair with a brown spaniel at his feet and a bird in a wicker cage above his head and he was nodding for it was a hot day and he was an old man and tired Swelp me I can t do it whispered Beale I ll walk on a bit You just arst for a drink and sort of see ow the land lays It might turn im up seeing me so sudden Good old dad He walked quickly on and Dickie was left standing by the gate Then the brown spaniel became aware of True and barked and the old man said Down Trusty in his sleep and then woke up His clear old eyes set in many wrinkles turned full on Dickie by the gate May I have a drink of water Dickie asked Come in said the old man And Dickie lifted the latch of smooth brown sun warmed iron and went up the brick path as the old man slowly turned himself about in the chair Yonder s the well he said draw up a bucket if thy leg ll let thee poor little chap I draws water with my arms not my legs said Dickie cheerfully There s a blue mug in the wash house window ledge said the old man Fetch me a drop when you ve had your drink my lad Of course Dickie s manners were too good for him to drink first He drew up the dripping oaken bucket from the cool darkness of the well fetched the mug and offered it brimming to the old man Then he drank and looked at the garden ablaze with flowers blush roses and damask roses and sweet williams and candytuft white lilies and yellow lilies pansies larkspur poppies bergamot and sage It was just like a play at the Greenwich Theatre Dickie thought He had seen a scene just like that where the old man sat in the sun and the Prodigal returned Dickie would not have been surprised to see Beale run up the brick path and throw himself on his knees exclaiming Father it is I your erring but repentant son Can you forgive me If a lifetime of repentance can atone and so on If Dickie had been Beale he would certainly have made the speech beginning Father it is I But as he was only Dickie he said Your name s Beale ain t it It might be old Beale allowed I seen your son in London E told me about yer garden I should a thought e d a forgot the garden same as e s forgot me said the old man E ain t forgot you not e said Dickie e s come to see you an e s waiting outside now to know if you d like to see im Then e oughter know better said the old man and shouted in a thin high voice Jim Jim come along in this minute Even then Beale didn t act a bit like the prodigal in the play He just unlatched the gate without looking at it his hand had not forgotten the way of it for all it was so long since he had passed through that gate And he walked slowly and heavily up the path and said Hullo dad how goes it And the old man looked at him with his eyes half shut and said Why it is James so it is as if he had expected it to be some one quite different And they shook hands and then Beale said The garden s looking well And the old man owned that the garden ud do all right if it wasn t for the snails That was all Dickie heard for he thought it polite to go away Of course they could not be really affectionate with a stranger about So he shouted from the gate something about back presently and went off along the cart track towards Arden Castle and looked at it quite closely It was the most beautiful and interesting thing he had ever seen But he did not see the children When he went back the old man was cooking steak over the kitchen fire and Beale was at the sink straining summer cabbage in a colander as though he had lived there all his life and never anywhere else He was in his shirt sleeves too and his coat and hat hung behind the back door So then they had dinner when the old man had set down the frying pan expressly to shake hands with Dickie saying So this is the lad you told me about Yes yes It was a very nice dinner with cold gooseberry pastry as well as the steak and vegetables The kitchen was pleasant and cozy though rather dark on account of the white climbing rose that grew round the window After dinner the men sat in the sun and smoked and Dickie occupied himself in teaching the spaniel and True that neither of them was a dog who deserved to be growled at Dickie had just thrown back his head in a laugh at True s sulky face and stiffly planted paws when he felt the old man s dry wrinkled hand under his chin Let s ave a look at you he said and peered closely at the child Where d you get that face eh What did you say your name was Harding s his name said Beale Dickie Harding Dickie Arden I should a said if you d asked me said the old man Seems to me it s a reg lar Arden face he s got But my eyes ain t so good as wot they was What d you say to stopping along of me a bit my boy There s room in the cottage for all five of us My son James here tells me you ve been s good as a son to him I d love it said Dickie So that was settled There were two bedrooms for Beale and his father and Dickie slept in a narrow whitewashed slip of a room that had once been a larder The brown spaniel and True slept on the rag hearth rug in the kitchen And everything was as cozy as cozy could be We can send for any of the dawgs any minute if we feel we can t stick it without em said Beale smoking his pipe in the front garden You mean to stay a long time then said Dickie I dunno You see I was born and bred ere The air tastes good don t it An the water s good Didn t you notice the tea tasted quite different from what it does anywhere else That s the soft water that is An the old chap Yes and there s one or two other things yes I reckon us ll stop on ere a bit And Dickie was very glad For now he was near Arden Castle and could see it any time that he chose to walk a couple of hundred yards and look down And presently he would see Edred and Elfrida Would they know him That was the question Would they remember that he and they had been cousins and friends when James the First was King CHAPTER IX KIDNAPPED AND now New Cross seemed to go backwards and very far away its dirty streets its sordid shifts its crowds of anxious unhappy people who never had quite enough of anything and Dickie s home was in a pleasant cottage from whose windows you could see great green rolling downs and the smooth silver and blue of the sea and from whose door you stepped not on to filthy pavements but on to a neat brick path leading between beds glowing with flowers Also he was near Arden the goal of seven months effort Now he would see Edred and Elfrida again and help them to find the hidden treasure as he had once helped them to find their father This joyful thought put the crown on his happiness But he presently perceived that though he was so close to Arden Castle he did not seem to be much nearer to the Arden children It is not an easy thing to walk into the courtyard of a ruined castle and ring the bell of a strange house and ask for people whom you have only met in dreams or as good as dreams And I don t know how Dickie would have managed if Destiny had not kindly come to his help and arranged that turning a corner in the lane which leads to the village he should come face to face with Edred and Elfrida Arden And they looked exactly like the Edred and Elfrida whom he had played with and quarrelled with in the dream He halted leaning on his crutch for them to come up and speak to him They came on looking hard at him the severe might have called it staring looked came up to him and passed by without a word But he saw them talking eagerly to each other Dickie was left in the lane looking after them It was a miserable moment But quite quickly he roused himself They were talking to each other eagerly and once Elfrida half looked round Perhaps it was his shabby clothes that made them not so sure whether he was the Dickie they had known If they did not know him it should not be his fault He balanced himself on one foot beat with his crutch on the ground and shouted Hi and Hullo as loud as he could The other children turned hesitated and came back What is it the little girl called out have you hurt yourself And she came up to him and looked at him with kind eyes No said Dickie but I wanted to ask you something The other two looked at him and at each other and the boy said Righto You re from the Castle aren t you he said I was wondering whether you d let me go down and have a look at it Of course said the girl Come on Wait a minute said Dickie nerving himself to the test If they didn t remember him they d think he was mad and never show him the Castle Never mind Now for it Did you ever have a tutor called mister Parados he asked And again the others looked at him and at each other Parrot nose for short Dickie hastened to add and did you ever shovel snow on to his head and then ride away in a carriage drawn by swans It is you cried Elfrida and hugged him Edred it is Dickie We were saying could it be you Oh Dickie darling how did you hurt your foot Dickie flushed My foot s always been like that he said in Nowadays time When we met in the magic times I was like everybody else wasn t I Elfrida hugged him again and said no more about the foot Instead she said Oh how ripping it is to really and truly find you here We thought you couldn t be real because we wrote a letter to you at the address it said on that bill you gave us And the letter came back with not known outside What address was it Dickie asked Laurie Grove New Cross Edred told him Oh that was just an address mister Beale made up to look grand with said Dickie I remember his telling me about it He s the man I live with I call him father because he s been kind to me But my own daddy s dead Let s go up on the downs said Elfrida and sit down and you tell us all about everything from the very beginning So they went up and sat among the furze bushes and Dickie told them all his story just as much of it as I have told to you And it took a long time And then they reminded each other how they had met in the magic or dream world and how Dickie had helped them to save their father which he did do only I have not had time to tell you about it but it is all written in The House of Arden But our magic is all over now said Edred sadly We had to give up ever having any more magic so as to get father back And now we shall never find the treasure or be able to buy back the old lands and restore the Castle and bring the water back to the moat and build nice dry warm cozy cottages for the tenants But we ve got father Well but look here said Dickie We got my magic all right and old nurse said I could work it for you and that s really what I ve come for so that we can look for the treasure together That s awfully jolly of you said Elfrida What is your magic Edred asked and Dickie pulled out Tinkler and the white seal and the moon seeds and laid them on the turf and explained And in the middle of the explanation a shadow fell on the children and the Tinkler and the moon seeds and the seal and there was a big handsome gentleman looking down at them and saying Introduce your friend Edred Oh Dickie this is my father cried Edred scrambling up And Dickie added very quickly My name s Dick Harding It took longer for Dickie to get up because of the crutch and Lord Arden reached his hand down to help him He must have been a little surprised when the crippled child in the shabby clothes stood up and instead of touching his forehead as poor children are taught to do held out his hand and said How do you do Lord Arden I am very well I thank you said Lord Arden And where did you spring from You are not a native of these parts I think No but my adopted father is said Dickie and I came from London with him to see his father who is old mister Beale and we are staying at his cottage Lord Arden sat down beside them on the turf and asked Dickie a good many questions about where he was born and who he had lived with and what he had seen and done and been Dickie answered honestly and straightforwardly Only of course he did not tell about the magic or say that in that magic world he and Lord Arden s children were friends and cousins And all the time they were talking Lord Arden s eyes were fixed on his face except when they wandered to Tinkler and the white seal Once he picked these up and looked at the crest on them Where did you get these he asked Dickie told And then Lord Arden handed the seal and Tinkler to him and went on with his questions At last Elfrida put her arms round her father s neck and whispered I know it s not manners but Dickie won t mind she said before the whispering began Yes certainly said Lord Arden when the whispering was over it s tea time Dickie you ll come home to tea with us won t you I must tell mister Beale said Dickie he ll be anxious if I don t Shall I hurt you if I put you on my back Lord Arden asked and next minute he was carrying Dickie down the slope towards Arden Castle while Edred went back to Beale s cottage to say where Dickie was When Edred got back to Arden Castle tea was ready in the parlor and Dickie was resting in a comfortable chair Isn t old Beale a funny old man said Edred He said Arden Castle was the right place for Dickie with a face like that What could he have meant What are you doing that for he added in injured tones for Elfrida had kicked his hand under the table Before tea was over there was a sound of horses hoofs and carriage wheels in the courtyard And the maid servant opened the parlor door and said Lady Talbot Though he remembered well enough how kind she had been to him Dickie wished he could creep under the table It was too hard she must recognize him And now Edred and Elfrida and Lord Arden who was so kind and jolly they would all know that he had once been a burglar and that she had wanted to adopt him and that he had been ungrateful and had run away He trembled all over It was too hard Lady Talbot shook hands with the others and then turned to him And who is your little friend she asked Edred and in the same breath cried out Why it s my little runaway Dickie only said I wasn t ungrateful I wasn t I had to go But his eyes implored And Lady Talbot Dickie will always love her for that understood Not a word about burglars did she say only I wanted to adopt Dickie once Lord Arden but he would not stay I had to get back to father said Dickie Well at any rate it s pleasant to see each other again she said I always hoped we should some day No sugar thank you Elfrida and then sat down and had tea and was as jolly as possible The only thing which made Dickie at all uncomfortable was when she turned suddenly to the master of the house and said Doesn t he remind you of any one Lord Arden And Lord Arden said Perhaps he does with that sort of look that people have when they mean Not before the children I d rather talk about it afterwards if you don t mind Then the three were sent out to play and Dickie was shown the castle ruins while Lord Arden and Lady Talbot walked up and down on the daisied grass and talked for a long time Dickie knew they were talking about him but he did not mind He had that feeling you sometimes have about grown up people that they really do understand and are to be trusted You ll be too fine presently to speak to the likes of us you nipper said Beale when a smart little pony cart had brought Dickie back to the cottage You an your grand friends Lord Arden indeed They was as jolly as jolly said Dickie nobody weren t never kinder to me nor what Lord Arden was an Lady Talbot too without it was you farver Ah said Beale to the old man e knows how to get round his old father don t e What does he want to talk that way for the old man asked E can talk like a little gentleman all right cause we eard im Oh that s the way we talks up London way said Dickie I learned to talk fine out o books mister Beale said nothing but that night he actually read for nearly ten minutes in a bound volume of the Wesleyan Magazine And he was asleep over the same entertaining work when Lord Arden came the next afternoon You will be able to guess what he came about And Dickie had a sort of feeling that perhaps Lord Arden might have seen by his face as old Beale had that he was an Arden So neither he nor you will be much surprised The person to be really surprised was mister Beale You might a knocked me down with a pickaxe said Beale later so help me three men and a boy you might It s a rum go My lord e says there s some woman been writing letters to im this long time saying she d got old of is long lost nephew or cousin or something and a wanting to get money out of him though what for goodness knows An e says you re a Arden by rights you nipper you an e wants to take you and bring you up along of his kids so there s an end of you and me Dickie old boy I didn t understand more than arf of wot e was saying But I tumbled to that much It s all up with you and me and Amelia and the dogs and the little ome You re a goin to be a gentleman you are an I ll have to take to the road by meself and be a poor beast of a cadger again That s what it ll come to I know Don t you put yourself about said Dickie calmly I ain t a goin to leave yer Didn t Lady Talbot ask me to be her boy and didn t I cut straight back to you I ll play along o them kids if Lord Arden ll let me But I ain t a goin to leave you not yet I ain t So don t you go snivelling afore any one s urt yer farver See But that was before Lord Arden had his second talk with mister Beale After that it was Look ere you nipper I ain t a goin to stand in your light You re goin up in the world says you Well you ain t the only one Lord Arden s bought father s cottage an e s goin to build on to it and I m to ave all the dawgs down ere and sell em through the papers like And you ll come an ave a look at us sometimes And what about Amelia said Dickie and the little ones Well I did think said Beale rubbing his nose thoughtfully of asking Melia to come down ere along o the dawgs Seems a pity to separate em somehow It was Lord Arden put it into my ed You oughter be married you ought e says to me pleasant like man to man ain t there any young woman I could give a trifle to to set you and her up in housekeeping So then I casts about and I thinks of Melia As well er as anybody and she s used to the dawgs And the trifle s an hundred pounds That s all That s all So I m sending to her by this post and it s an awful toss up getting married but Melia ain t like a stranger and it couldn t ever be the same with us two and nipper after all this set out What you say I don t know what Dickie said what he felt was something like this I have tried to stick to Beale and help him along and I did come back from the other old long ago world to help him and I have been sticking to things I didn t like so as to help him and get him settled He was my bit of work and now some one else comes along and takes my work out of my hands and finishes it And here s Beale provided for and settled And I meant to provide for him myself And I don t like it That was what he felt at first But afterwards he had to own that it was a jolly lucky thing for Beale And for himself too He found that to be at Arden Castle with Edred and Elfrida all day at play and at lessons was almost as good as being with them in the beautiful old dream life All the things that he had hated in this modern life when he was Dickie of Deptford ceased to trouble him now that he was Richard Arden For the difference between being rich and poor is as great as the difference between being warm and cold After that first day a sort of shyness came over the three children and they spoke no more of the strange adventures they had had together but just played at all the ordinary every day games till they almost forgot that there was any magic had ever been any The fact was the life they were leading was so happy in itself that they needed no magic to make them contented It was not till after the wedding of Melia and mister Beale that Dickie remembered that to find the Arden Treasure for his cousins had been one of his reasons for coming back to this the Nowadays world I wish I had time to tell you about the wedding I could write a whole book about it How Amelia came down from London and was married in Arden Church How she wore a white dress and a large hat with a wreath of orange blossoms a filmy veil and real kid gloves all gifts of Miss Edith Arden Lord Arden s sister How Lord Arden presented an enormous wedding cake and a glorious wedding breakfast and gave away the bride and made a speech saying he owed a great debt to mister Beale for his kindness to his nephew Richard Arden and how surprised every one was to hear Dickie s new name How all the dogs wore white favors and had each a crumb of wedding cake and how when the wedding feast was over and the guests gone the bride tucked up her white dress under a big apron and set about arranging in the new rooms the sticks of furniture which Dickie and Beale had brought together from the little home in Deptford and which had come in a van by road all the way to Arden The Ardens had gone back to the Castle and Dickie with them and old Beale was smoking in his usual chair by his front door so there was no one to hear Beale s compliment to his bride He came behind her and put his arm round her as she was dusting the mantelpiece Go on with you said the new missus Beale any one ud think we was courting So we be said Beale and kissed Melia for the first time We got all our courtin to do now See I might a picked an choosed he added reflectively but there I dare say I might a done worse Melia blushed with pleasure at the compliment and went on with the dusting It was as the Ardens walked home over the short turf that Lord Arden said to his sister I wish all the cottages about here were like Beale s It didn t cost so very much If I could only buy back the rest of the land I d show some people what a model village is like Only I can t buy it back He wants far more than we can think of managing And Dickie heard what he said That was why when next he was alone with his cousins he began Look here you aren t allowed to use your magic any more to go and look for the treasure But I am And I vote we go and look for it And then your father can buy back the old lands and build the new cottages and mend up Arden Castle and make it like it used to be Oh let s said Elfrida with enthusiasm But Edred unexpectedly answered I don t know The three children were sitting in the window of the gate tower looking down on the green turf of the Castle yard What do you mean you don t know Elfrida asked briskly I mean I don t know said Edred stolidly we re all right as we are I think I used to think I liked magic and things But if you come to think of it something horrid happened to us every single time we went into the past with our magic We were always being chased or put in prison or bothered somehow or other The only really nice thing was when we saw the treasure being hidden because that looked like a picture and we hadn t to do anything And we don t know where the treasure is anyhow And I don t like adventures nearly so much as I used to think I did We re all right and jolly as we are What I say is Don t let s This cold water damped the spirit of the others only for a few minutes You know Elfrida explained to Dickie our magic took us to look for treasure in the past And once a film of a photograph that we d stuck up behaved like a cinematograph and then we saw the treasure being hidden away Then let s just go where that was mark the spot come home and then dig it up It wasn t buried Elfrida explained it was put into a sort of cellar with doors and we ve looked all over what s left of the Castle and there isn t so much as a teeny silver ring to be found I see said Dickie But suppose I just worked the magic and wished to be where the treasure is I won t cried Edred and in his extreme dislike to the idea he kicked with his boots quite violently against the stones of the tower not much I won t I expect the treasure s bricked up We should look nice bricked up in a vault like a wicked nun and perhaps forgotten the way to get out Not much You needn t make such a fuss about it said Elfrida nobody s going to get bricked up in vaults And Dickie added You re quite right old chap I didn t think about that We must do something Elfrida said impatiently How would it be Dickie spoke slowly if I tried to see the Mouldierwarp He is stronger than the Mouldiwarp He might advise us Suppose we work the magic and just ask to see him I don t want to go away from here said Edred firmly You needn t I ll lay out the moon seeds and things on the floor here you ll see So Dickie made the crossed triangles of moon seeds and he and his cousins stood in it and Dickie said Please can we see the Mouldierwarp just as you say Please can I see mister So and so when you have knocked at the door of mister So and so s house and some one has opened the door Immediately everything became dark but before the children had time to wish that it was light again a disc of light appeared on the curtain of darkness and there was the Mouldierwarp just as Dickie had seen him once before He bowed in a courtly manner and said What can I do for you to day Richard Lord Arden He s not Lord Arden said Edred I used to be But even I m not Lord Arden now My father is Indeed said the Mouldierwarp with an air of polite interest You interest me greatly But my question remains unanswered I want said Dickie to find the lost treasure of Arden so that the old Castle can be built up again and the old lands bought back and the old cottages made pretty and good to live in Will you please advise me The Mouldierwarp in the magic lantern picture seemed to scratch his nose thoughtfully with his fore paw It can be done he said but it will be hard It is almost impossible to find the treasure without waking the Mouldiestwarp who sits on the green and white checkered field of Ardens shield of arms And he can only be awakened by some noble deed Yet noble deeds may chance at any time And if you go to seek treasure of one kind you may find treasure of another I have spoken It began to fade away but Elfrida cried Oh don t go You re just like the Greek oracles Won t you tell us something plain and straightforward I will said the Mouldierwarp rather shortly Great Arden s Lord no treasure shall regain Till Arden s Lord is lost and found again And father was lost and found again said Edred so that s all right Set forth to seek it with courageous face And seek it in the most unlikely place And with that it vanished altogether and the darkness with it and there were the three children and Tinkler and the white seal and the moon seeds and the sunshine on the floor of the room in the tower That s useful said Edred scornfully As if it wasn t just as difficult to know the unlikely places as the likely ones I ll tell you what said Dickie And then the dinner bell rang and they had to go without Dickie s telling them what and to eat roast mutton and plum pie and behave as though they were just ordinary children to whom no magic had ever happened There was little chance of more talk that day Edred and Elfrida were to be taken to Cliffville immediately after dinner to be measured for new shoes and Dickie was to go up to spend the afternoon with Beale and Melia and the dogs Still in the few moments when they were all dressed and waiting for the dog cart to come round Dickie found a chance to whisper to Elfrida Let s all think of unlikely places as hard as ever we can And to morrow we ll decide on the unlikeliest and go there Edred needn t be in it if he doesn t want to You re keen aren t you Rather was all there was time for Elfrida to say The welcome that awaited Dickie at Beale s cottage from Beale Amelia and not least the dogs was enough to drive all thoughts of unlikely places out of anybody s head And besides there were always so many interesting things to do at the cottage He helped to wash True cleaned the knives and rinsed lettuce for tea helped to dry the tea things and to fold the washing when missus Beale brought it in out of the yard in dry sweet armfuls of white folds It was dusk when he bade them good night embracing each dog in turn and set out to walk the little way to the crossroads where the dog cart returning from Cliffville would pick him up But the dog cart was a little late because the pony had dropped a shoe and had had to be taken to the blacksmith s So when Dickie had waited a little while he began to think as one always does when people don t keep their appointments that perhaps he had mistaken the time or that the clock at the cottage was slow And when he had waited a little longer it seemed simply silly to be waiting at all So he picked up his crutch and got up from the milestone where he had been sitting and set off to walk down to the Castle As he went he thought many things and one of the things he thought was that the memories of King James s time had grown dim and distant he looked down on Arden Castle and loved it and felt that he asked no better than to live there all his life with his cousins and their father and that after all the magic of a dream life was not needed when life itself was so good and happy And just as he was thinking this a twig cracked sharply in the hedge Then a dozen twigs rustled and broke and something like a great black bird seemed to fly out at him and fold him in its wings It was not a bird he knew that the next moment but a big dark cloak that some one had thrown over his head and shoulders and through it strong hands were holding him Hold yer noise said a voice if you so much as squeak it ll be the worse for you Help shouted Dickie instantly He was thrown on to the ground Hands fumbled his face was cleared of the cloak and a handkerchief with a round pebble in it was stuffed into his mouth so that he could not speak Then he was dragged behind a hedge and held there while two voices whispered above him The cloak was over his head again now and he could see nothing but he could hear He heard one of the voices say Hush they re coming And then he heard the sound of hoofs and wheels and Lord Arden s jolly voice saying He must have walked on we shall catch him up all right Then the sound of wheels and hoofs died away and hard hands pulled him to his feet and thrust the crutch under his arm Step out said one of the voices and step out sharp see or I ll l arn you There s a carriage awaiting for you He stepped out there was nothing else to be done They had taken the cloak from his eyes now and he saw presently that they were nearing a coster s barrow They laid him in the barrow covered him with the cloak and put vegetable marrows and cabbages on that They only left him a little room to breathe Now lie still for your life said the second voice If you stir a inch I ll lick you till you can t stand And now you know So he lay still rigid with misery and despair For neither of these voices was strange to him He knew them both only too well CHAPTER X THE NOBLE DEED 
5172-29468-0000	train-other-500	WHEN Lord Arden and Elfrida and Edred reached the castle and found that Dickie had not come back the children concluded that Beale had persuaded him to stay the night at the cottage And Lord Arden thought that the children must be right He was extremely annoyed
none	none	 both with Beale and with Dickie for making such an arrangement without consulting him 
5172-29468-0001	train-other-500	It is impertinent of Beale and thoughtless of the boy
none	none	 he said and I shall speak a word to them both in the morning 
5172-29468-0002	train-other-500	But when Edred and Elfrida were gone to bed Lord Arden found that he could not feel quite sure or quite satisfied Suppose Dickie was not at Beale s He strolled up to the cottage to see Everything was dark at the cottage He hesitated then knocked at the door
5172-29468-0003	train-other-500	At the third knock Beale very sleepy put his head out of the window Who s
none	none	 there said he I am here 
5172-29468-0004	train-other-500	said Lord Arden Richard is asleep I suppose I suppose so my lord said Beale sleepy and puzzled You have given me some anxiety I had to come up to make sure he was here But e ain t ere said Beale
5172-29468-0005	train-other-500	Didn t you pick im up with the dog cart same as you said you would No shouted Lord Arden Come down Beale and get a lantern
none	none	 There must have been an accident The bedroom window showed a square of light and Lord Arden below heard Beale blundering about above 
5172-29468-0006	train-other-500	Ere s your coat missus Beale s voice sounded
none	none	 never mind lacing up of your boots You orter gone a bit of the way with im Well I offered for to go didn t I 
5172-29468-0007	train-other-500	Beale growled blundered down the stairs and out through the wash house and came round the corner of the house with a stable lantern in his hand He came close to where Lord Arden stood a tall dark figure in the starlight and spoke in a voice that trembled The little nipper
5172-29468-0008	train-other-500	he said and again the little nipper If anything s happened to im Swelp me gov ner my lord I mean
none	none	 What I meanter say if anything s appened to im 
5172-29468-0009	train-other-500	One of the best The two men went quickly towards the gate As they passed down the quiet dusty road Beale spoke again
none	none	 I wasn t no good 
5172-29468-0010	train-other-500	I don t deceive you guv ner a no account man I was swelp me And the little un
none	none	 e tidied me up and told me tales and kep me straight It was is doing me and Melia come together 
5172-29468-0011	train-other-500	An the dogs an all An the little one An
none	none	 e got me to chuck the cadgin 
5172-29468-0012	train-other-500	An worse E don t know what I was like when I met im Why I set out to make a blighted burglar of im you wouldn t believe And out the whole story came as Lord Arden and he went along the gray road
5172-29468-0013	train-other-500	looking to right and left where no bushes
none	none	 were nor stones only the smooth curves of the down so that it was easy to see that no little boy was there either They looked for Dickie to right and left and here and there under bushes and by stiles and hedges and with trembling hearts they searched in the little old chalk quarry 
5172-29468-0014	train-other-500	and the white moon came up very late to help them
5172-29468-0015	train-other-500	But they did not find him though they roused a dozen men in the village to join in the search and old Beale himself who knew every yard of the ground for five miles round came out with the spaniel who knew every inch of it for ten But True rushed about the house and garden whining and yelping so piteously that Melia tied him up and he stayed tied up
5172-29468-0016	train-other-500	And so when Edred and Elfrida came down to breakfast missus Honeysett met them with the news that Dickie was lost and their father still out looking for him It s that beastly magic said Edred as soon as the children were alone
5172-29468-0017	train-other-500	He s done it once too often and he s got stuck some time in history and can t get back And we can t do anything We can t get to him
none	none	 said Elfrida Oh if only we d got the old white magic and the Mouldiwarp to help us we could find out what s become of him 
5172-29468-0018	train-other-500	Perhaps he has fallen down a disused mine Edred suggested
none	none	 and is lying panting for water and his faithful dog has jumped down after him and broken all its dear legs Elfrida melted to tears at this desperate picture 
5172-29468-0019	train-other-500	melted to a speechless extent We can t do anything said Edred again don t snivel like that for goodness sake Elfrida This is a man s job
5172-29468-0020	train-other-500	Dry up I can t think with you blubbing like that I m not said Elfrida untruly and sniffed with some intensity If you could make up some poetry now Edred went on would that be any good Not without the dresses she sniffed
5172-29468-0021	train-other-500	You know we always had dresses for our magic or nearly always and they have to be dead and gone people s dresses and you ll only go to the dead and gone people s time when the dresses were worn
none	none	 Oh dear Dickie and if he s really down a mine or things like that what s the good of anything 
5172-29468-0022	train-other-500	I m going to try anyway said Edred at least you must too Because I can t make poetry
none	none	 No more can I when I m as unhappy as this Poetry s the last thing you think of when you re mizzy 
5172-29468-0023	train-other-500	We could dress up anyway said Edred hopefully
none	none	 The bits of armor out of the hall and the Indian feather head dresses father brought home and I have father s shooting gaiters and brown paper tops and you can have Aunt Edith s Roman sash 
5172-29468-0024	train-other-500	It s in the right hand corner drawer I saw it on the wedding day when I went to get her prayer book I don t want to dress up said Elfrida I want to find Dickie I don t want to dress up either said Edred
5172-29468-0025	train-other-500	but we must do something and perhaps I know it s just only perhaps it might help if we dressed up Let s try it anyway Elfrida was too miserable to argue
none	none	 Before long two most miserable children faced each other in Edred s bedroom dressed as Red Indians so far as their heads and backs went Then came lots of plate armor for chest and arms then in the case of Elfrida petticoats and Roman sash and Japanese wickerwork shoes and father s shooting gaiters made to look like boots by brown paper tops And in the case of Edred legs cased in armor 
5172-29468-0026	train-other-500	that looked like cricket pads ending in jointed foot coverings that looked like chrysalises
none	none	 I am told the correct plural is chrysalides but life would be dull indeed if one always used the correct plural 
5172-29468-0027	train-other-500	They were two forlorn faces that looked at each other as Edred said Now the poetry I can t said Elfrida bursting into tears again I can t So there I ve been trying all the time we ve been dressing and I can only think of Oh call dear Dickie back to me
5172-29468-0028	train-other-500	I cannot play alone The summer comes with flower and bee
none	none	 Where is dear Dickie gone 
5172-29468-0029	train-other-500	And I know that s no use I should think not
none	none	 said Edred 
5172-29468-0030	train-other-500	Why it isn t your own poetry at all It s Felicia M Hemans I ll try
none	none	 And he got a pencil and paper and try he did his very hardest be sure But there are some things that the best and bravest cannot do 
5172-29468-0031	train-other-500	And the thing Edred couldn t do was to make poetry however bad He simply couldn t do it any more than you can fly It wasn t in him any more than wings are on you Oh Mouldiwarp you said we must
5172-29468-0032	train-other-500	Not have any more magic But we trust You won t be hard on us because Dickie is lost And we don t know how to find him
none	none	 That was the best Edred could do and I tell it to his credit he really did feel doubtful whether what he had so slowly and carefully written was indeed genuine poetry 
5172-29468-0033	train-other-500	So much so that he would not show it to Elfrida until she had begged very hard indeed At about the thirtieth Do please Edred do he gave her the paper
5172-29468-0034	train-other-500	No little girl was ever more polite than Elfrida or less anxious to hurt the feelings of others But she was also quite truthful
5172-29468-0035	train-other-500	and when Edred said in an ashamed muffled voice Is it all right do you think the best she could find by way of answer was I don t know much about poetry We ll try it And they did try it and nothing happened I knew it was no good Edred said crossly
none	none	 and I ve made an ass of myself for nothing 
5172-29468-0036	train-other-500	Well I ve often made one of myself said Elfrida comfortingly and I will again if you like But I don t suppose it ll be any more good than yours
5172-29468-0037	train-other-500	Elfrida frowned fiercely and the feathers on her Indian head dress quivered with the intensity of her effort Is it coming Edred asked in anxious tones and she nodded distractedly Great Mouldiestwarp on you we call To do the greatest magic of all
5172-29468-0038	train-other-500	To show us how we are to find Dear Dickie who is lame and kind Do this for us and on our hearts we swore We ll never ask you for anything more I don t see that it s so much better than mine said Edred and it ought to be swear not swore
none	none	 I don t think it is But you didn t finish yours And it couldn t be swear because of rhyming Elfrida explained 
5172-29468-0039	train-other-500	But I m sure if the Mouldiestwarp hears it he won t care tuppence whether it s swear or swore He is much too great He s far above grammar I m sure
5172-29468-0040	train-other-500	I wish every one was sighed Edred and I dare say you have often felt the same Well fire away Not that it s any good Don t you remember you can only get at the Mouldiestwarp by a noble deed
none	none	 And wanting to find Dickie isn t noble No she agreed but then if we could get Dickie back by doing a noble deed we d do it like a shot wouldn t we Oh I suppose so said Edred grumpily fire away can t you Elfrida fired away and the next moment it was plain that Elfrida s poetry was more potent than Edred s also that a little bad grammar is a trifle to a mighty Mouldiwarp For the walls of Edred s room receded further and further till the children found themselves in a great white hall with avenues of tall pillars stretching in every direction as far as you could see The hall was crowded with people dressed in costumes of all countries and all ages Chinamen Indians Crusaders in armor powdered ladies doubleted gentlemen Cavaliers in curls Turks in turbans Arabs monks abbesses jesters grandees with ruffs round their necks and savages with kilts of thatch Every kind of dress you can think of was there Only all the dresses were white It was like a redoute which is a fancy dress ball where the guests may wear any dress they choose only all the dresses must be of one color Elfrida saw the whiteness all about her and looked down anxiously at her clothes and Edred s which she remembered to have been of rather odd colors Everything they wore was white now Even the Roman sash instead of having stripes blue and red and green and black and yellow was of five different shades of white If you think there are not so many shades of white try to paper a room with white paper and get it at five different shops The people round the children pushed them gently forward And then they saw that in the middle of the hall was a throne of silver spread with a fringed cloth of checkered silver and green and on it with the Mouldiwarp standing on one side and the Mouldierwarp on the other the Mouldiestwarp was seated in state and splendor He was much larger than either of the other moles and his fur was as silvery as the feathers of a swan Every one in the room was looking at the two children and it seemed impossible for them not to advance though slowly and shyly right to the front of the throne Arrived there it seemed right to bow very low So they did it Then the Mouldiwarp said What brings you here Kind magic Elfrida answered And the Mouldierwarp said What is your desire And Edred said We want Dickie please Then the Mouldiestwarp said and it was to Edred that he said it Dickie is in the hands of those who will keep him from you for many a day unless you yourself go alone and rescue him It will be difficult and it will be dangerous Will you go Me Alone said Edred rather blankly Not Elfrida Dickie can only be ransomed at a great price and it must be paid by you It will cost you more to do it than it would cost Elfrida because she is braver than you are Here was a nice thing for a boy to have said to him and before all these people too To ask a chap to do a noble deed and in the same breath to tell him he is a coward Edred flushed crimson and a shudder ran through the company Don t turn that horrible color whispered a white toreador who was close to him This is the white world No crimson allowed Elfrida caught Edred s hand Edred is quite as brave as me she said He ll go Won t you Of course I will said Edred impatiently Then ascend the steps of the throne said the Mouldiestwarp very kindly now and sit here by my side Edred obeyed and the Mouldiestwarp leaned towards him and spoke in his ear So that neither Elfrida nor any of the great company in the White Hall could hear a word only Edred alone If you go to rescue Richard Arden the Mouldiestwarp said you make the greatest sacrifice of your life For he who was called Richard Harding is Richard Arden and it is he who is Lord Arden and not you or your father 
5172-29468-0041	train-other-500	And if you go to his rescue you will be taking from your father the title and the Castle and you will be giving up your place as heir of Arden to your cousin Richard who is the rightful heir But how is he the rightful heir Edred asked bewildered
5172-29468-0042	train-other-500	Three generations ago said the Mouldiestwarp a little baby was stolen from Arden Death came among the Ardens and that child became the heir to the name and the lands of Arden The man who stole the child took it to a woman in Deptford
5172-29468-0043	train-other-500	and gave it in charge to her to nurse She knew nothing but that the child s clothes were marked Arden and that it had tied to its waist a coral and bells engraved with a coat of arms The man who had stolen the child said he would return in a month
none	none	 He never returned He fought in a duel and was killed 
5172-29468-0044	train-other-500	But the night before the duel he wrote a letter saying what he had done and put it in a secret cupboard behind a picture of a lady who was born an Arden at Talbot Court And there that letter is to this day I hope I shan t forget it all
5172-29468-0045	train-other-500	said Edred None ever forgets what I tell them said the Mouldiestwarp
none	none	 Finding that the man did not return the Deptford woman brought up the child as her own 
5172-29468-0046	train-other-500	He grew up was taught a trade and married a working girl The name of Arden changed itself as names do to Harding Their child was the father of Richard whom you know And he is Lord Arden Yes
5172-29468-0047	train-other-500	said Edred submissively You will never tell your father this the low beautiful voice went on you must not even tell your sister till you have rescued Dickie and made the sacrifice
none	none	 This is the one supreme chance of all your life 
5172-29468-0048	train-other-500	Every soul has one such chance a chance to be perfectly unselfish absolutely noble and true You can take this chance But you must take it alone No one can help you No one can advise you
5172-29468-0049	train-other-500	And you must keep the nobler thought in your own heart till it is a noble deed Then humbly and thankfully in that you have been permitted to do so
none	none	 fine and brave a thing and to draw near to the immortals of all ages who have such deeds to do 
5172-29468-0050	train-other-500	and have done them you may tell the truth to the one who loves you best your sister Elfrida But isn t Elfrida to have a chance to be noble too Edred asked She will have a thousand chances to be good and noble
none	none	 And she will take them all But she will never know that she has done it said the Mouldiestwarp gravely 
5172-29468-0051	train-other-500	Now are you ready to do what is to be done
none	none	 It seems very unkind to daddy said Edred stopping his being Lord Arden and everything 
5172-29468-0052	train-other-500	To do right often seems unkind to one or another said the Mouldiestwarp but think How long would your father wish to keep his house and his castle if he knew that they belonged to some one else I see said Edred still doubtfully
5172-29468-0053	train-other-500	No of course he wouldn t Well what am I to do When Dickie s father died a Deptford woman related to Dickie s mother kept the child She was not kind to him And he left her Later she met a man who had been a burglar
5172-29468-0054	train-other-500	He had entered Talbot Court opened a panel and found that old letter that told of Dickie s birth
none	none	 He and she have kidnapped Dickie hoping to get him to sign a paper promising to pay them money for giving him the letter which tells how he is heir to Arden 
5172-29468-0055	train-other-500	But already they have found out that a letter signed by a child is useless and unlawful And they dare not let Richard go for fear of punishment So if you choose to do nothing your father is safe and you will inherit Arden
none	none	 What am I to do Edred asked again to get Dickie back I mean You must go alone and at night to Beale s cottage open the door and you will find Richard s dog asleep before the fire You must unchain the dog and take him to the milestone by the crossroads Then go where the dog goes You will need a knife to cut cords with And you will need all your courage Look in my eyes Edred looked in the eyes of the Mouldiestwarp and saw that they were no longer a mole s eyes but were like the eyes of all the dear people he had ever known and through them the soul of all the brave people he had ever read about looked out at him and said Courage Edred Be one of us Now look at the people on the Hall said the Mouldiestwarp Edred looked And behold they were no longer strangers He knew them all Joan of Arc and Peter the Hermit Hereward and Drake Elsa whose brothers were swans saint George who killed the dragon Blondel who sang to his king in prison Lady Nithsdale who brought her husband safe out of the cruel Tower There were captains who went down with their ships generals who died fighting for forlorn hopes patriots kings nuns monks men women and children all with that light in their eyes which brightens with splendor the dreams of men And as he came down off the throne the great ones crowded round him clasping his hand and saying 
5172-29468-0056	train-other-500	Be one of us Edred Be one of us
none	none	 Then an intense white light shone so that the children could see nothing else And then suddenly 
5172-29468-0057	train-other-500	there they were again within the narrow walls of Edred s bedroom Well said Elfrida in tones of brisk commonplace what did it say to you I say you do look funny Don t said Edred crossly He began to tear off the armor Here
5172-29468-0058	train-other-500	help me to get these things off But what did it say Elfrida asked helpfully I can t tell you I m not going to tell any one till it s over Oh just as you like said Elfrida keep your old secrets and left him
5172-29468-0059	train-other-500	That was hard wasn t it I can t help it I tell you Oh Elfrida if you re going to bother it s just a little bit too much that s all You really mustn t tell me I ve told you so fifty times he said Which was untrue
none	none	 You know he had really only told her twice 
5172-29468-0060	train-other-500	Very well then she said heroically I won t ask you a single thing But you ll tell me the minute you can won t you And you ll let me help Nobody can help no one can advise me Edred said
5172-29468-0061	train-other-500	I ve got to do it off my own bat if I do it at all
none	none	 Now you just shut up 
5172-29468-0062	train-other-500	I want to think This unusual desire quite awed Elfrida But it irritated her too Perhaps you d like me to go away she said ironically And Edred s wholly unexpected reply was Yes please
none	none	 So she went And when she was gone 
5172-29468-0063	train-other-500	Edred sat down on the box at the foot of his bed and tried to think But it was not easy
none	none	 I ought to go he told himself But think of your father 
5172-29468-0064	train-other-500	said something else which was himself too
none	none	 He thought so hard that his thoughts got quite confused His head grew very hot and his hands and feet very cold 
5172-29468-0065	train-other-500	missus Honeysett came in exclaimed at his white face felt his hands said he was in a high fever and put him to bed with wet rags on his forehead and hot water bottles to his feet Perhaps he was feverish
5172-29468-0066	train-other-500	At any rate he could never be sure afterwards whether there really had been a very polite and plausible black mole sitting on his pillow most of the day saying all those things which the part of himself that he liked least agreed with Such things as
none	none	 Think of your father 
5172-29468-0067	train-other-500	No one will ever know Dickie will be all right somehow Perhaps you only dreamed that about Dickie being shut up somewhere and it s not true Anyway it s not your business is it And so on You know the sort of thing
none	none	 Elfrida was not allowed to come into the room for fear Edred should be ill 
5172-29468-0068	train-other-500	with something catching So he lay tossing all day hearing the black mole or something else say all these things and himself saying I must go Oh poor Dickie I promised to go
5172-29468-0069	train-other-500	Yes I will go And late that night when Lord Arden had come home and had gone to bed
none	none	 tired out by a long day s vain search for the lost Dickie and when everybody was asleep Edred 
5172-29468-0070	train-other-500	got up and dressed He put his bedroom candle and matches in his pocket crept down stairs and out of the house and up to Beale s It was a slow and nervous business More than once on the staircase he thought he heard a stair creak behind him
5172-29468-0071	train-other-500	and again and again
none	none	 as he went along the road 
5172-29468-0072	train-other-500	he fancied he heard a soft footstep pad padding behind him but of course when he looked round he could see no one was there
5172-29468-0073	train-other-500	So presently he decided that it was cowardly to keep looking round and besides it only made him more frightened So he kept steadily on and took no notice at all of a black patch by the sweetbrier bush by Beale s cottage door
5172-29468-0074	train-other-500	just exactly as if some one was crouching in the shadow He pressed his thumb on the latch and opened the door very softly Something moved inside and a chain rattled
5172-29468-0075	train-other-500	Edred s heart gave a soft uncomfortable jump But it was only True standing up to receive company He saw the whiteness of the dog and made for it felt for the chain unhooked it from the staple in the wall
5172-29468-0076	train-other-500	and went out again closing the door after him and followed very willingly by True Again he looked suspiciously at the shadow of the great sweetbrier but the dog showed no uneasiness so Edred knew that there was nothing to be afraid of
5172-29468-0077	train-other-500	True in fact was the greatest comfort to him He told Elfrida afterwards that it was all True s doing he could never he was sure have gone on without that good companion True followed at the slack chain s end
5172-29468-0078	train-other-500	till they got to the milestone and then suddenly he darted ahead and took the lead the chain stretched taut and the boy had all his work cut out to keep up with the dog Up the hill they went on to the downs and in and out among the furze bushes
none	none	 The night was no longer dark to Edred His eyes had got used to the gentle starlight and he followed the dog among the gorse and brambles without stumbling and without hurting himself against the million sharp spears and thorns 
5172-29468-0079	train-other-500	Suddenly True paused sniffed sneezed blew through his nose and began to dig Come on come on good dog said Edred come on True for his fancy pictured Dickie a prisoner in some lonely cottage
none	none	 and he longed to get to it and set him free and get safe back home with him So he pulled at the chain But True only shook himself and went on digging The spot he had chosen was under a clump of furze bigger than any they had passed The sharp furze spikes pricked his nose and paws but True was not the dog to be stopped by little things like that He only stopped every now and then to sneeze and blow and then went on digging 
5172-29468-0080	train-other-500	Edred remembered the knife he had brought It was the big pruning knife out of the drawer in the hall He pulled it out
none	none	 He would cut away some of the furze branches 
5172-29468-0081	train-other-500	Perhaps Dickie was lying bound hidden in the middle of the furze bush Dickie he said softly Dickie But no one answered Only True sneezed and snuffed and blew and went on digging
none	none	 So then Edred took hold of a branch of furze to cut it and it was loose and came away in his hand without any cutting He tried another That too was loose He took off his jacket and threw it over his hands to protect them and seizing an armful of furze pulled and fell back a great bundle of the prickly stuff on top of him 
5172-29468-0082	train-other-500	True was pulling like mad at the chain Edred scrambled up the furze he had pulled away disclosed a hole and True was disappearing down it Edred saw as the dog dragged him close to the hole
5172-29468-0083	train-other-500	that it was a large one though only part of it had been uncovered He stooped to peer in
none	none	 his foot slipped on the edge and he fell right into it the dog dragging all the time 
5172-29468-0084	train-other-500	Stop True lie down sir he said and the dog paused though the chain was still strained tight Then Edred was glad of his bedroom candle
5172-29468-0085	train-other-500	He pulled it out and lighted it and blinked perceiving almost at once that he was in the beginning of an underground passage He looked up he could see above him the stars plain through a net of furze bushes He stood up and True went on Next moment he knew
5172-29468-0086	train-other-500	that he was in the old smugglers cave
none	none	 that he and Elfrida had so often tried to find The dog and the boy went on along a passage down steps cut in the rock through a rough heavy door and so into the smugglers cave itself 
5172-29468-0087	train-other-500	an enormous cavern as big as a church Out of an opening at the upper end a stream of water fell and ran along the cave clear between shores of smooth sand
none	none	 And lying on the sand near the stream was something dark True gave a bound that jerked the chain out of Edred s hand and leaped upon the dark thing licking it whining and uttering little dog moans of pure love and joy For the dark something was Dickie fast asleep He was bound with cords his poor lame foot tied tight to the other one His arms were bound too And now he was awake Down True he said Hush Ssh Where are they the man and woman Edred whispered Oh Edred You You perfect brick Dickie whispered back They re in the further cave I heard them snoring before I went to sleep Lie still said Edred I ve got a knife I ll cut the cords He cut them and Dickie tried to stand up But his limbs were too stiff Edred rubbed his legs while Dickie stretched his fingers to get the pins and needles out of his arms Edred had stuck the candle in the sand It made a ring of light round them That was why they did not see a dark figure that came quietly creeping across the sand towards them It was quite close to them before Edred looked up Illustration ELFRIDA SAID BOTH BOYS AT ONCE Page two hundred seventy two Oh he gasped and Dickie looking up whispered It s all up run Never mind me I shall get away all right No said Edred and then with a joyous leap of the heart perceived that the dark figure was Elfrida in her father s ulster I hadn t time to put on my stockings she explained later You d have known me a mile off by my white legs if I hadn t covered them up with this Elfrida said both boys at once Well you didn t think I was going to be out of it she said I ve been behind you all the way Edred Don t tell me anything I won t ask any questions only come along out of it Lean on me They got him up to the passage one on each side and by that time Dickie could use his legs and his crutch They got home and roused Lord Arden and told him Dickie was found and all about it and he roused the house and he and Beale and half a dozen men from the village went up to the cave and found that wicked man and woman in a stupid sleep and tied their hands and marched them to the town and to the police station When the man was searched the letter was found on him which the man it was that redheaded man you have heard of had taken from Talbot Court I wish you joy of your good fortune my boy said Lord Arden when he had read the letter Of course we must look into things but I feel no doubt at all that you are Lord Arden I don t want to be said Dickie and that was true Yet at the same time he did want to be The thought of being Richard Lord Arden he who had been just little lame Dickie of Deptford of owning this glorious castle of being the master of an old name and an old place this thought sang in his heart a very beautiful tune Yet what he said was true There is so often room in our hearts for two tunes at a time I don t want to be You ought to be sir You ve been so kind to me he said My dear boy said the father of Edred and Elfrida I did very well without the title and the castle and if they re yours I shall do very well without them again You shall have your rights my dear boy and I shan t be hurt by it Don t you think that Dickie thought several things and shook the other s hand very hard The tale of Dickie s rescue from the cave was the talk of the countryside True was praised much but Edred more Why had no one else thought of putting the dog on the scent Edred said that it was mostly True s doing And the people praised his modesty And nobody except perhaps Elfrida ever understood what it had cost Edred to go that night through the dark and rescue his cousin Edred s father and missus Honeysett agreed that Edred had done it in the delirium of a fever brought on by his anxiety about his friend and playmate People do you know do odd things in fevers that they would never do at other times The redheaded man and the woman were tried at the assizes and punished If you ask me how they knew about the caves which none of the country people seemed to know of I can only answer that I don t know Only I know that every one you know knows lots of things that you don t know they know When they all went a week later to explore the caves they found a curious arrangement of brickwork and cement and clay shutting up a hole through which the stream had evidently once flowed out into the open air It now flowed away into darkness Lord Arden pointed out how its course had been diverted and made to run down underground to the sea We might let it come back to the moat said Edred It used to run that way It says so in the History of Arden We must decide that later said his father who had a long blue lawyer s letter in his pocket CHAPTER XI LORD ARDEN THERE was a lot of talk and a lot of letter writing before any one seemed to be able to be sure who was Lord Arden If the father of Edred and Elfrida had wanted to dispute about it no doubt there would have been enough work to keep the lawyers busy for years and seas of ink would have been spilled and thunders of eloquence spent on the question But as the present Lord Arden was an honest man and only too anxious that Dickie should have everything that belonged to him even the lawyers had to cut their work short When Edred saw how his father tried his best to find out the truth about Dickie s birth and how willing he was to give up what he had thought was his own if it should prove to be not his do you think he was not glad to know that he had done his duty and rescued his cousin and had not by any meanness or any indecision brought dishonor on the name of Arden As for Elfrida when she knew the whole story of that night of rescue she admired her brother so much that it made him almost uncomfortable However she now looked up to him in all things and consulted him about everything and after all this is very pleasant from your sister especially when every one has been rather in the habit of suggesting that she is better than you are as well as cleverer To Dickie Lord Arden said Of course if anything should happen to show that I am really Lord Arden you won t desert us Dickie You shall go to school with Edred and be brought up like my very own son And like Lord Arden s very own son Dickie lived at the house in Arden Castle and grew to love it more and more He no longer wanted to get away from these present times to those old days when James the First was King The times you are born in are always more home like than any other times can be When Dickie lived miserably at Deptford he always longed to go to those old times as a man who is unhappy at home may wish to travel to other countries But a man who is happy in his home does not want to leave it And at Arden Dickie was happy The training he had had in the old world life enabled him to take his place and to be unembarrassed with the Ardens and their friends as he was with the Beales and theirs A little shy the Ardens friends told each other but what fine manners And to think he was only a tramp Lord Arden has certainly done wonders with him So Lord Arden got the credit of all that Dickie had learned from his tutors in James the First s time It is not in the nature of any child to brood continually on the past or the future The child lives in the present And Dickie lived at Arden and loved it and enjoyed himself and Lord Arden bought him a pony so that his lame foot was hardly any drag at all The other children had a donkey cart and the three made all sorts of interesting expeditions Once they went over to Talbot Court and saw the secret place where Edward Talbot had hidden his confession about having stolen the Arden baby three generations before Also they saw the portrait of the Lady Talbot who had been a Miss Arden In rose colored brocade she was with a green silk petticoat and her powdered hair dressed high over a great cushion but her eyes and her mouth were the eyes of Dickie of Deptford Lady Talbot was very charming to the children played hide and seek with them and gave them a delightful and varied tea in the yew arbor I m glad you wouldn t let me adopt you Richard she said when Elfrida and Edred had been sent to her garden to get a basket of peaches to take home with them because just when I had become entirely attached to you you would have found out your real relations and where would your poor foster mother have been then If I could have stayed with you I would said Dickie seriously I did like you most awfully even then You are very like the Lady Arden whose husband was shut up in the Tower for the Gunpowder Plot So they tell me said Lady Talbot but how do you know it I don t know said Dickie confused but you are like her You must have seen a portrait of her There s one in the National Portrait Gallery She was a Delamere and my name was Delamere too before I was married She was one of the same family you see dear Dickie put his arms round her waist as she sat beside him and laid his head on her shoulder I wish you d really been my mother he said and his thoughts were back in the other days with the mother who wore a ruff and hoop Lady Talbot hugged him tenderly My dear little Dickie she said you don t wish it as much as I do There are all sorts of things a chap can t be sure of things you mustn t tell any one Secrets you know honorable secrets But if it was your own mother it would be different But if you haven t got a mother you have to decide everything for yourself Won t you let me help you she asked Dickie his head on her shoulder was for one wild moment tempted to tell her everything the whole story from beginning to end But he knew that she could not understand it or even believe it No grown up person could A chap s own mother might have perhaps but perhaps not too I can t tell you he said at last only I don t think I want to be Lord Arden At least I do frightfully It s so splendid all the things the Ardens did in history you know But I don t want to turn people out and you know Edred came and saved me from those people It feels hateful when I think perhaps they ll have to turn out just because I happened to turn up Sometimes I feel as if I simply couldn t bear it You dear child she said of course you feel that But don t let your mind dwell on it Don t think about it You re only a little boy Be happy and jolly and don t worry about grown up things Leave grown up things to the grown ups You see Dickie told her somehow I ve always had to worry about grown up things What with Beale and one thing and another That was the man you ran away from me to go to Yes said Dickie gravely you see I was responsible for Beale And now Don t you feel responsible any more No said Dickie in businesslike tones you see I ve settled Beale in life You can t be responsible for married people They re responsible for each other So now I ve got only my own affairs to think of And the Ardens I don t know what to do Do why there s nothing to do except to enjoy yourself and learn your lessons and be happy she told him Don t worry your little head Just enjoy yourself and forget that you ever had any responsibilities I ll try he told her and then the others came back with their peaches and there was nothing more to be said but Thank you very much and good bye Exploring the old smugglers caves was exciting and delightful as exploring caves always is It turned out that more than one old man in the village had heard from his father about the caves and the smuggling that had gone on in those parts in old ancient days But they had not thought it their place to talk about such things and I suspect that in their hearts they did not more than half believe them Old Beale said Why didn t you ask me I could a told you where they was Only I shouldn t a done fear you d break your precious necks Of course the children were desperately anxious to open up the brickwork and let the stream come out into the light of day only their father thought it would be too expensive But Edred and Elfrida worried and bothered in a perfectly gentle and polite way till at last a very jolly gentleman in spectacles who came down to spend a couple of days took their part From the moment he owned himself an engineer Edred and Elfrida gave him no peace and he seemed quite pleased to be taken to see the caves He pointed out that the removal of the simple dam would send the water back into the old channel It would be perfectly simple to have the brickwork knocked out and to let the stream find its way back if it could to its old channel and thence down the arched way which Edred and Elfrida told him they were certain was under a mound below the Castle You know a lot about it don t you he said good humoredly Yes said Edred simply Then they all went down to the mound and the engineer then poked and prodded it and said he should not wonder if they were not so far out And then Beale and another man came with spades and presently there was the arch as good as ever and they exclaimed and admired and went back to the caves It was a grand moment when the bricks had been taken out and daylight poured into the cave and nothing remained but to break down the dam and let the water run out of the darkness into the sunshine You can imagine with what mixed feelings the children wondered whether they would rather stay in the cave and see the dam demolished or stay outside and see the stream rush out In the end the boys stayed within and it was only Elfrida and her father who saw the stream emerge They sat on a hillock among the thin harebells and wild thyme and sweet lavender colored gipsy roses with their eyes fixed on the opening in the hillside and waited and waited and waited for a very long time Won t you mind frightfully daddy Elfrida asked during this long waiting if it turns out that you re not Lord Arden He paused a moment before he decided to answer her without reserve Yes he said I shall mind frightfully And that s just why we must do everything we possibly can to prove that Dickie is the rightful heir so that whether he has the title or I have it you and I may never have to reproach ourselves for having left a single stone unturned to give him his rights whatever they are And you yours daddy And me mine Anyhow if he is Lord Arden I shall probably be appointed his guardian and we shall all live together here just the same Only I shall go back to being plain Arden I believe Dickie is Lord Arden Elfrida began and I am not at all sure that she would not have gone on to give her reasons including the whole story which the Mouldiestwarp had told to Dickie but at that moment there was a roaring rushing sound from inside the cave and a flash of shiny silver gleamed across that dark gap in the hillside There was a burst of imprisoned splendor The stream leaped out and flowed right and left over the dry grass till it lapped in tiny waves against their hillock like sand castles as Elfrida observed It spread out in a lake wider and wider but presently gathered itself together and began to creep down the hill winding in and out among the hillocks in an ever deepening stream Come on childie let s make for the moat We shall get there first if we run our hardest Elfrida s father said And he ran with his little daughter s hand in his They got there first The stream knowing its own mind better and better as it recognized its old road reached the Castle and by dinner time all the grass round the Castle was under water By tea time the water in the moat was a foot or more deep and when they got up next morning the Castle was surrounded by a splendid moat fifty feet wide and a stream ran from it in a zigzag way it is true but still it ran to the lower arch under the mound and disappeared there to run underground into the sea They enjoyed the moat for one whole day and then the stream was dammed again and condemned to run underground till next spring by which time the walls of the Castle would have been examined and concrete laid to their base lest the water should creep through and sap the foundations It s going to be a very costly business it seems Elfrida heard her father say to the engineer and I don t know that I ought to do it But I can t resist the temptation I shall have to economize in other directions that s all When Elfrida had heard this she went to Dickie and Edred who were fishing in the cave and told them what she had heard And we must have another try for the treasure she said Whoever has the Castle will want to restore it they ve got those pictures of it as it used to be And then there are all the cottages to rebuild Dear Dickie you re so clever do think of some way to find the treasure So Dickie thought And presently he said You once saw the treasure being carried to the secret room in a picture didn t you They told him yes Then why didn t you go back to that time and see it really We hadn t the clothes Everything in our magic depended on clothes Mine doesn t Shall we go There were lots of soldiers in the picture said Edred and fighting I m not afraid of soldiers said Elfrida very quickly and you re not afraid of anything Edred you know you aren t You can t be or you couldn t have come after me right into the cave in the middle of the night Come on Stand close together and I ll spread out the moon seeds So Dickie said and they stood and he spread the moon seeds out and he wished to be with the party of men who were hiding the treasure But before he spread out the seeds he took certain other things in his left hand and held them closely And instantly they were They were standing very close together all three of them in a niche in a narrow dark passage and men went by them carrying heavy chests and great sacks of leather and bundles tied up in straw and in handkerchiefs The men had long hair and the kind of clothes you know were worn when Charles the First was King And the children wore the dresses of that time and the boys had little swords at their sides When the last bundle had been carried the last chest set down with a dump on the stone floor of some room beyond the children heard a door shut and a key turned and then the men came back all together along the passage and the children followed them Presently torchlight gave way to daylight as they came out into the open air But they had to come on hands and knees for the path sloped steeply up and the opening was very low The chests must have been pushed or pulled through They could never have been carried The children turned and looked at the opening It was in the courtyard wall the courtyard that was now a smooth grass lawn and not the rough daisied grass plot dotted with heaps of broken stone and masonry that they were used to see And as they looked two men picked up a great stone and staggered forward with it and laid it on the stone floor of the secret passage just where it ended at the edge of the grass Then another stone and another The stones fitted into their places like bits of a Chinese puzzle There was mortar or cement at their edges and when the last stone was replaced no one could tell those stones from the other stones that formed the wall Only the grass in front of them was trampled and broken Fetch food and break it about said the man who seemed to be in command that it may look as though the men had eaten here And trample the grass at other places I give the Roundhead dogs another hour to break down our last defense Children go to your mother This is no place for you They knew the way They had seen it in the picture Edred and Elfrida turned to go But Dickie whispered Don t wait for me I ve something yet to do And when the soldiers had gone to get food and strew it about as they had been told to do Dickie crept up to the stones that had been removed from which he had never taken his eyes knelt down and scratched on one of the stones with one of the big nails he had brought in his hand It blunted over and he took another hiding in the chapel doorway when the men came back with the food Every man to his post and God save us all cried the captain when the food was spread They clattered off they were in their armor now and Dickie knelt down again and went on scratching with the nail The air was full of shouting and the sound of guns and the clash of armor and a shattering sound like a giant mallet striking a giant drum a sound that came and came again at five minute intervals and the shrieks of wounded men Dickie pressed up the grass to cover the marks he had made on the stone so low as to be almost underground and quite hidden by the grass roots Then he brushed the stone dust from his hands and stood up The treasure was found and its hiding place marked Now he would find Edred and Elfrida and they would go back Whether he was Lord of Arden or no it was he and no other who had restored the fallen fortunes of that noble house He turned to go the way his cousins had gone He could see the men at arms crowding in the archway of the great gate tower From a window to his right a lady leaned pale with terror and with her were Edred and Elfrida he could just see their white faces He made for the door below that window But it was too late That dull thudding sound came again and this time it was followed by a great crash and a great shouting The blue sky showed through the archway where the tall gates had been and under the arch was a mass of men shouting screaming struggling and the gleam of steel and the scarlet of brave blood Dickie forgot all about the door below the window forgot all about his cousins forgot that he had found the treasure and that it was now his business to get himself and the others safely back to their own times He only saw the house he loved broken into by men he hated he saw the men he loved spending their blood like water to defend that house He drew the little sword that hung at his side and shouting An Arden an Arden he rushed towards the swaying staggering melee He reached it just as the leader of the attacking party had hewn his way through the Arden men and taken his first step on the flagged path of the courtyard The first step was his last He stopped a big burly fellow in a leathern coat and steel round cap and looked bewildered at the little figure coming at him with all the fire and courage of the Ardens burning in his blue eyes The big man laughed and as he laughed Dickie lunged with his sword the way his tutor had taught him and the little sword no tailor s ornament to a Court dress but a piece of true steel went straight and true up into the heart of that big rebel The man fell wrenching the blade from Dickie s hand A shout of fury went up from the enemy A shout of pride and triumph from the Arden men Men struggled and fought all about him Next moment Dickie s hands were tied with a handkerchief and he stood there breathless and trembling with pride Illustration I HAVE KILLED A MAN HE SAID Page two hundred ninety I have killed a man he said I have killed a man for the King and for Arden They shut him up in the fuel shed and locked the door Pride and anger filled him He could think of nothing but that one good thrust for the good cause But presently he remembered He had brought his cousins here he must get them back safely But how On a quiet evening on the road Beale had taught him how to untie hands tied behind the back He remembered the lesson now and set to work but it was slow work And all the time he was thinking thinking How could he get out He knew the fuel shed well enough The door was strong there was a beech bar outside But it was not roofed with tile or lead as the rest of the Castle was And Dickie knew something about thatch Not for nothing had he watched the men thatching the oast house by the Medway When his hands were free he stood up and felt for the pins that fasten the thatch Suddenly his hands fell by his side Even if he got out how could he find his cousins He would only be found by the rebels and be locked away more securely He lay down on the floor lay quite still there It was despair This was the end of all his cleverness He had brought Edred and Elfrida into danger and he could not get them back again His anger had led him to defy the Roundheads and to gratify his hate of them he had sacrificed those two who trusted him He lay there a long time and if he cried a little it was very dark in the fuel house and there was no one to see him He was not crying however but thinking thinking thinking and trying to find some way out when he heard a little scratch scratching on the corner of the shed He sat up and listened The scratching went on He held his breath Could it be that some one was trying to get in to help him Nonsense of course it was only a rat Next moment a voice spoke so close to him that he started and all but cried out Bide where you be lad bide still tis only me old Mouldiwarp of Arden You be a bold lad by my faith so you be Never an Arden better Never an Arden of them all Oh Mouldiwarp dear Mouldiwarp do help me I led them into this help me to get them back safe Do do do So I will den dere ain t no reason in getting all of a fluster It ain t fitten for a lad as as faced death same s what you ave said the voice I ve made a liddle tunnel for e so I ave ere in dis ere corner you come caten wise crose the floor and you ll feel it You crawl down it and outside you be sure enough Dickie went towards the voice and sure enough as the voice said there was a hole in the ground just big enough it seemed for him to crawl down on hands and knees I ll go afore said the Mouldiwarp you come arter Dere s naught to be afeared on Lord Arden Am I really Lord Arden said Dickie pausing Sure s I m alive you be the mole answered yer uncle ll tell it you with all de lawyer s reasons to morrow morning as sure s sure Come along den Dere ain t no time to lose So Dickie went down on his hands and knees and crept down the mole tunnel of soft sweet smelling earth and then along and then up and there they were in the courtyard There too were Edred and Elfrida The three children hugged each other and then turned to the Mouldiwarp How can we get home The old way he said and from the sky above a swan carriage suddenly swooped In with you said the Mouldiwarp swan carriages can take you from one time to another just as well as one place to another But we don t often use em cause why swans is dat contrary dey won t go invisible not for no magic dey won t So everybody can see em Still we can t pick nor choose when it s danger like dis ere In with you Be off with you This is the last you ll see o me Be off afore the soldiers sees you They squeezed into the swan carriage all three The white wings spread and the whole equipage rose into the air unseen by any one but a Roundhead sentinel who with great presence of mind gave the alarm and was kicked for his pains because when the guard turned out there was nothing to be seen The swans flew far too fast for the children to see where they were going and when the swans began to flap more slowly so that the children could have seen if there had been anything to see there was nothing to be seen because it was quite dark And the air was very cold But presently a light showed ahead and next moment there they were in the cave and stepped out of the carriage on the exact spot where Dickie had set out the moon seeds and Tinkler and the white seal The swan carriage went back up the cave with a swish and rustle of wings and the children went down the hill as quickly as they could which was not very quickly because of Dickie s poor lame foot The boy who had killed a Cromwell s man with his little sword had not been lame Arrived in the courtyard Dickie proudly led the way and stooped to examine the stones near the ruined arch that had been the chapel door Alas there was not a sign of the inscription which Dickie had scratched on the stone when the Roundheads were battering at the gates of Arden Castle Then Edred said Aha in a tone of triumph I took notice too he explained It s the fifth stone from the chapel door under the little window with the Arden arms carved over it There s no other window with that over it I ll get the cold chisel He got it and when he came back Dickie was on his knees by the wall and he had dug with his hands and uncovered the stone where he had scratched with the nails And there was the mark nineteen R D eight Only the nail had slipped once or twice while he was doing the nine so that it looked much more like a five fifteen R D eight There he said that s what I scratched That said Edred Why that s always been there We found that when we were digging about trying to find the treasure Quite at the beginning didn t we Elf And Elfrida agreed that this was so Well I scratched it anyway said Dickie Now then let me go ahead with the chisel Edred let him he knew how clever Dickie was with his hands for had he not made a work box for Elfrida and a tool chest for Edred both with lids that fitted Dickie got the point of the chisel between the stones and pried and pressed here and there and at the other end till the stone moved forward a little at a time and they were able to get hold of it and drag it out Behind was darkness a hollow Dickie plunged his arm in I can feel the door he said it s all right Let s fetch father suggested Elfrida he will enjoy it so So he was fetched Elfrida burst into the library where her father was busy with many lawyers letters and papers and also with the lawyer himself a stout jolly looking gentleman in a tweed suit not a bit like the long lean disagreeable black coated lawyers you read about in books Please daddy she cried we ve found the treasure Come and look What treasure and how often have I told you not to interrupt me when I am busy Oh well said Elfrida I only thought it would amuse you daddy We ve found a bricked up place and there s a door behind and I m almost sure it s where they hid the treasure when Cromwell s wicked men took the Castle There is a legend to that effect said Elfrida s father to the lawyer who was looking interested You must forgive us if our family enthusiasms obliterate our manners You have not said good morning to mister Roscoe Elfrida Good morning mister Roscoe said Elfrida cheerfully I thought it was the engineer s day and not the lawyer s I beg your pardon you wouldn t mind me bursting in if you knew how very important the treasure is to the fortunes of our house The lawyer laughed I am deeply interested in buried treasure It would be a great treat to me if Lord Arden would allow me to assist in the search for it There s no search now said Elfrida because it s found We ve been searching for ages Oh daddy do come you ll be sorry afterwards if you don t If mister Roscoe doesn t mind then said her father indulgently And the two followed Elfrida believing that they were just going to be kind and to take part in some childish game of make believe Their feelings were very different when they peeped through the hole where Dickie and Edred had removed two more stones and saw the dusty gray of the wooden door beyond Very soon all the stones were out and the door was disclosed The lock plate bore the arms of Arden and the door was not to be shaken We must get a locksmith said Lord Arden The big key with the arms on it cried Elfrida one of those in the iron box Mightn t that One flew to fetch it A good deal of oil and more patience were needed before the key consented to turn in the lock but it did turn and the low passage was disclosed It hardly seemed a passage at all so thick and low hung the curtain of dusty cobwebs But with brooms and lanterns and much sneezing and choking the whole party got through to the door of the treasure room And the other key unlocked that And there in real fact was the treasure just as the children had seen it the chests and the boxes and the leathern sacks and the bundles done up in straw and in handkerchiefs The lawyer who had come on a bicycle went off on it at racing speed to tell the Bank at Cliffville to come and fetch the treasure and to bring police to watch over it till it should be safe in the Bank vaults And I m child enough he said before he went as well as cautious enough to beg you not to bring any of it out till I come back and not to leave guarding the entrance till the police are here So when the treasure at last saw the light of day it saw it under the eyes of policemen and Bank managers and all the servants and all the family and the Beales and True and half the village beside who had got wind of the strange happenings at the Castle and had crowded in through the now undefended gate It was a glorious treasure gold and silver plate jewels and beautiful armor along with a pile of old parchments which mister Roscoe said were worth more than all the rest put together for they were the title deeds of great estates And now cried Beale let s ave a cheer for Lord Arden Long may e enjoy is find says I Ip ip ooray The cheers went up given with a good heart I thank you all said the father of Edred and Elfrida I thank you all from my heart And you may be sure that you shall share in this good fortune The old lands are in the market They will be bought back And every house on Arden land shall be made sound and weather tight and comfortable The Castle will be restored almost certainly And the fortunes of Arden s tenantry will be the fortunes of Arden Castle Another cheer went up But the speaker raised his hand and silence waited his next words I have something else to tell you he said and as well now as later This gentleman mister Roscoe my solicitor has this morning brought me news that I am not Lord Arden Loud murmurs of dissatisfaction from the crowd I have no claim to the title he went on grimly my father was a younger son the real heir was kidnapped and supposed to be dead so I inherited It is the grandson of that kidnapped heir who is Lord Arden I know his whole history I know what he has done to do honor to himself and to help others Hear hear from Beale I know all his life and I am proud that he is the head of our house He will do for you when he is of age all that I would have done And in the meantime I am his guardian This is Lord Arden he said throwing his arm round the shoulders of Dickie little lame Dickie who stood there leaning on his crutch pale as death This is Lord Arden come to his own Cheer for him men as you never cheered before Three cheers for Richard Lord Arden CHAPTER XII THE END WHAT a triumph for little lame Dickie of Deptford You think perhaps that he was happy as well as proud for proud he certainly was with those words and those cheers ringing in his ears He had just done the best he could and tried to help Beale and the dogs and the man who had thought himself to be Lord Arden had said I am proud that he should be the head of our house and all the Arden folk had cheered It was worth having lived for The unselfish kindness and affection of the man he had displaced the love of his little cousins the devotion of Beale the fact that he was Lord of Arden and would soon be lord of all the old acres the knowledge that now he would learn all he chose to learn and hold in his hand some day the destinies of these village folk all loyal to the name of Arden the thought of all that he could be and do all these things you think should have made him happy They would have made him happy but for one thing All this was won at the expense of those whom he loved best the children who were his dear cousins and playfellows the man their father who had moved heaven and earth to establish Dickie s claim to the title and had been content quietly to stand aside and give up title castle lands and treasure to the little cripple from Deptford Dickie thought of that and almost only of that in the days that followed The life he had led in that dream world when James the First was King seemed to him now a very little thing compared with the present glory of being the head of the house of Arden of being the Providence the loving over lord of all these good peasant folk who loved his name Yet the thought of those days when he was plain Richard Arden son of Sir Richard Arden living in the beautiful house at Deptford fretted at all his joy in his present state That and the thought of all he owed to him who had been Lord of Arden until he came with his lame foot and his heirship fretted his soul as rust frets steel These people had received him loved him been kind to him when he was only a tramp boy And he was repaying them by taking away from them priceless possessions For so he esteemed the lordship of Arden and the old lands and the old Castle Suppose he gave them up the priceless possessions Suppose he went away to that sure retreat that was still left him the past It was a sacrifice To give up the here and now for the far off the almost forgotten All that happy other life that had once held all for which he cared seemed thin and dream like beside the vivid glories of the life here now Yet he remembered how once that life in King James s time had seemed the best thing in the world and how he had chosen to come back from it to help a helpless middle aged ne er do weel of a tramp Beale Well he had helped Beale He had done what he set out to do For Beale s sake he had given up the beautiful life for the sordid life And Beale was a new man a man that Dickie had made Surely now he could give up one beautiful life for another for the sake of these his flesh and blood who had so readily so kindly so generously set him in the place that had been theirs More and more it came home to Dickie that this was what he had to do To go back to the times when James the First was King and never to return to these times at all It would be very bitter it would be like leaving home never to return It was exile Well was Richard Lord Arden to be afraid of exile or of anything else He must not just disappear either or they would search and search for him and never know that he was gone forever He must slip away and let the father of Edred and Elfrida be as he had been Lord Arden He must make it appear that he Richard Lord Arden was dead He thought over this very carefully But if he seemed to be dead Edred and Elfrida would be very unhappy Well they should not be unhappy He would tell them And then they would know that he had behaved well and as an Arden should Don t be hard on him for longing for just this little human praise There are very few of us who can do without it who can bear not to let some one very near and dear know that we have behaved rather decently on those occasions when that is what we have done It took Dickie a long time to think out all this clearly and with no mistakes But at last his mind was made up And then he asked Edred and Elfrida to come up to the cave with him because he had something to tell them When they were all there sitting on the smooth sand by the underground stream Dickie said Look here I m not going on being Lord Arden You can t help it said Edred Yes I can You know how I went and lived in King James s time Well I m going there again for good Illustration I VE THOUGHT OF NOTHING ELSE FOR A MONTH SAID DICKIE Page three hundred four You shan t said Elfrida I ll tell father I ve thought of all that Dickie said and I m going to ask the Mouldiwarps to make it so that you can t tell I can t stay here and feel that I m turning you and your father out And think what Edred did for me in this very cave No my mind s made up It was and they could not shake it But we shan t ever see you again Dickie admitted that this was so And oh Dickie said Elfrida with deep concern you won t ever see us again either Think of that Whatever will you do without us That said Dickie won t be so bad as you think The Elfrida and Edred who live in those times are as like you as two pins No they aren t really Oh don t make it any harder I ve got to do it There was that in his voice which silenced and convinced them They felt that he had indeed to do it I could never be happy here never he went on but I shall be happy there And you ll never forget me though there are one or two things I want you to forget And I m going now Oh not now wait and think Elfrida implored I ve thought of nothing else for a month said Dickie and began to lay out the moon seeds on the smooth sand Now he said when the pattern was complete I shall hold Tinkler and the white seal in my hand and take them with me When I ve gone you can put the moon seeds in your pocket and go home When they ask you where I am say I am in the cave They will come and find my clothes and they ll think I was bathing and got drowned I can t bear it said Elfrida bursting into sobs I can t and I won t I shan t be really dead silly Richard told her We re bound to meet again some day People who love each other can t help meeting again Old nurse told me so and she knows everything Good bye Elfrida He kissed her Good bye Edred old chap I d like to kiss you too if you don t mind I know boys don t but in the times I m going to men kiss each other Raleigh and Drake did you know The boys kissed shyly and awkwardly And now good bye said Richard and stepped inside the crossed triangles of moon seeds I wish he said slowly oh dear Mouldiwarps of Arden grant me these last wishes I wish Edred and Elfrida may never be able to tell what I have done And I wish that in a year they may forget what I have done and let them not be unhappy about me because I shall be very happy I know I shall he added doubtfully and paused Oh Dickie don t the other children cried out together He went on I wish my uncle may restore the Castle and take care of the poor people so that there aren t any poor people and every one s comfortable just as I meant to do He took off his cap and coat and flung them outside the circle his boots too I wish I may go back to James the First s time and live out my life there and do honor in my life and death to the house of Arden The children blinked Dickie and Tinkler and the white seal were gone and only the empty ring of moon seeds lay on the sand Shocking bathing fatality the newspapers said Lord Arden drowned The body not yet recovered It never was recovered of course Elfrida and Edred said nothing No wonder their elders said The shock was too great and too sudden The father of Edred and Elfrida is Lord Arden now He has done all that Dickie would have done He has made Arden the happiest and most prosperous village in England and the stream beside which Dickie bade farewell to his cousins flows a broad moat round the waters of the Castle restored now to all its own splendor There is a tablet in the church which tells of the death by drowning of Richard Sixteenth Lord Arden The children read it every Sunday for a year and knew that it did not tell the truth But by the time the moon seeds had grown and flowered and shed their seeds in the Castle garden they ceased to know this and talked often sadly and fondly of dear cousin Dickie who was drowned And at the same time they ceased to remember that they had ever been out of their own time into the past so that if they were to read this book they would think it all nonsense and make up and not in the least recognize the story as their own But whatever else is forgotten Dickie is remembered And he who gave up his life here for the sake of those he loved will live as long as life shall beat in the hearts of those who loved him And Dickie himself I see him in his ruff and cloak with his little sword by his side living out the life he has chosen in the old England when James the First was King I see him growing in grace and favor versed in book learning expert in all noble sports and exercises For Dickie is not lame now I see the roots of his being taking fast hold of his chosen life and the life that he renounced receding receding till he can hardly see it any more I see him a tall youth straight and strong lending the old nurse his arm to walk in the trim beautiful garden at Deptford And I hear him say When I was a little boy nurse I had mighty strange dreams of another life than this Forget them she says dreams go to the making of all proper men But now thou art a man forget the dreams of thy childhood and play the man to the glory of God and of the house of Arden And let thy dreams be of the life to come compared to which all lives on earth are only dreams And in that life all those who have loved shall meet and be together forevermore in that life when all the dear and noble dreams of the earthly life shall at last and forever be something more than dreams THE END Transcriber s Notes Obvious punctuation errors repaired List of Illustrations HUMPREYS changed to HUMPHREYS HERE HUMPHREYS PUT THESE Page six pennorth changed to penn orth
