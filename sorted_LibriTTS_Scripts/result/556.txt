upon a time Dan and Una brother and sister living in the English country had the good fortune to meet with Puck alias Robin Goodfellow alias Nick o Lincoln alias Lob lie by the Fire the last survivor in England of those whom mortals call Fairies Their proper name of course is The People of the Hills This Puck by means of the magic of Oak Ash and Thorn gave the children power To see what they should see and hear what they should hear Though it should have happened three thousand year The result was that from time to time and in different places on the farm and in the fields and in the country about they saw and talked to some rather interesting people One of these for instance was a Knight of the Norman Conquest another a young Centurion of a Roman Legion stationed in England another a builder and decorator of King Henry VII s time and so on and so forth as I have tried to explain in a book called PUCK OF POOK S HILL A year or so later the children met Puck once more and though they were then older and wiser and wore boots regularly instead of going barefooted when they got the chance Puck was as kind to them as ever and introduced them to more people of the old days He was careful of course to take away their memory of their walks and conversations afterwards but otherwise he did not interfere and Dan and Una would find the strangest sort of persons in their gardens or woods In the stories that follow I am trying to tell something about those people COLD IRON When Dan and Una had arranged to go out before breakfast they did not remember that it was Midsummer Morning They only wanted to see the otter which old Hobden said had been fishing their brook for weeks and early morning was the time to surprise him As they tiptoed out of the house into the wonderful stillness the church clock struck five Dan took a few steps across the dew blobbed lawn and looked at his black footprints I think we ought to be kind to our poor boots he said They ll get horrid wet It was their first summer in boots and they hated them so they took them off and slung them round their necks and paddled joyfully over the dripping turf where the shadows lay the wrong way like evening in the East The sun was well up and warm but by the brook the last of the night mist still fumed off the water They picked up the chain of otter s footprints on the mud and followed it from the bank between the weeds and the drenched mowing while the birds shouted with surprise Then the track left the brook and became a smear as though a log had been dragged along They traced it into Three Cows meadow over the mill sluice to the Forge round Hobden s garden and then up the slope till it ran out on the short turf and fern of Pook s Hill and they heard the cock pheasants crowing in the woods behind them No use said Dan questing like a puzzled hound The dew s drying off and old Hobden says otters ll travel for miles I m sure we ve travelled miles Una fanned herself with her hat How still it is It s going to be a regular roaster She looked down the valley where no chimney yet smoked Hobden s up Dan pointed to the open door of the Forge cottage What d you suppose he has for breakfast One of them He says they eat good all times of the year Una jerked her head at some stately pheasants going down to the brook for a drink A few steps farther on a fox broke almost under their bare feet yapped and trotted off Ah Mus Reynolds Mus Reynolds Dan was quoting from old Hobden if I knowed all you knowed I d know something See The Winged Hats in PUCK OF POOK S HILL I say Una lowered her voice you know that funny feeling of things having happened before I felt it when you said Mus Reynolds So did I Dan began What is it They faced each other stammering with excitement Wait a shake I ll remember in a minute Wasn t it something about a fox last year Oh I nearly had it then Dan cried Be quiet said Una prancing excitedly There was something happened before we met the fox last year Hills Broken Hills the play at the theatre see what you see I remember now Dan shouted It s as plain as the nose on your face Pook s Hill Puck s Hill Puck I remember too said Una And it s Midsummer Day again The young fern on a knoll rustled and Puck walked out chewing a green topped rush Good Midsummer Morning to you Here s a happy meeting said he They shook hands all round and asked questions You ve wintered well he said after a while and looked them up and down Nothing much wrong with you seemingly They ve put us into boots said Una Look at my feet they re all pale white and my toes are squidged together awfully Yes boots make a difference Puck wriggled his brown square hairy foot and cropped a dandelion flower between the big toe and the next I could do that last year Dan said dismally as he tried and failed And boots simply ruin one s climbing There must be some advantage to them I suppose said Puck or folk wouldn t wear them Shall we come this way They sauntered along side by side till they reached the gate at the far end of the hillside Here they halted just like cattle and let the sun warm their backs while they listened to the flies in the wood Little Lindens is awake said Una as she hung with her chin on the top rail See the chimney smoke Today s Thursday isn t it Puck turned to look at the old pink farmhouse across the little valley missus Vincey s baking day Bread should rise well this weather He yawned and that set them both yawning The bracken about rustled and ticked and shook in every direction They felt that little crowds were stealing past Doesn t that sound like er the People of the Hills said Una It s the birds and wild things drawing up to the woods before people get about said Puck as though he were Ridley the keeper Oh we know that I only said it sounded like As I remember em the People of the Hills used to make more noise They d settle down for the day rather like small birds settling down for the night But that was in the days when they carried the high hand Oh me The deeds that I ve had act and part in you d scarcely believe I like that said Dan After all you told us last year too Only the minute you went away you made us forget everything said Una Puck laughed and shook his head I shall this year too I ve given you seizin of Old England and I ve taken away your Doubt and Fear but your memory and remembrance between whiles I ll keep where old Billy Trott kept his night lines and that s where he could draw em up and hide em at need Does that suit He twinkled mischievously It s got to suit said Una and laughed We Can t magic back at you She folded her arms and leaned against the gate Suppose now you wanted to magic me into something an otter Could you Not with those boots round your neck I ll take them off She threw them on the turf Dan s followed immediately Now she said Less than ever now you ve trusted me Where there s true faith there s no call for magic Puck s slow smile broadened all over his face But what have boots to do with it said Una perching on the gate There s Cold Iron in them said Puck and settled beside her Nails in the soles I mean It makes a difference How Can t you feel it does You wouldn t like to go back to bare feet again same as last year would you Not really No o I suppose I shouldn t not for always I m growing up you know said Una But you told us last year in the Long Slip at the theatre that you didn t mind Cold Iron said Dan I don t but folks in housen as the People of the Hills call them must be ruled by Cold Iron Folk in housen are born on the near side of Cold Iron there s iron in every man s house isn t there They handle Cold Iron every day of their lives and their fortune s made or spoilt by Cold Iron in some shape or other That s how it goes with Flesh and Blood and one can t prevent it I don t quite see How do you mean said Dan It would take me some time to tell you Oh it s ever so long to breakfast said Dan We looked in the larder before we came out He unpocketed one big hunk of bread and Una another which they shared with Puck That s Little Lindens baking he said as his white teeth sunk in it I know missus Vincey s hand He ate with a slow sideways thrust and grind just like old Hobden and like Hobden hardly dropped a crumb The sun flashed on Little Lindens windows and the cloudless sky grew stiller and hotter in the valley AH Cold Iron he said at last to the impatient children Folk in housen as the People of the Hills say grow careless about Cold Iron They ll nail the Horseshoe over the front door and forget to put it over the back Then some time or other the People of the Hills slip in find the cradle babe in the corner and Oh I know Steal it and leave a changeling Una cried No said Puck firmly All that talk of changelings is people s excuse for their own neglect Never believe em I d whip em at the cart tail through three parishes if I had my way But they don t do it now said Una Whip or neglect children Umm Some folks and some fields never alter But the People of the Hills didn t work any changeling tricks They d tiptoe in and whisper and weave round the cradle babe in the chimney corner a fag end of a charm here or half a spell there like kettles singing but when the babe s mind came to bud out afterwards it would act differently from other people in its station That s no advantage to man or maid So I wouldn t allow it with my folks babies here I told Sir Huon so once Who was Sir Huon Dan asked and Puck turned on him in quiet astonishment Sir Huon of Bordeaux he succeeded King Oberon He had been a bold knight once but he was lost on the road to Babylon a long while back Have you ever heard How many miles to Babylon Of course said Dan flushing Well Sir Huon was young when that song was new But about tricks on mortal babies I said to Sir Huon in the fern here on just such a morning as this If you crave to act and influence on folk in housen which I know is your desire why don t you take some human cradle babe by fair dealing and bring him up among yourselves on the far side of Cold Iron as Oberon did in time past Then you could make him a splendid fortune and send him out into the world Time past is past time says Sir Huon I doubt if we could do it For one thing the babe would have to be taken without wronging man woman or child For another he d have to be born on the far side of Cold Iron in some house where no Cold Iron ever stood and for yet the third he d have to be kept from Cold Iron all his days till we let him find his fortune No it s not easy he said and he rode off thinking You see Sir Huon had been a man once I happened to attend Lewes Market next Woden s Day even and watched the slaves being sold there same as pigs are sold at Robertsbridge Market nowadays Only the pigs have rings on their noses and the slaves had rings round their necks What sort of rings said Dan A ring of Cold Iron four fingers wide and a thumb thick just like a quoit but with a snap to it for to snap round the slave s neck They used to do a big trade in slave rings at the Forge here and ship them to all parts of Old England packed in oak sawdust But as I was saying there was a farmer out of the Weald who had bought a woman with a babe in her arms and he didn t want any encumbrances to her driving his beasts home for him Beast himself said Una and kicked her bare heel on the gate So he blamed the auctioneer It s none o my baby the wench puts in I took it off a woman in our gang who died on Terrible Down yesterday I ll take it off to the church then says the farmer Mother Church ll make a monk of it and we ll step along home It was dusk then He slipped down to saint Pancras Church and laid the babe at the cold chapel door I breathed on the back of his stooping neck and I ve heard he never could be warm at any fire afterwards I should have been surprised if he could Then I whipped up the babe and came flying home here like a bat to his belfry On the dewy break of morning of Thor s own day just such a day as this I laid the babe outside the Hill here and the People flocked up and wondered at the sight You ve brought him then Sir Huon said staring like any mortal man Yes and he s brought his mouth with him too I said The babe was crying loud for his breakfast What is he says Sir Huon when the womenfolk had drawn him under to feed him Full Moon and Morning Star may know I says I don t By what I could make out of him in the moonlight he s without brand or blemish I ll answer for it that he s born on the far side of Cold Iron for he was born under a shaw on Terrible Down and I ve wronged neither man woman nor child in taking him for he is the son of a dead slave woman All to the good Robin Sir Huon said He ll be the less anxious to leave us Oh we ll give him a splendid fortune and we shall act and influence on folk in housen as we have always craved His Lady came up then and drew him under to watch the babe s wonderful doings Who was his Lady said Dan The Lady Esclairmonde She had been a woman once till she followed Sir Huon across the fern as we say Babies are no special treat to me I ve watched too many of them so I stayed on the Hill Presently I heard hammering down at the Forge there Puck pointed towards Hobden s cottage It was too early for any workmen but it passed through my mind that the breaking day was Thor s own day A slow north east wind blew up and set the oaks sawing and fretting in a way I remembered so I slipped over to see what I could see And what did you see A smith forging something or other out of Cold Iron When it was finished he weighed it in his hand his back was towards me and tossed it from him a longish quoit throw down the valley I saw Cold Iron flash in the sun but I couldn t quite make out where it fell That didn t trouble me I knew it would be found sooner or later by someone How did you know Dan went on Because I knew the Smith that made it said Puck quietly Wayland Smith Una suggested See Weland s Sword in PUCK OF POOK S HILL No I should have passed the time o day with Wayland Smith of course This other was different So Puck made a queer crescent in the air with his finger I counted the blades of grass under my nose till the wind dropped and he had gone he and his Hammer Was it Thor then Una murmured under her breath Who else It was Thor s own day Puck repeated the sign I didn t tell Sir Huon or his Lady what I d seen Borrow trouble for yourself if that s your nature but don t lend it to your neighbours Moreover I might have been mistaken about the Smith s work He might have been making things for mere amusement though it wasn t like him or he might have thrown away an old piece of made iron One can never be sure So I held my tongue and enjoyed the babe He was a wonderful child and the People of the Hills were so set on him they wouldn t have believed me He took to me wonderfully As soon as he could walk he d putter forth with me all about my Hill here Fern makes soft falling He knew when day broke on earth above for he d thump thump thump like an old buck rabbit in a bury and I d hear him say Opy till some one who knew the Charm let him out and then it would be Robin Robin all round Robin Hood s barn as we say till he d found me The dear said Una I d like to have seen him Yes he was a boy And when it came to learning his words spells and such like he d sit on the Hill in the long shadows worrying out bits of charms to try on passersby And when the bird flew to him or the tree bowed to him for pure love s sake like everything else on my Hill he d shout Robin Look see Look see Robin and sputter out some spell or other that they had taught him all wrong end first till I hadn t the heart to tell him it was his own dear self and not the words that worked the wonder When he got more abreast of his words and could cast spells for sure as we say he took more and more notice of things and people in the world People of course always drew him for he was mortal all through Seeing that he was free to move among folk in housen under or over Cold Iron I used to take him along with me night walking where he could watch folk and I could keep him from touching Cold Iron That wasn t so difficult as it sounds because there are plenty of things besides Cold Iron in housen to catch a boy s fancy He was a handful though I shan t forget when I took him to Little Lindens his first night under a roof The smell of the rushlights and the bacon on the beams they were stuffing a feather bed too and it was a drizzling warm night got into his head Before I could stop him we were hiding in the bakehouse he d whipped up a storm of wildfire with flashlights and voices which sent the folk shrieking into the garden and a girl overset a hive there and of course he didn t know till then such things could touch him he got badly stung and came home with his face looking like kidney potatoes You can imagine how angry Sir Huon and Lady Esclairmonde were with poor Robin They said the Boy was never to be trusted with me night walking any more and he took about as much notice of their order as he did of the bee stings Night after night as soon as it was dark I d pick up his whistle in the wet fern and off we d flit together among folk in housen till break of day he asking questions and I answering according to my knowledge Then we fell into mischief again Puck shook till the gate rattled We came across a man up at Brightling who was beating his wife with a bat in the garden I was just going to toss the man over his own woodlump when the Boy jumped the hedge and ran at him Of course the woman took her husband s part and while the man beat him the woman scratted his face It wasn t till I danced among the cabbages like Brightling Beacon all ablaze that they gave up and ran indoors The Boy s fine green and gold clothes were torn all to pieces and he had been welted in twenty places with the man s bat and scratted by the woman s nails to pieces He looked like a Robertsbridge hopper on a Monday morning Robin said he while I was trying to clean him down with a bunch of hay I don t quite understand folk in housen I went to help that old woman and she hit me Robin What else did you expect I said That was the one time when you might have worked one of your charms instead of running into three times your weight I didn t think he says But I caught the man one on the head that was as good as any charm Did you see it work Robin Mind your nose I said Bleed it on a dockleaf not your sleeve for pity s sake I knew what the Lady Esclairmonde would say He didn t care He was as happy as a gipsy with a stolen pony and the front part of his gold coat all blood and grass stains looked like ancient sacrifices Of course the People of the Hills laid the blame on me The Boy could do nothing wrong in their eyes You are bringing him up to act and influence on folk in housen when you re ready to let him go I said Now he s begun to do it why do you cry shame on me That s no shame It s his nature drawing him to his kind But we don t want him to begin that way the Lady Esclairmonde said We intend a splendid fortune for him not your flitter by night hedge jumping gipsy work I don t blame you Robin says Sir Huon but I do think you might look after the Boy more closely I ve kept him away from Cold Iron these sixteen years I said You know as well as I do the first time he touches Cold Iron he ll find his own fortune in spite of everything you intend for him You owe me something for that Sir Huon having been a man was going to allow me the right of it but the Lady Esclairmonde being the Mother of all Mothers over persuaded him We re very grateful Sir Huon said but we think that just for the present you are about too much with him on the Hill Though you have said it I said I will give you a second chance I did not like being called to account for my doings on my own Hill I wouldn t have stood it even that far except I loved the Boy No No says the Lady Esclairmonde He s never any trouble when he s left to me and himself It s your fault You have said it I answered Hear me From now on till the Boy has found his fortune whatever that may be I vow to you all on my Hill by Oak and Ash and Thorn and by the Hammer of Asa Thor again Puck made that curious double cut in the air that you may leave me out of all your counts and reckonings Then I went out he snapped his fingers like the puff of a candle and though they called and cried they made nothing by it I didn t promise not to keep an eye on the Boy though I watched him close close close When he found what his people had forced me to do he gave them a piece of his mind but they all kissed and cried round him and being only a boy he came over to their way of thinking I don t blame him and called himself unkind and ungrateful and it all ended in fresh shows and plays and magics to distract him from folk in housen Dear heart alive How he used to call and call on me and I couldn t answer or even let him know that I was near Not even once said Una If he was very lonely No he couldn t said Dan who had been thinking Didn t you swear by the Hammer of Thor that you wouldn t Puck By that Hammer was the deep rumbled reply Then he came back to his soft speaking voice And the Boy was lonely when he couldn t see me any more He began to try to learn all learning he had good teachers but I saw him lift his eyes from the big black books towards folk in housen all the time He studied song making good teachers he had too but he sang those songs with his back toward the Hill and his face toward folk I know I have sat and grieved over him grieving within a rabbit s jump of him Then he studied the High Low and Middle Magic He had promised the Lady Esclairmonde he would never go near folk in housen so he had to make shows and shadows for his mind to chew on What sort of shows said Dan Just boy s Magic as we say I ll show you some some time It pleased him for the while and it didn t hurt any one in particular except a few men coming home late from the taverns But I knew what it was a sign of and I followed him like a weasel follows a rabbit As good a boy as ever lived I ve seen him with Sir Huon and the Lady Esclairmonde stepping just as they stepped to avoid the track of Cold Iron in a furrow or walking wide of some old ash tot because a man had left his swop hook or spade there and all his heart aching to go straightforward among folk in housen all the time Oh a good boy They always intended a fine fortune for him but they could never find it in their heart to let him begin I ve heard that many warned them but they wouldn t be warned So it happened as it happened One hot night I saw the Boy roving about here wrapped in his flaming discontents There was flash on flash against the clouds and rush on rush of shadows down the valley till the shaws were full of his hounds giving tongue and the woodways were packed with his knights in armour riding down into the water mists all his own Magic of course Behind them you could see great castles lifting slow and splendid on arches of moonshine with maidens waving their hands at the windows which all turned into roaring rivers and then would come the darkness of his own young heart wiping out the whole slateful But boy s Magic doesn t trouble me or Merlin s either for that matter I followed the Boy by the flashes and the whirling wildfire of his discontent and oh but I grieved for him Oh but I grieved for him He pounded back and forth like a bullock in a strange pasture sometimes alone sometimes waist deep among his shadow hounds sometimes leading his shadow knights on a hawk winged horse to rescue his shadow girls I never guessed he had such Magic at his command but it s often that way with boys Just when the owl comes home for the second time I saw Sir Huon and the Lady ride down my Hill where there s not much Magic allowed except mine They were very pleased at the Boy s Magic the valley flared with it and I heard them settling his splendid fortune when they should find it in their hearts to let him go to act and influence among folk in housen Sir Huon was for making him a great King somewhere or other and the Lady was for making him a marvellous wise man whom all should praise for his skill and kindness She was very kind hearted Of a sudden we saw the flashes of his discontents turned back on the clouds and his shadow hounds stopped baying There s Magic fighting Magic over yonder the Lady Esclairmonde cried reigning up Who is against him I could have told her but I did not count it any of my business to speak of Asa Thor s comings and goings How did you know said Una A slow North East wind blew up sawing and fretting through the oaks in a way I remembered The wildfire roared up one last time in one sheet and snuffed out like a rushlight and a bucketful of stinging hail fell We heard the Boy walking in the Long Slip where I first met you Here oh come here said the Lady Esclairmonde and stretched out her arms in the dark He was coming slowly but he stumbled in the footpath being of course mortal man Why what s this he said to himself We three heard him Hold lad hold Ware Cold Iron said Sir Huon and they two swept down like nightjars crying as they rode I ran at their stirrups but it was too late We felt that the Boy had touched Cold Iron somewhere in the dark for the Horses of the Hill shied off and whipped round snorting Then I judged it was time for me to show myself in my own shape so I did Whatever it is I said he has taken hold of it Now we must find out whatever it is that he has taken hold of for that will be his fortune Come here Robin the Boy shouted as soon as he heard my voice I don t know what I ve hold of It is in your hands I called back Tell us if it is hard and cold with jewels atop For that will be a King s Sceptre Not by a furrow long he said and stooped and tugged in the dark We heard him Has it a handle and two cutting edges I called For that ll be a Knight s Sword No it hasn t he says It s neither ploughshare whittle hook nor crook nor aught I ve yet seen men handle By this time he was scratting in the dirt to prise it up Whatever it is you know who put it there Robin said Sir Huon to me or you would not ask those questions You should have told me as soon as you knew What could you or I have done against the Smith that made it and laid it for him to find I said and I whispered Sir Huon what I had seen at the Forge on Thor s Day when the babe was first brought to the Hill Oh good bye our dreams said Sir Huon It s neither sceptre sword nor plough Maybe yet it s a bookful of learning bound with iron clasps There s a chance for a splendid fortune in that sometimes But we knew we were only speaking to comfort ourselves and the Lady Esclairmonde having been a woman said so Thur aie Thor help us the Boy called It is round without end Cold Iron four fingers wide and a thumb thick and there is writing on the breadth of it Read the writing if you have the learning I called The darkness had lifted by then and the owl was out over the fern again He called back reading the runes on the iron Few can see Further forth Than when the child Meets the Cold Iron And there he stood in clear starlight with a new heavy shining slave ring round his proud neck Is this how it goes he asked while the Lady Esclairmonde cried That is how it goes I said He hadn t snapped the catch home yet though What fortune does it mean for him said Sir Huon while the Boy fingered the ring You who walk under Cold Iron you must tell us and teach us Tell I can but teach I cannot I said The virtue of the Ring is only that he must go among folk in housen henceforward doing what they want done or what he knows they need all Old England over Never will he be his own master nor yet ever any man s He will get half he gives and give twice what he gets till his life s last breath and if he lays aside his load before he draws that last breath all his work will go for naught Oh cruel wicked Thor cried the Lady Esclairmonde Ah look see all of you The catch is still open He hasn t locked it He can still take it off He can still come back Come back She went as near as she dared but she could not lay hands on Cold Iron The Boy could have taken it off yes We waited to see if he would but he put up his hand and the snap locked home What else could I have done said he Surely then you will do I said Morning s coming and if you three have any farewells to make make them now for after sunrise Cold Iron must be your master So the three sat down cheek by wet cheek telling over their farewells till morning light As good a boy as ever lived he was And what happened to him asked Dan When morning came Cold Iron was master of him and his fortune and he went to work among folk in housen Presently he came across a maid like minded with himself and they were wedded and had bushels of children as the saying is Perhaps you ll meet some of his breed this year Thank you said Una But what did the poor Lady Esclairmonde do What can you do when Asa Thor lays the Cold Iron in a lad s path She and Sir Huon were comforted to think they had given the Boy good store of learning to act and influence on folk in housen For he was a good boy Isn t it getting on for breakfast time I ll walk with you a piece When they were well in the centre of the bone dry fern Dan nudged Una who stopped and put on a boot as quickly as she could Now she said you can t get any Oak Ash and Thorn leaves from here and she balanced wildly on one leg I m standing on Cold Iron What ll you do if we don t go away E eh Of all mortal impudence said Puck as Dan also in one boot grabbed his sister s hand to steady himself He walked round them shaking with delight You think I can only work with a handful of dead leaves This comes of taking away your Doubt and Fear I ll show you A minute later they charged into old Hobden at his simple breakfast of cold roast pheasant shouting that there was a wasps nest in the fern which they had nearly stepped on and asking him to come and smoke it out It s too early for wops nests an I don t go diggin in the Hill not for shillin s said the old man placidly You ve a thorn in your foot Miss Una Sit down and put on your t other boot You re too old to be caperin barefoot on an empty stomach Stay it with this chicken o mine Cold Iron Gold is for the mistress silver for the maid Copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade Good said the Baron sitting in his hall But Iron Cold Iron is master of them all So he made rebellion gainst the King his liege Camped before his citadel and summoned it to siege Nay said the cannoneer on the castle wall But Iron Cold Iron shall be master of you all Woe for the Baron and his knights so strong When the cruel cannon balls laid em all along He was taken prisoner he was cast in thrall And Iron Cold Iron was master of it all Yet his King spake kindly Oh how kind a Lord What if I release thee now and give thee back thy sword Nay said the Baron mock not at my fall For Iron Cold Iron is master of men all Tears are for the craven prayers are for the clown Halters for the silly neck that cannot keep a crown As my loss is grievous so my hope is small For Iron Cold Iron must be master of men all Yet his King made answer few such Kings there be Here is Bread and here is Wine sit and sup with me Eat and drink in Mary s Name the whiles I do recall How Iron Cold Iron can be master of men all He took the Wine and blessed It He blessed and brake the Bread With His own Hands He served Them and presently He said Look These Hands they pierced with nails outside my city wall Show Iron Cold Iron to be master of men all Wounds are for the desperate blows are for the strong Balm and oil for weary hearts all cut and bruised with wrong I forgive thy treason I redeem thy fall For Iron Cold Iron must be master of men all Crowns are for the valiant sceptres for the bold Thrones and powers for mighty men who dare to take and hold Nay said the Baron kneeling in his hall But Iron Cold Iron is master of men all Iron out of Calvary is master of men all GLORIANA The Two Cousins Valour and Innocence Have latterly gone hence To certain death by certain shame attended Envy ah even to tears The fortune of their years Which though so few yet so divinely ended Scarce had they lifted up Life s full and fiery cup Than they had set it down untouched before them Before their day arose They beckoned it to close Close in destruction and confusion o er them They did not stay to ask What prize should crown their task Well sure that prize was such as no man strives for But passed into eclipse Her kiss upon their lips Even Belphoebe s whom they gave their lives for Gloriana Willow Shaw the little fenced wood where the hop poles are stacked like Indian wigwams had been given to Dan and Una for their very own kingdom when they were quite small As they grew older they contrived to keep it most particularly private Even Phillips the gardener told them every time that he came in to take a hop pole for his beans and old Hobden would no more have thought of setting his rabbit wires there without leave given fresh each spring than he would have torn down the calico and marking ink notice on the big willow which said Grown ups not allowed in the Kingdom unless brought Now you can understand their indignation when one blowy July afternoon as they were going up for a potato roast they saw somebody moving among the trees They hurled themselves over the gate dropping half the potatoes and while they were picking them up Puck came out of a wigwam Oh it s you is it said Una We thought it was people I saw you were angry from your legs he answered with a grin Well it s our own Kingdom not counting you of course That s rather why I came A lady here wants to see you What about said Dan cautiously Oh just Kingdoms and things She knows about Kingdoms There was a lady near the fence dressed in a long dark cloak that hid everything except her high red heeled shoes Her face was half covered by a black silk fringed mask without goggles And yet she did not look in the least as if she motored Puck led them up to her and bowed solemnly Una made the best dancing lesson curtsy she could remember The lady answered with a long deep slow billowy one Since it seems that you are a Queen of this Kingdom she said I can do no less than acknowledge your sovereignty She turned sharply on staring Dan What s in your head lad Manners I was thinking how wonderfully you did that curtsy he answered She laughed a rather shrill laugh You re a courtier already Do you know anything of dances wench or Queen must I say I ve had some lessons but I can t really dance a bit said Una You should learn then The lady moved forward as though she would teach her at once It gives a woman alone among men or her enemies time to think how she shall win or lose A woman can only work in man s play time Heigho She sat down on the bank Old Middenboro the lawn mower pony stumped across the paddock and hung his sorrowful head over the fence A pleasant Kingdom said the lady looking round Well enclosed And how does your Majesty govern it Who is your Minister Una did not quite understand We don t play that she said Play The lady threw up her hands and laughed We have it for our own together Dan explained And d you never quarrel young Burleigh Sometimes but then we don t tell The lady nodded I ve no brats of my own but I understand keeping a secret between Queens and their Ministers Ay de mi But with no disrespect to present majesty methinks your realm small and therefore likely to be coveted by man and beast For Is example she pointed to Middenboro yonder old horse with the face of a Spanish friar does he never break in He can t Old Hobden stops all our gaps for us said Una and we let Hobden catch rabbits in the Shaw The lady laughed like a man I see Hobden catches conies rabbits for himself and guards your defences for you Does he make a profit out of his coney catching We never ask said Una Hobden s a particular friend of ours Hoity toity the lady began angrily Then she laughed But I forget It is your Kingdom I knew a maid once that had a larger one than this to defend and so long as her men kept the fences stopped she asked em no questions either Was she trying to grow flowers said Una No trees perdurable trees Her flowers all withered The lady leaned her head on her hand They do if you don t look after them We ve got a few Would you like to see I ll fetch you some Una ran off to the rank grass in the shade behind the wigwam and came back with a handful of red flowers Aren t they pretty she said They re Virginia stock Virginia said the lady and lifted them to the fringe of her mask Yes They come from Virginia Did your maid ever plant any Not herself but her men adventured all over the earth to pluck or to plant flowers for her crown They judged her worthy of them And was she said Dan cheerfully Quien sabe who knows But at least while her men toiled abroad she toiled in England that they might find a safe home to come back to And what was she called Gloriana Belphoebe Elizabeth of England Her voice changed at each word You mean Queen Bess The lady bowed her head a little towards Dan You name her lightly enough young Burleigh What might you know of her said she Well I I ve seen the little green shoes she left at Brickwall House down the road you know They re in a glass case awfully tiny things Oh Burleigh Burleigh she laughed You are a courtier too soon But they are Dan insisted As little as dolls shoes Did you really know her well Well She was a woman I ve been at her Court all my life Yes I remember when she danced after the banquet at Brickwall They say she danced Philip of Spain out of a brand new kingdom that day Worth the price of a pair of old shoes hey She thrust out one foot and stooped forward to look at its broad flashing buckle You ve heard of Philip of Spain long suffering Philip she said her eyes still on the shining stones Faith what some men will endure at some women s hands passes belief If I had been a man and a woman had played with me as Elizabeth played with Philip I would have She nipped off one of the Virginia stocks and held it up between finger and thumb But for all that she began to strip the leaves one by one they say and I am persuaded that Philip loved her She tossed her head sideways I don t quite understand said Una The high heavens forbid that you should wench She swept the flowers from her lap and stood up in the rush of shadows that the wind chased through the wood I should like to know about the shoes said Dan So ye shall Burleigh So ye shall if ye watch me Twill be as good as a play We ve never been to a play said Una The lady looked at her and laughed I ll make one for you Watch You are to imagine that she Gloriana Belphoebe Elizabeth has gone on a progress to Rye to comfort her sad heart maids are often melancholic and while she halts at Brickwall House the village what was its name She pushed Puck with her foot Norgem he croaked and squatted by the wigwam Norgem village loyally entertains her with a masque or play and a Latin oration spoken by the parson for whose false quantities if I d made em in my girlhood I should have been whipped You whipped said Dan Soundly sirrah soundly She stomachs the affront to her scholarship makes her grateful gracious thanks from the teeth outwards thus the lady yawned Oh a Queen may love her subjects in her heart and yet be dog wearied of em in body and mind and so sits down her skirts foamed about her as she sat to a banquet beneath Brickwall Oak Here for her sins she is waited upon by What were the young cockerels names that served Gloriana at table Frewens Courthopes Fullers Husseys Puck began She held up her long jewelled hand Spare the rest They were the best blood of Sussex and by so much the more clumsy in handling the dishes and plates Wherefore she looked funnily over her shoulder you are to think of Gloriana in a green and gold laced habit dreadfully expecting that the jostling youths behind her would of pure jealousy or devotion spatter it with sauces and wines The gown was Philip s gift too At this happy juncture a Queen s messenger mounted and mired spurs up the Rye road and delivers her a letter she giggled a letter from a good simple frantic Spanish gentleman called Don Philip That wasn t Philip King of Spain Dan asked Truly it was Twixt you and me and the bedpost young Burleigh these kings and queens are very like men and women and I ve heard they write each other fond foolish letters that none of their ministers should open Did her ministers ever open Queen Elizabeth s letters said Una Faith yes But she d have done as much for theirs any day You are to think of Gloriana then they say she had a pretty hand excusing herself thus to the company for the Queen s time is never her own and while the music strikes up reading Philip s letter as I do She drew a real letter from her pocket and held it out almost at arm s length like the old post mistress in the village when she reads telegrams Hm Hm Hm Philip writes as ever most lovingly He says his Gloriana is cold for which reason he burns for her through a fair written page She turned it with a snap What s here Philip complains that certain of her gentlemen have fought against his generals in the Low Countries He prays her to hang em when they re enter her realms Hm that s as may be Here s a list of burnt shipping slipped between two vows of burning adoration Oh poor Philip His admirals at sea no less than three of em have been boarded sacked and scuttled on their lawful voyages by certain English mariners gentlemen he will not call them who are now at large and working more piracies in his American ocean which the Pope gave him He and the Pope should guard it then Philip hears but his devout ears will not credit it that Gloriana in some fashion countenances these villains misdeeds shares in their booty and oh shame has even lent them ships royal for their sinful thefts Therefore he requires which is a word Gloriana loves not requires that she shall hang em when they return to England and afterwards shall account to him for all the goods and gold they have plundered A most loving request If Gloriana will not be Philip s bride she shall be his broker and his butcher Should she still be stiff necked he writes see where the pen digged the innocent paper that he hath both the means and the intention to be revenged on her Aha Now we come to the Spaniard in his shirt She waved the letter merrily Listen here Philip will prepare for Gloriana a destruction from the West a destruction from the West far exceeding that which Pedro de Avila wrought upon the Huguenots And he rests and remains kissing her feet and her hands her slave her enemy or her conqueror as he shall find that she uses him She thrust back the letter under her cloak and went on acting but in a softer voice All this while hark to it the wind blows through Brickwall Oak the music plays and with the company s eyes upon her the Queen of England must think what this means She cannot remember the name of Pedro de Avila nor what he did to the Huguenots nor when nor where She can only see darkly some dark motion moving in Philip s dark mind for he hath never written before in this fashion She must smile above the letter as though it were good news from her ministers the smile that tires the mouth and the poor heart What shall she do Again her voice changed You are to fancy that the music of a sudden wavers away Chris Hatton Captain of her bodyguard quits the table all red and ruffled and Gloriana s virgin ear catches the clash of swords at work behind a wall The mothers of Sussex look round to count their chicks I mean those young gamecocks that waited on her Two dainty youths have stepped aside into Brickwall garden with rapier and dagger on a private point of honour They are haled out through the gate disarmed and glaring the lively image of a brace of young Cupids transformed into pale panting Cains Ahem Gloriana beckons awfully thus They come up for judgement Their lives and estates lie at her mercy whom they have doubly offended both as Queen and woman But la what will not foolish young men do for a beautiful maid Why What did she do What had they done said Una Hsh You mar the play Gloriana had guessed the cause of the trouble They were handsome lads So she frowns a while and tells em not to be bigger fools than their mothers had made em and warns em if they do not kiss and be friends on the instant she ll have Chris Hatton horse and birch em in the style of the new school at Harrow Chris looks sour at that Lastly because she needed time to think on Philip s letter burning in her pocket she signifies her pleasure to dance with em and teach em better manners Whereat the revived company call down Heaven s blessing on her gracious head Chris and the others prepare Brickwall House for a dance and she walks in the clipped garden between those two lovely young sinners who are both ready to sink for shame They confess their fault It appears that midway in the banquet the elder they were cousins conceived that the Queen looked upon him with special favour The younger taking the look to himself after some words gives the elder the lie Hence as she guessed the duel And which had she really looked at Dan asked Neither except to wish them farther off She was afraid all the while they d spill dishes on her gown She tells em this poor chicks and it completes their abasement When they had grilled long enough she says And so you would have fleshed your maiden swords for me for me Faith they would have been at it again if she d egged em on but their swords oh prettily they said it had been drawn for her once or twice already And where says she On your hobby horses before you were breeched On my own ship says the elder My cousin was vice admiral of our venture in his pinnace We would not have you think of us as brawling children No no says the younger and flames like a very Tudor rose At least the Spaniards know us better Admiral Boy Vice Admiral Babe says Gloriana I cry your pardon The heat of these present times ripens childhood to age more quickly than I can follow But we are at peace with Spain Where did you break your Queen s peace On the sea called the Spanish Main though tis no more Spanish than my doublet says the elder Guess how that warmed Gloriana s already melting heart She would never suffer any sea to be called Spanish in her private hearing And why was I not told What booty got you and where have you hid it Disclose says she You stand in some danger of the gallows for pirates The axe most gracious lady says the elder for we are gentle born He spoke truth but no woman can brook contradiction Hoity toity says she and but that she remembered that she was Queen she d have cuffed the pair of em It shall be gallows hurdle and dung cart if I choose Had our Queen known of our going beforehand Philip might have held her to blame for some small things we did on the seas the younger lisps As for treasure says the elder we brought back but our bare lives We were wrecked on the Gascons Graveyard where our sole company for three months was the bleached bones of De Avila s men Gloriana s mind jumped back to Philip s last letter De Avila that destroyed the Huguenots What d you know of him she says The music called from the house here and they three turned back between the yews Simply that De Avila broke in upon a plantation of Frenchmen on that coast and very Spaniardly hung them all for heretics eight hundred or so The next year Dominique de Gorgues a Gascon broke in upon De Avila s men and very justly hung em all for murderers five hundred or so No Christians inhabit there now says the elder lad though tis a goodly land north of Florida How far is it from England asks prudent Gloriana With a fair wind six weeks They say that Philip will plant it again soon This was the younger and he looked at her out of the corner of his innocent eye Chris Hatton fuming meets and leads her into Brickwall Hall where she dances thus A woman can think while she dances can think I ll show you Watch She took off her cloak slowly and stood forth in dove coloured satin worked over with pearls that trembled like running water in the running shadows of the trees Still talking more to herself than to the children she swam into a majestical dance of the stateliest balancings the naughtiest wheelings and turnings aside the most dignified sinkings the gravest risings all joined together by the elaboratest interlacing steps and circles They leaned forward breathlessly to watch the splendid acting Would a Spaniard she began looking on the ground speak of his revenge till his revenge were ripe No Yet a man who loved a woman might threaten her in the hope that his threats would make her love him Such things have been She moved slowly across a bar of sunlight A destruction from the West may signify that Philip means to descend on Ireland But then my Irish spies would have had some warning The Irish keep no secrets No it is not Ireland Now why why why the red shoes clicked and paused does Philip name Pedro Melendez de Avila a general in his Americas unless she turned more quickly unless he intends to work his destruction from the Americas Did he say De Avila only to put her off her guard or for this once has his black pen betrayed his black heart We she raised herself to her full height England must forestall Master Philip But not openly she sank again we cannot fight Spain openly not yet not yet She stepped three paces as though she were pegging down some snare with her twinkling shoe buckles The Queen s mad gentlemen may fight Philip s poor admirals where they find em but England Gloriana Harry s daughter must keep the peace Perhaps after all Philip loves her as many men and boys do That may help England Oh what shall help England She raised her head the masked head that seemed to have nothing to do with the busy feet and stared straight at the children I think this is rather creepy said Una with a shiver I wish she d stop The lady held out her jewelled hand as though she were taking some one else s hand in the Grand Chain Can a ship go down into the Gascons Graveyard and wait there she asked into the air and passed on rustling She s pretending to ask one of the cousins isn t she said Dan and Puck nodded Back she came in the silent swaying ghostly dance They saw she was smiling beneath the mask and they could hear her breathing hard I cannot lend you any of my ships for the venture Philip would hear of it she whispered over her shoulder but as much guns and powder as you ask if you do not ask too Her voice shot up and she stamped her foot thrice Louder Louder the music in the gallery Oh me but I have burst out of my shoe She gathered her skirts in each hand and began a curtsy You will go at your own charges she whispered straight before her Oh enviable and adorable age of youth Her eyes shone through the mask holes But I warn you you ll repent it Put not your trust in princes or Queens Philip s ships ll blow you out of water You ll not be frightened Well we ll talk on it again when I return from Rye dear lads The wonderful curtsy ended She stood up Nothing stirred on her except the rush of the shadows And so it was finished she said to the children Why d you not applaud What was finished said Una The dance the lady replied offendedly And a pair of green shoes I don t understand a bit said Una Eh What did you make of it young Burleigh I m not quite sure Dan began but You never can be with a woman But But I thought Gloriana meant the cousins to go back to the Gascons Graveyard wherever that was Twas Virginia after wards Her plantation of Virginia Virginia afterwards and stop Philip from taking it Didn t she say she d lend em guns Right so But not ships then And I thought you meant they must have told her they d do it off their own bat without getting her into a row with Philip Was I right Near enough for a Minister of the Queen But remember she gave the lads full time to change their minds She was three long days at Rye Royal knighting of fat Mayors When she came back to Brickwall they met her a mile down the road and she could feel their eyes burn through her riding mask Chris Hatton poor fool was vexed at it YOU would not birch them when I gave you the chance says she to Chris Now you must get me half an hour s private speech with em in Brickwall garden Eve tempted Adam in a garden Quick man or I may repent She was a Queen Why did she not send for them herself said Una The lady shook her head That was never her way I ve seen her walk to her own mirror by bye ends and the woman that cannot walk straight there is past praying for Yet I would have you pray for her What else what else in England s name could she have done She lifted her hand to her throat for a moment Faith she cried I d forgotten the little green shoes She left em at Brickwall so she did And I remember she gave the Norgem parson John Withers was he a text for his sermon Over Edom have I cast out my shoe Neat if he d understood I don t understand said Una What about the two cousins You are as cruel as a woman the lady answered I was not to blame I told you I gave em time to change their minds On my honour ay de mi she asked no more of em at first than to wait a while off that coast the Gascons Graveyard to hover a little if their ships chanced to pass that way they had only one tall ship and a pinnace only to watch and bring me word of Philip s doings One must watch Philip always What a murrain right had he to make any plantation there a hundred leagues north of his Spanish Main and only six weeks from England By my dread father s soul I tell you he had none none She stamped her red foot again and the two children shrunk back for a second Nay nay You must not turn from me too She laid it all fairly before the lads in Brickwall garden between the yews I told em that if Philip sent a fleet and to make a plantation he could not well send less their poor little cock boats could not sink it They answered that with submission the fight would be their own concern She showed em again that there could be only one end to it quick death on the sea or slow death in Philip s prisons They asked no more than to embrace death for my sake Many men have prayed to me for life I ve refused em and slept none the worse after but when my men my tall fantastical young men beseech me on their knees for leave to die for me it shakes me ah it shakes me to the marrow of my old bones Her chest sounded like a board as she hit it She showed em all I told em that this was no time for open war with Spain If by miracle inconceivable they prevailed against Philip s fleet Philip would hold me accountable For England s sake to save war I should e en be forced I told em so to give him up their young lives If they failed and again by some miracle escaped Philip s hand and crept back to England with their bare lives they must lie oh I told em all under my sovereign displeasure She could not know them see them nor hear their names nor stretch out a finger to save them from the gallows if Philip chose to ask it Be it the gallows then says the elder I could have wept but that my face was made for the day Either way any way this venture is death which I know you fear not But it is death with assured dishonour I cried Yet our Queen will know in her heart what we have done says the younger Sweetheart I said A queen has no heart But she is a woman and a woman would not forget says the elder We will go They knelt at my feet Nay dear lads but here I said and I opened my arms to them and I kissed them Be ruled by me I said We ll hire some ill featured old tarry breeks of an admiral to watch the Graveyard and you shall come to Court Hire whom you please says the elder we are ruled by you body and soul and the younger who shook most when I kissed em says between his white lips I think you have power to make a god of a man Come to Court and be sure of t I said They shook their heads and I knew I knew that go they would If I had not kissed them perhaps I might have prevailed Then why did you do it said Una I don t think you knew really what you wanted done May it please your Majesty the lady bowed her head low this Gloriana whom I have represented for your pleasure was a woman and a Queen Remember her when you come to your Kingdom But did the cousins go to the Gascons Graveyard said Dan as Una frowned They went said the lady Did they ever come back Una began but Did they stop King Philip s fleet Dan interrupted The lady turned to him eagerly D you think they did right to go she asked I don t see what else they could have done Dan replied after thinking it over D you think she did right to send em The lady s voice rose a little Well said Dan I don t see what else she could have done either do you How did they stop King Philip from getting Virginia There s the sad part of it They sailed out that autumn from Rye Royal and there never came back so much as a single rope yarn to show what had befallen them The winds blew and they were not Does that make you alter your mind young Burleigh I expect they were drowned then Anyhow Philip didn t score did he Gloriana wiped out her score with Philip later But if Philip had won would you have blamed Gloriana for wasting those lads lives Of course not She was bound to try to stop him The lady coughed You have the root of the matter in you Were I Queen I d make you Minister We don t play that game said Una who felt that she disliked the lady as much as she disliked the noise the high wind made tearing through Willow Shaw Play said the lady with a laugh and threw up her hands affectedly The sunshine caught the jewels on her many rings and made them flash till Una s eyes dazzled and she had to rub them Then she saw Dan on his knees picking up the potatoes they had spilled at the gate There wasn t anybody in the Shaw after all he said Didn t you think you saw someone I m most awfully glad there isn t said Una Then they went on with the potato roast The Looking Glass Queen Bess Was Harry s daughter The Queen was in her chamber and she was middling old Her petticoat was satin and her stomacher was gold Backwards and forwards and sideways did she pass Making up her mind to face the cruel looking glass The cruel looking glass that will never show a lass As comely or as kindly or as young as once she was The Queen was in her chamber a combing of her hair There came Queen Mary s spirit and it stood behind her chair Singing Backwards and forwards and sideways you may pass But I will stand behind you till you face the looking glass The cruel looking glass that will never show a lass As lovely or unlucky or as lonely as I was The Queen was in her chamber a weeping very sore There came Lord Leicester s spirit and it scratched upon the door Singing Backwards and forwards and sideways may you pass But I will walk beside you till you face the looking glass The cruel looking glass that will never show a lass As hard and unforgiving or as wicked as you was The Queen was in her chamber her sins were on her head She looked the spirits up and down and statelily she said Backwards and forwards and sideways though I ve been Yet I am Harry s daughter and I am England s Queen And she faced the looking glass and whatever else there was And she saw her day was over and she saw her beauty pass In the cruel looking glass that can always hurt a lass More hard than any ghost there is or any man there was THE WRONG THING A Truthful Song THE BRICKLAYER I tell this tale which is strictly true just by way of convincing you How very little since things were made Things have altered in the building trade A year ago come the middle o March We was building flats near the Marble Arch When a thin young man with coal black hair Came up to watch us working there Now there wasn t a trick in brick or stone That this young man hadn t seen or known Nor there wasn t a tool from trowel to maul But this young man could use em all Then up and spoke the plumbyers bold Which was laying the pipes for the hot and cold Since you with us have made so free Will you kindly say what your name might be The young man kindly answered them It might be Lot or Methusalem Or it might be Moses a man I hate Whereas it is Pharaoh surnamed the Great Your glazing is new and your plumbing s strange But other wise I perceive no change And in less than a month if you do as I bid I d learn you to build me a Pyramid THE SAILOR I tell this tale which is stricter true just by way of convincing you How very little since things was made Things have altered in the shipwright s trade In Blackwall Basin yesterday A China barque re fitting lay When a fat old man with snow white hair Came up to watch us working there Now there wasn t a knot which the riggers knew But the old man made it and better too Nor there wasn t a sheet or a lift or a brace But the old man knew its lead and place Then up and spake the caulkyers bold Which was packing the pump in the after hold Since you with us have made so free Will you kindly tell what your name might be The old man kindly answered them it might be Japhet it might be Shem Or it might be Ham though his skin was dark Whereas it is Noah commanding the Ark Your wheel is new and your pumps are strange But otherwise I perceive no change And in less than a week if she did not ground I d sail this hooker the wide world round BOTH We tell these tales which are strictest true et cetera The Wrong Thing Dan had gone in for building model boats but after he had filled the schoolroom with chips which he expected Una to clear away they turned him out of doors and he took all his tools up the hill to mister Springett s yard where he knew he could make as much mess as he chose Old mister Springett was a builder contractor and sanitary engineer and his yard which opened off the village street was always full of interesting things At one end of it was a long loft reached by a ladder where he kept his iron bound scaffold planks tins of paints pulleys and odds and ends he had found in old houses He would sit here by the hour watching his carts as they loaded or unloaded in the yard below while Dan gouged and grunted at the carpenter s bench near the loft window mister Springett and Dan had always been particular friends for mister Springett was so old he could remember when railways were being made in the southern counties of England and people were allowed to drive dogs in carts One hot still afternoon the tar paper on the roof smelt like ships Dan in his shirt sleeves was smoothing down a new schooner s bow and mister Springett was talking of barns and houses he had built He said he never forgot any stick or stone he had ever handled or any man woman or child he had ever met Just then he was very proud of the Village Hall at the entrance of the village which he had finished a few weeks before An I don t mind tellin you Mus Dan he said that the Hall will be my last job top of this mortal earth I didn t make ten pounds no nor yet five out o the whole contrac but my name s lettered on the foundation stone Ralph Springett Builder and the stone she s bedded on four foot good concrete If she shifts any time these five hundred years I ll sure ly turn in my grave I told the Lunnon architec so when he come down to oversee my work What did he say Dan was sandpapering the schooner s port bow Nothing The Hall ain t more than one of his small jobs for him but tain t small to me an my name is cut and lettered frontin the village street I do hope an pray for time everlastin You ll want the little round file for that holler in her bow Who s there mister Springett turned stiffly in his chair A long pile of scaffold planks ran down the centre of the loft Dan looked and saw Hal o the Draft s touzled head beyond them See Hal o the Draft in PUCK OF POOK S HILL Be you the builder of the Village Hall he asked of mister Springett I be was the answer But if you want a job Hal laughed No faith he said Only the Hall is as good and honest a piece of work as I ve ever run a rule over So being born hereabouts and being reckoned a master among masons and accepted as a master mason I made bold to pay my brotherly respects to the builder Aa um mister Springett looked important I be a bit rusty but I ll try ye He asked Hal several curious questions and the answers must have pleased him for he invited Hal to sit down Hal moved up always keeping behind the pile of planks so that only his head showed and sat down on a trestle in the dark corner at the back of mister Springett s desk He took no notice of Dan but talked at once to mister Springett about bricks and cement and lead and glass and after a while Dan went on with his work He knew mister Springett was pleased because he tugged his white sandy beard and smoked his pipe in short puffs The two men seemed to agree about everything but when grown ups agree they interrupt each other almost as much as if they were quarrelling Hal said something about workmen Why that s what I always say mister Springett cried A man who can only do one thing he s but next above fool to the man that can t do nothin That s where the Unions make their mistake My thought to the very dot Dan heard Hal slap his tight hosed leg I ve suffered in my time from these same Guilds Unions d you call em All their precious talk of the mysteries of their trades why what does it come to Nothin You ve justabout hit it said mister Springett and rammed his hot tobacco with his thumb Take the art of wood carving Hal went on He reached across the planks grabbed a wooden mallet and moved his other hand as though he wanted something mister Springett without a word passed him one of Dan s broad chisels Ah Wood carving for example If you can cut wood and have a fair draft of what ye mean to do a Heaven s name take chisel and maul and let drive at it say I You ll soon find all the mystery forsooth of wood carving under your proper hand Whack came the mallet on the chisel and a sliver of wood curled up in front of it mister Springett watched like an old raven All art is one man one said Hal between whacks and to wait on another man to finish out To finish out your work ain t no sense mister Springett cut in That s what I m always sayin to the boy here He nodded towards Dan That s what I said when I put the new wheel into Brewster s Mill in Eighteen hundred Seventy two I reckoned I was millwright enough for the job thout bringin a man from Lunnon An besides dividin work eats up profits no bounds Hal laughed his beautiful deep laugh and mister Springett joined in till Dan laughed too You handle your tools I can see said mister Springett I reckon if you re any way like me you ve found yourself hindered by those Guilds did you call em Unions we say You may say so Hal pointed to a white scar on his cheekbone This is a remembrance from the Master watching Foreman of Masons on Magdalen Tower because please you I dared to carve stone without their leave They said a stone had slipped from the cornice by accident I know them accidents There s no way to disprove em An stones ain t the only things that slip mister Springett grunted Hal went on I ve seen a scaffold plank keckle and shoot a too clever workman thirty foot on to the cold chancel floor below And a rope can break Yes natural as nature an lime ll fly up in a man s eyes without any breath o wind sometimes said mister Springett But who s to show twasn t a accident Who do these things Dan asked and straightened his back at the bench as he turned the schooner end for end in the vice to get at her counter Them which don t wish other men to work no better nor quicker than they do growled mister Springett Don t pinch her so hard in the vice Mus Dan Put a piece o rag in the jaws or you ll bruise her More than that he turned towards Hal if a man has his private spite laid up against you the Unions give him his excuse for workin it off Well I know it said Hal They never let you go them spiteful ones I knowed a plasterer in Eighteen hundred Sixty one down to the wells He was a Frenchy a bad enemy he was I had mine too He was an Italian called Benedetto I met him first at Oxford on Magdalen Tower when I was learning my trade or trades I should say A bad enemy he was as you say but he came to be my singular good friend said Hal as he put down the mallet and settled himself comfortably What might his trade have been plastering mister Springett asked Plastering of a sort He worked in stucco fresco we call it Made pictures on plaster Not but what he had a fine sweep of the hand in drawing He d take the long sides of a cloister trowel on his stuff and roll out his great all abroad pictures of saints and croppy topped trees quick as a webster unrolling cloth almost Oh Benedetto could draw but a was a little minded man professing to be full of secrets of colour or plaster common tricks all of em and his one single talk was how Tom Dick or Harry had stole this or t other secret art from him I know that sort said mister Springett There s no keeping peace or making peace with such An they re mostly born an bone idle True Even his fellow countrymen laughed at his jealousy We two came to loggerheads early on Magdalen Tower I was a youngster then Maybe I spoke my mind about his work You shouldn t never do that mister Springett shook his head That sort lay it up against you True enough This Benedetto did most specially Body o me the man lived to hate me But I always kept my eyes open on a plank or a scaffold I was mighty glad to be shut of him when he quarrelled with his Guild foreman and went off nose in air and paints under his arm But Hal leaned forward if you hate a man or a man hates you I know You re everlastin running acrost him mister Springett interrupted Excuse me sir He leaned out of the window and shouted to a carter who was loading a cart with bricks Ain t you no more sense than to heap em up that way he said Take an throw a hundred of em off It s more than the team can compass Throw em off I tell you and make another trip for what s left over Excuse me sir You was sayin I was saying that before the end of the year I went to Bury to strengthen the lead work in the great Abbey east window there Now that s just one of the things I ve never done But I mind there was a cheap excursion to Chichester in Eighteen hundred Seventy nine an I went an watched em leadin a won erful fine window in Chichester Cathedral I stayed watchin till twas time for us to go back Dunno as I had two drinks p raps all that day Hal smiled At Bury then sure enough I met my enemy Benedetto He had painted a picture in plaster on the south wall of the Refectory a noble place for a noble thing a picture of Jonah Ah Jonah an his whale I ve never been as far as Bury You ve worked about a lot said mister Springett with his eyes on the carter below No Not the whale This was a picture of Jonah and the pompion that withered But all that Benedetto had shown was a peevish grey beard huggled up in angle edged drapery beneath a pompion on a wooden trellis This last being a dead thing he d drawn it as twere to the life But fierce old Jonah bared in the sun angry even to death that his cold prophecy was disproven Jonah ashamed and already hearing the children of Nineveh running to mock him ah that was what Benedetto had not drawn He better ha stuck to his whale then said mister Springett He d ha done no better with that He draws the damp cloth off the picture an shows it to me I was a craftsman too d ye see Tis good I said but it goes no deeper than the plaster What he said in a whisper Be thy own judge Benedetto I answered Does it go deeper than the plaster He reeled against a piece of dry wall No he says and I know it I could not hate thee more than I have done these five years but if I live I will try Hal I will try Then he goes away I pitied him but I had spoken truth His picture went no deeper than the plaster Ah said mister Springett who had turned quite red You was talkin so fast I didn t understand what you was drivin at I ve seen men good workmen they was try to do more than they could do and and they couldn t compass it They knowed it and it nigh broke their hearts like You was in your right o course sir to say what you thought o his work but if you ll excuse me was you in your duty I was wrong to say it Hal replied God forgive me I was young He was workman enough himself to know where he failed But it all came evens in the long run By the same token did ye ever hear o one Torrigiano Torrisany we called him I can t say I ever did Was he a Frenchy like No a hectoring hard mouthed long sworded Italian builder as vain as a peacock and as strong as a bull but mark you a master workman More than that he could get his best work out of the worst men Which it s a gift I had a foreman bricklayer like him once said mister Springett He used to prod em in the back like with a pointing trowel and they did wonders I ve seen our Torrisany lay a prentice down with one buffet and raise him with another to make a mason of him I worked under him at building a chapel in London a chapel and a tomb for the King I never knew kings went to chapel much said mister Springett But I always hold with a man don t care who he be seein about his own grave before he dies Tidn t the sort of thing to leave to your family after the will s read I reckon twas a fine vault None finer in England This Torrigiano had the contract for it as you d say He picked master craftsmen from all parts England France Italy the Low Countries no odds to him so long as they knew their work and he drove them like like pigs at Brightling Fair He called us English all pigs We suffered it because he was a master in his craft If he misliked any work that a man had done with his own great hands he d rive it out and tear it down before us all Ah you pig you English pig he d scream in the dumb wretch s face You answer me You look at me You think at me Come out with me into the cloisters I will teach you carving myself I will gild you all over But when his passion had blown out he d slip his arm round the man s neck and impart knowledge worth gold Twould have done your heart good Mus Springett to see the two hundred of us masons jewellers carvers gilders iron workers and the rest all toiling like cock angels and this mad Italian hornet fleeing one to next up and down the chapel Done your heart good it would I believe you said mister Springett In Eighteen hundred Fifty four I mind the railway was bein made into Hastin s There was two thousand navvies on it all young all strong an I was one of em Oh dearie me Excuse me sir but was your enemy workin with you Benedetto Be sure he was He followed me like a lover He painted pictures on the chapel ceiling slung from a chair Torrigiano made us promise not to fight till the work should be finished We were both master craftsmen do ye see and he needed us None the less I never went aloft to carve thout testing all my ropes and knots each morning We were never far from each other Benedetto ud sharpen his knife on his sole while he waited for his plaster to dry wheet wheet wheet I d hear it where I hung chipping round a pillar head and we d nod to each other friendly like Oh he was a craftsman was Benedetto but his hate spoiled his eye and his hand I mind the night I had finished the models for the bronze saints round the tomb Torrigiano embraced me before all the chapel and bade me to supper I met Benedetto when I came out He was slavering in the porch Like a mad dog Workin himself up to it said mister Springett Did he have it in at ye that night No no That time he kept his oath to Torrigiano But I pitied him Eh well Now I come to my own follies I had never thought too little of myself but after Torrisany had put his arm round my neck I I Hal broke into a laugh I lay there was not much odds twixt me and a cock sparrow in his pride I was pretty middlin young once on a time said mister Springett Then ye know that a man can t drink and dice and dress fine and keep company above his station but his work suffers for it Mus Springett I never held much with dressin up but you re right The worst mistakes I ever made they was made of a Monday morning mister Springett answered We ve all been one sort of fool or t other Mus Dan Mus Dan take the smallest gouge or you ll be spluttin her stem works clean out Can t ye see the grain of the wood don t favour a chisel I ll spare you some of my follies But there was a man called Brygandyne Bob Brygandyne Clerk of the King s Ships a little smooth bustling atomy as clever as a woman to get work done for nothin a won erful smooth tongued pleader He made much o me and asked me to draft him out a drawing a piece of carved and gilt scroll work for the bows of one of the King s Ships the SOVEREIGN was her name Was she a man of war asked Dan She was a warship and a woman called Catherine of Castile desired the King to give her the ship for a pleasure ship of her own I did not know at the time but she d been at Bob to get this scroll work done and fitted that the King might see it I made him the picture in an hour all of a heat after supper one great heaving play of dolphins and a Neptune or so reining in webby footed sea horses and Arion with his harp high atop of them It was twenty three foot long and maybe nine foot deep painted and gilt It must ha justabout looked fine said mister Springett That s the curiosity of it Twas bad rank bad In my conceit I must needs show it to Torrigiano in the chapel He straddles his legs hunches his knife behind him and whistles like a storm cock through a sleet shower Benedetto was behind him We were never far apart I ve told you That is pig s work says our Master Swine s work You make any more such things even after your fine Court suppers and you shall be sent away Benedetto licks his lips like a cat It is so bad then Master he says What a pity Yes says Torrigiano Scarcely you could do things so bad I will condescend to show He talks to me then and there No shouting no swearing it was too bad for that but good memorable counsel bitten in slowly Then he sets me to draft out a pair of iron gates to take as he said the taste of my naughty dolphins out of my mouth Iron s sweet stuff if you don t torture her and hammered work is all pure truthful line with a reason and a support for every curve and bar of it A week at that settled my stomach handsomely and the Master let me put the work through the smithy where I sweated out more of my foolish pride Good stuff is good iron said mister Springett I done a pair of lodge gates once in Eighteen hundred Sixty three Oh I forgot to say that Bob Brygandyne whipped away my draft of the ship s scroll work and would not give it back to me to re draw He said twould do well enough Howsoever my lawful work kept me too busied to remember him Body o me but I worked that winter upon the gates and the bronzes for the tomb as I d never worked before I was leaner than a lath but I lived I lived then Hal looked at mister Springett with his wise crinkled up eyes and the old man smiled back Ouch Dan cried He had been hollowing out the schooner s after deck the little gouge had slipped and gashed the ball of his left thumb an ugly triangular tear That came of not steadying your wrist said Hal calmly Don t bleed over the wood Do your work with your heart s blood but no need to let it show He rose and peered into a corner of the loft mister Springett had risen too and swept down a ball of cobwebs from a rafter Clap that on was all he said and put your handkerchief atop Twill cake over in a minute It don t hurt now do it No said Dan indignantly You know it has happened lots of times I ll tie it up myself Go on sir And it ll happen hundreds of times more said Hal with a friendly nod as he sat down again But he did not go on till Dan s hand was tied up properly Then he said One dark December day too dark to judge colour we was all sitting and talking round the fires in the chapel you heard good talk there when Bob Brygandyne bustles in and Hal you re sent for he squeals I was at Torrigiano s feet on a pile of put locks as I might be here toasting a herring on my knife s point Twas the one English thing our Master liked salt herring I m busy about my art I calls Art says Bob What s Art compared to your scroll work for the SOVEREIGN Come Be sure your sins will find you out says Torrigiano Go with him and see As I followed Bob out I was aware of Benedetto like a black spot when the eyes are tired sliddering up behind me Bob hurries through the streets in the raw fog slips into a doorway up stairs along passages and at last thrusts me into a little cold room vilely hung with Flemish tapestries and no furnishing except a table and my draft of the SOVEREIGN s scrollwork Here he leaves me Presently comes in a dark long nosed man in a fur cap Master Harry Dawe said he The same I says Where a plague has Bob Brygandyne gone His thin eyebrows surged up in a piece and come down again in a stiff bar He went to the King he says All one Where s your pleasure with me I says shivering for it was mortal cold He lays his hand flat on my draft Master Dawe he says do you know the present price of gold leaf for all this wicked gilding of yours By that I guessed he was some cheese paring clerk or other of the King s Ships so I gave him the price I forget it now but it worked out to thirty pounds carved gilt and fitted in place Thirty pounds he said as though I had pulled a tooth of him You talk as though thirty pounds was to be had for the asking None the less he says your draft s a fine piece of work I d been looking at it ever since I came in and twas viler even than I judged it at first My eye and hand had been purified the past months d ye see by my iron work I could do it better now I said The more I studied my squabby Neptunes the less I liked em and Arion was a pure flaming shame atop of the unbalanced dolphins I doubt it will be fresh expense to draft it again he says Bob never paid me for the first draft I lay he ll never pay me for the second Twill cost the King nothing if I re draw it I says There s a woman wishes it to be done quickly he says We ll stick to your first drawing Master Dawe But thirty pounds is thirty pounds You must make it less And all the while the faults in my draft fair leaped out and hit me between the eyes At any cost I thinks to myself I must get it back and re draft it He grunts at me impatiently and a splendid thought comes to me which shall save me By the same token It was quite honest They ain t always says mister Springett How did you get out of it By the truth I says to Master Fur Cap as I might to you here I says I ll tell you something since you seem a knowledgeable man Is the SOVEREIGN to lie in Thames river all her days or will she take the high seas Oh he says quickly the King keeps no cats that don t catch mice She must sail the seas Master Dawe She ll be hired to merchants for the trade She ll be out in all shapes o weathers Does that make any odds Why then says I the first heavy sea she sticks her nose into ll claw off half that scroll work and the next will finish it If she s meant for a pleasure ship give me my draft again and I ll porture you a pretty light piece of scroll work good cheap If she s meant for the open sea pitch the draft into the fire She can never carry that weight on her bows He looks at me squintlings and plucks his under lip Is this your honest unswayed opinion he says Body o me Ask about I says Any seaman could tell you tis true I m advising you against my own profit but why I do so is my own concern Not altogether he says It s some of mine You ve saved me thirty pounds Master Dawe and you ve given me good arguments to use against a willful woman that wants my fine new ship for her own toy We ll not have any scroll work His face shined with pure joy Then see that the thirty pounds you ve saved on it are honestly paid the King I says and keep clear o women folk I gathered up my draft and crumpled it under my arm If that s all you need of me I ll be gone I says I m pressed He turns him round and fumbles in a corner Too pressed to be made a knight Sir Harry he says and comes at me smiling with three quarters of a rusty sword I pledge you my Mark I never guessed it was the King till that moment I kneeled and he tapped me on the shoulder Rise up Sir Harry Dawe he says and in the same breath I m pressed too and slips through the tapestries leaving me like a stuck calf It come over me in a bitter wave like that here was I a master craftsman who had worked no bounds soul or body to make the King s tomb and chapel a triumph and a glory for all time and here d ye see I was made knight not for anything I d slaved over or given my heart and guts to but expressedly because I d saved him thirty pounds and a tongue lashing from Catherine of Castille she that had asked for the ship That thought shrivelled me with insides while I was folding away my draft On the heels of it maybe you ll see why I began to grin to myself I thought of the earnest simplicity of the man the King I should say because I d saved him the money his smile as though he d won half France I thought of my own silly pride and foolish expectations that some day he d honour me as a master craftsman I thought of the broken tipped sword he d found behind the hangings the dirt of the cold room and his cold eye wrapped up in his own concerns scarcely resting on me Then I remembered the solemn chapel roof and the bronzes about the stately tomb he d lie in and d ye see the unreason of it all the mad high humour of it all took hold on me till I sat me down on a dark stair head in a passage and laughed till I could laugh no more What else could I have done I never heard his feet behind me he always walked like a cat but his arm slid round my neck pulling me back where I sat till my head lay on his chest and his left hand held the knife plumb over my heart Benedetto Even so I laughed the fit was beyond my holding laughed while he ground his teeth in my ear He was stark crazed for the time Laugh he said Finish the laughter I ll not cut ye short Tell me now he wrenched at my head why the King chose to honour you you you you lickspittle Englishman I am full of patience now I have waited so long Then he was off at score about his Jonah in Bury Refectory and what I d said of it and his pictures in the chapel which all men praised and none looked at twice as if that was my fault and a whole parcel of words and looks treasured up against me through years Ease off your arm a little I said I cannot die by choking for I am just dubbed knight Benedetto Tell me and I ll confess ye Sir Harry Dawe Knight There s a long night before ye Tell says he So I told him his chin on my crown told him all told it as well and with as many words as I have ever told a tale at a supper with Torrigiano I knew Benedetto would understand for mad or sad he was a craftsman I believed it to be the last tale I d ever tell top of mortal earth and I would not put out bad work before I left the Lodge All art s one art as I said I bore Benedetto no malice My spirits d ye see were catched up in a high solemn exaltation and I saw all earth s vanities foreshortened and little laid out below me like a town from a cathedral scaffolding I told him what befell and what I thought of it I gave him the King s very voice at Master Dawe you ve saved me thirty pounds his peevish grunt while he looked for the sword and how the badger eyed figures of Glory and Victory leered at me from the Flemish hangings Body o me twas a fine noble tale and as I thought my last work on earth That is how I was honoured by the King I said They ll hang ye for killing me Benedetto And since you ve killed in the King s Palace they ll draw and quarter you but you re too mad to care Grant me though ye never heard a better tale He said nothing but I felt him shake My head on his chest shook his right arm fell away his left dropped the knife and he leaned with both hands on my shoulder shaking shaking I turned me round No need to put my foot on his knife The man was speechless with laughter honest craftsman s mirth The first time I d ever seen him laugh You know the mirth that cuts off the very breath while ye stamp and snatch at the short ribs That was Benedetto s case When he began to roar and bay and whoop in the passage I haled him out into the street and there we leaned against the wall and had it all over again waving our hands and wagging our heads till the watch came to know if we were drunk Benedetto says to em solemn as an owl You have saved me thirty pounds Mus Dawe and off he pealed In some sort we were mad drunk I because dear life had been given back to me and he because as he said afterwards because the old crust of hatred round his heart was broke up and carried away by laughter His very face had changed too Hal he cries I forgive thee Forgive me too Hal Oh you English you English Did it gall thee Hal to see the rust on the dirty sword Tell me again Hal how the King grunted with joy Oh let us tell the Master So we reeled back to the chapel arms round each other s necks and when we could speak he thought we d been fighting we told the Master Yes we told Torrigiano and he laughed till he rolled on the new cold pavement Then he knocked our heads together Ah you English he cried You are more than pigs You are English Now you are well punished for your dirty fishes Put the draft in the fire and never do so any more You are a fool Hal and you are a fool Benedetto but I need your works to please this beautiful English King And I meant to kill Hal says Benedetto Master I meant to kill him because the English King had made him a knight Ah says the Master shaking his finger Benedetto if you had killed my Hal I should have killed you in the cloister But you are a craftsman too so I should have killed you like a craftsman very very slowly in an hour if I could spare the time That was Torrigiano the Master mister Springett sat quite still for some time after Hal had finished Then he turned dark red then he rocked to and fro then he coughed and wheezed till the tears ran down his face Dan knew by this that he was laughing but it surprised Hal at first Excuse me sir said mister Springett but I was thinkin of some stables I built for a gentleman in Eighteen hundred Seventy four They was stables in blue brick very particular work Dunno as they weren t the best job which ever I d done But the gentleman s lady she d come from Lunnon new married she was all for buildin what was called a haw haw what you an me ud call a dik right acrost his park A middlin big job which I d have had the contract of for she spoke to me in the library about it But I told her there was a line o springs just where she wanted to dig her ditch an she d flood the park if she went on Were there any springs at all said Hal Bound to be springs everywhere if you dig deep enough ain t there But what I said about the springs put her out o conceit o diggin haw haws an she took an built a white tile dairy instead But when I sent in my last bill for the stables the gentleman he paid it thout even lookin at it and I hadn t forgotten nothin I do assure you More than that he slips two five pound notes into my hand in the library an Ralph he says he allers called me by name Ralph he says you ve saved me a heap of expense an trouble this autumn I didn t say nothin o course I knowed he didn t want any haws haws digged acrost his park no more n I did but I never said nothin No more he didn t say nothin about my blue brick stables which was really the best an honestest piece o work I d done in quite a while He give me ten pounds for savin him a hem of a deal o trouble at home I reckon things are pretty much alike all times in all places Hal and he laughed together Dan couldn t quite understand what they thought so funny and went on with his work for some time without speaking When he looked up mister Springett alone was wiping his eyes with his green and yellow pocket handkerchief Bless me Mus Dan I ve been asleep he said An I ve dreamed a dream which has made me laugh laugh as I ain t laughed in a long day I can t remember what twas all about but they do say that when old men take to laughin in their sleep they re middlin ripe for the next world Have you been workin honest Mus Dan Ra ather said Dan unclamping the schooner from the vice And look how I ve cut myself with the small gouge Ye es You want a lump o cobwebs to that said mister Springett Oh I see you ve put it on already That s right Mus Dan King Henry VII and the Shipwrights Harry our King in England from London town is gone And comen to Hamull on the Hoke in the countie of Suthampton For there lay the MARY OF THE TOWER his ship of war so strong And he would discover certaynely if his shipwrights did him wrong He told not none of his setting forth nor yet where he would go But only my Lord of Arundel and meanly did he show In an old jerkin and patched hose that no man might him mark With his frieze hood and cloak about he looked like any clerk He was at Hamull on the Hoke about the hour of the tide And saw the MARY haled into dock the winter to abide With all her tackle and habiliments which are the King his own But then ran on his false shipwrights and stripped her to the bone They heaved the main mast overboard that was of a trusty tree And they wrote down it was spent and lost by force of weather at sea But they sawen it into planks and strakes as far as it might go To maken beds for their own wives and little children also There was a knave called Slingawai he crope beneath the deck Crying Good felawes come and see The ship is nigh a wreck For the storm that took our tall main mast it blew so fierce and fell Alack it hath taken the kettles and pans and this brass pott as well With that he set the pott on his head and hied him up the hatch While all the shipwrights ran below to find what they might snatch All except Bob Brygandyne and he was a yeoman good He caught Slingawai round the waist and threw him on to the mud I have taken plank and rope and nail without the King his leave After the custom of Portesmouth but I will not suffer a thief Nay never lift up thy hand at me There s no clean hands in the trade Steal in measure quo Brygandyne There s measure in all things made Gramercy yeoman said our King Thy counsel liketh me And he pulled a whistle out of his neck and whistled whistles three Then came my Lord of Arundel pricking across the down And behind him the Mayor and Burgesses of merry Suthampton town They drew the naughty shipwrights up with the kettles in their hands And bound them round the forecastle to wait the King s commands But Since ye have made your beds said the King ye needs must lie thereon For the sake of your wives and little ones felawes get you gone When they had beaten Slingawai out of his own lips Our King appointed Brygandyne to be Clerk of all his ships Nay never lift up thy hands to me there s no clean hands in the trade But steal in measure said Harry our King There s measure in all things made God speed the Mary of the Tower the Sovereign and Grace Dieu The Sweepstakes and the Mary Fortune and the Henry of Bristol too All tall ships that sail on the sea or in our harbours stand That they may keep measure with Harry our King and peace in Engeland MARKLAKE WITCHES The Way Through the Woods They shut the road through the woods Seventy years ago Weather and rain have undone it again And now you would never know There was once a road through the woods Before they planted the trees It is underneath the coppice and heath And the thin anemones Only the keeper sees That where the ring dove broods And the badgers roll at ease There was once a road through the woods Yet if you enter the woods Of a summer evening late When the night air cools on the trout ringed pools Where the otter whistles his mate They fear not men in the woods Because they see so few You will hear the beat of a horse s feet And the swish of a skirt in the dew Steadily cantering through The misty solitudes As though they perfectly knew The old lost road through the woods But there is no road through the woods Marklake Witches When Dan took up boat building Una coaxed missus Vincey the farmer s wife at Little Lindens to teach her to milk missus Vincey milks in the pasture in summer which is different from milking in the shed because the cows are not tied up and until they know you they will not stand still After three weeks Una could milk Red Cow or Kitty Shorthorn quite dry without her wrists aching and then she allowed Dan to look But milking did not amuse him and it was pleasanter for Una to be alone in the quiet pastures with quiet spoken missus Vincey So evening after evening she slipped across to Little Lindens took her stool from the fern clump beside the fallen oak and went to work her pail between her knees and her head pressed hard into the cow s flank As often as not missus Vincey would be milking cross Pansy at the other end of the pasture and would not come near till it was time to strain and pour off Once in the middle of a milking Kitty Shorthorn boxed Una s ear with her tail You old pig said Una nearly crying for a cow s tail can hurt Why didn t you tie it down child said a voice behind her I meant to but the flies are so bad I let her off and this is what she s done Una looked round expecting Puck and saw a curly haired girl not much taller than herself but older dressed in a curious high waisted lavender coloured riding habit with a high hunched collar and a deep cape and a belt fastened with a steel clasp She wore a yellow velvet cap and tan gauntlets and carried a real hunting crop Her cheeks were pale except for two pretty pink patches in the middle and she talked with little gasps at the end of her sentences as though she had been running You don t milk so badly child she said and when she smiled her teeth showed small and even and pearly Can you milk Una asked and then flushed for she heard Puck s chuckle He stepped out of the fern and sat down holding Kitty Short horn s tail There isn t much he said that Miss Philadelphia doesn t know about milk or for that matter butter and eggs She s a great housewife Oh said Una I m sorry I can t shake hands Mine are all milky but missus Vincey is going to teach me butter making this summer Ah I m going to London this summer the girl said to my aunt in Bloomsbury She coughed as she began to hum Oh what a town What a wonderful metropolis You ve got a cold said Una No Only my stupid cough But it s vastly better than it was last winter It will disappear in London air Every one says so D you like doctors child I don t know any Una replied But I m sure I shouldn t Think yourself lucky child I beg your pardon the girl laughed for Una frowned I m not a child and my name s Una she said Mine s Philadelphia But everybody except Rene calls me Phil I m Squire Bucksteed s daughter over at Marklake yonder She jerked her little round chin towards the south behind Dallington Sure ly you know Marklake We went a picnic to Marklake Green once said Una It s awfully pretty I like all those funny little roads that don t lead anywhere They lead over our land said Philadelphia stiffly and the coach road is only four miles away One can go anywhere from the Green I went to the Assize Ball at Lewes last year She spun round and took a few dancing steps but stopped with her hand to her side It gives me a stitch she explained No odds Twill go away in London air That s the latest French step child Rene taught it me D you hate the French chi Una Well I hate French of course but I don t mind Ma m selle She s rather decent Is Rene your French governess Philadelphia laughed till she caught her breath again Oh no Rene s a French prisoner on parole That means he s promised not to escape till he has been properly exchanged for an Englishman He s only a doctor so I hope they won t think him worth exchanging My uncle captured him last year in the FERDINAND privateer off Belle Isle and he cured my uncle of a r r raging toothache Of course after that we couldn t let him lie among the common French prisoners at Rye and so he stays with us He s of very old family a Breton which is nearly next door to being a true Briton my father says and he wears his hair clubbed not powdered Much more becoming don t you think I don t know what you re Una began but Puck the other side of the pail winked and she went on with her milking He s going to be a great French physician when the war is over He makes me bobbins for my lace pillow now he s very clever with his hands but he d doctor our people on the Green if they would let him Only our Doctor Doctor Break says he s an emp or imp something worse than imposter But my Nurse says Nurse You re ever so old What have you got a nurse for Una finished milking and turned round on her stool as Kitty Shorthorn grazed off Because I can t get rid of her Old Cissie nursed my mother and she says she ll nurse me till she dies The idea She never lets me alone She thinks I m delicate She has grown infirm in her understanding you know Mad quite mad poor Cissie Really mad said Una Or just silly Crazy I should say from the things she does Her devotion to me is terribly embarrassing You know I have all the keys of the Hall except the brewery and the tenants kitchen I give out all stores and the linen and plate How jolly I love store rooms and giving out things Ah it s a great responsibility you ll find when you come to my age Last year Dad said I was fatiguing myself with my duties and he actually wanted me to give up the keys to old Amoore our housekeeper I wouldn t I hate her I said No sir I am Mistress of Marklake Hall just as long as I live because I m never going to be married and I shall give out stores and linen till I die And what did your father say Oh I threatened to pin a dishclout to his coat tail He ran away Every one s afraid of Dad except me Philadelphia stamped her foot The idea If I can t make my own father happy in his own house I d like to meet the woman that can and and I d have the living hide off her She cut with her long thonged whip It cracked like a pistol shot across the still pasture Kitty Shorthorn threw up her head and trotted away I beg your pardon Philadelphia said but it makes me furious Don t you hate those ridiculous old quizzes with their feathers and fronts who come to dinner and call you child in your own chair at your own table I don t always come to dinner said Una but I hate being called child Please tell me about store rooms and giving out things Ah it s a great responsibility particularly with that old cat Amoore looking at the lists over your shoulder And such a shocking thing happened last summer Poor crazy Cissie my Nurse that I was telling you of she took three solid silver tablespoons Took But isn t that stealing Una cried Hsh said Philadelphia looking round at Puck All I say is she took them without my leave I made it right afterwards So as Dad says and he s a magistrate it wasn t a legal offence it was only compounding a felony It sounds awful said Una It was My dear I was furious I had had the keys for ten months and I d never lost anything before I said nothing at first because a big house offers so many chances of things being mislaid and coming to hand later Fetching up in the lee scuppers my uncle calls it But next week I spoke to old Cissie about it when she was doing my hair at night and she said I wasn t to worry my heart for trifles Isn t it like em Una burst out They see you re worried over something that really matters and they say Don t worry as if that did any good I quite agree with you my dear quite agree with you I told Ciss the spoons were solid silver and worth forty shillings so if the thief were found he d be tried for his life Hanged do you mean Una said They ought to be but Dad says no jury will hang a man nowadays for a forty shilling theft They transport em into penal servitude at the uttermost ends of the earth beyond the seas for the term of their natural life I told Cissie that and I saw her tremble in my mirror Then she cried and caught hold of my knees and I couldn t for my life understand what it was all about she cried so Can you guess my dear what that poor crazy thing had done It was midnight before I pieced it together She had given the spoons to Jerry Gamm the Witchmaster on the Green so that he might put a charm on me Me Put a charm on you Why That s what I asked and then I saw how mad poor Cissie was You know this stupid little cough of mine It will disappear as soon as I go to London She was troubled about that and about my being so thin and she told me Jerry had promised her if she would bring him three silver spoons that he d charm my cough away and make me plump flesh up she said I couldn t help laughing but it was a terrible night I had to put Cissie into my own bed and stroke her hand till she cried herself to sleep What else could I have done When she woke and I coughed I suppose I can cough in my own room if I please she said that she d killed me and asked me to have her hanged at Lewes sooner than send her to the uttermost ends of the earth away from me How awful What did you do Phil Do I rode off at five in the morning to talk to Master Jerry with a new lash on my whip Oh I was furious Witchmaster or no Witchmaster I meant to Ah what s a Witchmaster A master of witches of course I don t believe there are witches but people say every village has a few and Jerry was the master of all ours at Marklake He has been a smuggler and a man of war s man and now he pretends to be a carpenter and joiner he can make almost anything but he really is a white wizard He cures people by herbs and charms He can cure them after Doctor Break has given them up and that s why Doctor Break hates him so He used to make me toy carts and charm off my warts when I was a child Philadelphia spread out her hands with the delicate shiny little nails It isn t counted lucky to cross him He has his ways of getting even with you they say But I wasn t afraid of Jerry I saw him working in his garden and I leaned out of my saddle and double thonged him between the shoulders over the hedge Well my dear for the first time since Dad gave him to me my Troubadour I wish you could see the sweet creature shied across the road and I spilled out into the hedge top Most undignified Jerry pulled me through to his side and brushed the leaves off me I was horribly pricked but I didn t care Now Jerry I said I m going to take the hide off you first and send you to Lewes afterwards You well know why Oh he said and he sat down among his bee hives Then I reckon you ve come about old Cissie s business my dear I reckon I justabout have I said Stand away from these hives I can t get at you there That s why I be where I be he said If you ll excuse me Miss Phil I don t hold with bein flogged before breakfast at my time o life He s a huge big man but he looked so comical squatting among the hives that I know I oughtn t to I laughed and he laughed I always laugh at the wrong time But I soon recovered my dignity and I said Then give me back what you made poor Cissie steal Your pore Cissie he said She s a hatful o trouble But you shall have em Miss Phil They re all ready put by for you And would you believe it the old sinner pulled my three silver spoons out of his dirty pocket and polished them on his cuff Here they be he says and he gave them to me just as cool as though I d come to have my warts charmed That s the worst of people having known you when you were young But I preserved my composure Jerry I said what in the world are we to do If you d been caught with these things on you you d have been hanged I know it he said But they re yours now But you made my Cissie steal them I said That I didn t he said Your Cissie she was pickin at me an tarrifyin me all the long day an every day for weeks to put a charm on you Miss Phil an take away your little spitty cough Yes I knew that Jerry and to make me flesh up I said I m much obliged to you but I m not one of your pigs Ah I reckon she ve been talking to you then he said Yes she give me no peace and bein tarrified for I don t hold with old women I laid a task on her which I thought ud silence her I never reckoned the old scrattle ud risk her neckbone at Lewes Assizes for your sake Miss Phil But she did She up an stole I tell ye as cheerful as a tinker You might ha knocked me down with any one of them liddle spoons when she brung em in her apron Do you mean to say then that you did it to try my poor Cissie I screamed at him What else for dearie he said I don t stand in need of hedge stealings I m a freeholder with money in the bank and now I won t trust women no more Silly old besom I do beleft she d ha stole the Squire s big fob watch if I d required her Then you re a wicked wicked old man I said and I was so angry that I couldn t help crying and of course that made me cough Jerry was in a fearful taking He picked me up and carried me into his cottage it s full of foreign curiosities and he got me something to eat and drink and he said he d be hanged by the neck any day if it pleased me He said he d even tell old Cissie he was sorry That s a great comedown for a Witchmaster you know I was ashamed of myself for being so silly and I dabbed my eyes and said The least you can do now is to give poor Ciss some sort of a charm for me Yes that s only fair dealings he said You know the names of the Twelve Apostles dearie You say them names one by one before your open window rain or storm wet or shine five times a day fasting But mind you twixt every name you draw in your breath through your nose right down to your pretty liddle toes as long and as deep as you can and let it out slow through your pretty liddle mouth There s virtue for your cough in those names spoke that way And I ll give you something you can see moreover Here s a stick of maple which is the warmest tree in the wood That s true Una interrupted You can feel it almost as warm as yourself when you touch it It s cut one inch long for your every year Jerry said That s sixteen inches You set it in your window so that it holds up the sash and thus you keep it rain or shine or wet or fine day and night I ve said words over it which will have virtue on your complaints I haven t any complaints Jerry I said It s only to please Cissie I know that as well as you do dearie he said And and that was all that came of my going to give him a flogging I wonder whether he made poor Troubadour shy when I lashed at him Jerry has his ways of getting even with people I wonder said Una Well did you try the charm Did it work What nonsense I told Rene about it of course because he s a doctor He s going to be a most famous doctor That s why our doctor hates him Rene said Oho Your Master Gamm he is worth knowing and he put up his eyebrows like this He made joke of it all He can see my window from the carpenter s shed where he works and if ever the maple stick fell down he pretended to be in a fearful taking till I propped the window up again He used to ask me whether I had said my Apostles properly and how I took my deep breaths Oh yes and the next day though he had been there ever so many times before he put on his new hat and paid Jerry Gamm a visit of state as a fellow physician Jerry never guessed Rene was making fun of him and so he told Rene about the sick people in the village and how he cured them with herbs after Doctor Break had given them up Jerry could talk smugglers French of course and I had taught Rene plenty of English if only he wasn t so shy They called each other Monsieur Gamm and Mosheur Lanark just like gentlemen I suppose it amused poor Rene He hasn t much to do except to fiddle about in the carpenter s shop He s like all the French prisoners always making knickknacks and Jerry had a little lathe at his cottage and so and so Rene took to being with Jerry much more than I approved of The Hall is so big and empty when Dad s away and I will not sit with old Amoore she talks so horridly about every one specially about Rene I was rude to Rene I m afraid but I was properly served out for it One always is You see Dad went down to Hastings to pay his respects to the General who commanded the brigade there and to bring him to the Hall afterwards Dad told me he was a very brave soldier from India he was Colonel of Dad s Regiment the Thirty third Foot after Dad left the Army and then he changed his name from Wesley to Wellesley or else the other way about and Dad said I was to get out all the silver for him and I knew that meant a big dinner So I sent down to the sea for early mackerel and had such a morning in the kitchen and the store rooms Old Amoore nearly cried However my dear I made all my preparations in ample time but the fish didn t arrive it never does and I wanted Rene to ride to Pevensey and bring it himself He had gone over to Jerry of course as he always used unless I requested his presence beforehand I can t send for Rene every time I want him He should be there Now don t you ever do what I did child because it s in the highest degree unladylike but but one of our Woods runs up to Jerry s garden and if you climb it s ungenteel but I can climb like a kitten there s an old hollow oak just above the pigsty where you can hear and see everything below Truthfully I only went to tell Rene about the mackerel but I saw him and Jerry sitting on the seat playing with wooden toy trumpets So I slipped into the hollow and choked down my cough and listened Rene had never shown me any of these trumpets Trumpets Aren t you too old for trumpets said Una They weren t real trumpets because Jerry opened his short collar and Rene put one end of his trumpet against Jerry s chest and put his ear to the other Then Jerry put his trumpet against Rene s chest and listened while Rene breathed and coughed I was afraid I would cough too This hollywood one is the best said Jerry Tis won erful like hearin a man s soul whisperin in his innards but unless I ve a buzzin in my ears Mosheur Lanark you make much about the same kind o noises as old Gaffer Macklin but not quite so loud as young Copper It sounds like breakers on a reef a long way off Comprenny Perfectly said Rene I drive on the breakers But before I strike I shall save hundreds thousands millions perhaps by my little trumpets Now tell me what sounds the old Gaffer Macklin have made in his chest and what the young Copper also Jerry talked for nearly a quarter of an hour about sick people in the village while Rene asked questions Then he sighed and said You explain very well Monsieur Gamm but if only I had your opportunities to listen for myself Do you think these poor people would let me listen to them through my trumpet for a little money No Rene s as poor as a church mouse They d kill you Mosheur It s all I can do to coax em to abide it and I m Jerry Gamm said Jerry He s very proud of his attainments Then these poor people are alarmed No said Rene They ve had it in at me for some time back because o my tryin your trumpets on their sick and I reckon by the talk at the alehouse they won t stand much more Tom Dunch an some of his kidney was drinkin themselves riot ripe when I passed along after noon Charms an mutterin s an bits o red wool an black hens is in the way o nature to these fools Mosheur but anything likely to do em real service is devil s work by their estimation If I was you I d go home before they come Jerry spoke quite quietly and Rene shrugged his shoulders I am prisoner on parole Monsieur Gamm he said I have no home Now that was unkind of Rene He s often told me that he looked on England as his home I suppose it s French politeness Then we ll talk o something that matters said Jerry Not to name no names Mosheur Lanark what might be your own opinion o some one who ain t old Gaffer Macklin nor young Copper Is that person better or worse Better for time that is said Rene He meant for the time being but I never could teach him some phrases I thought so too said Jerry But how about time to come Rene shook his head and then he blew his nose You don t know how odd a man looks blowing his nose when you are sitting directly above him I ve thought that too said Jerry He rumbled so deep I could scarcely catch It don t make much odds to me because I m old But you re young Mosheur you re young and he put his hand on Rene s knee and Rene covered it with his hand I didn t know they were such friends Thank you mon ami said Rene I am much oblige Let us return to our trumpet making But I forget he stood up it appears that you receive this afternoon You can t see into Gamm s Lane from the oak but the gate opened and fat little Doctor Break stumped in mopping his head and half a dozen of our people following him very drunk You ought to have seen Rene bow he does it beautifully A word with you Laennec said Doctor Break Jerry has been practising some devilry or other on these poor wretches and they ve asked me to be arbiter Whatever that means I reckon it s safer than asking you to be doctor said Jerry and Tom Dunch one of our carters laughed That ain t right feeling of you Tom Jerry said seeing how clever Doctor Break put away your thorn in the flesh last winter Tom s wife had died at Christmas though Doctor Break bled her twice a week Doctor Break danced with rage This is all beside the mark he said These good people are willing to testify that you ve been impudently prying into God s secrets by means of some papistical contrivance which this person he pointed to poor Rene has furnished you with Why here are the things themselves Rene was holding a trumpet in his hand Then all the men talked at once They said old Gaffer Macklin was dying from stitches in his side where Jerry had put the trumpet they called it the devil s ear piece and they said it left round red witch marks on people s skins and dried up their lights and made em spit blood and threw em into sweats Terrible things they said You never heard such a noise I took advantage of it to cough Rene and Jerry were standing with their backs to the pigsty Jerry fumbled in his big flap pockets and fished up a pair of pistols You ought to have seen the men give back when he cocked his He passed one to Rene Wait Wait said Rene I will explain to the doctor if he permits He waved a trumpet at him and the men at the gate shouted Don t touch it Doctor Don t lay a hand to the thing Come come said Rene You are not so big fool as you pretend No Doctor Break backed toward the gate watching Jerry s pistol and Rene followed him with his trumpet like a nurse trying to amuse a child and put the ridiculous thing to his ear to show how it was used and talked of la Gloire and l Humanite and la Science while Doctor Break watched jerry s pistol and swore I nearly laughed aloud Now listen Now listen said Rene This will be moneys in your pockets my dear confrere You will become rich Then Doctor Break said something about adventurers who could not earn an honest living in their own country creeping into decent houses and taking advantage of gentlemen s confidence to enrich themselves by base intrigues Rene dropped his absurd trumpet and made one of his best bows I knew he was angry from the way he rolled his r s Ver r ry good said he For that I shall have much pleasure to kill you now and here Monsieur Gamm another bow to Jerry you will please lend him your pistol or he shall have mine I give you my word I know not which is best and if he will choose a second from his friends over there another bow to our drunken yokels at the gate we will commence That s fair enough said Jerry Tom Dunch you owe it to the Doctor to be his second Place your man No said Tom No mixin in gentry s quarrels for me And he shook his head and went out and the others followed him Hold on said Jerry You ve forgot what you set out to do up at the alehouse just now You was goin to search me for witch marks you was goin to duck me in the pond you was goin to drag all my bits o sticks out o my little cottage here What s the matter with you Wouldn t you like to be with your old woman tonight Tom But they didn t even look back much less come They ran to the village alehouse like hares No matter for these canaille said Rene buttoning up his coat so as not to show any linen All gentlemen do that before a duel Dad says and he s been out five times You shall be his second Monsieur Gamm Give him the pistol Doctor Break took it as if it was red hot but he said that if Rene resigned his pretensions in certain quarters he would pass over the matter Rene bowed deeper than ever As for that he said if you were not the ignorant which you are you would have known long ago that the subject of your remarks is not for any living man I don t know what the subject of his remarks might have been but he spoke in a simply dreadful voice my dear and Doctor Break turned quite white and said Rene was a liar and then Rene caught him by the throat and choked him black Well my dear as if this wasn t deliciously exciting enough just exactly at that minute I heard a strange voice on the other side of the hedge say What s this What s this Bucksteed and there was my father and Sir Arthur Wesley on horseback in the lane and there was Rene kneeling on Doctor Break and there was I up in the oak listening with all my ears I must have leaned forward too much and the voice gave me such a start that I slipped I had only time to make one jump on to the pigsty roof another before the tiles broke on to the pigsty wall and then I bounced down into the garden just behind Jerry with my hair full of bark Imagine the situation Oh I can Una laughed till she nearly fell off the stool Dad said Phil a del phia and Sir Arthur Wesley said Good Ged and Jerry put his foot on the pistol Rene had dropped But Rene was splendid He never even looked at me He began to untwist Doctor Break s neckcloth as fast as he d twisted it and asked him if he felt better What s happened What s happened said Dad A fit said Rene I fear my confrere has had a fit Do not be alarmed He recovers himself Shall I bleed you a little my dear Doctor Doctor Break was very good too He said I am vastly obliged Monsieur Laennec but I am restored now And as he went out of the gate he told Dad it was a syncope I think Then Sir Arthur said Quite right Bucksteed Not another word They are both gentlemen And he took off his cocked hat to Doctor Break and Rene But poor Dad wouldn t let well alone He kept saying Philadelphia what does all this mean Well sir I said I ve only just come down As far as I could see it looked as though Doctor Break had had a sudden seizure That was quite true if you d seen Rene seize him Sir Arthur laughed Not much change there Bucksteed he said She s a lady a thorough lady Heaven knows she doesn t look like one said poor Dad Go home Philadelphia So I went home my dear don t laugh so right under Sir Arthur s nose a most enormous nose feeling as though I were twelve years old going to be whipped Oh I beg your pardon child It s all right said Una I m getting on for thirteen I ve never been whipped but I know how you felt All the same it must have been funny Funny If you d heard Sir Arthur jerking out Good Ged Bucksteed every minute as they rode behind me and poor Dad saying Pon my honour Arthur I can t account for it Oh how my cheeks tingled when I reached my room But Cissie had laid out my very best evening dress the white satin one vandyked at the bottom with spots of morone foil and the pearl knots you know catching up the drapery from the left shoulder I had poor mother s lace tucker and her coronet comb Oh you lucky Una murmured And gloves French kid my dear Philadelphia patted her shoulder and morone satin shoes and a morone and gold crape fan That restored my calm Nice things always do I wore my hair banded on my forehead with a little curl over the left ear And when I descended the stairs en grande tenue old Amoore curtsied to me without my having to stop and look at her which alas is too often the case Sir Arthur highly approved of the dinner my dear the mackerel did come in time We had all the Marklake silver out and he toasted my health and he asked me where my little bird s nesting sister was I know he did it to quiz me so I looked him straight in the face my dear and I said I always send her to the nursery Sir Arthur when I receive guests at Marklake Hall Oh how chee clever of you What did he say Una cried He said Not much change there Bucksteed Ged I deserved it and he toasted me again They talked about the French and what a shame it was that Sir Arthur only commanded a brigade at Hastings and he told Dad of a battle in India at a place called Assaye Dad said it was a terrible fight but Sir Arthur described it as though it had been a whist party I suppose because a lady was present Of course you were the lady I wish I d seen you said Una I wish you had child I had such a triumph after dinner Rene and Doctor Break came in They had quite made up their quarrel and they told me they had the highest esteem for each other and I laughed and said I heard every word of it up in the tree You never saw two men so frightened in your life and when I said What was the subject of your remarks Rene neither of them knew where to look Oh I quizzed them unmercifully They d seen me jump off the pigsty roof remember But what was the subject of their remarks said Una Oh Doctor Break said it was a professional matter so the laugh was turned on me I was horribly afraid it might have been something unladylike and indelicate But that wasn t my triumph Dad asked me to play on the harp Between just you and me child I had been practising a new song from London I don t always live in trees for weeks and I gave it them for a surprise What was it said Una Sing it I have given my heart to a flower Not very difficult fingering but r r ravishing sentiment Philadelphia coughed and cleared her throat I ve a deep voice for my age and size she explained Contralto you know but it ought to be stronger and she began her face all dark against the last of the soft pink sunset I have given my heart to a flower Though I know it is fading away Though I know it will live but an hour And leave me to mourn its decay Isn t that touchingly sweet Then the last verse I wish I had my harp dear goes as low as my register will reach She drew in her chin and took a deep breath Ye desolate whirlwinds that rave I charge you be good to my dear She is all she is all that I have And the time of our parting is near Beautiful said Una And did they like it Like it They were overwhelmed accables as Rene says My dear if I hadn t seen it I shouldn t have believed that I could have drawn tears genuine tears to the eyes of four grown men But I did Rene simply couldn t endure it He s all French sensibility He hid his face and said Assez Mademoiselle C est plus fort que moi Assez And Sir Arthur blew his nose and said Good Ged This is worse than Assaye While Dad sat with the tears simply running down his cheeks And what did Doctor Break do He got up and pretended to look out of the window but I saw his little fat shoulders jerk as if he had the hiccoughs That was a triumph I never suspected him of sensibility Oh I wish I d seen I wish I d been you said Una clasping her hands Puck rustled and rose from the fern just as a big blundering cock chafer flew smack against Una s cheek When she had finished rubbing the place missus Vincey called to her that Pansy had been fractious or she would have come long before to help her strain and pour off It didn t matter said Una I just waited Is that old Pansy barging about the lower pasture now No said missus Vincey listening It sounds more like a horse being galloped middlin quick through the woods but there s no road there I reckon it s one of Gleason s colts loose Shall I see you up to the house Miss Una Gracious no thank you What s going to hurt me said Una and she put her stool away behind the oak and strolled home through the gaps that old Hobden kept open for her Brookland Road I was very well pleased with what I knowed I reckoned myself no fool Till I met with a maid on the Brookland Road That turned me back to school Low down low down Where the liddle green lanterns shine Oh maids I ve done with ee all but one And she can never be mine Twas right in the middest of a hot June night With thunder duntin round And I seed her face by the fairy light That beats from off the ground She only smiled and she never spoke She smiled and went away But when she d gone my heart was broke And my wits was clean astray Oh Stop your ringing and let me be Let be O Brookland bells You ll ring Old Goodman out of the sea Before I wed one else Old Goodman s farm is rank sea sand And was this thousand year But it shall turn to rich plough land Before I change my dear Oh Fairfield Church is water bound From Autumn to the Spring But it shall turn to high hill ground Before my bells do ring Oh leave me walk on the Brookland Road In the thunder and warm rain Oh leave me look where my love goed And p raps I ll see her again Low down low down Where the liddle green lanterns shine Oh maids I ve done with ee all but one And she can never be mine Earl Godwin of the Goodwin Sands THE KNIFE AND THE NAKED CHALK The Run of the Downs The Weald is good the Downs are best I ll give you the run of em East to West Beachy Head and Winddoor Hill They were once and they are still Firle Mount Caburn and Mount Harry Go back as far as sums ll carry Ditchling Beacon and Chanctonbury Ring They have looked on many a thing And what those two have missed between em I reckon Truleigh Hill has seen em Highden Bignor and Duncton Down Knew Old England before the Crown Linch Down Treyford and Sunwood Knew Old England before the Flood And when you end on the Hampshire side Butser s old as Time and Tide The Downs are sheep the Weald is corn You be glad you are Sussex born The Knife and the Naked Chalk The children went to the seaside for a month and lived in a flint village on the bare windy chalk Downs quite thirty miles away from home They made friends with an old shepherd called mister Dudeney who had known their Father when their Father was little He did not talk like their own people in the Weald of Sussex and he used different names for farm things but he understood how they felt and let them go with him He had a tiny cottage about half a mile from the village where his wife made mead from thyme honey and nursed sick lambs in front of a coal fire while Old Jim who was mister Dudeney s sheep dog s father lay at the door They brought up beef bones for Old Jim you must never give a sheep dog mutton bones and if mister Dudeney happened to be far in the Downs missus Dudeney would tell the dog to take them to him and he did One August afternoon when the village water cart had made the street smell specially townified they went to look for their shepherd as usual and as usual Old Jim crawled over the doorstep and took them in charge The sun was hot the dry grass was very slippery and the distances were very distant It s Just like the sea said Una when Old Jim halted in the shade of a lonely flint barn on a bare rise You see where you re going and you go there and there s nothing between Dan slipped off his shoes When we get home I shall sit in the woods all day he said Whuff said Old Jim to show he was ready and struck across a long rolling stretch of turf Presently he asked for his beefbone Not yet said Dan Where s mister Dudeney Where s Master Old Jim looked as if he thought they were mad and asked again Don t you give it him Una cried I m not going to be left howling in a desert Show boy Show said Dan for the Downs seemed as bare as the palm of your hand Old Jim sighed and trotted forward Soon they spied the blob of mister Dudeney s hat against the sky a long way off Right All right said Dan Old Jim wheeled round took his bone carefully between his blunted teeth and returned to the shadow of the old barn looking just like a wolf The children went on Two kestrels hung bivvering and squealing above them A gull flapped lazily along the white edge of the cliffs The curves of the Downs shook a little in the heat and so did mister Dudeney s distant head They walked toward it very slowly and found themselves staring into a horseshoe shaped hollow a hundred feet deep whose steep sides were laced with tangled sheep tracks The flock grazed on the flat at the bottom under charge of Young Jim mister Dudeney sat comfortably knitting on the edge of the slope his crook between his knees They told him what Old Jim had done Ah he thought you could see my head as soon as he did The closeter you be to the turf the more you see things You look warm like said mister Dudeney We be said Una flopping down And tired Set beside o me here The shadow ll begin to stretch out in a little while and a heat shake o wind will come up with it that ll overlay your eyes like so much wool We don t want to sleep said Una indignantly but she settled herself as she spoke in the first strip of early afternoon shade O course not You come to talk with me same as your father used He didn t need no dog to guide him to Norton Pit Well he belonged here said Dan and laid himself down at length on the turf He did And what beats me is why he went off to live among them messy trees in the Weald when he might ha stayed here and looked all about him There s no profit to trees They draw the lightning and sheep shelter under em and so like as not you ll lose a half score ewes struck dead in one storm Tck Your father knew that Trees aren t messy Una rose on her elbow And what about firewood I don t like coal Eh You lie a piece more uphill and you ll lie more natural said mister Dudeney with his provoking deaf smile Now press your face down and smell to the turf That s Southdown thyme which makes our Southdown mutton beyond compare and my mother told me twill cure anything except broken necks or hearts I forget which They sniffed and somehow forgot to lift their cheeks from the soft thymy cushions You don t get nothing like that in the Weald Watercress maybe said mister Dudeney But we ve water brooks full of it where you paddle in hot weather Una replied watching a yellow and violet banded snail shell close to her eye Brooks flood Then you must shift your sheep let alone foot rot afterward I put more dependence on a dew pond any day How s a dew pond made said Dan and tilted his hat over his eyes mister Dudeney explained The air trembled a little as though it could not make up its mind whether to slide into the Pit or move across the open But it seemed easiest to go downhill and the children felt one soft puff after another slip and sidle down the slope in fragrant breaths that baffed on their eyelids The little whisper of the sea by the cliffs joined with the whisper of the wind over the grass the hum of insects in the thyme the ruffle and rustle of the flock below and a thickish mutter deep in the very chalk beneath them mister Dudeney stopped explaining and went on with his knitting They were roused by voices The shadow had crept halfway down the steep side of Norton Pit and on the edge of it his back to them Puck sat beside a half naked man who seemed busy at some work The wind had dropped and in that funnel of ground every least noise and movement reached them like whispers up a water Pipe That is clever said Puck leaning over How truly you shape it Yes but what does The Beast care for a brittle flint tip Bah The man flicked something contemptuously over his shoulder It fell between Dan and Una a beautiful dark blue flint arrow head still hot from the maker s hand The man reached for another stone and worked away like a thrush with a snail shell Flint work is fool s work he said at last One does it because one always did it but when it comes to dealing with The Beast no good He shook his shaggy head The Beast was dealt with long ago He has gone said Puck He ll be back at lambing time I know him He chipped very carefully and the flints squeaked Not he Children can lie out on the Chalk now all day through and go home safe Can they Well call The Beast by his True Name and I ll believe it the man replied Surely Puck leaped to his feet curved his hands round his mouth and shouted Wolf Wolf Norton Pit threw back the echo from its dry sides Wuff Wuff like Young jim s bark You see You hear said Puck Nobody answers Grey Shepherd is gone Feet in the Night has run off There are no more wolves Wonderful The man wiped his forehead as though he were hot Who drove him away You Many men through many years each working in his own country Were you one of them Puck answered The man slid his sheepskin cloak to his waist and without a word pointed to his side which was all seamed and blotched with scars His arms too were dimpled from shoulder to elbow with horrible white dimples I see said Puck It is The Beast s mark What did you use against him Hand hammer and spear as our fathers did before us So Then how Puck twitched aside the man s dark brown cloak how did a Flint worker come by that Show man show He held out his little hand The man slipped a long dark iron knife almost a short sword from his belt and after breathing on it handed it hilt first to Puck who took it with his head on one side as you should when you look at the works of a watch squinted down the dark blade and very delicately rubbed his forefinger from the point to the hilt Good said he in a surprised tone It should be The Children of the Night made it the man answered So I see by the iron What might it have cost you This The man raised his hand to his cheek Puck whistled like a Weald starling By the Great Rings of the Chalk he cried Was that your price Turn sunward that I may see better and shut your eye He slipped his hand beneath the man s chin and swung him till he faced the children up the slope They saw that his right eye was gone and the eyelid lay shrunk Quickly Puck turned him round again and the two sat down It was for the sheep The sheep are the people said the man in an ashamed voice What else could I have done You know Old One Puck sighed a little fluttering sigh Take the knife I listen The man bowed his head drove the knife into the turf and while it still quivered said This is witness between us that I speak the thing that has been Before my Knife and the Naked Chalk I speak Touch Puck laid a hand on the hilt It stopped shaking The children wriggled a little nearer I am of the People of the Worked Flint I am the one son of the Priestess who sells the Winds to the Men of the Sea I am the Buyer of the Knife the Keeper of the People the man began in a sort of singing shout These are my names in this country of the Naked Chalk between the Trees and the Sea Yours was a great country Your names are great too said Puck One cannot feed some things on names and songs The man hit himself on the chest It is better always better to count one s children safe round the fire their Mother among them Ahai said Puck I think this will be a very old tale I warm myself and eat at any fire that I choose but there is no one to light me a fire or cook my meat I sold all that when I bought the Magic Knife for my people It was not right that The Beast should master man What else could I have done I hear I know I listen said Puck When I was old enough to take my place in the Sheepguard The Beast gnawed all our country like a bone between his teeth He came in behind the flocks at watering time and watched them round the Dew ponds he leaped into the folds between our knees at the shearing he walked out alongside the grazing flocks and chose his meat on the hoof while our boys threw flints at him he crept by night into the huts and licked the babe from between the mother s hands he called his companions and pulled down men in broad daylight on the Naked Chalk No not always did he do so This was his cunning He would go away for a while to let us forget him A year two years perhaps we neither smelt nor heard nor saw him When our flocks had increased when our men did not always look behind them when children strayed from the fenced places when our women walked alone to draw water back back back came the Curse of the Chalk Grey Shepherd Feet in the Night The Beast The Beast The Beast He laughed at our little brittle arrows and our poor blunt spears He learned to run in under the stroke of the hammer I think he knew when there was a flaw in the flint Often it does not show till you bring it down on his snout Then Pouf the false flint falls all to flinders and you are left with the hammer handle in your fist and his teeth in your flank I have felt them At evening too in the dew or when it has misted and rained your spear head lashings slack off though you have kept them beneath your cloak all day You are alone but so close to the home ponds that you stop to tighten the sinews with hands teeth and a piece of driftwood You bend over and pull so That is the minute for which he has followed you since the stars went out Aarh he Wurr aarh he says Norton Pit gave back the growl like a pack of real wolves Then he is on your right shoulder feeling for the vein in your neck and perhaps your sheep run on without you To fight The Beast is nothing but to be despised by The Beast when he fights you that is like his teeth in the heart Old One why is it that men desire so greatly and can do so little I do not know Did you desire so much said Puck I desired to master The Beast It is not right that The Beast should master man But my people were afraid Even my Mother the Priestess was afraid when I told her what I desired We were accustomed to be afraid of The Beast When I was made a man and a maiden she was a Priestess waited for me at the Dew ponds The Beast flitted from off the Chalk Perhaps it was a sickness perhaps he had gone to his Gods to learn how to do us new harm But he went and we breathed more freely The women sang again the children were not so much guarded our flocks grazed far out I took mine yonder he pointed inland to the hazy line of the Weald where the new grass was best They grazed north I followed till we were close to the Trees he lowered his voice close there where the Children of the Night live He pointed north again Ah now I remember a thing said Puck Tell me why did your people fear the Trees so extremely Because the Gods hate the Trees and strike them with lightning We can see them burning for days all along the Chalk s edge Besides all the Chalk knows that the Children of the Night though they worship our Gods are magicians When a man goes into their country they change his spirit they put words into his mouth they make him like talking water But a voice in my heart told me to go toward the north While I watched my sheep there I saw three Beasts chasing a man who ran toward the Trees By this I knew he was a Child of the Night We Flint workers fear the Trees more than we fear The Beast He had no hammer He carried a knife like this one A Beast leaped at him He stretched out his knife The Beast fell dead The other Beasts ran away howling which they would never have done from a Flint worker The man went in among the Trees I looked for the dead Beast He had been killed in a new way by a single deep clean cut without bruise or tear which had split his bad heart Wonderful So I saw that the man s knife was magic and I thought how to get it thought strongly how to get it When I brought the flocks to the shearing my Mother the Priestess asked me What is the new thing which you have seen and I see in your face I said It is a sorrow to me and she answered All new things are sorrow Sit in my place and eat sorrow I sat down in her place by the fire where she talks to the ghosts in winter and two voices spoke in my heart One voice said Ask the Children of the Night for the Magic Knife It is not fit that The Beast should master man I listened to that voice One voice said If you go among the Trees the Children of the Night will change your spirit Eat and sleep here The other voice said Ask for the Knife I listened to that voice I said to my Mother in the morning I go away to find a thing for the people but I do not know whether I shall return in my own shape She answered Whether you live or die or are made different I am your Mother True said Puck The Old Ones themselves cannot change men s mothers even if they would Let us thank the Old Ones I spoke to my Maiden the Priestess who waited for me at the Dew ponds She promised fine things too The man laughed I went away to that place where I had seen the magician with the knife I lay out two days on the short grass before I ventured among the Trees I felt my way before me with a stick I was afraid of the terrible talking Trees I was afraid of the ghosts in the branches of the soft ground underfoot of the red and black waters I was afraid above all of the Change It came They saw him wipe his forehead once again and his strong back muscles quivered till he laid his hand on the knife hilt A fire without a flame burned in my head an evil taste grew in my mouth my eyelids shut hot over my eyes my breath was hot between my teeth and my hands were like the hands of a stranger I was made to sing songs and to mock the Trees though I was afraid of them At the same time I saw myself laughing and I was very sad for this fine young man who was myself Ah The Children of the Night know magic I think that is done by the Spirits of the Mist They change a man if he sleeps among them said Puck Had you slept in any mists Yes but I know it was the Children of the Night After three days I saw a red light behind the Trees and I heard a heavy noise I saw the Children of the Night dig red stones from a hole and lay them in fires The stones melted like tallow and the men beat the soft stuff with hammers I wished to speak to these men but the words were changed in my mouth and all I could say was Do not make that noise It hurts my head By this I knew that I was bewitched and I clung to the Trees and prayed the Children of the Night to take off their spells They were cruel They asked me many questions which they would never allow me to answer They changed my words between my teeth till I wept Then they led me into a hut and covered the floor with hot stones and dashed water on the stones and sang charms till the sweat poured off me like water I slept When I waked my own spirit not the strange shouting thing was back in my body and I was like a cool bright stone on the shingle between the sea and the sunshine The magicians came to hear me women and men each wearing a Magic Knife Their Priestess was their Ears and their Mouth I spoke I spoke many words that went smoothly along like sheep in order when their shepherd standing on a mound can count those coming and those far off getting ready to come I asked for Magic Knives for my people I said that my people would bring meat and milk and wool and lay them in the short grass outside the Trees if the Children of the Night would leave Magic Knives for our people to take away They were pleased Their Priestess said For whose sake have you come I answered The sheep are the people If The Beast kills our sheep our people die So I come for a Magic Knife to kill The Beast She said We do not know if our God will let us trade with the people of the Naked Chalk Wait till we have asked When they came back from the Question place their Gods are our Gods their Priestess said The God needs a proof that your words are true I said What is the proof She said The God says that if you have come for the sake of your people you will give him your right eye to be put out but if you have come for any other reason you will not give it This proof is between you and the God We ourselves are sorry I said This is a hard proof Is there no other road She said Yes You can go back to your people with your two eyes in your head if you choose But then you will not get any Magic Knives for your people I said It would be easier if I knew that I were to be killed She said Perhaps the God knew this too See I have made my knife hot I said Be quick then With her knife heated in the flame she put out my right eye She herself did it I am the son of a Priestess She was a Priestess It was not work for any common man True Most true said Puck No common man s work that And afterwards Afterwards I did not see out of that eye any more I found also that a one eye does not tell you truly where things are Try it At this Dan put his hand over one eye and reached for the flint arrow head on the grass He missed it by inches It s true he whispered to Una You can t judge distances a bit with only one eye Puck was evidently making the same experiment for the man laughed at him I know it is so said he Even now I am not always sure of my blow I stayed with the Children of the Night till my eye healed They said I was the son of Tyr the God who put his right hand in a Beast s mouth They showed me how they melted their red stone and made the Magic Knives of it They told me the charms they sang over the fires and at the beatings I can sing many charms Then he began to laugh like a boy I was thinking of my journey home he said and of the surprised Beast He had come back to the Chalk I saw him I smelt his lairs as soon as ever I left the Trees He did not know I had the Magic Knife I hid it under my cloak the Knife that the Priestess gave me Ho Ho That happy day was too short See A Beast would wind me Wow he would say Here is my Flint worker He would come leaping tail in air he would roll he would lay his head between his paws out of merriness of heart at his warm waiting meal He would leap and oh his eye in mid leap when he saw when he saw the knife held ready for him It pierced his hide as a rush pierces curdled milk Often he had no time to howl I did not trouble to flay any beasts I killed Sometimes I missed my blow Then I took my little flint hammer and beat out his brains as he cowered He made no fight He knew the Knife But The Beast is very cunning Before evening all The Beasts had smelt the blood on my knife and were running from me like hares They knew Then I walked as a man should the Master of The Beast So came I back to my Mother s house There was a lamb to be killed I cut it in two halves with my knife and I told her all my tale She said This is the work of a God I kissed her and laughed I went to my Maiden who waited for me at the Dew ponds There was a lamb to be killed I cut it in two halves with my knife and told her all my tale She said It is the work of a God I laughed but she pushed me away and being on my blind side ran off before I could kiss her I went to the Men of the Sheepguard at watering time There was a sheep to be killed for their meat I cut it in two halves with my knife and told them all my tale They said It is the work of a God I said We talk too much about Gods Let us eat and be happy and tomorrow I will take you to the Children of the Night and each man will find a Magic Knife I was glad to smell our sheep again to see the broad sky from edge to edge and to hear the sea I slept beneath the stars in my cloak The men talked among themselves I led them the next day to the Trees taking with me meat wool and curdled milk as I had promised We found the Magic Knives laid out on the grass as the Children of the Night had promised They watched us from among the Trees Their Priestess called to me and said How is it with your people I said Their hearts are changed I cannot see their hearts as I used to She said That is because you have only one eye Come to me and I will be both your eyes But I said I must show my people how to use their knives against The Beast as you showed me how to use my knife I said this because the Magic Knife does not balance like the flint She said What you have done you have done for the sake of a woman and not for the sake of your people I asked of her Then why did the God accept my right eye and why are you so angry She answered Because any man can lie to a God but no man can lie to a woman And I am not angry with you I am only very sorrowful for you Wait a little and you will see out of your one eye why I am sorry So she hid herself I went back with my people each one carrying his Knife and making it sing in the air tssee sssse The Flint never sings It mutters ump ump The Beast heard The Beast saw He knew Everywhere he ran away from us We all laughed As we walked over the grass my Mother s brother the Chief on the Men s Side he took off his Chief s necklace of yellow sea stones How Eh Oh I remember Amber said Puck And would have put them on my neck I said No I am content What does my one eye matter if my other eye sees fat sheep and fat children running about safely My Mother s brother said to them I told you he would never take such things Then they began to sing a song in the Old Tongue The Song of Tyr I sang with them but my Mother s brother said This is your song O Buyer of the Knife Let us sing it Tyr Even then I did not understand till I saw that that no man stepped on my shadow and I knew that they thought me to be a God like the God Tyr who gave his right hand to conquer a Great Beast By the Fire in the Belly of the Flint was that so Puck rapped out By my Knife and the Naked Chalk so it was They made way for my shadow as though it had been a Priestess walking to the Barrows of the Dead I was afraid I said to myself My Mother and my Maiden will know I am not Tyr But still I was afraid with the fear of a man who falls into a steep flint pit while he runs and feels that it will be hard to climb out When we came to the Dew ponds all our people were there The men showed their knives and told their tale The sheep guards also had seen The Beast flying from us The Beast went west across the river in packs howling He knew the Knife had come to the Naked Chalk at last at last He knew So my work was done I looked for my Maiden among the Priestesses She looked at me but she did not smile She made the sign to me that our Priestesses must make when they sacrifice to the Old Dead in the Barrows I would have spoken but my Mother s brother made himself my Mouth as though I had been one of the Old Dead in the Barrows for whom our Priests speak to the people on Midsummer Mornings I remember Well I remember those Midsummer Mornings said Puck Then I went away angrily to my Mother s house She would have knelt before me Then I was more angry but she said Only a God would have spoken to me thus a Priestess A man would have feared the punishment of the Gods I looked at her and I laughed I could not stop my unhappy laughing They called me from the door by the name of Tyr himself A young man with whom I had watched my first flocks and chipped my first arrow and fought my first Beast called me by that name in the Old Tongue He asked my leave to take my Maiden His eyes were lowered his hands were on his forehead He was full of the fear of a God but of me a man he had no fear when he asked I did not kill him I said Call the maiden She came also without fear this very one that had waited for me that had talked with me by our Dew ponds Being a Priestess she lifted her eyes to me As I look on a hill or a cloud so she looked at me She spoke in the Old Tongue which Priestesses use when they make prayers to the Old Dead in the Barrows She asked leave that she might light the fire in my companion s house and that I should bless their children I did not kill her I heard my own voice little and cold say Let it be as you desire and they went away hand in hand My heart grew little and cold a wind shouted in my ears my eye darkened I said to my Mother Can a God die I heard her say What is it What is it my son and I fell into darkness full of hammer noises I was not Oh poor poor God said Puck And your wise Mother She knew As soon as I dropped she knew When my spirit came back I heard her whisper in my ear Whether you live or die or are made different I am your Mother That was good better even than the water she gave me and the going away of the sickness Though I was ashamed to have fallen down yet I was very glad She was glad too Neither of us wished to lose the other There is only the one Mother for the one son I heaped the fire for her and barred the doors and sat at her feet as before I went away and she combed my hair and sang I said at last What is to be done to the people who say that I am Tyr She said He who has done a God like thing must bear himself like a God I see no way out of it The people are now your sheep till you die You cannot drive them off I said This is a heavier sheep than I can lift She said In time it will grow easy In time perhaps you will not lay it down for any maiden anywhere Be wise be very wise my son for nothing is left you except the words and the songs and the worship of a God Oh poor God said Puck But those are not altogether bad things I know they are not but I would sell them all all all for one small child of my own smearing himself with the ashes of our own house fire He wrenched his knife from the turf thrust it into his belt and stood up And yet what else could I have done he said The sheep are the people It is a very old tale Puck answered I have heard the like of it not only on the Naked Chalk but also among the Trees under Oak and Ash and Thorn The afternoon shadows filled all the quiet emptiness of Norton Pit The children heard the sheep bells and Young jim s busy bark above them and they scrambled up the slope to the level We let you have your sleep out said mister Dudeney as the flock scattered before them It s making for tea time now Look what I ve found said Dan and held up a little blue flint arrow head as fresh as though it had been chipped that very day Oh said mister Dudeney the closeter you be to the turf the more you re apt to see things I ve found em often Some says the fairies made em but I says they was made by folks like ourselves only a goodish time back They re lucky to keep Now you couldn t ever have slept not to any profit among your father s trees same as you ve laid out on Naked Chalk could you One doesn t want to sleep in the woods said Una Then what s the good of em said mister Dudeney Might as well set in the barn all day Fetch em long Jim boy The Downs that looked so bare and hot when they came were full of delicious little shadow dimples the smell of the thyme and the salt mixed together on the south west drift from the still sea their eyes dazzled with the low sun and the long grass under it looked golden The sheep knew where their fold was so Young Jim came back to his master and they all four strolled home the scabious heads swishing about their ankles and their shadows streaking behind them like the shadows of giants Song of the Men s Side Once we feared The Beast when he followed us we ran Ran very fast though we knew It was not right that The Beast should master Man But what could we Flint workers do The Beast only grinned at our spears round his ears Grinned at the hammers that we made But now we will hunt him for the life with the Knife And this is the Buyer of the Blade Room for his shadow on the grass let it pass To left and right stand clear This is the Buyer of the Blade be afraid This is the great God Tyr Tyr thought hard till he hammered out a plan For he knew it was not right And it is not right that The Beast should master Man So he went to the Children of the Night He begged a Magic Knife of their make for our sake When he begged for the Knife they said The price of the Knife you would buy is an eye And that was the price he paid Tell it to the Barrows of the Dead run ahead Shout it so the Women s Side can hear This is the Buyer of the Blade be afraid This is the great God Tyr Our women and our little ones may walk on the Chalk As far as we can see them and beyond We shall not be anxious for our sheep when we keep Tally at the shearing pond We can eat with both our elbows on our knees if we please We can sleep after meals in the sun For Shepherd of the Twilight is dismayed at the Blade Feet in the Night have run Dog without a Master goes away Hai Tyr aie Devil in the Dusk has run Then Room for his shadow on the grass let it pass To left and right stand clear This is the Buyer of the Blade be afraid This is the great God Tyr BROTHER SQUARE

1093_132891_000010_000001	train-clean-360	They had turned themselves out of doors while their trunks were being packed and strolled over the Downs towards the dull evening sea 
1093_132891_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The tide was dead low under the chalk cliffs and the little wrinkled waves grieved along the sands up the coast to Newhaven and down the coast to long grey Brighton whose smoke trailed out across the Channel

none	none	That was where Uncle Aurette used to sink his brandy kegs from Boulogne and we fished em up and rowed em into The Gap here for the ponies to run inland One thickish night in January of Ninety three Dad and Uncle Lot and me came over from Shoreham in the smack and we found Uncle Aurette and the L Estranges my cousins waiting for us in their lugger with New Year s presents from Mother s folk in Boulogne I remember Aunt Cecile she d sent me a fine new red knitted cap which I put on then and there for the French was having their Revolution in those days and red caps was all the fashion Uncle Aurette tells us that they had cut off their King Louis head and moreover the Brest forts had fired on an English man o war The news wasn t a week old
1093_132891_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 That means war again when we was only just getting used to the peace says Dad

none	none	So he and Uncle Lot took the dinghy and left me in the smack playing on my fiddle to guide em back
1093_132891_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Presently I heard guns 
none	none	Two of em sounded mighty like Uncle Aurette s three pounders

1093_132891_000044_000004	train-clean-360	He was open handed with his compliments but he would lay his guns himself 
none	none	I stopped fiddling to listen and I heard a whole skyful o French up in the fog and a high bow come down on top o the smack 
1093_132891_000044_000006	train-clean-360	I hadn t time to call or think 
none	none	I remember the smack heeling over and me standing on the gunwale pushing against the ship s side as if I hoped to bear her off Then the square of an open port with a lantern in it slid by in front of my nose 
1093_132891_000044_000008	train-clean-360	I kicked back on our gunwale as it went under and slipped through that port into the French ship me and my fiddle 
none	none	Gracious said Una What an adventure
1093_132891_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Didn t anybody see you come in said Dan 
none	none	There wasn t any one there I d made use of an orlop deck port that s the next deck below the gun deck which by rights should not have been open at all 
1093_132891_000047_000002	train-clean-360	The crew was standing by their guns up above 
1093_132891_000047_000003	train-clean-360	I rolled on to a pile of dunnage in the dark and I went to sleep 
none	none	When I woke men was talking all round me telling each other their names and sorrows just like Dad told me pressed men used to talk in the last war Pretty soon I made out they d all been hove aboard together by the press gangs and left to sort emselves The ship she was the Embuscade a thirty six gun Republican frigate Captain Jean Baptiste Bompard two days out of Le Havre going to the United States with a Republican French Ambassador of the name of Genet 
1093_132891_000047_000007	train-clean-360	They had been up all night clearing for action on account of hearing guns in the fog 
none	none	Uncle Aurette and Captain Giddens must have been passing the time o day with each other off Newhaven and the frigate had drifted past em She never knew she d run down our smack Seeing so many aboard was total strangers to each other I thought one more mightn t be noticed so I put Aunt Cecile s red cap on the back of my head and my hands in my pockets like the rest and as we French say I circulated till I found the galley What Here s one of em that isn t sick says a cook Take his breakfast to Citizen Bompard I carried the tray to the cabin but I didn t call this Bompard Citizen Oh no Mon Capitaine was my little word same as Uncle Aurette used to answer in King Louis Navy 
1093_132891_000049_000002	train-clean-360	Bompard he liked it 
none	none	He took me on for cabin servant and after that no one asked questions and thus I got good victuals and light work all the way across to America He talked a heap of politics and so did his officers and when this Ambassador Genet got rid of his land stomach and laid down the law after dinner a rooks parliament was nothing compared to their cabin I learned to know most of the men which had worked the French Revolution through waiting at table and hearing talk about em One of our forecas le six pounders was called Danton and t other Marat 
1093_132891_000049_000006	train-clean-360	I used to play the fiddle between em sitting on the capstan 
none	none	Day in and day out Bompard and Monsieur Genet talked o what France had done and how the United States was going to join her to finish off the English in this war Monsieur Genet said he d justabout make the United States fight for France He was a rude common man But I liked listening 
1093_132891_000049_000011	train-clean-360	I always helped drink any healths that was proposed specially Citizen Danton s who d cut off King Louis head 
none	none	An all Englishman might have been shocked but that s where my French blood saved me It didn t save me from getting a dose of ship s fever though the week before we put Monsieur Genet ashore at Charleston and what was left of me after bleeding and pills took the dumb horrors from living tween decks The surgeon Karaguen his name was kept me down there to help him with his plasters I was too weak to wait on Bompard I don t remember much of any account for the next few weeks till I smelled lilacs and I looked out of the port and we was moored to a wharf edge and there was a town o fine gardens and red brick houses and all the green leaves o God s world waiting for me outside What s this I said to the sick bay man Old Pierre Tiphaigne he was Philadelphia says Pierre

1093_132891_000073_000003	train-clean-360	His wife she walked me into the back yard without a word and she washed me and she cut my hair to the edge of a basin and she put me to bed and oh how I slept how I slept in that little room behind the oven looking on the flower garden 
none	none	I didn t know Toby went to the Embuscade that night and bought me off doctor Karaguen for twelve dollars and a dozen bottles of Seneca Oil Karaguen wanted a new lace to his coat and he reckoned I hadn t long to live so he put me down as discharged sick

1093_132891_000077_000001	train-clean-360	 That was his joke 
1093_132891_000077_000002	train-clean-360	He kept her under David Jones s hat shop in the Buck tavern yard and his Indian friends kept their ponies there when they visited him 
1093_132891_000077_000003	train-clean-360	I looked after the horses when I wasn t rolling pills on top of the old spinet while he played his fiddle and Red Jacket sang hymns I liked it

none	none	They came in at one door and the men at another and there was a brass chandelier you could see your face in and a nigger boy to blow the organ bellows 
1093_132891_000077_000008	train-clean-360	I carried Toby s fiddle and he played pretty much as he chose all against the organ and the singing 
none	none	He was the only one they let do it for they was a simple minded folk They used to wash each other s feet up in the attic to keep emselves humble which Lord knows they didn t need
1093_132891_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 How very queer said Una

none	none	I ve met many and seen much he said but I haven t yet found any better or quieter or forbearinger people than the Brethren and Sistern of the Moravian Church in Philadelphia Nor will I ever forget my first Sunday the service was in English that week with the smell of the flowers coming in from Pastor Meder s garden where the big peach tree is and me looking at all the clean strangeness and thinking of tween decks on the Embuscade only six days ago 
1093_132891_000079_000003	train-clean-360	Being a boy it seemed to me it had lasted for ever and was going on for ever 
none	none	But I didn t know Toby then 
1093_132891_000079_000005	train-clean-360	As soon as the dancing clock struck midnight that Sunday I was lying under the spinet I heard Toby s fiddle

1093_132891_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 I rubbed my eyes and fetched em out of the Buck stables 
1093_132891_000080_000001	train-clean-360	Red Jacket was there saddling his and when I d packed the saddle bags we three rode up Race Street to the Ferry by starlight 
1093_132891_000080_000002	train-clean-360	So we went travelling It s a kindly softly country there back of Philadelphia among the German towns Lancaster way 
1093_132891_000080_000003	train-clean-360	Little houses and bursting big barns fat cattle fat women and all as peaceful as Heaven might be if they farmed there 
none	none	Toby sold medicines out of his saddlebags and gave the French war news to folk along the roads 
1093_132891_000080_000005	train-clean-360	Him and his long hilted umberell was as well known as the stage coaches 
1093_132891_000080_000006	train-clean-360	He took orders for that famous Seneca Oil which he had the secret of from Red Jacket s Indians and he slept in friends farmhouses but he would shut all the windows so Red Jacket and me slept outside 
1093_132891_000080_000007	train-clean-360	There s nothing to hurt except snakes and they slip away quick enough if you thrash in the bushes 
1093_132891_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 I d have liked that said Dan 
1093_132891_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 I d no fault to find with those days 
none	none	In the cool o the morning the cat bird sings 
1093_132891_000082_000002	train-clean-360	He s something to listen to 
1093_132891_000082_000003	train-clean-360	And there s a smell of wild grape vine growing in damp hollows which you drop into after long rides in the heat which is beyond compare for sweetness 
none	none	So s the puffs out of the pine woods of afternoons Come sundown the frogs strike up and later on the fireflies dance in the corn Oh me the fireflies in the corn We were a week or ten days on the road tacking from one place to another such as Lancaster Bethlehem Ephrata thou Bethlehem Ephrata No odds I loved the going about 
1093_132891_000082_000008	train-clean-360	And so we jogged into dozy little Lebanon by the Blue Mountains where Toby had a cottage and a garden of all fruits 
none	none	He come north every year for this wonderful Seneca Oil the Seneca Indians made for him They d never sell to any one else and he doctored em with von Swieten pills which they valued more than their own oil He could do what he chose with them and of course he tried to make them Moravians 
1093_132891_000082_000012	train-clean-360	The Senecas are a seemly quiet people and they d had trouble enough from white men American and English during the wars to keep em in that walk 
1093_132891_000082_000013	train-clean-360	They lived on a Reservation by themselves away off by their lake 
1093_132891_000082_000014	train-clean-360	Toby took me up there and they treated me as if I was their own blood brother 
1093_132891_000082_000015	train-clean-360	Red Jacket said the mark of my bare feet in the dust was just like an Indian s and my style of walking was similar 
1093_132891_000082_000016	train-clean-360	I know I took to their ways all over 
none	none	Maybe the gipsy drop in your blood helped you said Puck
1093_132891_000084_000000	train-clean-360	 Sometimes I think it did Pharaoh went on 
none	none	Anyhow Red Jacket and Cornplanter the other Seneca chief they let me be adopted into the tribe It s only a compliment of course but Toby was angry when I showed up with my face painted 
1093_132891_000084_000003	train-clean-360	They gave me a side name which means Two Tongues because d ye see I talked French and English 
none	none	They had their own opinions I ve heard em about the French and the English and the Americans They d suffered from all of em during the wars and they only wished to be left alone But they thought a heap of the President of the United States Cornplanter had had dealings with him in some French wars out West when General Washington was only a lad His being President afterwards made no odds to em 
1093_132891_000085_000004	train-clean-360	They always called him Big Hand for he was a large fisted man and he was all of their notion of a white chief 
none	none	Cornplanter ud sweep his blanket round him and after I d filled his pipe he d begin In the old days long ago when braves were many and blankets were few Big Hand said If Red Jacket agreed to the say so he d trickle a little smoke out of the corners of his mouth If he didn t he d blow through his nostrils Then Cornplanter ud stop and Red Jacket ud take on Red Jacket was the better talker of the two I ve laid and listened to em for hours Oh they knew General Washington well 
1093_132891_000085_000009	train-clean-360	Cornplanter used to meet him at Epply s the great dancing place in the city before District Marshal William Nichols bought it 
none	none	They told me he was always glad to see em and he d hear em out to the end if they had anything on their minds They had a good deal in those days 
1093_132891_000085_000011	train-clean-360	I came at it by degrees after I was adopted into the tribe 
none	none	The talk up in Lebanon and everywhere else that summer was about the French war with England and whether the United States ud join in with France or make a peace treaty with England 
1093_132891_000085_000013	train-clean-360	Toby wanted peace so as he could go about the Reservation buying his oils But most of the white men wished for war and they was angry because the President wouldn t give the sign for it 
1093_132891_000085_000014	train-clean-360	The newspaper said men was burning Guy Fawkes images of General Washington and yelling after him in the streets of Philadelphia 
1093_132891_000085_000015	train-clean-360	You d have been astonished what those two fine old chiefs knew of the ins and outs of such matters 
none	none	The little I ve learned of politics I picked up from Cornplanter and Red Jacket on the Reservation 
1093_132891_000085_000017	train-clean-360	Toby used to read the Aurora newspaper 
none	none	He was what they call a Democrat though our Church is against the Brethren concerning themselves with politics
1093_132891_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 I hate politics too said Una and Pharaoh laughed 
none	none	I might ha guessed it he said But here s something that isn t politics 
1093_132891_000087_000002	train-clean-360	One hot evening late in August Toby was reading the newspaper on the stoop and Red Jacket was smoking under a peach tree and I was fiddling 
1093_132891_000087_000003	train-clean-360	Of a sudden Toby drops his Aurora 
1093_132891_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 I am an oldish man too fond of my own comforts he says 
1093_132891_000088_000001	train-clean-360	 I will go to the Church which is in Philadelphia 
1093_132891_000088_000002	train-clean-360	My brother lend me a spare pony 
none	none	I must be there tomorrow night
1093_132891_000089_000000	train-clean-360	 Good says Red Jacket looking at the sun 
1093_132891_000089_000001	train-clean-360	 My brother shall be there

1093_132891_000090_000001	train-clean-360	Toby had cured me of asking questions He stopped my fiddling if I did 
none	none	Besides Indians don t ask questions much and I wanted to be like em When the horses were ready I jumped up

1093_132891_000093_000001	train-clean-360	When I picked up the paper to wrap his fiddle strings in I spelled out a piece about the yellow fever being in Philadelphia so dreadful every one was running away 
1093_132891_000093_000002	train-clean-360	I was scared for I was fond of Toby 
1093_132891_000093_000003	train-clean-360	We never said much to each other but we fiddled together and music s as good as talking to them that understand 
1093_132891_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 Did Toby die of yellow fever Una asked 
1093_132891_000095_000000	train-clean-360	 Not him 
1093_132891_000095_000001	train-clean-360	There s justice left in the world still 
none	none	He went down to the City and bled em well again in heaps He sent back word by Red Jacket that if there was war or he died I was to bring the oils along to the City but till then I was to go on working in the garden and Red Jacket was to see me do it 
1093_132891_000095_000004	train-clean-360	Down at heart all Indians reckon digging a squaw s business and neither him nor Cornplanter when he relieved watch was a hard task Master 
none	none	We hired a nigger boy to do our work and a lazy grinning runagate he was 
1093_132891_000095_000006	train-clean-360	When I found Toby didn t die the minute he reached town why boylike I took him off my mind and went with my Indians again 
none	none	Oh those days up north at Canasedago running races and gambling with the Senecas or bee hunting in the woods or fishing in the lake Pharaoh sighed and looked across the water

none	none	You roll out o your blanket and find every leaf left green over night turned red and yellow not by trees at a time but hundreds and hundreds of miles of em like sunsets splattered upside down On one of such days the maples was flaming scarlet and gold and the sumach bushes were redder Cornplanter and Red Jacket came out in full war dress making the very leaves look silly feathered war bonnets yellow doeskin leggings fringed and tasselled red horse blankets and their bridles feathered and shelled and beaded no bounds I thought it was war against the British till I saw their faces weren t painted and they only carried wrist whips Then I hummed Yankee Doodle at em They told me they was going to visit Big Hand and find out for sure whether he meant to join the French in fighting the English or make a peace treaty with England I reckon those two would ha gone out on the war path at a nod from Big Hand but they knew well if there was war twixt England and the United States their tribe ud catch it from both parties same as in all the other wars They asked me to come along and hold the ponies That puzzled me because they always put their ponies up at the Buck or Epply s when they went to see General Washington in the city and horse holding is a nigger s job 
1093_132891_000095_000017	train-clean-360	Besides I wasn t exactly dressed for it

none	none	This didn t happen at Lebanon he said but a bit farther north on the Reservation and at that particular moment of time so far as blanket hair band moccasins and sunburn went there wasn t much odds twix me and a young Seneca buck You may laugh he smoothed down his long skirted brown coat but I told you I took to their ways all over I said nothing though I was bursting to let out the war whoop like the young men had taught me No and you don t let out one here either said Puck before Dan could ask
1093_132891_000098_000001	train-clean-360	 Go on Brother Square toes 
none	none	We went on Pharaoh s narrow dark eyes gleamed and danced We went on forty fifty miles a day for days on end we three braves And how a great tall Indian a horse back can carry his war bonnet at a canter through thick timber without brushing a feather beats me 
1093_132891_000099_000003	train-clean-360	My silly head was banged often enough by low branches but they slipped through like running elk 
1093_132891_000099_000004	train-clean-360	We had evening hymn singing every night after they d blown their pipe smoke to the quarters of heaven 
1093_132891_000099_000005	train-clean-360	Where did we go 
1093_132891_000099_000006	train-clean-360	I ll tell you but don t blame me if you re no wiser 
none	none	We took the old war trail from the end of the Lake along the East Susquehanna through the Nantego country right down to Fort Shamokin on the Senachse river We crossed the Juniata by Fort Granville got into Shippensberg over the hills by the Ochwick trail and then to Williams Ferry it s a bad one 
1093_132891_000099_000009	train-clean-360	From Williams Ferry across the Shanedore over the Blue Mountains through Ashby s Gap and so south east by south from there till we found the President at the back of his own plantations 
1093_132891_000099_000010	train-clean-360	I d hate to be trailed by Indians in earnest 
none	none	They caught him like a partridge on a stump After we d left our ponies we scouted forward through a woody piece and creeping slower and slower at last if my moccasins even slipped Red Jacket ud turn and frown I heard voices Monsieur Genet s for choice long before I saw anything and we pulled up at the edge of a clearing where some niggers in grey and red liveries were holding horses and half a dozen gentlemen but one was Genet were talking among felled timber I fancy they d come to see Genet a piece on his road for his portmantle was with him I hid in between two logs as near to the company as I be to that old windlass there I didn t need anybody to show me Big Hand He stood up very still his legs a little apart listening to Genet that French Ambassador which never had more manners than a Bosham tinker Genet was as good as ordering him to declare war on England at once I had heard that clack before on the Embuscade He said he d stir up the whole United States to have war with England whether Big Hand liked it or not Big Hand heard him out to the last end I looked behind me and my two chiefs had vanished like smoke Says Big Hand That is very forcibly put Monsieur Genet

1093_132891_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 The others all assembled round Big Hand then and in their way they said pretty much what Genet had said 
none	none	They put it to him here was France and England at war in a manner of speaking right across the United States stomach and paying no regards to any one 
1093_132891_000103_000002	train-clean-360	The French was searching American ships on pretence they was helping England but really for to steal the goods 
none	none	The English was doing the same only t other way round and besides searching they was pressing American citizens into their Navy to help them fight France on pretence that those Americans was lawful British subjects 
1093_132891_000103_000004	train-clean-360	His gentlemen put this very clear to Big Hand 
none	none	It didn t look to them they said as though the United States trying to keep out of the fight was any advantage to her because she only catched it from both French and English They said that nine out of ten good Americans was crazy to fight the English then and there 
1093_132891_000103_000007	train-clean-360	They wouldn t say whether that was right or wrong they only wanted Big Hand to turn it over in his mind 
1093_132891_000103_000008	train-clean-360	He did for a while 
none	none	I saw Red Jacket and Cornplanter watching him from the far side of the clearing and how they had slipped round there was another mystery Then Big Hand drew himself up and he let his gentlemen have it Hit em Dan asked
1093_132891_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 No nor yet was it what you might call swearing 
none	none	He he blasted em with his natural speech 
1093_132891_000105_000002	train-clean-360	He asked them half a dozen times over whether the United States had enough armed ships for any shape or sort of war with any one 
none	none	He asked em if they thought she had those ships to give him those ships and they looked on the ground as if they expected to find em there He put it to em whether setting ships aside their country I reckon he gave em good reasons whether the United States was ready or able to face a new big war she having but so few years back wound up one against England and being all holds full of her own troubles As I said the strong way he laid it all before em blasted em and when he d done it was like a still in the woods after a storm A little man but they all looked little pipes up like a young rook in a blowed down nest Nevertheless General it seems you will be compelled to fight England Quick Big Hand wheeled on him And is there anything in my past which makes you think I am averse to fighting Great Britain
1093_132891_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 Everybody laughed except him 
1093_132891_000106_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh General you mistake us entirely they says 
none	none	I trust so he says
1093_132891_000106_000003	train-clean-360	 But I know my duty 
1093_132891_000106_000004	train-clean-360	We must have peace with England

1093_132891_000108_000001	train-clean-360	 Our ships will be searched our citizens will be pressed but 
1093_132891_000109_000000	train-clean-360	 Then what about the Declaration of Independence says one 
1093_132891_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 Deal with facts not fancies says Big Hand 
none	none	The United States are in no position to fight England
1093_132891_000111_000000	train-clean-360	 But think of public opinion another one starts up

1093_132891_000112_000000	train-clean-360	 He held up one of his big hands 
1093_132891_000112_000001	train-clean-360	 Gentlemen he says slow he spoke but his voice carried far I have to think of our country 
1093_132891_000112_000002	train-clean-360	Let me assure you that the treaty with Great Britain will be made though every city in the Union burn me in effigy

1093_132891_000114_000000	train-clean-360	 The treaty must be made on Great Britain s own terms 
none	none	What else can I do He turns his back on em and they looked at each other and slinked off to the horses leaving him alone and then I saw he was an old man Then Red Jacket and Cornplanter rode down the clearing from the far end as though they had just chanced along Back went Big Hand s shoulders up went his head and he stepped forward one single pace with a great deep Hough so pleased he was That was a statelified meeting to behold three big men and two of em looking like jewelled images among the spattle of gay coloured leaves I saw my chiefs war bonnets sinking together down and down Then they made the sign which no Indian makes outside of the Medicine Lodges a sweep of the right hand just clear of the dust and an inbend of the left knee at the same time and those proud eagle feathers almost touched his boot top What did it mean said Dan Mean Pharaoh cried
1093_132891_000116_000001	train-clean-360	 Why it s what you what we it s the Sachems way of sprinkling the sacred corn meal in front of oh it s a piece of Indian compliment really and it signifies that you are a very big chief 
none	none	Big Hand looked down on em 
1093_132891_000117_000001	train-clean-360	First he says quite softly My brothers know it is not easy to be a chief Then his voice grew 
none	none	My children says he what is in your minds Says Cornplanter We came to ask whether there will be war with King George s men but we have heard what our Father has said to his chiefs We will carry away that talk in our hearts to tell to our people No says Big Hand Leave all that talk behind it was between white men only but take this message from me to your people There will be no war
1093_132891_000120_000000	train-clean-360	 His gentlemen were waiting so they didn t delay him only Cornplanter says using his old side name Big Hand did you see us among the timber just now 
1093_132891_000121_000000	train-clean-360	 Surely says he 
1093_132891_000121_000001	train-clean-360	 You taught me to look behind trees when we were both young And with that he cantered off 
none	none	Neither of my chiefs spoke till we were back on our ponies again and a half hour along the home trail Then Cornplanter says to Red Jacket We will have the Corn dance this year There will be no war And that was all there was to it

still A Priest in Spite of Himself The day after they came home from the sea side they set out on a tour of inspection to make sure everything was as they had left it Soon they discovered that old Hobden had blocked their best hedge gaps with stakes and thorn bundles and had trimmed up the hedges where the blackberries were setting It can t be time for the gipsies to come along said Una Why it was summer only the other day There s smoke in Low Shaw said Dan sniffing Let s make sure They crossed the fields towards the thin line of blue smoke that leaned above the hollow of Low Shaw which lies beside the King s Hill road It used to be an old quarry till somebody planted it and you can look straight down into it from the edge of Banky Meadow I thought so Dan whispered as they came up to the fence at the edge of the larches A gipsy van not the show man s sort but the old black kind with little windows high up and a baby gate across the door was getting ready to leave A man was harnessing the horses an old woman crouched over the ashes of a fire made out of broken fence rails and a girl sat on the van steps singing to a baby on her lap A wise looking thin dog snuffed at a patch of fur on the ground till the old woman put it carefully in the middle of the fire The girl reached back inside the van and tossed her a paper parcel This was laid on the fire too and they smelt singed feathers Chicken feathers said Dan I wonder if they are old Hobden s Una sneezed The dog growled and crawled to the girl s feet the old woman fanned the fire with her hat while the man led the horses up to the shafts They all moved as quickly and quietly as snakes over moss Ah said the girl I ll teach you She beat the dog who seemed to expect it Don t do that Una called down It wasn t his fault How do you know what I m beating him for she answered For not seeing us said Dan He was standing right in the smoke and the wind was wrong for his nose anyhow The girl stopped beating the dog and the old woman fanned faster than ever You ve fanned some of your feathers out of the fire said Una There s a tail feather by that chestnut tot What of it said the old woman as she grabbed it Oh nothing said Dan Only I ve heard say that tail feathers are as bad as the whole bird sometimes That was a saying of Hobden s about pheasants Old Hobden always burned all feather and fur before he sat down to eat Come on mother the man whispered The old woman climbed into the van and the horses drew it out of the deep rutted shaw on to the hard road The girl waved her hands and shouted something they could not catch That was gipsy for Thank you kindly Brother and Sister said Pharaoh Lee He was standing behind them his fiddle under his arm Gracious you startled me said Una You startled old Priscilla Savile Puck called from below them Come and sit by their fire She ought to have put it out before they left They dropped down the ferny side of the shaw Una raked the ashes together Dan found a dead wormy oak branch that burns without flame and they watched the smoke while Pharaoh played a curious wavery air That s what the girl was humming to the baby said Una I know it he nodded and went on Ai Lumai Lumai Lumai Luludia Ai Luludia He passed from one odd tune to another and quite forgot the children At last Puck asked him to go on with his adventures in Philadelphia and among the Seneca Indians I m telling it he said staring straight in front of him as he played Can t you hear Maybe but they can t Tell it aloud said Puck Pharaoh shook himself laid his fiddle beside him and began I d left Red Jacket and Cornplanter riding home with me after Big Hand had said that there wouldn t be any war That s all there was to it We believed Big Hand and we went home again we three braves When we reached Lebanon we found Toby at the cottage with his waistcoat a foot too big for him so hard he had worked amongst the yellow fever people He beat me for running off with the Indians but twas worth it I was glad to see him and when we went back to Philadelphia for the winter and I was told how he d sacrificed himself over sick people in the yellow fever I thought the world and all of him No I didn t neither I d thought that all along That yellow fever must have been something dreadful Even in December people had no more than begun to trinkle back to town Whole houses stood empty and the niggers was robbing them out But I can t call to mind that any of the Moravian Brethren had died It seemed like they had just kept on with their own concerns and the good Lord He d just looked after em That was the winter yes winter of Ninety three the Brethren bought a stove for the church Toby spoke in favour of it because the cold spoiled his fiddle hand but many thought stove heat not in the Bible and there was yet a third party which always brought hickory coal foot warmers to service and wouldn t speak either way They ended by casting the Lot for it which is like pitch and toss After my summer with the Senecas church stoves didn t highly interest me so I took to haunting round among the French emigres which Philadelphia was full of My French and my fiddling helped me there d ye see They come over in shiploads from France where by what I made out every one was killing every one else by any means and they spread emselves about the city mostly in Drinker s Alley and Elfrith s Alley and they did odd jobs till times should mend But whatever they stooped to they were gentry and kept a cheerful countenance and after an evening s fiddling at one of their poor little proud parties the Brethren seemed old fashioned Pastor Meder and Brother Adam Goos didn t like my fiddling for hire but Toby said it was lawful in me to earn my living by exercising my talents He never let me be put upon In February of Ninety four No March it must have been because a new Ambassador called Faucher had come from France with no more manners than Genet the old one in March Red Jacket came in from the Reservation bringing news of all kind friends there I showed him round the city and we saw General Washington riding through a crowd of folk that shouted for war with England They gave him quite rough music but he looked twixt his horse s ears and made out not to notice His stirrup brished Red Jacket s elbow and Red Jacket whispered up My brother knows it is not easy to be a chief Big Hand shot just one look at him and nodded Then there was a scuffle behind us over some one who wasn t hooting at Washington loud enough to please the people We went away to be out of the fight Indians won t risk being hit What do they do if they are Dan asked Kill of course That s why they have such proper manners Well then coming home by Drinker s Alley to get a new shirt which a French Vicomte s lady was washing to take the stiff out of I m always choice in my body linen a lame Frenchman pushes a paper of buttons at us He hadn t long landed in the United States and please would we buy He sure ly was a pitiful scrattel his coat half torn off his face cut but his hands steady so I knew it wasn t drink He said his name was Peringuey and he d been knocked about in the crowd round the Stadt Independence Hall One thing leading to another we took him up to Toby s rooms same as Red Jacket had taken me the year before The compliments he paid to Toby s Madeira wine fairly conquered the old man for he opened a second bottle and he told this Monsieur Peringuey all about our great stove dispute in the church I remember Pastor Meder and Brother Adam Goos dropped in and although they and Toby were direct opposite sides regarding stoves yet this Monsieur Peringuey he made em feel as if he thought each one was in the right of it He said he had been a clergyman before he had to leave France He admired at Toby s fiddling and he asked if Red Jacket sitting by the spinet was a simple Huron Senecas aren t Hurons they re Iroquois of course and Toby told him so Well then in due time he arose and left in a style which made us feel he d been favouring us instead of us feeding him I ve never seen that so strong before in a man We all talked him over but couldn t make head or tail of him and Red Jacket come out to walk with me to the French quarter where I was due to fiddle at a party Passing Drinker s Alley again we saw a naked window with a light in it and there sat our button selling Monsieur Peringuey throwing dice all alone right hand against left Says Red Jacket keeping back in the dark Look at his face I was looking I protest to you I wasn t frightened like I was when Big Hand talked to his gentlemen I I only looked and I wondered that even those dead dumb dice ud dare to fall different from what that face wished It it was a face He is bad says Red Jacket But he is a great chief The French have sent away a great chief I thought so when he told us his lies Now I know I had to go on to the party so I asked him to call round for me afterwards and we d have hymn singing at Toby s as usual No he says Tell Toby I am not Christian tonight All Indian He had those fits sometimes I wanted to know more about Monsieur Peringuey and the emigre party was the very place to find out It s neither here nor there of course but those French emigre parties they almost make you cry The men that you bought fruit of in Market Street the hairdressers and fencing masters and French teachers they turn back again by candlelight to what they used to be at home and you catch their real names There wasn t much room in the washhouse so I sat on top of the copper and played em the tunes they called for Si le Roi m avait donne and such nursery stuff They cried sometimes It hurt me to take their money afterwards indeed it did And there I found out about Monsieur Peringuey He was a proper rogue too None of em had a good word for him except the Marquise that kept the French boarding house on Fourth Street I made out that his real name was the Count Talleyrand de Perigord a priest right enough but sorely come down in the world He d been King Louis Ambassador to England a year or two back before the French had cut off King Louis head and by what I heard that head wasn t hardly more than hanging loose before he d run back to Paris and prevailed on Danton the very man which did the murder to send him back to England again as Ambassador of the French Republic That was too much for the English so they kicked him out by Act of Parliament and he d fled to the Americas without money or friends or prospects I m telling you the talk in the washhouse Some of em was laughing over it Says the French Marquise My friends you laugh too soon That man ll be on the winning side before any of us I did not know you were so fond of priests Marquise says the Vicomte His lady did my washing as I ve told you I have my reasons says the Marquise He sent my uncle and my two brothers to Heaven by the little door that was one of the emigre names for the guillotine He will be on the winning side if it costs him the blood of every friend he has in the world Then what does he want here says one of em We have all lost our game My faith says the Marquise He will find out if any one can whether this canaille of a Washington means to help us to fight England Genet that was my Ambassador in the Embuscade has failed and gone off disgraced Faucher he was the new man hasn t done any better but our Abbe will find out and he will make his profit out of the news Such a man does not fall He begins unluckily says the Vicomte He was set upon today in the street for not hooting your Washington They all laughed again and one remarks How does the poor devil keep himself He must have slipped in through the washhouse door for he flits past me and joins em cold as ice One does what one can he says I sell buttons And you Marquise I she waves her poor white hands all burned I am a cook a very bad one at your service Abbe We were just talking about you They didn t treat him like they talked of him They backed off and stood still I have missed something then he says But I spent this last hour playing only for buttons Marquise against a noble savage the veritable Huron himself You had your usual luck I hope she says Certainly he says I cannot afford to lose even buttons in these days Then I suppose the child of nature does not know that your dice are usually loaded Father Tout a tous she continues I don t know whether she meant to accuse him of cheating He only bows Not yet Mademoiselle Cunegonde he says and goes on to make himself agreeable to the rest of the company And that was how I found out our Monsieur Peringuey was Count Charles Maurice Talleyrand de Perigord Pharaoh stopped but the children said nothing You ve heard of him said Pharaoh Una shook her head Was Red Jacket the Indian he played dice with Dan asked He was Red Jacket told me the next time we met I asked if the lame man had cheated Red Jacket said no he had played quite fair and was a master player I allow Red Jacket knew I ve seen him on the Reservation play himself out of everything he had and in again Then I told Red Jacket all I d heard at the party concerning Talleyrand I was right he says I saw the man s war face when he thought he was alone That s why I played him I played him face to face He s a great chief Do they say why he comes here They say he comes to find out if Big Hand makes war against the English I said Red Jacket grunted Yes he says He asked me that too If he had been a small chief I should have lied But he is a great chief He knew I was a chief so I told him the truth I told him what Big Hand said to Cornplanter and me in the clearing There will be no war I could not see what he thought I could not see behind his face But he is a great chief He will believe Will he believe that Big Hand can keep his people back from war I said thinking of the crowds that hooted Big Hand whenever he rode out He is as bad as Big Hand is good but he is not as strong as Big Hand says Red Jacket When he talks with Big Hand he will feel this in his heart The French have sent away a great chief Presently he will go back and make them afraid Now wasn t that comical The French woman that knew him and owed all her losses to him the Indian that picked him up cut and muddy on the street and played dice with him they neither of em doubted that Talleyrand was something by himself appearances notwithstanding And was he something by himself asked Una Pharaoh began to laugh but stopped The way I look at it he said Talleyrand was one of just three men in this world who are quite by themselves Big Hand I put first because I ve seen him Ay said Puck I m sorry we lost him out of Old England Who d you put second Talleyrand maybe because I ve seen him too said Pharaoh Who s third said Puck Boney even though I ve seen him Whew said Puck Every man has his own weights and measures but that s queer reckoning Boney said Una You don t mean you ve ever met Napoleon Bonaparte There I knew you wouldn t have patience with the rest of my tale after hearing that But wait a minute Talleyrand he come round to Hundred and Eighteen in a day or two to thank Toby for his kindness I didn t mention the dice playing but I could see that Red Jacket s doings had made Talleyrand highly curious about Indians though he would call him the Huron Toby as you may believe was all holds full of knowledge concerning their manners and habits He only needed a listener The Brethren don t study Indians much till they join the Church but Toby knew em wild So evening after evening Talleyrand crossed his sound leg over his game one and Toby poured forth Having been adopted into the Senecas I naturally kept still but Toby ud call on me to back up some of his remarks and by that means and a habit he had of drawing you on in talk Talleyrand saw I knew something of his noble savages too Then he tried a trick Coming back from an emigre party he turns into his little shop and puts it to me laughing like that I d gone with the two chiefs on their visit to Big Hand I hadn t told Red Jacket hadn t told and Toby of course didn t know Twas just Talleyrand s guess Now he says my English and Red Jacket s French was so bad that I am not sure I got the rights of what the President really said to the unsophisticated Huron Do me the favour of telling it again I told him every word Red Jacket had told him and not one word more I had my suspicions having just come from an emigre party where the Marquise was hating and praising him as usual Much obliged he said But I couldn t gather from Red Jacket exactly what the President said to Monsieur Genet or to his American gentlemen after Monsieur Genet had ridden away I saw Talleyrand was guessing again for Red Jacket hadn t told him a word about the white men s pow wow Why hadn t he Puck asked Because Red Jacket was a chief He told Talleyrand what the President had said to him and Cornplanter but he didn t repeat the talk between the white men that Big Hand ordered him to leave behind Oh said Puck I see What did you do First I was going to make some sort of tale round it but Talleyrand was a chief too So I said As soon as I get Red Jacket s permission to tell that part of the tale I ll be delighted to refresh your memory Abbe What else could I have done Is that all he says laughing Let me refresh your memory In a month from now I can give you a hundred dollars for your account of the conversation Make it five hundred Abbe I says Five then says he That will suit me admirably I says Red Jacket will be in town again by then and the moment he gives me leave I ll claim the money He had a hard fight to be civil but he come out smiling Monsieur he says I beg your pardon as sincerely as I envy the noble Huron your loyalty Do me the honour to sit down while I explain There wasn t another chair so I sat on the button box He was a clever man He had got hold of the gossip that the President meant to make a peace treaty with England at any cost He had found out from Genet I reckon who was with the President on the day the two chiefs met him He d heard that Genet had had a huff with the President and had ridden off leaving his business at loose ends What he wanted what he begged and blustered to know was just the very words which the President had said to his gentlemen after Genet had left concerning the peace treaty with England He put it to me that in helping him to those very words I d be helping three great countries as well as mankind The room was as bare as the palm of your hand but I couldn t laugh at him I m sorry I says when he wiped his forehead As soon as Red Jacket gives permission You don t believe me then he cuts in Not one little little word Abbe I says except that you mean to be on the winning side Remember I ve been fiddling to all your old friends for months Well then his temper fled him and he called me names Wait a minute ci devant I says at last I am half English and half French but I am not the half of a man I will tell thee something the Indian told me Has thee seen the President Oh yes he sneers I had letters from the Lord Lansdowne to that estimable old man Then I says thee will understand The Red Skin said that when thee has met the President thee will feel in thy heart he is a stronger man than thee Go he whispers Before I kill thee go He looked like it So I left him Why did he want to know so badly said Dan The way I look at it is that if he had known for certain that Washington meant to make the peace treaty with England at any price he d ha left old Faucher fumbling about in Philadelphia while he went straight back to France and told old Danton It s no good your wasting time and hopes on the United States because she won t fight on our side that I ve proof of Then Danton might have been grateful and given Talleyrand a job because a whole mass of things hang on knowing for sure who s your friend and who s your enemy Just think of us poor shop keepers for instance Did Red Jacket let you tell when he came back Una asked Of course not He said When Cornplanter and I ask you what Big Hand said to the whites you can tell the Lame Chief All that talk was left behind in the timber as Big Hand ordered Tell the Lame Chief there will be no war He can go back to France with that word Talleyrand and me hadn t met for a long time except at emigre parties When I give him the message he just shook his head He was sorting buttons in the shop I cannot return to France with nothing better than the word of an unsophisticated savage he says Hasn t the President said anything to you I asked him He has said everything that one in his position ought to say but but if only I had what he said to his Cabinet after Genet rode off I believe I could change Europe the world maybe I m sorry I says Maybe you ll do that without my help He looked at me hard Either you have unusual observation for one so young or you choose to be insolent he says It was intended for a compliment I says But no odds We re off in a few days for our summer trip and I ve come to make my good byes I go on my travels too he says If ever we meet again you may be sure I will do my best to repay what I owe you Without malice Abbe I hope I says None whatever says he Give my respects to your adorable doctor Pangloss that was one of his side names for Toby and the Huron I never could teach him the difference betwixt Hurons and Senecas Then Sister Haga came in for a paper of what we call pilly buttons and that was the last I saw of Talleyrand in those parts But after that you met Napoleon didn t you said Una Wait Just a little dearie After that Toby and I went to Lebanon and the Reservation and being older and knowing better how to manage him I enjoyed myself well that summer with fiddling and fun When we came back the Brethren got after Toby because I wasn t learning any lawful trade and he had hard work to save me from being apprenticed to Helmbold and Geyer the printers Twould have ruined our music together indeed it would And when we escaped that old Mattes Roush the leather breeches maker round the corner took a notion I was cut out for skin dressing But we were rescued Along towards Christmas there comes a big sealed letter from the Bank saying that a Monsieur Talleyrand had put five hundred dollars a hundred pounds to my credit there to use as I pleased There was a little note from him inside he didn t give any address to thank me for past kindnesses and my believing in his future which he said was pretty cloudy at the time of writing I wished Toby to share the money I hadn t done more than bring Talleyrand up to Hundred and Eighteen The kindnesses were Toby s But Toby said No Liberty and Independence for ever I have all my wants my son So I gave him a set of new fiddle strings and the Brethren didn t advise us any more Only Pastor Meder he preached about the deceitfulness of riches and Brother Adam Goos said if there was war the English ud surely shoot down the Bank I knew there wasn t going to be any war but I drew the money out and on Red Jacket s advice I put it into horse flesh which I sold to Bob Bicknell for the Baltimore stage coaches That way I doubled my money inside the twelvemonth You gipsy You proper gipsy Puck shouted Why not Twas fair buying and selling Well one thing leading to another in a few years I had made the beginning of a worldly fortune and was in the tobacco trade Ah said Puck suddenly Might I inquire if you d ever sent any news to your people in England or in France O course I had I wrote regular every three months after I d made money in the horse trade We Lees don t like coming home empty handed If it s only a turnip or an egg it s something Oh yes I wrote good and plenty to Uncle Aurette and Dad don t read very quickly Uncle used to slip over Newhaven way and tell Dad what was going on in the tobacco trade I see Aurettes and Lees Like as two peas Go on Brother Square toes said Puck Pharaoh laughed and went on Talleyrand he d gone up in the world same as me He d sailed to France again and was a great man in the Government there awhile but they had to turn him out on account of some story about bribes from American shippers All our poor emigres said he was surely finished this time but Red Jacket and me we didn t think it likely not unless he was quite dead Big Hand had made his peace treaty with Great Britain just as he said he would and there was a roaring trade twixt England and the United States for such as ud take the risk of being searched by British and French men o war Those two was fighting and just as his gentlemen told Big Hand ud happen the United States was catching it from both If an English man o war met an American ship he d press half the best men out of her and swear they was British subjects Most of em was If a Frenchman met her he d likely have the cargo out of her swearing it was meant to aid and comfort the English and if a Spaniard or a Dutchman met her they was hanging on to England s coat tails too Lord only knows what they wouldn t do It came over me that what I wanted in my tobacco trade was a fast sailing ship and a man who could be French English or American at a pinch Luckily I could lay my hands on both articles So along towards the end of September in the year Ninety nine I sailed from Philadelphia with a hundred and eleven hogshead o good Virginia tobacco in the brig BERTHE AURETTE named after Mother s maiden name hoping twould bring me luck which she didn t and yet she did Where was you bound for Puck asked Er any port I found handiest I didn t tell Toby or the Brethren They don t understand the ins and outs of the tobacco trade Puck coughed a small cough as he shifted a piece of wood with his bare foot It s easy for you to sit and judge Pharaoh cried But think o what we had to put up with We spread our wings and run across the broad Atlantic like a hen through a horse fair Even so we was stopped by an English frigate three days out He sent a boat alongside and pressed seven able seamen I remarked it was hard on honest traders but the officer said they was fighting all creation and hadn t time to argue The next English frigate we escaped with no more than a shot in our quarter Then we was chased two days and a night by a French privateer firing between squalls and the dirty little English ten gun brig which made him sheer off had the impudence to press another five of our men That s how we reached to the chops of the Channel Twelve good men pressed out of thirty five an eighteen pound shot hole close beside our rudder our mainsail looking like spectacles where the Frenchman had hit us and the Channel crawling with short handed British cruisers Put that in your pipe and smoke it next time you grumble at the price of tobacco Well then to top it off while we was trying to get at our leaks a French lugger come swooping at us out o the dusk We warned him to keep away but he fell aboard us and up climbed his Jabbering red caps We couldn t endure any more indeed we couldn t We went at em with all we could lay hands on It didn t last long They was fifty odd to our twenty three Pretty soon I heard the cutlasses thrown down and some one bellowed for the sacri captain Here I am I says I don t suppose it makes any odds to you thieves but this is the United States brig BERTHE AURETTE My aunt the man says laughing Why is she named that Who s speaking I said Twas too dark to see but I thought I knew the voice Enseigne de Vaisseau Estephe L Estrange he sings out and then I was sure Oh I says It s all in the family I suppose but you have done a fine day s work Stephen He whips out the binnacle light and holds it to my face He was young L Estrange my full cousin that I hadn t seen since the night the smack sank off Telscombe Tye six years before Whew he says That s why she was named for Aunt Berthe is it What s your share in her Pharaoh Only half owner but the cargo s mine That s bad he says I ll do what I can but you shouldn t have fought us Steve I says you aren t ever going to report our little fall out as a fight Why a Revenue cutter ud laugh at it So d I if I wasn t in the Republican Navy he says But two of our men are dead d ye see and I m afraid I ll have to take you to the Prize Court at Le Havre Will they condemn my baccy I asks To the last ounce But I was thinking more of the ship She d make a sweet little craft for the Navy if the Prize Court ud let me have her he says Then I knew there was no hope I don t blame him a man must consider his own interests but nigh every dollar I had was in ship or cargo and Steve kept on saying You shouldn t have fought us Well then the lugger took us to Le Havre and that being the one time we did want a British ship to rescue us why o course we never saw one My cousin spoke his best for us at the Prize Court He owned he d no right to rush alongside in the face o the United States flag but we couldn t get over those two men killed d ye see and the Court condemned both ship and cargo They was kind enough not to make us prisoners only beggars and young L Estrange was given the BERTHE AURETTE to re arm into the French Navy I ll take you round to Boulogne he says Mother and the rest ll be glad to see you and you can slip over to Newhaven with Uncle Aurette Or you can ship with me like most o your men and take a turn at King George s loose trade There s plenty pickings he says Crazy as I was I couldn t help laughing I ve had my allowance of pickings and stealings I says Where are they taking my tobacco Twas being loaded on to a barge Up the Seine to be sold in Paris he says Neither you nor I will ever touch a penny of that money Get me leave to go with it I says I ll see if there s justice to be gotten out of our American Ambassador There s not much justice in this world he says without a Navy But he got me leave to go with the barge and he gave me some money That tobacco was all I had and I followed it like a hound follows a snatched bone Going up the river I fiddled a little to keep my spirits up as well as to make friends with the guard They was only doing their duty Outside o that they were the reasonablest o God s creatures They never even laughed at me So we come to Paris by river along in November which the French had christened Brumaire They d given new names to all the months and after such an outrageous silly piece o business as that they wasn t likely to trouble emselves with my rights and wrongs They didn t The barge was laid up below Notre Dame church in charge of a caretaker and he let me sleep aboard after I d run about all day from office to office seeking justice and fair dealing and getting speeches concerning liberty None heeded me Looking back on it I can t rightly blame em I d no money my clothes was filthy mucked I hadn t changed my linen in weeks and I d no proof of my claims except the ship s papers which they said I might have stolen The thieves The door keeper to the American Ambassador for I never saw even the Secretary he swore I spoke French a sight too well for an American citizen Worse than that I had spent my money d ye see and I I took to fiddling in the streets for my keep and and a ship s captain with a fiddle under his arm well I don t blame em that they didn t believe me I come back to the barge one day late in this month Brumaire it was fair beazled out Old Maingon the caretaker he d lit a fire in a bucket and was grilling a herring Courage mon ami he says Dinner is served I can t eat I says I can t do any more It s stronger than I am Bah he says Nothing s stronger than a man Me for example Less than two years ago I was blown up in the Orient in Aboukir Bay but I descended again and hit the water like a fairy Look at me now he says He wasn t much to look at for he d only one leg and one eye but the cheerfullest soul that ever trod shoe leather That s worse than a hundred and eleven hogshead of baccy he goes on You re young too What wouldn t I give to be young in France at this hour There s nothing you couldn t do he says The ball s at your feet kick it he says He kicks the old fire bucket with his peg leg General Buonaparte for example he goes on That man s a babe compared to me and see what he s done already He s conquered Egypt and Austria and Italy oh half Europe he says and now he sails back to Paris and he sails out to saint Cloud down the river here don t stare at the river you young fool and all in front of these pig jobbing lawyers and citizens he makes himself Consul which is as good as a King He ll be King too in the next three turns of the capstan King of France England and the world Think o that he shouts and eat your herring I says something about Boney If he hadn t been fighting England I shouldn t have lost my baccy should I Young fellow says Maingon you don t understand We heard cheering A carriage passed over the bridge with two in it That s the man himself says Maingon He ll give em something to cheer for soon He stands at the salute Who s t other in black beside him I asks fairly shaking all over Ah he s the clever one You ll hear of him before long He s that scoundrel bishop Talleyrand It is I said and up the steps I went with my fiddle and run after the carriage calling Abbe Abbe A soldier knocked the wind out of me with the back of his sword but I had sense to keep on following till the carriage stopped and there just was a crowd round the house door I must have been half crazy else I wouldn t have struck up Si le Roi m avait donne Paris la grande ville I thought it might remind him That is a good omen he says to Boney sitting all hunched up and he looks straight at me Abbe oh Abbe I says Don t you remember Toby and Hundred and Eighteen Second Street He said not a word He just crooked his long white finger to the guard at the door while the carriage steps were let down and I skipped into the house and they slammed the door in the crowd s face You go there says a soldier and shoves me into an empty room where I catched my first breath since I d left the barge Presently I heard plates rattling next door there were only folding doors between and a cork drawn I tell you some one shouts with his mouth full it was all that sulky ass Sieyes fault Only my speech to the Five Hundred saved the situation Did it save your coat says Talleyrand I hear they tore it when they threw you out Don t gasconade to me You may be in the road of victory but you aren t there yet Then I guessed t other man was Boney He stamped about and swore at Talleyrand You forget yourself Consul says Talleyrand or rather you remember yourself Corsican Pig says Boney and worse Emperor says Talleyrand but the way he spoke it sounded worst of all Some one must have backed against the folding doors for they flew open and showed me in the middle of the room Boney whipped out his pistol before I could stand up General says Talleyrand to him this gentleman has a habit of catching us canaille en deshabille Put that thing down Boney laid it on the table so I guessed which was master Talleyrand takes my hand Charmed to see you again Candide he says How is the adorable doctor Pangloss and the noble Huron They were doing very well when I left I said But I m not Do you sell buttons now he says and fills me a glass of wine off the table Madeira says he Not so good as some I have drunk You mountebank Boney roars Turn that out He didn t even say man but Talleyrand being gentle born just went on Pheasant is not so good as pork he says You will find some at that table if you will do me the honour to sit down Pass him a clean plate General And as true as I m here Boney slid a plate along just like a sulky child He was a lanky haired yellow skinned little man as nervous as a cat and as dangerous I could feel that And now said Talleyrand crossing his game leg over his sound one will you tell me your story I was in a fluster but I told him nearly everything from the time he left me the five hundred dollars in Philadelphia up to my losing ship and cargo at Le Havre Boney began by listening but after a bit he dropped into his own thoughts and looked at the crowd sideways through the front room curtains Talleyrand called to him when I d done Eh What we need now says Boney is peace for the next three or four years Quite so says Talleyrand Meantime I want the Consul s order to the Prize Court at Le Havre to restore my friend here his ship Nonsense says Boney Give away an oak built brig of two hundred and seven tons for sentiment Certainly not She must be armed into my Navy with ten no fourteen twelve pounders and two long fours Is she strong enough to bear a long twelve forward Now I could ha sworn he d paid no heed to my talk but that wonderful head piece of his seemingly skimmed off every word of it that was useful to him Ah General says Talleyrand You are a magician a magician without morals But the brig is undoubtedly American and we don t want to offend them more than we have Need anybody talk about the affair he says He didn t look at me but I knew what was in his mind just cold murder because I worried him and he d order it as easy as ordering his carriage You can t stop em I said There s twenty two other men besides me I felt a little more ud set me screaming like a wired hare Undoubtedly American Talleyrand goes on You would gain something if you returned the ship with a message of fraternal good will published in the MONITEUR that s a French paper like the Philadelphia AURORA A good idea Boney answers One could say much in a message It might be useful says Talleyrand Shall I have the message prepared He wrote something in a little pocket ledger Yes for me to embellish this evening The MONITEUR will publish it tonight Certainly Sign please says Talleyrand tearing the leaf out But that s the order to return the brig says Boney Is that necessary Why should I lose a good ship Haven t I lost enough ships already Talleyrand didn t answer any of those questions Then Boney sidled up to the table and jabs his pen into the ink Then he shies at the paper again My signature alone is useless he says You must have the other two Consuls as well Sieyes and Roger Ducos must sign We must preserve the Laws By the time my friend presents it says Talleyrand still looking out of window only one signature will be necessary Boney smiles It s a swindle says he but he signed and pushed the paper across Give that to the President of the Prize Court at Le Havre says Talleyrand and he will give you back your ship I will settle for the cargo myself You have told me how much it cost What profit did you expect to make on it Well then as man to man I was bound to warn him that I d set out to run it into England without troubling the Revenue and so I couldn t rightly set bounds to my profits I guessed that all along said Puck There was never a Lee to Warminghurst That wasn t a smuggler last and first The children laughed It s comical enough now said Pharaoh But I didn t laugh then Says Talleyrand after a minute I am a bad accountant and I have several calculations on hand at present Shall we say twice the cost of the cargo Say I couldn t say a word I sat choking and nodding like a China image while he wrote an order to his secretary to pay me I won t say how much because you wouldn t believe it Oh Bless you Abbe God bless you I got it out at last Yes he says I am a priest in spite of myself but they call me Bishop now Take this for my episcopal blessing and he hands me the paper He stole all that money from me says Boney over my shoulder A Bank of France is another of the things we must make Are you mad he shouts at Talleyrand Quite says Talleyrand getting up But be calm The disease will never attack you It is called gratitude This gentleman found me in the street and fed me when I was hungry I see and he has made a fine scene of it and you have paid him I suppose Meantime France waits Oh poor France says Talleyrand Good bye Candide he says to me By the way he says have you yet got Red Jacket s permission to tell me what the President said to his Cabinet after Monsieur Genet rode away I couldn t speak I could only shake my head and Boney so impatient he was to go on with his doings he ran at me and fair pushed me out of the room And that was all there was to it Pharaoh stood up and slid his fiddle into one of his big skirt pockets as though it were a dead hare Oh but we want to know lots and lots more said Dan How you got home and what old Maingon said on the barge and wasn t your cousin surprised when he had to give back the BERTHE AURETTE and Tell us more about Toby cried Una Yes and Red Jacket said Dan Won t you tell us any more they both pleaded Puck kicked the oak branch on the fire till it sent up a column of smoke that made them sneeze When they had finished the Shaw was empty except for old Hobden stamping through the larches They gipsies have took two he said My black pullet and my liddle gingy speckled cockrel I thought so said Dan picking up one tail feather that the old woman had overlooked Which way did they go Which way did the runagates go said Hobden Hobby said Una Would you like it if we told Keeper Ridley all your goings and comings Poor Honest Men Your jar of Virginny Will cost you a guinea Which you reckon too much by five shilling or ten But light your churchwarden And judge it accordin When I ve told you the troubles of poor honest men From the Capes of the Delaware As you are well aware We sail with tobacco for England but then Our own British cruisers They watch us come through sirs And they press half a score of us poor honest men Or if by quick sailing Thick weather prevailing We leave them behind as we do now and then We are sure of a gun from Each frigate we run from Which is often destruction to poor honest men Broadsides the Atlantic We tumble short handed With shot holes to plug and new canvas to bend And off the Azores Dutch Dons and Monsieurs Are waiting to terrify poor honest men Napoleon s embargo Is laid on all cargo Which comfort or aid to King George may intend And since roll twist and leaf Of all comforts is chief They try for to steal it from poor honest men With no heart for fight We take refuge in flight But fire as we run our retreat to defend Until our stern chasers Cut up her fore braces And she flies off the wind from us poor honest men Twix the Forties and Fifties South eastward the drift is And so when we think we are making Land s End Alas it is Ushant With half the King s Navy Blockading French ports against poor honest men But they may not quit station Which is our salvation So swiftly we stand to the Nor ard again And finding the tail of A homeward bound convoy We slip past the Scillies like poor honest men Twix the Lizard and Dover We hand our stuff over Though I may not inform how we do it nor when But a light on each quarter Low down on the water Is well understanded by poor honest men Even then we have dangers From meddlesome strangers Who spy on our business and are not content To take a smooth answer Except with a handspike And they say they are murdered by poor honest men To be drowned or be shot Is our natural lot Why should we moreover be hanged in the end After all our great pains For to dangle in chains As though we were smugglers not poor honest men THE CONVERSION OF saint WILFRID Eddi s Service Eddi priest of saint Wilfrid In the chapel at Manhood End Ordered a midnight service For such as cared to attend But the Saxons were keeping Christmas And the night was stormy as well Nobody came to service Though Eddi rang the bell Wicked weather for walking Said Eddi of Manhood End But I must go on with the service For such as care to attend The altar candles were lighted An old marsh donkey came Bold as a guest invited And stared at the guttering flame The storm beat on at the windows The water splashed on the floor And a wet yoke weary bullock Pushed in through the open door How do I know what is greatest How do I know what is least That is My Father s business Said Eddi Wilfrid s priest But three are gathered together Listen to me and attend I bring good news my brethren Said Eddi of Manhood End And he told the Ox of a manger And a stall in Bethlehem And he spoke to the Ass of a Rider That rode to jerusalem They steamed and dripped in the chancel They listened and never stirred While just as though they were Bishops Eddi preached them The Word Till the gale blew off on the marshes And the windows showed the day And the Ox and the Ass together Wheeled and clattered away And when the Saxons mocked him Said Eddi of Manhood End I dare not shut His chapel On such as care to attend The Conversion of saint Wilfrid They had bought peppermints up at the village and were coming home past little saint Barnabas Church when they saw Jimmy Kidbrooke the carpenter s baby kicking at the churchyard gate with a shaving in his mouth and the tears running down his cheeks Una pulled out the shaving and put in a peppermint Jimmy said he was looking for his grand daddy he never seemed to take much notice of his father so they went up between the old graves under the leaf dropping limes to the porch where Jim trotted in looked about the empty Church and screamed like a gate hinge Young Sam Kidbrooke s voice came from the bell tower and made them jump Why jimmy he called what are you doin here Fetch him Father Old mister Kidbrooke stumped downstairs jerked Jimmy on to his shoulder stared at the children beneath his brass spectacles and stumped back again They laughed it was so exactly like mister Kidbrooke It s all right Una called up the stairs We found him Sam Does his mother know He s come off by himself She ll be justabout crazy Sam answered Then I ll run down street and tell her Una darted off Thank you Miss Una Would you like to see how we re mendin the bell beams Mus Dan Dan hopped up and saw young Sam lying on his stomach in a most delightful place among beams and ropes close to the five great bells Old mister Kidbrooke on the floor beneath was planing a piece of wood and Jimmy was eating the shavings as fast as they came away He never looked at Jimmy Jimmy never stopped eating and the broad gilt bobbed pendulum of the church clock never stopped swinging across the white washed wall of the tower Dan winked through the sawdust that fell on his upturned face Ring a bell he called I mustn t do that but I ll buzz one of em a bit for you said Sam He pounded on the sound bow of the biggest bell and waked a hollow groaning boom that ran up and down the tower like creepy feelings down your back Just when it almost began to hurt it died away in a hurry of beautiful sorrowful cries like a wine glass rubbed with a wet finger The pendulum clanked one loud clank to each silent swing Dan heard Una return from missus Kidbrooke s and ran down to fetch her She was standing by the font staring at some one who kneeled at the Altar rail Is that the Lady who practises the organ she whispered No She s gone into the organ place Besides she wears black Dan replied The figure rose and came down the nave It was a white haired man in a long white gown with a sort of scarf looped low on the neck one end hanging over his shoulder His loose long sleeves were embroidered with gold and a deep strip of gold embroidery waved and sparkled round the hem of his gown Go and meet him said Puck s voice behind the font It s only Wilfrid Wilfrid who said Dan You come along too Wilfrid Saint of Sussex and Archbishop of York I shall wait till he asks me He waved them forward Their feet squeaked on the old grave slabs in the centre aisle The Archbishop raised one hand with a pink ring on it and said something in Latin He was very handsome and his thin face looked almost as silvery as his thin circle of hair Are you alone he asked Puck s here of course said Una Do you know him I know him better now than I used to He beckoned over Dan s shoulder and spoke again in Latin Puck pattered forward holding himself as straight as an arrow The Archbishop smiled Be welcome said he Be very welcome Welcome to you also O Prince of the church Puck replied The Archbishop bowed his head and passed on till he glimmered like a white moth in the shadow by the font He does look awfully princely said Una Isn t he coming back Oh yes He s only looking over the church He s very fond of churches said Puck What s that The Lady who practices the organ was speaking to the blower boy behind the organ screen We can t very well talk here Puck whispered Let s go to Panama Corner He led them to the end of the south aisle where there is a slab of iron which says in queer long tailed letters ORATE P ANNEMA JHONE COLINE The children always called it Panama Corner The Archbishop moved slowly about the little church peering at the old memorial tablets and the new glass windows The Lady who practises the organ began to pull out stops and rustle hymn books behind the screen I hope she ll do all the soft lacey tunes like treacle on porridge said Una I like the trumpety ones best said Dan Oh look at Wilfrid He s trying to shut the Altar gates Tell him he mustn t said Puck quite seriously He can t anyhow Dan muttered and tiptoed out of Panama Corner while the Archbishop patted and patted at the carved gates that always sprang open again beneath his hand That s no use sir Dan whispered Old mister Kidbrooke says Altar gates are just the one pair of gates which no man can shut He made em so himself The Archbishop s blue eyes twinkled Dan saw that he knew all about it I beg your pardon Dan stammered very angry with Puck Yes I know He made them so Himself The Archbishop smiled and crossed to Panama Corner where Una dragged up a certain padded arm chair for him to sit on The organ played softly What does that music say he asked Una dropped into the chant without thinking O all ye works of the Lord bless ye the Lord praise him and magnify him for ever We call it the Noah s Ark because it s all lists of things beasts and birds and whales you know Whales said the Archbishop quickly Yes O ye whales and all that move in the waters Una hummed Bless ye the Lord It sounds like a wave turning over doesn t it Holy Father said Puck with a demure face is a little seal also one who moves in the water Eh Oh yes yess he laughed A seal moves wonderfully in the waters Do the seal come to my island still Puck shook his head All those little islands have been swept away Very possible The tides ran fiercely down there Do you know the land of the Sea calf maiden No but we ve seen seals at Brighton The Archbishop is thinking of a little farther down the coast He means Seal s Eye Selsey down Chichester way where he converted the South Saxons Puck explained Yes yess if the South Saxons did not convert me said the Archbishop smiling The first time I was wrecked was on that coast As our ship took ground and we tried to push her off an old fat fellow of a seal I remember reared breast high out of the water and scratched his head with his flipper as if he were saying What does that excited person with the pole think he is doing I was very wet and miserable but I could not help laughing till the natives came down and attacked us What did you do Dan asked One couldn t very well go back to France so one tried to make them go back to the shore All the South Saxons are born wreckers like my own Northumbrian folk I was bringing over a few things for my old church at York and some of the natives laid hands on them and and I m afraid I lost my temper It is said Puck s voice was wickedly meek that there was a great fight Eh but I must ha been a silly lad Wilfrid spoke with a sudden thick burr in his voice He coughed and took up his silvery tones again There was no fight really My men thumped a few of them but the tide rose half an hour before its time with a strong wind and we backed off What I wanted to say though was that the seas about us were full of sleek seals watching the scuffle My good Eddi my chaplain insisted that they were demons Yes yess That was my first acquaintance with the South Saxons and their seals But not the only time you were wrecked was it said Dan Alas no On sea and land my life seems to have been one long shipwreck He looked at the Jhone Coline slab as old Hobden sometimes looks into the fire Ah well But did you ever have any more adventures among the seals said Una after a little Oh the seals I beg your pardon They are the important things Yes yess I went back to the South Saxons after twelve fifteen years No I did not come by water but overland from my own Northumbria to see what I could do It s little one can do with that class of native except make them stop killing each other and themselves Why did they kill themselves Una asked her chin in her hand Because they were heathen When they grew tired of life as if they were the only people they would jump into the sea They called it going to Wotan It wasn t want of food always by any means A man would tell you that he felt grey in the heart or a woman would say that she saw nothing but long days in front of her and they d saunter away to the mud flats and that would be the end of them poor souls unless one headed them off One had to run quick but one can t allow people to lay hands on themselves because they happen to feel grey Yes yess Extraordinary people the South Saxons Disheartening sometimes What does that say now The organ had changed tune again Only a hymn for next Sunday said Una The Church s One Foundation Go on please about running over the mud I should like to have seen you I dare say you would and I really could run in those days Ethelwalch the King gave me some five or six muddy parishes by the sea and the first time my good Eddi and I rode there we saw a man slouching along the slob among the seals at Manhood End My good Eddi disliked seals but he swallowed his objections and ran like a hare Why said Dan For the same reason that I did We thought it was one of our people going to drown himself As a matter of fact Eddi and I were nearly drowned in the pools before we overtook him To cut a long story short we found ourselves very muddy very breathless being quietly made fun of in good Latin by a very well spoken person No he d no idea of going to Wotan He was fishing on his own beaches and he showed us the beacons and turf heaps that divided his land from the church property He took us to his own house gave us a good dinner some more than good wine sent a guide with us into Chichester and became one of my best and most refreshing friends He was a Meon by descent from the west edge of the kingdom a scholar educated curiously enough at Lyons my old school had travelled the world over even to Rome and was a brilliant talker We found we had scores of acquaintances in common It seemed he was a small chief under King Ethelwalch and I fancy the King was somewhat afraid of him The South Saxons mistrust a man who talks too well Ah Now I ve left out the very point of my story He kept a great grey muzzled old dog seal that he had brought up from a pup He called it Padda after one of my clergy It was rather like fat honest old Padda The creature followed him everywhere and nearly knocked down my good Eddi when we first met him Eddi loathed it It used to sniff at his thin legs and cough at him I can t say I ever took much notice of it I was not fond of animals till one day Eddi came to me with a circumstantial account of some witchcraft that Meon worked He would tell the seal to go down to the beach the last thing at night and bring him word of the weather When it came back Meon might say to his slaves Padda thinks we shall have wind tomorrow Haul up the boats I spoke to Meon casually about the story and he laughed He told me he could judge by the look of the creature s coat and the way it sniffed what weather was brewing Quite possible One need not put down everything one does not understand to the work of bad spirits or good ones for that matter He nodded towards Puck who nodded gaily in return I say so he went on because to a certain extent I have been made a victim of that habit of mind Some while after I was settled at Selsey King Ethelwalch and Queen Ebba ordered their people to be baptized I fear I m too old to believe that a whole nation can change its heart at the King s command and I had a shrewd suspicion that their real motive was to get a good harvest No rain had fallen for two or three years but as soon as we had finished baptizing it fell heavily and they all said it was a miracle And was it Dan asked Everything in life is a miracle but the Archbishop twisted the heavy ring on his finger I should be slow ve ry slow should I be to assume that a certain sort of miracle happens whenever lazy and improvident people say they are going to turn over a new leaf if they are paid for it My friend Meon had sent his slaves to the font but he had not come himself so the next time I rode over to return a manuscript I took the liberty of asking why He was perfectly open about it He looked on the King s action as a heathen attempt to curry favour with the Christians God through me the Archbishop and he would have none of it My dear man I said admitting that that is the case surely you as an educated person don t believe in Wotan and all the other hobgoblins any more than Padda here The old seal was hunched up on his ox hide behind his master s chair Even if I don t he said why should I insult the memory of my fathers Gods I have sent you a hundred and three of my rascals to christen Isn t that enough By no means I answered I want you He wants us What do you think of that Padda He pulled the seal s whiskers till it threw back its head and roared and he pretended to interpret No Padda says he won t be baptized yet awhile He says you ll stay to dinner and come fishing with me tomorrow because you re over worked and need a rest I wish you d keep yon brute in its proper place I said and Eddi my chaplain agreed I do said Meon I keep him just next my heart He can t tell a lie and he doesn t know how to love any one except me It ud be the same if I were dying on a mud bank wouldn t it Padda Augh Augh said Padda and put up his head to be scratched Then Meon began to tease Eddi Padda says if Eddi saw his Archbishop dying on a mud bank Eddi would tuck up his gown and run Padda knows Eddi can run too Padda came into Wittering Church last Sunday all wet to hear the music and Eddi ran out My good Eddi rubbed his hands and his shins together and flushed Padda is a child of the Devil who is the father of lies he cried and begged my pardon for having spoken I forgave him Yes You are just about stupid enough for a musician said Meon But here he is Sing a hymn to him and see if he can stand it You ll find my small harp beside the fireplace Eddi who is really an excellent musician played and sang for quite half an hour Padda shuffled off his ox hide hunched himself on his flippers before him and listened with his head thrown back Yes yess A rather funny sight Meon tried not to laugh and asked Eddi if he were satisfied It takes some time to get an idea out of my good Eddi s head He looked at me Do you want to sprinkle him with holy water and see if he flies up the chimney Why not baptize him said Meon Eddi was really shocked I thought it was bad taste myself That s not fair said Meon You call him a demon and a familiar spirit because he loves his master and likes music and when I offer you a chance to prove it you won t take it Look here I ll make a bargain I ll be baptized if you ll baptize Padda too He s more of a man than most of my slaves One doesn t bargain or joke about these matters I said He was going altogether too far Quite right said Meon I shouldn t like any one to joke about Padda Padda go down to the beach and bring us tomorrow s weather My good Eddi must have been a little over tired with his day s work I am a servant of the church he cried My business is to save souls not to enter into fellowships and understandings with accursed beasts Have it your own narrow way said Meon Padda you needn t go The old fellow flounced back to his ox hide at once Man could learn obedience at least from that creature said Eddi a little ashamed of himself Christians should not curse Don t begin to apologise Just when I am beginning to like you said Meon We ll leave Padda behind tomorrow out of respect to your feelings Now let s go to supper We must be up early tomorrow for the whiting The next was a beautiful crisp autumn morning a weather breeder if I had taken the trouble to think but it s refreshing to escape from kings and converts for half a day We three went by ourselves in Meon s smallest boat and we got on the whiting near an old wreck a mile or so off shore Meon knew the marks to a yard and the fish were keen Yes yess A perfect morning s fishing If a Bishop can t be a fisherman who can He twiddled his ring again We stayed there a little too long and while we were getting up our stone down came the fog After some discussion we decided to row for the land The ebb was just beginning to make round the point and sent us all ways at once like a coracle Selsey Bill said Puck under his breath The tides run something furious there I believe you said the Archbishop Meon and I have spent a good many evenings arguing as to where exactly we drifted All I know is we found ourselves in a little rocky cove that had sprung up round us out of the fog and a swell lifted the boat on to a ledge and she broke up beneath our feet We had just time to shuffle through the weed before the next wave The sea was rising It s rather a pity we didn t let Padda go down to the beach last night said Meon He might have warned us this was coming Better fall into the hands of God than the hands of demons said Eddi and his teeth chattered as he prayed A nor west breeze had just got up distinctly cool Save what you can of the boat said Meon we may need it and we had to drench ourselves again fishing out stray planks What for said Dan For firewood We did not know when we should get off Eddi had flint and steel and we found dry fuel in the old gulls nests and lit a fire It smoked abominably and we guarded it with boat planks up ended between the rocks One gets used to that sort of thing if one travels Unluckily I m not so strong as I was I fear I must have been a trouble to my friends It was blowing a full gale before midnight Eddi wrung out his cloak and tried to wrap me in it but I ordered him on his obedience to keep it However he held me in his arms all the first night and Meon begged his pardon for what he d said the night before about Eddi running away if he found me on a sandbank you remember You are right in half your prophecy said Eddi I have tucked up my gown at any rate The wind had blown it over his head Now let us thank God for His mercies Hum said Meon If this gale lasts we stand a very fair chance of dying of starvation If it be God s will that we survive God will provide said Eddi At least help me to sing to Him The wind almost whipped the words out of his mouth but he braced himself against a rock and sang psalms I m glad I never concealed my opinion from myself that Eddi was a better man than I Yet I have worked hard in my time very hard Yes yess So the morning and the evening were our second day on that islet There was rain water in the rock pools and as a churchman I knew how to fast but I admit we were hungry Meon fed our fire chip by chip to eke it out and they made me sit over it the dear fellows when I was too weak to object Meon held me in his arms the second night just like a child My good Eddi was a little out of his senses and imagined himself teaching a York choir to sing Even so he was beautifully patient with them I heard Meon whisper If this keeps up we shall go to our Gods I wonder what Wotan will say to me He must know I don t believe in him On the other hand I can t do what Ethelwalch finds so easy curry favour with your God at the last minute in the hope of being saved as you call it How do you advise Bishop My dear man I said if that is your honest belief I take it upon myself to say you had far better not curry favour with any God But if it s only your Jutish pride that holds you back lift me up and I ll baptize you even now Lie still said Meon I could judge better if I were in my own hall But to desert one s fathers Gods even if one doesn t believe in them in the middle of a gale isn t quite What would you do yourself I was lying in his arms kept alive by the warmth of his big steady heart It did not seem to me the time or the place for subtle arguments so I answered No I certainly should not desert my God I don t see even now what else I could have said Thank you I ll remember that if I live said Meon and I must have drifted back to my dreams about Northumbria and beautiful France for it was broad daylight when I heard him calling on Wotan in that high shaking heathen yell that I detest so Lie quiet I m giving Wotan his chance he said Our dear Eddi ambled up still beating time to his imaginary choir Yes Call on your Gods he cried and see what gifts they will send you They are gone on a journey or they are hunting I assure you the words were not out of his mouth when old Padda shot from the top of a cold wrinkled swell drove himself over the weedy ledge and landed fair in our laps with a rock cod between his teeth I could not help smiling at Eddi s face A miracle A miracle he cried and kneeled down to clean the cod You ve been a long time finding us my son said Meon Now fish fish for all our lives We re starving Padda The old fellow flung himself quivering like a salmon backward into the boil of the currents round the rocks and Meon said We re safe I ll send him to fetch help when this wind drops Eat and be thankful I never tasted anything so good as those rock codlings we took from Padda s mouth and half roasted over the fire Between his plunges Padda would hunch up and purr over Meon with the tears running down his face I never knew before that seals could weep for joy as I have wept Surely said Eddi with his mouth full God has made the seal the loveliest of His creatures in the water Look how Padda breasts the current He stands up against it like a rock now watch the chain of bubbles where he dives and now there is his wise head under that rock ledge Oh a blessing be on thee my little brother Padda You said he was a child of the Devil Meon laughed There I sinned poor Eddi answered Call him here and I will ask his pardon God sent him out of the storm to humble me a fool I won t ask you to enter into fellowships and understandings with any accursed brute said Meon rather unkindly Shall we say he was sent to our Bishop as the ravens were sent to your prophet Elijah Doubtless that is so said Eddi I will write it so if I live to get home No no I said Let us three poor men kneel and thank God for His mercies We kneeled and old Padda shuffled up and thrust his head under Meon s elbows I laid my hand upon it and blessed him So did Eddi And now my son I said to Meon shall I baptize thee Not yet said he Wait till we are well ashore and at home No God in any Heaven shall say that I came to him or left him because I was wet and cold I will send Padda to my people for a boat Is that witchcraft Eddi Why no Surely Padda will go and pull them to the beach by the skirts of their gowns as he pulled me in Wittering Church to ask me to sing Only then I was afraid and did not understand said Eddi You are understanding now said Meon and at a wave of his arm off went Padda to the mainland making a wake like a war boat till we lost him in the rain Meon s people could not bring a boat across for some hours even so it was ticklish work among the rocks in that tideway But they hoisted me aboard too stiff to move and Padda swam behind us barking and turning somersaults all the way to Manhood End Good old Padda murmured Dan When we were quite rested and re clothed and his people had been summoned not an hour before Meon offered himself to be baptized Was Padda baptized too Una asked No that was only Meon s joke But he sat blinking on his ox hide in the middle of the hall When Eddi who thought I wasn t looking made a little cross in holy water on his wet muzzle he kissed Eddi s hand A week before Eddi wouldn t have touched him That was a miracle if you like But seriously I was more glad than I can tell you to get Meon A rare and splendid soul that never looked back never looked back The Arch bishop half closed his eyes But sir said Puck most respectfully haven t you left out what Meon said afterwards Before the Bishop could speak he turned to the children and went on Meon called all his fishers and ploughmen and herdsmen into the hall and he said Listen men Two days ago I asked our Bishop whether it was fair for a man to desert his fathers Gods in a time of danger Our Bishop said it was not fair You needn t shout like that because you are all Christians now My red war boat s crew will remember how near we all were to death when Padda fetched them over to the Bishop s islet You can tell your mates that even in that place at that time hanging on the wet weedy edge of death our Bishop a Christian counselled me a heathen to stand by my fathers Gods I tell you now that a faith which takes care that every man shall keep faith even though he may save his soul by breaking faith is the faith for a man to believe in So I believe in the Christian God and in Wilfrid His Bishop and in the Church that Wilfrid rules You have been baptized once by the King s orders I shall not have you baptized again but if I find any more old women being sent to Wotan or any girls dancing on the sly before Balder or any men talking about Thun or Lok or the rest I will teach you with my own hands how to keep faith with the Christian God Go out quietly you ll find a couple of beefs on the beach Then of course they shouted Hurrah which meant Thor help us and I think you laughed sir I think you remember it all too well said the Archbishop smiling It was a joyful day for me I had learned a great deal on that rock where Padda found us Yes yess One should deal kindly with all the creatures of God and gently with their masters But one learns late He rose and his gold embroidered sleeves rustled thickly The organ cracked and took deep breaths Wait a minute Dan whispered She s going to do the trumpety one It takes all the wind you can pump It s in Latin sir There is no other tongue the Archbishop answered It s not a real hymn Una explained She does it as a treat after her exercises She isn t a real organist you know She just comes down here sometimes from the Albert Hall Oh what a miracle of a voice said the Archbishop It rang out suddenly from a dark arch of lonely noises every word spoken to the very end Dies Irae dies illa Solvet saeclum in favilla Teste David cum Sibylla The Archbishop caught his breath and moved forward The music carried on by itself a while Now it s calling all the light out of the windows Una whispered to Dan I think it s more like a horse neighing in battle he whispered back The voice continued Tuba mirum spargens sonum Per sepulchre regionum Deeper and deeper the organ dived down but far below its deepest note they heard Puck s voice joining in the last line Coget omnes ante thronum As they looked in wonder for it sounded like the dull jar of one of the very pillars shifting the little fellow turned and went out through the south door Now s the sorrowful part but it s very beautiful Una found herself speaking to the empty chair in front of her What are you doing that for Dan said behind her You spoke so politely too I don t know I thought said Una Funny Tisn t It s the part you like best Dan grunted The music had turned soft full of little sounds that chased each other on wings across the broad gentle flood of the main tune But the voice was ten times lovelier than the music Recordare Jesu pie Quod sum causa Tuae viae Ne me perdas illi die There was no more They moved out into the centre aisle That you the Lady called as she shut the lid I thought I heard you and I played it on purpose Thank you awfully said Dan We hoped you would so we waited Come on Una it s pretty nearly dinner time Song of the Red War Boat Shove off from the wharf edge Steady Watch for a smooth Give way If she feels the lop already She ll stand on her head in the bay It s ebb it s dusk it s blowing The shoals are a mile of white But snatch her along we re going To find our master tonight For we hold that in all disaster Of shipwreck storm or sword A man must stand by his master When once he had pledged his word Raging seas have we rowed in But we seldom saw them thus Our master is angry with Odin Odin is angry with us Heavy odds have we taken But never before such odds The Gods know they are forsaken We must risk the wrath of the Gods Over the crest she flies from Into its hollow she drops Crouches and clears her eyes from The wind torn breaker tops Ere out on the shrieking shoulder Of a hill high surge she drives Meet her Meet her and hold her Pull for your scoundrel lives The thunder bellow and clamour The harm that they mean to do There goes Thor s Own Hammer Cracking the dark in two Close But the blow has missed her Here comes the wind of the blow Row or the squall ll twist her Broadside on to it Row Hearken Thor of the Thunder We are not here for a jest For wager warfare or plunder Or to put your power to test This work is none of our wishing We would stay at home if we might But our master is wrecked out fishing We go to find him tonight For we hold that in all disaster As the Gods Themselves have said A man must stand by his master Till one of the two is dead That is our way of thinking Now you can do as you will While we try to save her from sinking And hold her head to it still Bale her and keep her moving Or she ll break her back in the trough Who said the weather s improving And the swells are taking off Sodden and chafed and aching Gone in the loins and knees No matter the day is breaking And there s far less weight to the seas Up mast and finish baling In oars and out with the mead The rest will be two reef sailing That was a night indeed But we hold that in all disaster And faith we have found it true If only you stand by your master The Gods will stand by you A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE An Astrologer s Song To the Heavens above us Oh look and behold The planets that love us All harnessed in gold What chariots what horses Against us shall bide While the Stars in their courses Do fight on our side All thought all desires That are under the sun Are one with their fires As we also are one All matter all spirit All fashion all frame Receive and inherit Their strength from the same Oh man that deniest All power save thine own Their power in the highest Is mightily shown Not less in the lowest That power is made clear Oh man if thou knowest What treasure is here Earth quakes in her throes And we wonder for why But the blind planet knows When her ruler is nigh And attuned since Creation To perfect accord She thrills in her station And yearns to her Lord The waters have risen The springs are unbound The floods break their prison And ravin around No rampart withstands em Their fury will last Till the Sign that commands em Sinks low or swings past Through abysses unproven And gulfs beyond thought Our portion is woven Our burden is brought Yet They that prepare it Whose Nature we share Make us who must bear it Well able to bear Though terrors o ertake us We ll not be afraid No Power can unmake us Save that which has made Nor yet beyond reason Nor hope shall we fall All things have their season And Mercy crowns all Then doubt not ye fearful The Eternal is King Up heart and be cheerful And lustily sing What chariots what horses Against us shall bide While the Stars in their courses Do fight on our side A Doctor of Medicine They were playing hide and seek with bicycle lamps after tea Dan had hung his lamp on the apple tree at the end of the hellebore bed in the walled garden and was crouched by the gooseberry bushes ready to dash off when Una should spy him He saw her lamp come into the garden and disappear as she hid it under her cloak While he listened for her footsteps somebody they both thought it was Phillips the gardener coughed in the corner of the herb beds All right Una shouted across the asparagus we aren t hurting your old beds Phippsey She flashed her lantern towards the spot and in its circle of light they saw a Guy Fawkes looking man in a black cloak and a steeple crowned hat walking down the path beside Puck They ran to meet him and the man said something to them about rooms in their head After a time they understood he was warning them not to catch colds You ve a bit of a cold yourself haven t you said Una for he ended all his sentences with a consequential cough Puck laughed Child the man answered if it hath pleased Heaven to afflict me with an infirmity Nay nay Puck struck In the maid spoke out of kindness I know that half your cough is but a catch to trick the vulgar and that s a pity There s honesty enough in you Nick without rasping and hawking Good people the man shrugged his lean shoulders the vulgar crowd love not truth unadorned Wherefore we philosophers must needs dress her to catch their eye or ahem their ear And what d you think of that said Puck solemnly to Dan I don t know he answered It sounds like lessons Ah well There have been worse men than Nick Culpeper to take lessons from Now where can we sit that s not indoors In the hay mow next to old Middenboro Dan suggested He doesn t mind Eh mister Culpeper was stooping over the pale hellebore blooms by the light of Una s lamp Does Master Middenboro need my poor services then Save him no said Puck He is but a horse next door to an ass as you ll see presently Come Their shadows jumped and slid on the fruit tree walls They filed out of the garden by the snoring pig pound and the crooning hen house to the shed where Middenboro the old lawn mower pony lives His friendly eyes showed green in the light as they set their lamps down on the chickens drinking trough outside and pushed past to the hay mow mister Culpeper stooped at the door Mind where you lie said Dan This hay s full of hedge brishings In in said Puck You ve lain in fouler places than this Nick Ah Let us keep touch with the stars He kicked open the top of the half door and pointed to the clear sky There be the planets you conjure with What does your wisdom make of that wandering and variable star behind those apple boughs The children smiled A bicycle that they knew well was being walked down the steep lane Where mister Culpeper leaned forward quickly That Some countryman s lantern Wrong Nick said Puck Tis a singular bright star in Virgo declining towards the house of Aquarius the water carrier who hath lately been afflicted by Gemini Aren t I right Una mister Culpeper snorted contemptuously No It s the village nurse going down to the Mill about some fresh twins that came there last week Nurse Una called as the light stopped on the flat when can I see the Morris twins And how are they Next Sunday perhaps Doing beautifully the Nurse called back and with a ping ping ping of the bell brushed round the corner Her uncle s a vetinary surgeon near Banbury Una explained and if you ring her bell at night it rings right beside her bed not downstairs at all Then she umps up she always keeps a pair of dry boots in the fender you know and goes anywhere she s wanted We help her bicycle through gaps sometimes Most of her babies do beautifully She told us so herself I doubt not then that she reads in my books said mister Culpeper quietly Twins at the Mill he muttered half aloud And again He sayeth Return ye children of men Are you a doctor or a rector Una asked and Puck with a shout turned head over heels in the hay But mister Culpeper was quite serious He told them that he was a physician astrologer a doctor who knew all about the stars as well as all about herbs for medicine He said that the sun the moon and five Planets called Jupiter Mars Mercury Saturn and Venus governed everybody and everything in the world They all lived in Houses he mapped out some of them against the dark with a busy forefinger and they moved from House to House like pieces at draughts and they went loving and hating each other all over the skies If you knew their likes and dislikes he said you could make them cure your patient and hurt your enemy and find out the secret causes of things He talked of these five Planets as though they belonged to him or as though he were playing long games against them The children burrowed in the hay up to their chins and looked out over the half door at the solemn star powdered sky till they seemed to be falling upside down into it while mister Culpeper talked about trines and oppositions and conjunctions and sympathies and antipathies in a tone that just matched things A rat ran between Middenboro s feet and the old pony stamped Mid hates rats said Dan and passed him over a lock of hay I wonder why Divine Astrology tells us said mister Culpeper The horse being a martial beast that beareth man to battle belongs naturally to the red planet Mars the Lord of War I would show you him but he s too near his setting Rats and mice doing their businesses by night come under the dominion of our Lady the Moon Now between Mars and Luna the one red t other white the one hot t other cold and so forth stands as I have told you a natural antipathy or as you say hatred Which antipathy their creatures do inherit Whence good people you may both see and hear your cattle stamp in their stalls for the self same causes as decree the passages of the stars across the unalterable face of Heaven Ahem Puck lay along chewing a leaf They felt him shake with laughter and mister Culpeper sat up stiffly I myself said he have saved men s lives and not a few neither by observing at the proper time there is a time mark you for all things under the sun by observing I say so small a beast as a rat in conjunction with so great a matter as this dread arch above us He swept his hand across the sky Yet there are those he went on sourly who have years without knowledge Right said Puck No fool like an old fool mister Culpeper wrapped his cloak round him and sat still while the children stared at the Great Bear on the hilltop Give him time Puck whispered behind his hand He turns like a timber tug all of a piece Ahem mister Culpeper said suddenly I ll prove it to you When I was physician to Saye s Horse and fought the King or rather the man Charles Stuart in Oxfordshire I had my learning at Cambridge the plague was very hot all around us I saw it at close hands He who says I am ignorant of the plague for example is altogether beside the bridge We grant it said Puck solemnly But why talk of the plague this rare night To prove my argument This Oxfordshire plague good people being generated among rivers and ditches was of a werish watery nature Therefore it was curable by drenching the patient in cold water and laying him in wet cloths or at least so I cured some of them Mark this It bears on what shall come after Mark also Nick said Puck that we are not your College of Physicians but only a lad and a lass and a poor lubberkin Therefore be plain old Hyssop on the Wall To be plain and in order with you I was shot in the chest while gathering of betony from a brookside near Thame and was took by the King s men before their Colonel one Blagg or Bragge whom I warned honestly that I had spent the week past among our plague stricken He flung me off into a cowshed much like this here to die as I supposed but one of their priests crept in by night and dressed my wound He was a Sussex man like myself Who was that said Puck suddenly Zack Tutshom No Jack Marget said mister Culpeper Jack Marget of New College The little merry man that stammered so Why a plague was stuttering Jack at Oxford then said Puck He had come out of Sussex in hope of being made a Bishop when the King should have conquered the rebels as he styled us Parliament men His College had lent the King some monies too which they never got again no more than simple Jack got his bishopric When we met he had had a bitter bellyful of King s promises and wished to return to his wife and babes This came about beyond expectation for so soon as I could stand of my wound the man Blagge made excuse that I had been among the plague and Jack had been tending me to thrust us both out from their camp The King had done with Jack now that Jack s College had lent the money and Blagge s physician could not abide me because I would not sit silent and see him butcher the sick He was a College of Physicians man So Blagge I say thrust us both out with many vile words for a pair of pestilent prating pragmatical rascals Ha Called you pragmatical Nick Puck started up High time Oliver came to purge the land How did you and honest Jack fare next We were in some sort constrained to each other s company I was for going to my house in Spitalfields he would go to his parish in Sussex but the plague was broke out and spreading through Wiltshire Berkshire and Hampshire and he was so mad distracted to think that it might even then be among his folk at home that I bore him company He had comforted me in my distress I could not have done less and I remembered that I had a cousin at Great Wigsell near by Jack s parish Thus we footed it from Oxford cassock and buff coat together resolute to leave wars on the left side henceforth and either through our mean appearances or the plague making men less cruel we were not hindered To be sure they put us in the stocks one half day for rogues and vagabonds at a village under saint Leonard s forest where as I have heard nightingales never sing but the constable very honestly gave me back my Astrological Almanac which I carry with me mister Culpeper tapped his thin chest I dressed a whitlow on his thumb So we went forward Not to trouble you with impertinences we fetched over against Jack Marget s parish in a storm of rain about the day s end Here our roads divided for I would have gone on to my cousin at Great Wigsell but while Jack was pointing me out his steeple we saw a man lying drunk as he conceived athwart the road He said it would be one Hebden a parishioner and till then a man of good life and he accused himself bitterly for an unfaithful shepherd that had left his flock to follow princes But I saw it was the plague and not the beginnings of it neither They had set out the plague stone and the man s head lay on it What s a plague stone Dan whispered When the plague is so hot in a village that the neighbours shut the roads against em people set a hollowed stone pot or pan where such as would purchase victual from outside may lay money and the paper of their wants and depart Those that would sell come later what will a man not do for gain snatch the money forth and leave in exchange such goods as their conscience reckons fair value I saw a silver groat in the water and the man s list of what he would buy was rain pulped in his wet hand My wife Oh my wife and babes says Jack of a sudden and makes uphill I with him A woman peers out from behind a barn crying out that the village is stricken with the plague and that for our lives sake we must avoid it Sweetheart says Jack Must I avoid thee and she leaps at him and says the babes are safe She was his wife When he had thanked God even to tears he tells me this was not the welcome he had intended and presses me to flee the place while I was clean Nay The Lord do so to me and more also if I desert thee now I said These affairs are under God s leave in some fashion my strength Oh sir she says are you a physician We have none Then good people said I I must e en justify myself to you by my works Look look ye stammers Jack I took you all this time for a crazy Roundhead preacher He laughs and she and then I all three together in the rain are overtook by an unreasonable gust or clap of laughter which none the less eased us We call it in medicine the Hysterical Passion So I went home with em Why did you not go on to your cousin at Great Wigsell Nick Puck suggested tis barely seven mile up the road But the plague was here mister Culpeper answered and pointed up the hill What else could I have done What were the parson s children called said Una Elizabeth Alison Stephen and Charles a babe I scarce saw them at first for I separated to live with their father in a cart lodge The mother we put forced into the house with her babes She had done enough And now good people give me leave to be particular in this case The plague was worst on the north side of the street for lack as I showed em of sunshine which proceeding from the PRIME MOBILE or source of life I speak astrologically is cleansing and purifying in the highest degree The plague was hot too by the corn chandler s where they sell forage to the carters extreme hot in both Mills along the river and scatteringly in other places except mark you at the smithy Mark here that all forges and smith shops belong to Mars even as corn and meat and wine shops acknowledge Venus for their mistress There was no plague in the smithy at Munday s Lane Munday s Lane You mean our village I thought so when you talked about the two Mills cried Dan Where did we put the plague stone I d like to have seen it Then look at it now said Puck and pointed to the chickens drinking trough where they had set their bicycle lamps It was a rough oblong stone pan rather like a small kitchen sink which Phillips who never wastes anything had found in a ditch and had used for his precious hens That said Dan and Una and stared and stared and stared mister Culpeper made impatient noises in his throat and went on I am at these pains to be particular good people because I would have you follow so far as you may the operations of my mind That plague which I told you I had handled outside Wallingford in Oxfordshire was of a watery nature conformable to the brookish riverine country it bred in and curable as I have said by drenching in water This plague of ours here for all that it flourished along watercourses every soul at both Mills died of it could not be so handled Which brought me to a stand Ahem And your sick people in the meantime Puck demanded We persuaded them on the north side of the street to lie out in Hitheram s field Where the plague had taken one or at most two in a house folk would not shift for fear of thieves in their absence They cast away their lives to die among their goods Human nature said Puck I ve seen it time and again How did your sick do in the fields They died not near so thick as those that kept within doors and even then they died more out of distraction and melancholy than plague But I confess good people I could not in any sort master the sickness or come at a glimmer of its nature or governance To be brief I was flat bewildered at the brute malignity of the disease and so did what I should have done before dismissed all conjectures and apprehensions that had grown up within me chose a good hour by my Almanac clapped my vinegar cloth to my face and entered some empty houses resigned to wait upon the stars for guidance At night Were you not horribly frightened said Puck I dared to hope that the God who hath made man so nobly curious to search out His mysteries might not destroy a devout seeker In due time there s a time as I have said for everything under the sun I spied a whitish rat very puffed and scabby which sat beneath the dormer of an attic through which shined our Lady the Moon Whilst I looked on him and her she was moving towards old cold Saturn her ancient ally the rat creeped languishingly into her light and there before my eyes died Presently his mate or companion came out laid him down beside there and in like fashion died too Later an hour or less to midnight a third rat did e en the same always choosing the moonlight to die in This threw me into an amaze since as we know the moonlight is favourable not hurtful to the creatures of the Moon and Saturn being friends with her as you would say was hourly strengthening her evil influence Yet these three rats had been stricken dead in very moonlight I leaned out of the window to see which of Heaven s host might be on our side and there beheld I good trusty Mars very red and heated bustling about his setting I straddled the roof to see better Jack Marget came up street going to comfort our sick in Hitheram s field A tile slipped under my foot Says he heavily enough Watchman what of the night Heart up Jack says I Methinks there s one fighting for us that like a fool I ve forgot all this summer My meaning was naturally the planet Mars Pray to Him then says he I forgot Him too this summer He meant God whom he always bitterly accused himself of having forgotten up in Oxfordshire among the King s men I called down that he had made amends enough for his sin by his work among the sick but he said he would not believe so till the plague was lifted from em He was at his strength s end more from melancholy than any just cause I have seen this before among priests and overcheerful men I drenched him then and there with a half cup of waters which I do not say cure the plague but are excellent against heaviness of the spirits What were they said Dan White brandy rectified camphor cardamoms ginger two sorts of pepper and aniseed Whew said Puck Waters you call em Jack coughed on it valiantly and went downhill with me I was for the Lower Mill in the valley to note the aspect of the Heavens My mind had already shadowed forth the reason if not the remedy for our troubles but I would not impart it to the vulgar till I was satisfied That practice may be perfect judgment ought to be sound and to make judgment sound is required an exquisite knowledge Ahem I left Jack and his lantern among the sick in Hitheram s field He still maintained the prayers of the so called Church which were rightly forbidden by Cromwell You should have told your cousin at Wigsell said Puck and Jack would have been fined for it and you d have had half the money How did you come so to fail in your duty Nick mister Culpeper laughed his only laugh that evening and the children jumped at the loud neigh of it We were not fearful of men s judgment in those days he answered Now mark me closely good people for what follows will be to you though not to me remarkable When I reached the empty Mill old Saturn low down in the House of the Fishes threatened the Sun s rising place Our Lady the Moon was moving towards the help of him understand I speak astrologically I looked abroad upon the high Heavens and I prayed the Maker of em for guidance Now Mars sparkingly withdrew himself below the sky On the instant of his departure which I noted a bright star or vapour leaped forth above his head as though he had heaved up his sword and broke all about in fire The cocks crowed midnight through the valley and I sat me down by the mill wheel chewing spearmint though that s an herb of Venus and calling myself all the asses heads in the world Twas plain enough now What was plain said Una The true cause and cure of the plague Mars good fellow had fought for us to the uttermost Faint though he had been in the Heavens and this had made me overlook him in my computations he more than any of the other planets had kept the Heavens which is to say had been visible some part of each night wellnigh throughout the year Therefore his fierce and cleansing influence warring against the Moon had stretched out to kill those three rats under my nose and under the nose of their natural mistress the Moon I had known Mars lean half across Heaven to deal our Lady the Moon some shrewd blow from under his shield but I had never before seen his strength displayed so effectual I don t understand a bit Do you mean Mars killed the rats because he hated the Moon said Una That is as plain as the pikestaff with which Blagge s men pushed me forth mister Culpeper answered I ll prove it Why had the plague not broken out at the blacksmith s shop in Munday s Lane Because as I ve shown you forges and smithies belong naturally to Mars and for his honour s sake Mars ud keep em clean from the creatures of the Moon But was it like think you that he d come down and rat catch in general for lazy ungrateful mankind That were working a willing horse to death So then you can see that the meaning of the blazing star above him when he set was simply this Destroy and burn the creatures Of the moon for they are the root of your trouble And thus having shown you a taste of my power good people adieu Did Mars really say all that Una whispered Yes and twice so much as that to any one who had ears to hear Briefly he enlightened me that the plague was spread by the creatures of the Moon The Moon our Lady of ill aspect was the offender My own poor wits showed me that I Nick Culpeper had the people in my charge God s good providence aiding me and no time to lose neither I posted up the hill and broke into Hitheram s field amongst em all at prayers Eureka good people I cried and cast down a dead mill rat which I d found Here s your true enemy revealed at last by the stars Nay but I m praying says Jack His face was as white as washed silver There s a time for everything under the sun says I If you would stay the plague take and kill your rats Oh mad stark mad says he and wrings his hands A fellow lay in the ditch beside him who bellows that he d as soon die mad hunting rats as be preached to death on a cold fallow They laughed round him at this but Jack Marget falls on his knees and very presumptuously petitions that he may be appointed to die to save the rest of his people This was enough to thrust em back into their melancholy You are an unfaithful shepherd jack I says Take a bat which we call a stick in Sussex and kill a rat if you die before sunrise Twill save your people Aye aye Take a bat and kill a rat he says ten times over like a child which moved em to ungovernable motions of that hysterical passion before mentioned so that they laughed all and at least warmed their chill bloods at that very hour one o clock or a little after when the fires of life burn lowest Truly there is a time for everything and the physician must work with it ahem or miss his cure To be brief with you I persuaded em sick or sound to have at the whole generation of rats throughout the village And there s a reason for all things too though the wise physician need not blab em all Imprimis or firstly the mere sport of it which lasted ten days drew em most markedly out of their melancholy I d defy sorrowful job himself to lament or scratch while he s routing rats from a rick Secundo or secondly the vehement act and operation of this chase or war opened their skins to generous transpiration more vulgarly sweated em handsomely and this further drew off their black bile the mother of sickness Thirdly when we came to burn the bodies of the rats I sprinkled sulphur on the faggots whereby the onlookers were as handsomely suffumigated This I could not have compassed if I had made it a mere physician s business they d have thought it some conjuration Yet more we cleansed limed and burned out a hundred foul poke holes sinks slews and corners of unvisited filth in and about the houses in the village and by good fortune mark here that Mars was in opposition to Venus burned the corn handler s shop to the ground Mars loves not Venus Will Noakes the saddler dropped his lantern on a truss of straw while he was rat hunting there Had ye given Will any of that gentle cordial of yours Nick by any chance said Puck A glass or two glasses not more But as I would say in fine when we had killed the rats I took ash slag and charcoal from the smithy and burnt earth from the brickyard I reason that a brickyard belongs to Mars and rammed it with iron crowbars into the rat runs and buries and beneath all the house floors The Creatures of the Moon hate all that Mars hath used for his own clean ends For example rats bite not iron And how did poor stuttering Jack endure it said Puck He sweated out his melancholy through his skin and catched a loose cough which I cured with electuaries according to art It is noteworthy were I speaking among my equals that the venom of the plague translated or turned itself into and evaporated or went away as a very heavy hoarseness and thickness of the head throat and chest Observe from my books which planets govern these portions of man s body and your darkness good people shall be illuminated ahem None the less the plague qua plague ceased and took off for we only lost three more and two of em had it already on em from the morning of the day that Mars enlightened me by the Lower Mill He coughed almost trumpeted triumphantly It is proved he jerked out I say I have proved my contention which is that by Divine Astrology and humble search into the veritable causes of things at the proper time the sons of wisdom may combat even the plague H m Puck replied For my own part I hold that a simple soul Mine Simple forsooth said mister Culpeper A very simple soul a high courage tempered with sound and stubborn conceit is stronger than all the stars in their courses So I confess truly that you saved the village Nick I stubborn I stiff necked I ascribed all my poor success under God s good providence to Divine Astrology Not to me the glory You talk as that dear weeping ass Jack Marget preached before I went back to my work in Red Lion House Spitalfields Oh Stammering Jack preached did he They say he loses his stammer in the pulpit And his wits with it He delivered a most idolatrous discourse when the plague was stayed He took for his text The wise man that delivered the city I could have given him a better such as There is a time for But what made you go to church to hear him Puck interrupted Wail Attersole was your lawfully appointed preacher and a dull dog he was mister Culpeper wriggled uneasily The vulgar said he the old crones and ahem the children Alison and the others they dragged me to the House of Rimmon by the hand I was in two minds to inform on Jack for maintaining the mummeries of the falsely called Church which I ll prove to you are founded merely on ancient fables Stick to your herbs and planets said Puck laughing You should have told the magistrates Nick and had Jack fined Again why did you neglect your plain duty Because because I was kneeling and praying and weeping with the rest of em at the Altar rails In medicine this is called the Hysterical Passion It may be it may be That s as may be said Puck They heard him turn the hay Why your hay is half hedge brishings he said You don t expect a horse to thrive on oak and ash and thorn leaves do you Ping ping ping went the bicycle bell round the corner Nurse was coming back from the mill Is it all right Una called All quite right Nurse called back They re to be christened next Sunday What What They both leaned forward across the half door It could not have been properly fastened for it opened and tilted them out with hay and leaves sticking all over them Come on We must get those two twins names said Una and they charged uphill shouting over the hedge till Nurse slowed up and told them When they returned old Middenboro had got out of his stall and they spent a lively ten minutes chasing him in again by starlight Our Fathers of Old Excellent herbs had our fathers of old Excellent herbs to ease their pain Alexanders and Marigold Eyebright Orris and Elecampane Basil Rocket Valerian Rue Almost singing themselves they run Vervain Dittany Call me to you Cowslip Melilot Rose of the Sun Anything green that grew out of the mould Was an excellent herb to our fathers of old Wonderful tales had our fathers of old Wonderful tales of the herbs and the stars The Sun was Lord of the Marigold Basil and Rocket belonged to Mars Pat as a sum in division it goes Every plant had a star bespoke Who but Venus should govern the Rose Who but Jupiter own the Oak Simply and gravely the facts are told In the wonderful books of our fathers of old Wonderful little when all is said Wonderful little our fathers knew Half their remedies cured you dead Most of their teaching was quite untrue Look at the stars when a patient is ill Dirt has nothing to do with disease Bleed and blister as much as you will Blister and bleed him as oft as you please Whence enormous and manifold Errors were made by our fathers of old Yet when the sickness was sore in the land And neither planet nor herb assuaged They took their lives in their lancet hand And oh what a wonderful war they waged Yes when the crosses were chalked on the door Yes when the terrible dead cart rolled Excellent courage our fathers bore Excellent heart had our fathers of old Not too learned but nobly bold Into the fight went our fathers of old If it be certain as Galen says And sage Hippocrates holds as much That those afflicted by doubts and dismays Are mightily helped by a dead man s touch Then be good to us stars above Then be good to us herbs below We are afflicted by what we can prove We are distracted by what we know So ah so Down from your Heaven or up from your mould Send us the hearts of our fathers of old SIMPLE SIMON The Thousandth Man One man in a thousand Solomon says Will stick

Nine hundred and ninety nine can t bide The shame or mocking or laughter But the Thousandth Man will stand by your side To the gallows foot and after Simple Simon Cattiwow came down the steep lane with his five horse timber tug He stopped by the wood lump at the back gate to take off the brakes His real name was Brabon but the first time the children met him years and years ago he told them he was carting wood and it sounded so exactly like cattiwow that they never called him anything else HI Una shouted from the top of the wood lump where they had been watching the lane What are you doing Why weren t we told They ve just sent for me Cattiwow answered There s a middlin big log stacked in the dirt at Rabbit Shaw and he flicked his whip back along the line so they ve sent for us all Dan and Una threw themselves off the wood lump almost under black Sailor s nose Cattiwow never let them ride the big beam that makes the body of the timber tug but they hung on behind while their teeth thuttered The Wood road beyond the brook climbs at once into the woods and you see all the horses backs rising one above another like moving stairs Cattiwow strode ahead in his sackcloth woodman s petticoat belted at the waist with a leather strap and when he turned and grinned his red lips showed under his sackcloth coloured beard His cap was sackcloth too with a flap behind to keep twigs and bark out of his neck He navigated the tug among pools of heather water that splashed in their faces and through clumps of young birches that slashed at their legs and when they hit an old toadstooled stump they never knew whether it would give way in showers of rotten wood or jar them back again At the top of Rabbit Shaw half a dozen men and a team of horses stood round a forty foot oak log in a muddy hollow The ground about was poached and stoached with sliding hoofmarks and a wave of dirt was driven up in front of the butt What did you want to bury her for this way said Cattiwow He took his broad axe and went up the log tapping it She s sticked fast said Bunny Lewknor who managed the other team Cattiwow unfastened the five wise horses from the tug They cocked their ears forward looked and shook themselves I believe Sailor knows Dan whispered to Una He do said a man behind them He was dressed in flour sacks like the others and he leaned on his broad axe but the children who knew all the wood gangs knew he was a stranger In his size and oily hairiness he might have been Bunny Lewknor s brother except that his brown eyes were as soft as a spaniel s and his rounded black beard beginning close up under them reminded Una of the walrus in The Walrus and the Carpenter Don t he justabout know he said shyly and shifted from one foot to the other Yes What Cattiwow can t get out of the woods must have roots growing to her Dan had heard old Hobden say this a few days before At that minute Puck pranced up picking his way through the pools of black water in the ling Look out cried Una jumping forward He ll see you Puck Me and Mus Robin are pretty middlin well acquainted the man answered with a smile that made them forget all about walruses This is Simon Cheyneys Puck began and cleared his throat Shipbuilder of Rye Port burgess of the said town and the only Oh look Look ye That s a knowing one said the man Cattiwow had fastened his team to the thin end of the log and was moving them about with his whip till they stood at right angles to it heading downhill Then he grunted The horses took the strain beginning with Sailor next the log like a tug of war team and dropped almost to their knees The log shifted a nail s breadth in the clinging dirt with the noise of a giant s kiss You re getting her Simon Cheyneys slapped his knee Hing on Hing on lads or she ll master ye Ah Sailor s left hind hoof had slipped on a heather tuft One of the men whipped off his sack apron and spread it down They saw Sailor feel for it and recover Still the log hung and the team grunted in despair Hai shouted Cattiwow and brought his dreadful whip twice across Sailor s loins with the crack of a shot gun The horse almost screamed as he pulled that extra last ounce which he did not know was in him The thin end of the log left the dirt and rasped on dry gravel The butt ground round like a buffalo in his wallow Quick as an axe cut Lewknor snapped on his five horses and sliding trampling jingling and snorting they had the whole thing out on the heather Dat s the very first time I ve knowed you lay into Sailor to hurt him said Lewknor It is said Cattiwow and passed his hand over the two wheals But I d ha laid my own brother open at that pinch Now we ll twitch her down the hill a piece she lies just about right and get her home by the low road My team ll do it Bunny you bring the tug along Mind out He spoke to the horses who tightened the chains The great log half rolled over and slowly drew itself out of sight downhill followed by the wood gang and the timber tug In half a minute there was nothing to see but the deserted hollow of the torn up dirt the birch undergrowth still shaking and the water draining back into the hoof prints Ye heard him Simon Cheyneys asked He cherished his horse but he d ha laid him open in that pinch Not for his own advantage said Puck quickly Twas only to shift the log I reckon every man born of woman has his log to shift in the world if so be you re hintin at any o Frankie s doings He never hit beyond reason or without reason said Simon I never said a word against Frankie Puck retorted with a wink at the children An if I did do it lie in your mouth to contest my say so seeing how you Why don t it lie in my mouth seeing I was the first which knowed Frankie for all he was The burly sack clad man puffed down at cool little Puck Yes and the first which set out to poison him Frankie on the high seas Simon s angry face changed to a sheepish grin He waggled his immense hands but Puck stood off and laughed mercilessly But let me tell you Mus Robin he pleaded I ve heard the tale Tell the children here Look Dan Look Una Puck s straight brown finger levelled like an arrow There s the only man that ever tried to poison Sir Francis Drake Oh Mus Robin Tidn t fair You ve the vantage of us all in your upbringin s by hundreds o years Stands to nature you know all the tales against every one He turned his soft eyes so helplessly on Una that she cried Stop ragging him Puck You know he didn t really I do But why are you so sure little maid Because because he doesn t look like it said Una stoutly I thank you said Simon to Una I I was always trustable like with children if you let me alone you double handful o mischief He pretended to heave up his axe on Puck and then his shyness overtook him afresh Where did you know Sir Francis Drake said Dan not liking being called a child At Rye Port to be sure said Simon and seeing Dan s bewilderment repeated it Yes but look here said Dan Drake he was a Devon man The song says so And ruled the Devon seas Una went on That s what I was thinking if you don t mind Simon Cheyneys seemed to mind very much indeed for he swelled in silence while Puck laughed Hutt he burst out at last I ve heard that talk too If you listen to them West Country folk you ll listen to a pack o lies I believe Frankie was born somewhere out west among the Shires but his father had to run for it when Frankie was a baby because the neighbours was wishful to kill him d ye see He run to Chatham old Parson Drake did an Frankie was brought up in a old hulks of a ship moored in the Medway river same as it might ha been the Rother Brought up at sea you might say before he could walk on land nigh Chatham in Kent And ain t Kent back door to Sussex And don t that make Frankie Sussex O course it do Devon man Bah Those West Country boats they re always fishin in other folks water I beg your pardon said Dan I m sorry No call to be sorry You ve been misled I met Frankie at Rye Port when my Uncle that was the shipbuilder there pushed me off his wharf edge on to Frankie s ship Frankie had put in from Chatham with his rudder splutted and a man s arm Moon s that ud be broken at the tiller Take this boy aboard an drown him says my Uncle and I ll mend your rudder piece for love What did your Uncle want you drowned for said Una That was only his fashion of say so same as Mus Robin I d a foolishness in my head that ships could be builded out of iron Yes iron ships I d made me a liddle toy one of iron plates beat out thin and she floated a wonder But my Uncle bein a burgess of Rye and a shipbuilder he prenticed me to Frankie in the fetchin trade to cure this foolishness What was the fetchin trade Dan interrupted Fetchin poor Flemishers and Dutchmen out o the Low Countries into England The King o Spain d ye see he was burnin em in those parts for to make em Papishers so Frankie he fetched em away to our parts and a risky trade it was His master wouldn t never touch it while he lived but he left his ship to Frankie when he died and Frankie turned her into this fetchin trade Outrageous cruel hard work on besom black nights bulting back and forth off they Dutch roads with shoals on all sides and having to hark out for the frish frish frish like of a Spanish galliwopses oars creepin up on ye Frankie ud have the tiller and Moon he d peer forth at the bows our lantern under his skirts till the boat we was lookin for ud blurt up out o the dark and we d lay hold and haul aboard whoever twas man woman or babe an round we d go again the wind bewling like a kite in our riggin s and they d drop into the hold and praise God for happy deliverance till they was all sick I had nigh a year at it an we must have fetched off oh a hundred pore folk I reckon Outrageous bold too Frankie growed to be Outrageous cunnin he was Once we was as near as nothin nipped by a tall ship off Tergoes Sands in a snowstorm She had the wind of us and spooned straight before it shootin all bow guns Frankie fled inshore smack for the beach till he was atop of the first breakers Then he hove his anchor out which nigh tore our bows off but it twitched us round end for end into the wind d ye see an we clawed off them sands like a drunk man rubbin along a tavern bench When we could see the Spanisher was laid flat along in the breakers with the snows whitening on his wet belly He thought he could go where Frankie went What happened to the crew said Una We didn t stop Simon answered There was a very liddle new baby in our hold and the mother she wanted to get to some dry bed middlin quick We runned into Dover and said nothing Was Sir Francis Drake very much pleased Heart alive maid he d no head to his name in those days He was just a outrageous valiant crop haired tutt mouthed boy roarin up an down the narrer seas with his beard not yet quilted out He made a laughing stock of everything all day and he d hold our lives in the bight of his arm all the besom black night among they Dutch sands and we d ha jumped overside to behove him any one time all of us Then why did you try to poison him Una asked wickedly and Simon hung his head like a shy child Oh that was when he set me to make a pudden for because our cook was hurted I done my uttermost but she all fetched adrift like in the bag an the more I biled the bits of her the less she favoured any fashion o pudden Moon he chawed and chammed his piece and Frankie chawed and chammed his n and no words to it he took me by the ear an walked me out over the bow end an him an Moon hove the pudden at me on the bowsprit gub by gub something cruel hard Simon rubbed his hairy cheek Nex time you bring me anything says Frankie you bring me cannon shot an I ll know what I m getting But as for poisonin He stopped the children laughed so Of course you didn t said Una Oh Simon we do like you I was always likeable with children His smile crinkled up through the hair round his eyes Simple Simon they used to call me through our yard gates Did Sir Francis mock you Dan asked Ah no He was gentle born Laugh he did he was always laughing but not so as to hurt a feather An I loved en I loved en before England knew en or Queen Bess she broke his heart But he hadn t really done anything when you knew him had he Una insisted Armadas and those things I mean Simon pointed to the scars and scrapes left by Cattiwow s great log You tell me that that good ship s timber never done nothing against winds and weathers since her up springing and I ll confess ye that young Frankie never done nothing neither Nothing He adventured and suffered and made shift on they Dutch sands as much in any one month as ever he had occasion for to do in a half year on the high seas afterwards An what was his tools A coaster boat a liddle box o walty plankin an some few fathom feeble rope held together an made able by him sole He drawed our spirits up In our bodies same as a chimney towel draws a fire Twas in him and it comed out all times and shapes I wonder did he ever magine what he was going to be Tell himself stories about it said Dan with a flush I expect so We mostly do even when we re grown But bein Frankie he took good care to find out beforehand what his fortune might be Had I rightly ought to tell em this piece Simon turned to Puck who nodded My Mother she was just a fair woman but my Aunt her sister she had gifts by inheritance laid up in her Simon began Oh that ll never do cried Puck for the children stared blankly Do you remember what Robin promised to the Widow Whitgift so long as her blood and get lasted See Dymchurch Flit in PUCK OF POOK S HILL Yes There was always to be one of them that could see farther through a millstone than most Dan answered promptly Well Simon s Aunt s mother said Puck slowly married the Widow s blind son on the Marsh and Simon s Aunt was the one chosen to see farthest through millstones Do you understand That was what I was gettin at said Simon but you re so desperate quick My Aunt she knew what was comin to people My Uncle being a burgess of Rye he counted all such things odious and my Aunt she couldn t be got to practise her gifts hardly at all because it hurted her head for a week after wards but when Frankie heard she had em he was all for nothin till she foretold on him till she looked in his hand to tell his fortune d ye see One time we was at Rye she come aboard with my other shirt and some apples and he fair beazled the life out of her about it Oh you ll be twice wed and die childless she says and pushes his hand away That s the woman s part he says What ll come to me to me an he thrusts it back under her nose Gold gold past belief or counting she says Let go o me lad Sink the gold he says What ll I do mother He coaxed her like no woman could well withstand I ve seen him with em even when they were sea sick If you will have it she says at last you shall have it You ll do a many things and eating and drinking with a dead man beyond the world s end will be the least of them For you ll open a road from the East unto the West and back again and you ll bury your heart with your best friend by that road side and the road you open none shall shut so long as you re let lie quiet in your grave The old lady s prophecy is in a fair way to come true for now the Panama Canal is finished one end of it opens into the very bay where Sir Francis Drake was buried So ships are taken through the Canal and the road round Cape Horn which Sir Francis opened is very little used And if I m not he says Why then she says Sim s iron ships will be sailing on dry land Now ha done with this foolishness Where s Sim s shirt He couldn t fetch no more out of her and when we come up from the cabin he stood mazed like by the tiller playing with a apple My Sorrow says my Aunt d ye see that The great world lying in his hand liddle and round like a apple Why tis one you gived him I says To be sure she says Tis just a apple and she went ashore with her hand to her head It always hurted her to show her gifts Him and me puzzled over that talk plenty It sticked in his mind quite extravagant The very next time we slipped out for some fetchin trade we met Mus Stenning s boat over by Calais sands and he warned us that the Spanishers had shut down all their Dutch ports against us English and their galliwopses was out picking up our boats like flies off hogs backs Mus Stenning he runs for Shoreham but Frankie held on a piece knowin that Mus Stenning was jealous of our good trade Over by Dunkirk a great gor bellied Spanisher with the Cross on his sails came rampin at us We left him We left him all they bare seas to conquest in Looks like this road was going to be shut pretty soon says Frankie humourin her at the tiller I ll have to open that other one your Aunt foretold of The Spanisher s crowdin down on us middlin quick I says No odds says Frankie he ll have the inshore tide against him Did your Aunt say I was to be quiet in my grave for ever Till my iron ships sailed dry land I says That s foolishness he says Who cares where Frankie Drake makes a hole in the water now or twenty years from now The Spanisher kept muckin on more and more canvas I told him so He s feelin the tide was all he says If he was among Tergoes Sands with this wind we d be picking his bones proper I d give my heart to have all their tall ships there some night before a north gale and me to windward There d be gold in My hands then Did your Aunt say she saw the world settin in my hand Sim Yes but twas a apple says I and he laughed like he always did at me Do you ever feel minded to jump overside and be done with everything he asks after a while No What water comes aboard is too wet as tis I says The Spanisher s going about I told you says he never looking back He ll give us the Pope s Blessing as he swings Come down off that rail There s no knowin where stray shots may hit So I came down off the rail and leaned against it and the Spanisher he ruffled round in the wind and his port lids opened all red inside Now what ll happen to my road if they don t let me lie quiet in my grave he says Does your Aunt mean there s two roads to be found and kept open or what does she mean I don t like that talk about t other road D you believe in your iron ships Sim He knowed I did so I only nodded and he nodded back again Anybody but me ud call you a fool Sim he says Lie down Here comes the Pope s Blessing The Spanisher gave us his broadside as he went about They all fell short except one that smack smooth hit the rail behind my back an I felt most won erful cold Be you hit anywhere to signify he says Come over to me O Lord Mus Drake I says my legs won t move and that was the last I spoke for months Why What had happened cried Dan and Una together The rail had jarred me in here like Simon reached behind him clumsily From my shoulders down I didn t act no shape Frankie carried me piggyback to my Aunt s house and I lay bed rid and tongue tied while she rubbed me day and night month in and month out She had faith in rubbing with the hands P raps she put some of her gifts into it too Last of all something loosed itself in my pore back and lo I was whole restored again but kitten feeble Where s Frankie I says thinking I d been a longish while abed Down wind amongst the Dons months ago says my Aunt When can I go after en I says Your duty s to your town and trade now says she Your Uncle he died last Michaelmas and he ve left you and me the yard So no more iron ships mind ye What I says And you the only one that beleft in em Maybe I do still she says but I m a woman before I m a Whitgift and wooden ships is what England needs us to build I lay on ye to do so That s why I ve never teched iron since that day not to build a toy ship of I ve never even drawed a draft of one for my pleasure of evenings Simon smiled down on them all Whitgift blood is terrible resolute on the she side said Puck Didn t You ever see Sir Francis Drake again Dan asked With one thing and another and my being made a burgess of Rye I never clapped eyes on him for the next twenty years Oh I had the news of his mighty doings the world over They was the very same bold cunning shifts and passes he d worked with beforetimes off they Dutch sands but naturally folk took more note of them When Queen Bess made him knight he sent my Aunt a dried orange stuffed with spiceries to smell to She cried outrageous on it She blamed herself for her foretellings having set him on his won erful road but I reckon he d ha gone that way all withstanding Curious how close she foretelled it The world in his hand like an apple an he burying his best friend Mus Doughty Never mind for Mus Doughty Puck interrupted Tell us where you met Sir Francis next Oh ha That was the year I was made a burgess of Rye the same year which King Philip sent his ships to take England without Frankie s leave The Armada said Dan contentedly I was hoping that would come I knowed Frankie would never let em smell London smoke but plenty good men in Rye was two three minded about the upshot Twas the noise of the gun fire tarrified us The wind favoured it our way from off behind the Isle of Wight It made a mutter like which growed and growed and by the end of a week women was shruckin in the streets Then they come slidderin past Fairlight in a great smoky pat vambrished with red gun fire and our ships flyin forth and duckin in again The smoke pat sliddered over to the French shore so I knowed Frankie was edgin the Spanishers toward they Dutch sands where he was master I says to my Aunt The smoke s thinnin out I lay Frankie s just about scrapin his hold for a few last rounds shot Tis time for me to go Never in them clothes she says Do on the doublet I bought you to be made burgess in and don t you shame this day So I mucked it on and my chain and my stiffed Dutch breeches and all I be comin too she says from her chamber and forth she come pavisandin like a peacock stuff ruff stomacher and all She was a notable woman But how did you go You haven t told us said Una In my own ship but half share was my Aunt s In the ANTONY OF RYE to be sure and not empty handed I d been loadin her for three days with the pick of our yard We was ballasted on cannon shot of all three sizes and iron rods and straps for his carpenters and a nice passel of clean three inch oak planking and hide breech ropes for his cannon and gubs of good oakum and bolts o canvas and all the sound rope in the yard What else could I ha done I knowed what he d need most after a week s such work I m a shipbuilder little maid We d a fair slant o wind off Dungeness and we crept on till it fell light airs and puffed out The Spanishers was all in a huddle over by Calais and our ships was strawed about mending emselves like dogs lickin bites Now and then a Spanisher would fire from a low port and the ball ud troll across the flat swells but both sides was finished fightin for that tide The first ship we foreslowed on her breastworks was crushed in an men was shorin em up She said nothing The next was a black pinnace his pumps clackin middling quick and he said nothing But the third mending shot holes he spoke out plenty I asked him where Mus Drake might be and a shiny suited man on the poop looked down into us and saw what we carried Lay alongside you he says We ll take that all Tis for Mus Drake I says keeping away lest his size should lee the wind out of my sails Hi Ho Hither We re Lord High Admiral of England Come alongside or we ll hang ye he says Twas none of my affairs who he was if he wasn t Frankie and while he talked so hot I slipped behind a green painted ship with her top sides splintered We was all in the middest of em then Hi Hoi the green ship says Come alongside honest man and I ll buy your load I m Fenner that fought the seven Portugals clean out of shot or bullets Frankie knows me Ay but I don t I says and I slacked nothing He was a masterpiece Seein I was for goin on he hails a Bridport hoy beyond us and shouts George Oh George Wing that duck He s fat An true as we re all here that squatty Bridport boat rounds to acrost our bows intendin to stop us by means o shooting My Aunt looks over our rail George she says you finish with your enemies afore you begin on your friends Him that was laying the liddle swivel gun at us sweeps off his hat an calls her Queen Bess and asks if she was selling liquor to pore dry sailors My Aunt answered him quite a piece She was a notable woman Then he come up his long pennant trailing overside his waistcloths and netting tore all to pieces where the Spanishers had grappled and his sides black smeared with their gun blasts like candle smoke in a bottle We hooked on to a lower port and hung Oh Mus Drake Mus Drake I calls up He stood on the great anchor cathead his shirt open to the middle and his face shining like the sun Why Sim he says Just like that after twenty year Sim he says what brings you Pudden I says not knowing whether to laugh or cry You told me to bring cannon shot next time an I ve brought em He saw we had He ripped out a fathom and a half o brimstone Spanish and he swung down on our rail and he kissed me before all his fine young captains His men was swarming out of the lower ports ready to unload us When he saw how I d considered all his likely wants he kissed me again Here s a friend that sticketh closer than a brother he says Mistress he says to my Aunt all you foretold on me was true I ve opened that road from the East to the West and I ve buried my heart beside it I know she says That s why I be come But ye never foretold this he points to both they great fleets This don t seem to me to make much odds compared to what happens to a man she says Do it Certain sure a man forgets to remember when he s proper mucked up with work Sim he says to me we must shift every living Spanisher round Dunkirk corner on to our Dutch sands before morning The wind ll come out of the North after this calm same as it used and then they re our meat Amen says I I ve brought you what I could scutchel up of odds and ends Be you hit anywhere to signify Oh our folk ll attend to all that when we ve time he says He turns to talk to my Aunt while his men flew the stuff out of our hold I think I saw old Moon amongst em but he was too busy to more than nod like Yet the Spanishers was going to prayers with their bells and candles before we d cleaned out the ANTONY Twenty two ton o useful stuff I d fetched him Now Sim says my Aunt no more devouring of Mus Drake s time He s sending us home in the Bridport hoy I want to speak to them young springalds again But here s our ship all ready and swept I says Swep an garnished says Frankie I m going to fill her with devils in the likeness o pitch and sulphur We must shift the Dons round Dunkirk corner and if shot can t do it we ll send down fireships I ve given him my share of the ANTONY says my Aunt What do you reckon to do about yours She offered it said Frankie laughing She wouldn t have if I d overheard her I says because I d have offered my share first Then I told him how the ANTONY s sails was best trimmed to drive before the wind and seeing he was full of occupations we went acrost to that Bridport hoy and left him But Frankie was gentle born d ye see and that sort they never overlook any folks dues When the hoy passed under his stern he stood bare headed on the poop same as if my Aunt had been his Queen and his musicianers played Mary Ambree on their silver trumpets quite a long while Heart alive little maid I never meaned to make you look sorrowful Bunny Lewknor in his sackcloth petticoats burst through the birch scrub wiping his forehead We ve got the stick to rights now She ve been a whole hatful o trouble You come an ride her home Mus Dan and Miss Una They found the proud wood gang at the foot of the slope with the log double chained on the tug Cattiwow what are you going to do with it said Dan as they straddled the thin part She s going down to Rye to make a keel for a Lowestoft fishin boat I ve heard Hold tight Cattiwow cracked his whip and the great log dipped and tilted and leaned and dipped again exactly like a stately ship upon the high seas Frankie s Trade Old Horn to All Atlantic said A hay O To me O Now where did Frankie learn his trade For he ran me down with a three reef mains le All round the Horn Atlantic answered Not from me You d better ask the cold North Sea For he ran me down under all plain canvas All round the Horn The North Sea answered He s my man For he came to me when he began Frankie Drake in an open coaster All round the Sands I caught him young and I used him sore So you never shall startle Frankie more Without capsizing Earth and her waters All round the Sands I did not favour him at all I made him pull and I made him haul And stand his trick with the common sailors All round the Sands I froze him stiff and I fogged him blind And kicked him home with his road to find By what he could see of a three day snow storm All round the Sands I learned him his trade o winter nights Twixt Mardyk Fort and Dunkirk lights On a five knot tide with the forts a firing All round the Sands Before his beard began to shoot I showed him the length of the Spaniard s foot And I reckon he clapped the boot on it later All round the Sands If there s a risk which you can make That s worse than he was used to take Nigh every week in the way of his business All round the Sands If there s a trick that you can try Which he hasn t met in time gone by Not once or twice but ten times over All round the Sands If you can teach him aught that s new A hay O To me O I ll give you Bruges and Niewport too And the ten tall churches that stand between em Storm along my gallant Captains All round the Horn THE TREE OF JUSTICE The Ballad of Minepit Shaw About the time that taverns shut And men can buy no beer Two lads went up by the keepers hut To steal Lord Pelham s deer Night and the liquor was in their heads They laughed and talked no bounds Till they waked the keepers on their beds And the keepers loosed the hounds They had killed a hart they had killed a hind Ready to carry away When they heard a whimper down the wind And they heard a bloodhound bay They took and ran across the fern Their crossbows in their hand Till they met a man with a green lantern That called and bade em stand What are you doing O Flesh and Blood And what s your foolish will That you must break into Minepit Wood And wake the Folk of the Hill Oh we ve broke into Lord Pelham s park And killed Lord Pelham s deer And if ever you heard a little dog bark You ll know why we come here We ask you let us go our way As fast as we can flee For if ever you heard a bloodhound bay You ll know how pressed we be Oh lay your crossbows on the bank And drop the knife from your hand And though the hounds are at your flank I ll save you where you stand They laid their crossbows on the bank They threw their knives in the wood And the ground before them opened and sank And saved em where they stood Oh what s the roaring in our ears That strikes us well nigh dumb Oh that is just how things appears According as they come What are the stars before our eyes That strike us well nigh blind Oh that is just how things arise According as you find And why s our bed so hard to the bones Excepting where it s cold Oh that s because it is precious stones Excepting where tis gold Think it over as you stand For I tell you without fail If you haven t got into Fairyland You re not in Lewes Gaol All night long they thought of it And come the dawn they saw They d tumbled into a great old pit At the bottom of Minepit Shaw And the keepers hound had followed em close And broke her neck in the fall So they picked up their knives and their cross bows And buried the dog That s all But whether the man was a poacher too Or a Pharisee so bold I reckon there s more things told than are true And more things true than are told The Tree of Justice It was a warm dark winter day with the Sou West wind singing through Dallington Forest and the woods below the Beacon The children set out after dinner to find old Hobden who had a three months job in the Rough at the back of Pound s Wood He had promised to get them a dormouse in its nest The bright leaf Still clung to the beech coppice the long chestnut leaves lay orange on the ground and the rides were speckled with scarlet lipped sprouting acorns They worked their way by their own short cuts to the edge of Pound s Wood and heard a horse s feet just as they came to the beech where Ridley the keeper hangs up the vermin The poor little fluffy bodies dangled from the branches some perfectly good but most of them dried to twisted strips Three more owls said Dan counting Two stoats four jays and a kestrel That s ten since last week Ridley s a beast In my time this sort of tree bore heavier fruit Sir Richard Dalyngridge reined up his grey horse Swallow in the ride behind them This is the Norman knight they met the year before in PUCK OF POOK S HILL See Young Men at the Manor The Knights of the Joyous Venture and Old Men at Pevensey in that book What play do you make he asked Nothing Sir We re looking for old Hobden Dan replied He promised to get us a sleeper Sleeper A DORMEUSE do you say Yes a dormouse Sir I understand I passed a woodman on the low grounds Come He wheeled up the ride again and pointed through an opening to the patch of beech stubs chestnut hazel and birch that old Hobden would turn into firewood hop poles pea boughs and house faggots before spring The old man was as busy as a beaver Something laughed beneath a thorn and Puck stole out his finger on his lip Look he whispered Along between the spindle trees Ridley has been there this half hour The children followed his point and saw Ridley the keeper in an old dry ditch watching Hobden as a cat watches a mouse Huhh cried Una Hobden always tends to his wires before breakfast He puts his rabbits into the faggots he s allowed to take home He ll tell us about em tomorrow We had the same breed in my day Sir Richard replied and moved off quietly Puck at his bridle the children on either side between the close trimmed beech stuff What did you do to them said Dan as they repassed Ridley s terrible tree That Sir Richard jerked his head toward the dangling owls Not he said Puck There was never enough brute Norman in you to hang a man for taking a buck I I cannot abide to hear their widows screech But why am I on horseback while you are afoot He dismounted lightly tapped Swallow on the chest so that the wise thing backed instead of turning in the narrow ride and put himself at the head of the little procession He walked as though all the woods belonged to him I have often told my friends he went on that Red William the King was not the only Norman found dead in a forest while he hunted D you mean William Rufus said Dan Yes said Puck kicking a clump of red toad stools off a dead log For example there was a knight new from Normandy Sir Richard went on to whom Henry our King granted a manor in Kent near by He chose to hang his forester s son the day before a deer hunt that he gave to pleasure the King Now when would that be said Puck and scratched an ear thoughtfully The summer of the year King Henry broke his brother Robert of Normandy at Tenchebrai fight Our ships were even then at Pevensey loading for the war What happened to the knight Dan asked They found him pinned to an ash three arrows through his leather coat I should have worn mail that day And did you see him all bloody Dan continued Nay I was with De Aquila at Pevensey counting horseshoes and arrow sheaves and ale barrels into the holds of the ships The army only waited for our King to lead them against Robert in Normandy but he sent word to De Aquila that he would hunt with him here before he set out for France Why did the King want to hunt so particularly Una demanded If he had gone straight to France after the Kentish knight was killed men would have said he feared being slain like the knight It was his duty to show himself debonair to his English people as it was De Aquila s duty to see that he took no harm while he did it But it was a great burden De Aquila Hugh and I ceased work on the ships and scoured all the Honour of the Eagle all De Aquila s lands to make a fit and above all a safe sport for our King Look The ride twisted and came out on the top of Pound s Hill Wood Sir Richard pointed to the swells of beautiful dappled Dallington that showed like a woodcock s breast up the valley Ye know the forest said he You ought to see the bluebells there in Spring said Una I have seen said Sir Richard gazing and stretched out his hand Hugh s work and mine was first to move the deer gently from all parts into Dallington yonder and there to hold them till the King came Next we must choose some three hundred beaters to drive the deer to the stands within bowshot of the King Here was our trouble In the mellay of a deer drive a Saxon peasant and a Norman King may come over close to each other The conquered do not love their conquerors all at once So we needed sure men for whom their village or kindred would answer in life cattle and land if any harm come to the King Ye see If one of the beaters shot the King said Puck Sir Richard wanted to be able to punish that man s village Then the village would take care to send a good man So So it was But lest our work should be too easy the King had done such a dread justice over at Salehurst for the killing of the Kentish knight twenty six men he hanged as I heard that our folk were half mad with fear before we began It is easier to dig out a badger gone to earth than a Saxon gone dumb sullen And atop of their misery the old rumour waked that Harold the Saxon was alive and would bring them deliverance from us Normans This has happened every autumn since Santlache fight But King Harold was killed at Hastings said Una So it was said and so it was believed by us Normans but our Saxons always believed he would come again That rumour did not make our work any more easy Sir Richard strode on down the far slope of the wood where the trees thin out It was fascinating to watch how he managed his long spurs among the lumps of blackened ling But we did it he said After all a woman is as good as a man to beat the woods and the mere word that deer are afoot makes cripples and crones young again De Aquila laughed when Hugh told him over the list of beaters Half were women and many of the rest were clerks Saxon and Norman priests Hugh and I had not time to laugh for eight days till De Aquila as Lord of Pevensey met our King and led him to the first shooting stand by the Mill on the edge of the forest Hugh and I it was no work for hot heads or heavy hands lay with our beaters on the skirts of Dallington to watch both them and the deer When De Aquila s great horn blew we went forward a line half a league long Oh to see the fat clerks their gowns tucked up puffing and roaring and the sober millers dusting the under growth with their staves and like as not between them a Saxon wench hand in hand with her man shrilling like a kite as she ran and leaping high through the fern all for joy of the sport Ah How Ah How How ah Sa how ah Puck bellowed without warning and Swallow bounded forward ears cocked and nostrils cracking Hal lal lal lal la hai ie Sir Richard answered in a high clear shout The two voices joined in swooping circles of sound and a heron rose out of a red osier bed below them circling as though he kept time to the outcry Swallow quivered and swished his glorious tail They stopped together on the same note A hoarse shout answered them across the bare woods That s old Hobden said Una Small blame to him It is in his blood said Puck Did your beaters cry so Sir Richard My faith they forgot all else Steady Swallow steady They forgot where the King and his people waited to shoot They followed the deer to the very edge of the open till the first flight of wild arrows from the stands flew fair over them I cried Ware shot Ware shot and a knot of young knights new from Normandy that had strayed away from the Grand Stand turned about and in mere sport loosed off at our line shouting Ware Santlache arrows Ware Santlache arrows A jest I grant you but too sharp One of our beaters answered in Saxon Ware New Forest arrows Ware Red William s arrow so I judged it time to end the jests and when the boys saw my old mail gown for to shoot with strangers I count the same as war they ceased shooting So that was smoothed over and we gave our beaters ale to wash down their anger They were excusable We they had sweated to show our guests good sport and our reward was a flight of hunting arrows which no man loves and worse a churl s jibe over hard fought fair lost Hastings fight So before the next beat Hugh and I assembled and called the beaters over by name to steady them The greater part we knew but among the Netherfield men I saw an old old man in the dress of a pilgrim The Clerk of Netherfield said he was well known by repute for twenty years as a witless man that journeyed without rest to all the shrines of England The old man sits Saxon fashion head between fists We Normans rest the chin on the left palm Who answers for him said I If he fails in his duty who will pay his fine Who will pay my fine the pilgrim said I have asked that of all the Saints in England these forty years less three months and nine days They have not answered When he lifted his thin face I saw he was one eyed and frail as a rush Nay but Father I said to whom hast thou commended thyself He shook his head so I spoke in Saxon Whose man art thou I think I have a writing from Rahere the King s jester said he after a while I am as I suppose Rahere s man He pulled a writing from his scrip and Hugh coming up read it It set out that the pilgrim was Rahere s man and that Rahere was the King s jester There was Latin writ at the back What a plague conjuration s here said Hugh turning it over Pum quum sum oc occ Magic Black Magic said the Clerk of Netherfield he had been a monk at Battle They say Rahere is more of a priest than a fool and more of a wizard than either Here s Rahere s name writ and there s Rahere s red cockscomb mark drawn below for such as cannot read He looked slyly at me Then read it said I and show thy learning He was a vain little man and he gave it us after much mouthing The charm which I think is from Virgilius the Sorcerer says When thou art once dead and Minos which is a heathen judge has doomed thee neither cunning nor speechcraft nor good works will restore thee A terrible thing It denies any mercy to a man s soul Does it serve said the pilgrim plucking at Hugh s cloak Oh man of the King s blood does it cover me Hugh was of Earl Godwin s blood and all Sussex knew it though no Saxon dared call him kingly in a Norman s hearing There can be but one King It serves said Hugh But the day will be long and hot Better rest here We go forward now No I will keep with thee my kinsman he answered like a child He was indeed childish through great age The line had not moved a bowshot when De Aquila s great horn blew for a halt and soon young Fulke our false Fulke s son yes the imp that lit the straw in Pevensey Castle See Old Men at Pevensey in PUCK OF POOK S HILL came thundering up a woodway Uncle said he though he was a man grown he called me Uncle those young Norman fools who shot at you this morn are saying that your beaters cried treason against the King It has come to Harry s long ears and he bids you give account of it There are heavy fines in his eye but I am with you to the hilt Uncle When the boy had fled back Hugh said to me It was Rahere s witless man that cried Ware Red William s arrow I heard him and so did the Clerk of Netherfield Then Rahere must answer to the King for his man said I Keep him by you till I send and I hastened down The King was with De Aquila in the Grand Stand above Welansford down in the valley yonder His Court knights and dames lay glittering on the edge of the glade I made my homage and Henry took it coldly How came your beaters to shout threats against me said he The tale has grown I answered One old witless man cried out Ware Red William s arrow when the young knights shot at our line We had two beaters hit I will do justice on that man he answered Who is his master He s Rahere s man said I Rahere s said Henry Has my fool a fool I heard the bells jingle at the back of the stand and a red leg waved over it then a black one So very slowly Rahere the King s jester straddled the edge of the planks and looked down on us rubbing his chin Loose knit with cropped hair and a sad priest s face under his cockscomb cap that he could twist like a strip of wet leather His eyes were hollow set Nay nay Brother said he If I suffer you to keep your fool you must e en suffer me to keep mine This he delivered slowly into the King s angry face My faith a King s jester must be bolder than lions Now we will judge the matter said Rahere Let these two brave knights go hang my fool because he warned King Henry against running after Saxon deer through woods full of Saxons Faith Brother if thy Brother Red William now among the Saints as we hope had been timely warned against a certain arrow in New Forest one fool of us four would not be crowned fool of England this morning Therefore hang the fool s fool knights Mark the fool s cunning Rahere had himself given us order to hang the man No King dare confirm a fool s command to such a great baron as De Aquila and the helpless King knew it What No hanging said Rahere after a silence A God s Gracious Name kill something then Go forward with the hunt He splits his face ear to ear in a yawn like a fish pond Henry says he the next time I sleep do not pester me with thy fooleries Then he throws himself out of sight behind the back of the stand I have seen courage with mirth in De Aquila and Hugh but stark mad courage of Rahere s sort I had never even guessed at What did the King say cried Dan He had opened his mouth to speak when young Fulke who had come into the stand with us laughed and boy like once begun could not check himself He kneeled on the instant for pardon but fell sideways crying His legs Oh his long waving red legs as he went backward Like a storm breaking our grave King laughed stamped and reeled with laughter till the stand shook So like a storm this strange thing passed He wiped his eyes and signed to De Aquila to let the drive come on When the deer broke we were pleased that the King shot from the shelter of the stand and did not ride out after the hurt beasts as Red William would have done Most vilely his knights and barons shot De Aquila kept me beside him and I saw no more of Hugh till evening We two had a little hut of boughs by the camp where I went to wash me before the great supper and in the dusk I heard Hugh on the couch Wearied Hugh said I A little he says I have driven Saxon deer all day for a Norman King and there is enough of Earl Godwin s blood left in me to sicken at the work Wait awhile with the torch I waited then and I thought I heard him sob Poor Hugh Was he so tired said Una Hobden says beating is hard work sometimes I think this tale is getting like the woods said Dan darker and twistier every minute Sir Richard had walked as he talked and though the children thought they knew the woods well enough they felt a little lost A dark tale enough says Sir Richard but the end was not all black When we had washed we went to wait on the King at meat in the great pavilion Just before the trumpets blew for the Entry all the guests upstanding long Rahere comes posturing up to Hugh and strikes him with his bauble bladder Here s a heavy heart for a joyous meal he says But each man must have his black hour or where would be the merit of laughing Take a fool s advice and sit it out with my man I ll make a jest to excuse you to the King if he remember to ask for you That s more than I would do for Archbishop Anselm Hugh looked at him heavy eyed Rahere said he The King s jester Oh Saints what punishment for my King and smites his hands together Go go fight it out in the dark says Rahere and thy Saxon Saints reward thee for thy pity to my fool He pushed him from the pavilion and Hugh lurched away like one drunk But why said Una I don t understand Ah why indeed Live you long enough maiden and you shall know the meaning of many whys Sir Richard smiled I wondered too but it was my duty to wait on the King at the High Table in all that glitter and stir He spoke me his thanks for the sport I had helped show him and he had learned from De Aquila enough of my folk and my castle in Normandy to graciously feign that he knew and had loved my brother there This also is part of a king s work Many great men sat at the High Table chosen by the King for their wits not for their birth I have forgotten their names and their faces I only saw that one night But Sir Richard turned in his stride but Rahere flaming in black and scarlet among our guests the hollow of his dark cheek flushed with wine long laughing Rahere and the stricken sadness of his face when he was not twisting it about Rahere I shall never forget At the King s outgoing De Aquila bade me follow him with his great bishops and two great barons to the little pavilion We had devised jugglers and dances for the Court s sport but Henry loved to talk gravely to grave men and De Aquila had told him of my travels to the world s end We had a fire of apple wood sweet as incense and the curtains at the door being looped up we could hear the music and see the lights shining on mail and dresses Rahere lay behind the King s chair The questions he darted forth at me were as shrewd as the flames I was telling of our fight with the apes as ye called them at the world s end See The Knights of the Joyous Venture in PUCK OF POOK S HILL But where is the Saxon knight that went with you said Henry He must confirm these miracles He is busy said Rahere confirming a new miracle Enough miracles for today said the King Rahere you have saved your long neck Fetch the Saxon knight Pest on it said Rahere Who would be a King s jester I ll bring him Brother if you ll see that none of your home brewed bishops taste my wine while I am away So he jingled forth between the men at arms at the door Henry had made many bishops in England without the Pope s leave I know not the rights of the matter but only Rahere dared jest about it We waited on the King s next word I think Rahere is jealous of you said he smiling to Nigel of Ely He was one bishop and William of Exeter the other Wal wist the Saxons called him laughed long Rahere is a priest at heart Shall I make him a bishop De Aquila says the King There might be worse said our Lord of Pevensey Rahere would never do what Anselm has done This Anselm Archbishop of Canterbury had gone off raging to the Pope at Rome because Henry would make bishops without his leave either I knew not the rights of it but De Aquila did and the King laughed Anselm means no harm He should have been a monk not a bishop said the King I ll never quarrel with Anselm or his Pope till they quarrel with my England If we can keep the King s peace till my son comes to rule no man will lightly quarrel with our England Amen said De Aquila But the King s peace ends when the King dies That is true The King s peace dies with the King The custom then is that all laws are outlaw and men do what they will till the new King is chosen I will amend that said the King hotly I will have it so that though King son and grandson were all slain in one day still the King s peace should hold over all England What is a man that his mere death must upheave a people We must have the Law Truth said William of Exeter but that he would have said to any word of the King The two great barons behind said nothing This teaching was clean against their stomachs for when the King s peace ends the great barons go to war and increase their lands At that instant we heard Rahere s voice returning in a scurril Saxon rhyme against William of Exeter Well wist Wal wist where lay his fortune When that he fawned on the King for his crozier and amid our laughter he burst in with one arm round Hugh and one round the old pilgrim of Netherfield Here is your knight Brother said he and for the better disport of the company here is my fool Hold up Saxon Samson the gates of Gaza are clean carried away Hugh broke loose white and sick and staggered to my side the old man blinked upon the company We looked at the King but he smiled Rahere promised he would show me some sport after supper to cover his morning s offence said he to De Aquila So this is thy man Rahere Even so said Rahere My man he has been and my protection he has taken ever since I found him under the gallows at Stamford Bridge telling the kites atop of it that he was Harold of England There was a great silence upon these last strange words and Hugh hid his face on my shoulder woman fashion It is most cruel true he whispered to me The old man proved it to me at the beat after you left and again in our hut even now It is Harold my King De Aquila crept forward He walked about the man and swallowed Bones of the Saints said he staring Many a stray shot goes too well home said Rahere The old man flinched as at an arrow Why do you hurt me still he said in Saxon It was on some bones of some Saints that I promised I would give my England to the Great Duke He turns on us all crying shrilly Thanes he had caught me at Rouen a lifetime ago If I had not promised I should have lain there all my life What else could I have done I have lain in a strait prison all my life none the less There is no need to throw stones at me He guarded his face with his arms and shivered Now his madness will strike him down said Rahere Cast out the evil spirit one of you new bishops Said William of Exeter Harold was slain at Santlache fight All the world knows it I think this man must have forgotten said Rahere Be comforted Father Thou wast well slain at Hastings forty years gone less three months and nine days Tell the King The man uncovered his face I thought they would stone me he said I did not know I spoke before a King He came to his full towering height no mean man but frail beyond belief The King turned to the tables and held him out his own cup of wine The old man drank and beckoned behind him and before all the Normans my Hugh bore away the empty cup Saxon fashion upon the knee It is Harold said De Aquila His own stiff necked blood kneels to serve him Be it so said Henry Sit then thou that hast been Harold of England The madman sat and hard dark Henry looked at him between half shut eyes We others stared like oxen all but De Aquila who watched Rahere as I have seen him watch a far sail on the sea The wine and the warmth cast the old man into a dream His white head bowed his hands hung His eye indeed was opened but the mind was shut When he stretched his feet they were scurfed and road cut like a slave s Ah Rahere cried Hugh why hast thou shown him thus Better have let him die than shame him and me Shame thee said the King Would any baron of mine kneel to me if I were witless discrowned and alone and Harold had my throne No said Rahere I am the sole fool that might do it Brother unless he pointed at De Aquila whom he had only met that day yonder tough Norman crab kept me company But Sir Hugh I did not mean to shame him He hath been somewhat punished through maybe little fault of his own Yet he lied to my Father the Conqueror said the King and the old man flinched in his sleep Maybe said Rahere but thy Brother Robert whose throat we purpose soon to slit with our own hands Hutt said the King laughing I ll keep Robert at my table for a life s guest when I catch him Robert means no harm It is all his cursed barons None the less said Rahere Robert may say that thou hast not always spoken the stark truth to him about England I should not hang too many men on that bough Brother And it is certain said Hugh that he pointed to the old man Harold was forced to make his promise to the Great Duke Very strongly forced said De Aquila He had never any pride in the Duke William s dealings with Harold before Hastings Yet as he said one cannot build a house all of straight sticks No matter how he was forced said Henry England was promised to my Father William by Edward the Confessor Is it not so William of Exeter nodded Harold confirmed that promise to my Father on the bones of the Saints Afterwards he broke his oath and would have taken England by the strong hand Oh La La Rahere rolled up his eyes like a girl That ever England should be taken by the strong hand Seeing that Red William and Henry after him had each in just that fashion snatched England from Robert of Normandy we others knew not where to look But De Aquila saved us quickly Promise kept or promise broken he said Harold came near enough to breaking us Normans at Santlache Was it so close a fight then said Henry A hair would have turned it either way De Aquila answered His house carles stood like rocks against rain Where wast thou Hugh in it Among Godwin s folk beneath the Golden Dragon till your front gave back and we broke our ranks to follow said Hugh But I bade you stand I bade you stand I knew it was all a deceit Harold had waked and leaned forward as one crying from the grave Ah now we see how the traitor himself was betrayed said William of Exeter and looked for a smile from the King I made thee Bishop to preach at my bidding said Henry and turning to Harold Tell us here how thy people fought us said he Their sons serve me now against my Brother Robert The old man shook his head cunningly Na Na Na he cried I know better Every time I tell my tale men stone me But Thanes I will tell you a greater thing Listen He told us how many paces it was from some Saxon Saint s shrine to another shrine and how many more back to the Abbey of the Battle Ay said he I have trodden it too often to be out even ten paces I move very swiftly Harold of Norway knows that and so does Tostig my brother They lie at ease at Stamford Bridge and from Stamford Bridge to the Battle Abbey it is he muttered over many numbers and forgot us Ay said De Aquila all in a muse That man broke Harold of Norway at Stamford Bridge and came near to breaking us at Santlache all within one month But how did he come alive from Santlache fight asked the King Ask him Hast thou heard it Rahere Never He says he has been stoned too often for telling the tale But he can count you off Saxon and Norman shrines till daylight said Rahere and the old man nodded proudly My faith said Henry after a while I think even my Father the Great Duke would pity if he could see him How if he does see said Rahere Hugh covered his face with his sound hand Ah why hast thou shamed him he cried again to Rahere No no says the old man reaching to pluck at Rahere s cape I am Rahere s man None stone me now and he played with the bells on the scollops of it How if he had been brought to me when you found him said the King to Rahere You would have held him prisoner again as the Great Duke did Rahere answered True said our King He is nothing except his name Yet that name might have been used by stronger men to trouble my England Yes I must have made him my life s guest as I shall make Robert I knew it said Rahere But while this man wandered mad by the wayside none cared what he called himself I learned to cease talking before the stones flew says the old man and Hugh groaned Ye have heard said Rahere Witless landless nameless and but for my protection masterless he can still make shift to bide his doom under the open sky Then wherefore didst thou bring him here for a mock and a shame cried Hugh beside himself with woe A right mock and a just shame said William of Exeter Not to me said Nigel of Ely I see and I tremble but I neither mock nor judge Well spoken Ely Rahere falls into the pure fool again I ll pray for thee when I turn monk Thou hast given thy blessing on a war between two most Christian brothers He meant the war forward twixt Henry and Robert of Normandy I charge you Brother he says wheeling on the King dost thou mock my fool The King shook his head and so then did smooth William of Exeter De Aquila does thou mock him Rahere jingled from one to another and the old man smiled By the Bones of the Saints not I said our Lord of Pevensey I know how dooms near he broke us at Santlache Sir Hugh you are excused the question But you valiant loyal honourable and devout barons Lords of Man s justice in your own bounds do you mock my fool He shook his bauble in the very faces of those two barons whose names I have forgotten Na Na they said and waved him back foolishly enough He hies him across to staring nodding Harold and speaks from behind his chair No man mocks thee Who here judges this man Henry of England Nigel De Aquila On your souls swift with the answer he cried None answered We were all the King not least over borne by that terrible scarlet and black wizard jester Well for your souls he said wiping his brow Next shrill like a woman Oh come to me and Hugh ran forward to hold Harold that had slidden down in the chair Hearken said Rahere his arm round Harold s neck The King his bishops the knights all the world s crazy chessboard neither mock nor judge thee Take that comfort with thee Harold of England Hugh heaved the old man up and he smiled Good comfort said Harold Tell me again I have been somewhat punished Rahere hallooed it once more into his ear as the head rolled We heard him sigh and Nigel of Ely stood forth praying aloud Out I will have no Norman Harold said as clearly as I speak now and he refuged himself on Hugh s sound shoulder and stretched out and lay all still Dead said Una turning up a white face in the dusk That was his good fortune To die in the King s presence and on the breast of the most gentlest truest knight of his own house Some of us envied him said Sir Richard and fell back to take Swallow s bridle Turn left here Puck called ahead of them from under an oak They ducked down a narrow path through close ash plantation The children hurried forward but cutting a corner charged full abreast into the thorn faggot that old Hobden was carrying home on his back My My said he Have you scratted your face Miss Una Sorry It s all right said Una rubbing her nose How many rabbits did you get today That s tellin the old man grinned as he re hoisted his faggot I reckon Mus Ridley he ve got rheumatism along o lyin in the dik to see I didn t snap up any Think o that now They laughed a good deal while he told them the tale An just as he crawled away I heard some one hollerin to the hounds in our woods said he Didn t you hear You must ha been asleep sure ly Oh what about the sleeper you promised to show us Dan cried Ere he be house an all Hobden dived into the prickly heart of the faggot and took out a dormouse s wonderfully woven nest of grass and leaves His blunt fingers parted it as if it had been precious lace and tilting it toward the last of the light he showed the little red furry chap curled up inside his tail between his eyes that were shut for their winter sleep Let s take him home Don t breathe on him said Una It ll make him warm and he ll wake up and die straight off Won t he Hobby Dat s a heap better by my reckonin than wakin up and findin himself in a cage for life No We ll lay him into the bottom o this hedge Dat s jus right No more trouble for him till come Spring An now we ll go home A Carol Our Lord Who did the Ox command To kneel to Judah s King He binds His frost upon the land To ripen it for Spring To ripen it for Spring good sirs According to His word Which well must be as ye can see And who shall judge the Lord When we poor fenmen skate the ice Or shiver on the wold We hear the cry of a single tree That breaks her heart in the cold That breaks her heart in the cold good sirs And rendeth by the board Which well must be as ye can see And who shall judge the Lord Her wood is crazed and little worth Excepting as to burn That we may warm and make our mirth Until the Spring return Until the Spring return good sirs When people walk abroad Which well must be as ye can see And who shall judge the Lord God bless the master of this house And all that sleep therein And guard the fens from pirate folk And keep us
