4734_220951_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Nature is that condition that reality which in appearance consists in life and death or in other words in the composition and decomposition of all things 
none	none	This Nature is subjected to an absolute organization to determined laws to a complete order and a finished design from which it will never depart to such a degree indeed that if you look carefully and with keen sight from the smallest invisible atom up to such large bodies of the world of existence as the globe of the sun or the other great stars and luminous spheres whether you regard their arrangement their composition their form or their movement you will find that all are in the highest degree of organization and are under one law from which they will never depart 
4734_220951_000004_000000	train-clean-360	But when you look at Nature itself you see that it has no intelligence no will 
4734_220951_000004_000001	train-clean-360	For instance the nature of fire is to burn it burns without will or intelligence 
4734_220951_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The nature of water is fluidity it flows without will or intelligence 
4734_220951_000004_000003	train-clean-360	The nature of the sun is radiance it shines without will or intelligence 
4734_220951_000004_000004	train-clean-360	The nature of vapor is to ascend it ascends without will or intelligence 
4734_220951_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Thus it is clear that the natural movements of all things are compelled there are no voluntary movements except those of animals and above all those of man 
none	none	Man is able to resist and to oppose Nature because he discovers the constitution of things and through this he commands the forces of Nature all the inventions he has made are due to his discovery of the constitution of things 
4734_220951_000004_000007	train-clean-360	For example he invented the telegraph which is the means of communication between the East and the West 
none	none	It is evident then that man rules over Nature 
4734_220951_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Now when you behold in existence such organizations arrangements and laws can you say that all these are the effect of Nature though Nature has neither intelligence nor perception 
4734_220951_000005_000001	train-clean-360	If not it becomes evident that this Nature which has neither perception nor intelligence is in the grasp of Almighty God Who is the Ruler of the world of Nature whatever He wishes He causes Nature to manifest 
4734_220951_000006_000000	train-clean-360	One of the things which has appeared in the world of existence and which is one of the requirements of Nature is human life 
4734_220951_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Considered from this point of view man is the branch nature is the root 
none	none	Then can the will and the intelligence and the perfections which exist in the branch be absent in the root It is said that Nature in its own essence is in the grasp of the power of God Who is the Eternal Almighty One He holds Nature within accurate regulations and laws and rules over it one two PROOFS AND EVIDENCES OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD 
4734_220951_000009_000000	train-clean-360	One of the proofs and demonstrations of the existence of God is the fact that man did not create himself nay his creator and designer is another than himself 
4734_220951_000010_000000	train-clean-360	It is certain and indisputable that the creator of man is not like man because a powerless creature cannot create another being 
4734_220951_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The maker the creator has to possess all perfections in order that he may create 
4734_220951_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Can the creation be perfect and the creator imperfect 
4734_220951_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Can a picture be a masterpiece and the painter imperfect in his art 
4734_220951_000011_000002	train-clean-360	For it is his art and his creation 
4734_220951_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Moreover the picture cannot be like the painter otherwise the painting would have created itself 
4734_220951_000011_000004	train-clean-360	However perfect the picture may be in comparison with the painter it is in the utmost degree of imperfection 
none	none	The contingent world is the source of imperfections God is the origin of perfections 
4734_220951_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The imperfections of the contingent world are in themselves a proof of the perfections of God 
4734_220951_000013_000000	train-clean-360	For example when you look at man you see that he is weak 
none	none	This very weakness of the creature is a proof of the power of the Eternal Almighty One because if there were no power weakness could not be imagined Then the weakness of the creature is a proof of the power of God for if there were no power there could be no weakness so from this weakness it becomes evident that there is power in the world Again in the contingent world there is poverty then necessarily wealth exists since poverty is apparent in the world 
4734_220951_000013_000004	train-clean-360	In the contingent world there is ignorance necessarily knowledge exists because ignorance is found for if there were no knowledge neither would there be ignorance 
none	none	Ignorance is the nonexistence of knowledge and if there were no existence nonexistence could not be realized It is certain that the whole contingent world is subjected to a law and rule which it can never disobey even man is forced to submit to death to sleep and to other conditions that is to say man in certain particulars is governed and necessarily this state of being governed implies the existence of a governor 
4734_220951_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Because a characteristic of contingent beings is dependency and this dependency is an essential necessity therefore there must be an independent being whose independence is essential 
none	none	In the same way it is understood from the man who is sick that there must be one who is in health for if there were no health his sickness could not be proved Therefore it becomes evident that there is an Eternal Almighty One Who is the possessor of all perfections because unless He possessed all perfections He would be like His creation 
4734_220951_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Throughout the world of existence it is the same the smallest created thing proves that there is a creator 
4734_220951_000017_000001	train-clean-360	For instance this piece of bread proves that it has a maker 
4734_220951_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Praise be to God the least change produced in the form of the smallest thing proves the existence of a creator then can this great universe which is endless be self created and come into existence from the action of matter and the elements 
none	none	How self evidently wrong is such a supposition 
4734_220951_000019_000000	train-clean-360	These obvious arguments are adduced for weak souls but if the inner perception be open a hundred thousand clear proofs become visible 
none	none	Thus when man feels the indwelling spirit he is in no need of arguments for its existence but for those who are deprived of the bounty of the spirit it is necessary to establish external arguments three THE NEED OF AN EDUCATOR 
4734_220951_000021_000000	train-clean-360	When we consider existence we see that the mineral vegetable animal and human worlds are all in need of an educator 
4734_220951_000022_000000	train-clean-360	If the earth is not cultivated it becomes a jungle where useless weeds grow but if a cultivator comes and tills the ground it produces crops which nourish living creatures 
4734_220951_000022_000001	train-clean-360	It is evident therefore that the soil needs the cultivation of the farmer 
none	none	Consider the trees if they remain without a cultivator they will be fruitless and without fruit they are useless but if they receive the care of a gardener these same barren trees become fruitful and through cultivation fertilization and engrafting the trees which had bitter fruits yield sweet fruits 
4734_220951_000022_000003	train-clean-360	These are rational proofs in this age the peoples of the world need the arguments of reason 
none	none	The same is true with respect to animals notice that when the animal is trained it becomes domestic and also that man if he is left without education becomes bestial and moreover if left under the rule of nature becomes lower than an animal whereas if he is educated he becomes an angel For the greater number of animals do not devour their own kind but men in the Sudan in the central regions of Africa kill and eat each other Now reflect that it is education that brings the East and the West under the authority of man it is education that produces wonderful industries it is education that spreads great sciences and arts it is education that makes manifest new discoveries and institutions If there were no educator there would be no such things as comforts civilization or humanity 
4734_220951_000024_000002	train-clean-360	If a man be left alone in a wilderness where he sees none of his own kind he will undoubtedly become a mere brute it is then clear that an educator is needed 
4734_220951_000025_000000	train-clean-360	But education is of three kinds material human and spiritual 
none	none	Material education is concerned with the progress and development of the body through gaining its sustenance its material comfort and ease This education is common to animals and man Human education signifies civilization and progress that is to say government administration charitable works trades arts and handicrafts sciences great inventions and discoveries and elaborate institutions which are the activities essential to man as distinguished from the animal Divine education is that of the Kingdom of God it consists in acquiring divine perfections and this is true education for in this state man becomes the focus of divine blessings the manifestation of the words Let Us make man in Our image and after Our likeness two This is the goal of the world of humanity 
4734_220951_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Now we need an educator who will be at the same time a material human and spiritual educator and whose authority will be effective in all conditions 
none	none	So if anyone should say I possess perfect comprehension and intelligence and I have no need of such an educator he would be denying that which is clear and evident as though a child should say I have no need of education I will act according to my reason and intelligence and so I shall attain the perfections of existence or as though the blind should say I am in no need of sight because many other blind people exist without difficulty Then it is plain and evident that man needs an educator and this educator must be unquestionably and indubitably perfect in all respects and distinguished above all men Otherwise if he should be like the rest of humanity he could not be their educator more particularly because he must be at the same time their material and human as well as their spiritual educator that is to say he must teach men to organize and carry out physical matters and to form a social order in order to establish cooperation and mutual aid in living so that material affairs may be organized and regulated for any circumstances that may occur In the same way he must establish human education that is to say he must educate intelligence and thought in such a way that they may attain complete development so that knowledge and science may increase and the reality of things the mysteries of beings and the properties of existence may be discovered that day by day instructions inventions and institutions may be improved and from things perceptible to the senses conclusions as to intellectual things may be deduced 
4734_220951_000030_000000	train-clean-360	He must also impart spiritual education so that intelligence and comprehension may penetrate the metaphysical world and may receive benefit from the sanctifying breeze of the Holy Spirit and may enter into relationship with the Supreme Concourse 
none	none	He must so educate the human reality that it may become the center of the divine appearance to such a degree that the attributes and the names of God shall be resplendent in the mirror of the reality of man and the holy verse We will make man in Our image and likeness shall be realized three It is clear that human power is not able to fill such a great office and that reason alone could not undertake the responsibility of so great a mission 
4734_220951_000031_000001	train-clean-360	How can one solitary person without help and without support lay the foundations of such a noble construction 
none	none	He must depend on the help of the spiritual and divine power to be able to undertake this mission One Holy Soul gives life to the world of humanity changes the aspect of the terrestrial globe causes intelligence to progress vivifies souls lays the basis of a new life establishes new foundations organizes the world brings nations and religions under the shadow of one standard delivers man from the world of imperfections and vices and inspires him with the desire and need of natural and acquired perfections 
4734_220951_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Certainly nothing short of a divine power could accomplish so great a work 
4734_220951_000031_000004	train-clean-360	We ought to consider this with justice for this is the office of justice 
4734_220951_000032_000000	train-clean-360	A Cause which all the governments and peoples of the world with all their powers and armies cannot promulgate and spread one Holy Soul can promote without help or support 
4734_220951_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Can this be done by human power 
4734_220951_000032_000002	train-clean-360	No in the name of God 
6385_220959_000006_000001	train-clean-100	No in the name of God 
none	none	For example Christ alone and solitary upraised the standard of peace and righteousness a work which all the victorious governments with all their hosts are unable to accomplish Consider what was the fate of so many and diverse empires and peoples the Roman Empire France Germany Russia England et cetera all were gathered together under the same tent that is to say the appearance of Christ brought about a union among these diverse nations some of whom under the influence of Christianity became so united that they sacrificed their lives and property for one another After the time of Constantine who was the protagonist of Christianity divisions broke out among them The point is this that Christ united these nations but after a while governments became the cause of discord What I mean is that Christ sustained a Cause that all the kings of the earth could not establish He united the various religions and modified ancient customs Consider what great differences existed between Romans Greeks Syrians Egyptians Phoenicians Israelites and other peoples of Europe Christ removed these differences and became the cause of love between these communities Although after some time governments destroyed this union the work of Christ was accomplished Therefore the Universal Educator must be at the same time a physical human and spiritual educator and He must possess a supernatural power so that He may hold the position of a divine teacher 
4734_220951_000033_000001	train-clean-360	If He does not show forth such a holy power He will not be able to educate for if He be imperfect how can He give a perfect education 
4734_220951_000033_000002	train-clean-360	If He be ignorant how can He make others wise 
4734_220951_000033_000003	train-clean-360	If He be unjust how can He make others just 
4734_220951_000033_000004	train-clean-360	If He be earthly how can He make others heavenly 
none	none	Now we must consider justly did these Divine Manifestations Who have appeared possess all these qualifications or not four If They had not these qualifications and these perfections They were not real Educators 
4734_220951_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Therefore it must be our task to prove to the thoughtful by reasonable arguments the prophethood of Moses of Christ and of the other Divine Manifestations 
none	none	And the proofs and evidences which we give are not based on traditional but on rational arguments It has now been proved by rational arguments that the world of existence is in the utmost need of an educator and that its education must be achieved by divine power There is no doubt that this holy power is revelation and that the world must be educated through this power which is above human power four ABRAHAM One of those Who possessed this power and was assisted by it was Abraham And the proof of it was that He was born in Mesopotamia and of a family who were ignorant of the Oneness of God 
4734_220952_000002_000001	train-clean-360	He opposed His own nation and people and even His own family by rejecting all their gods 
4734_220952_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Alone and without help He resisted a powerful tribe a task which is neither simple nor easy 
none	none	It is as if in this day someone were to go to a Christian people who are attached to the Bible and deny Christ or in the Papal Court God forbid if such a one were in the most powerful manner to blaspheme against Christ and oppose the people 
4734_220952_000003_000000	train-clean-360	These people believed not in one God but in many gods to whom they ascribed miracles therefore they all arose against Him and no one supported Him except Lot His brother s son and one or two other people of no importance 
none	none	At last reduced to the utmost distress by the opposition of His enemies He was obliged to leave His native land 
4734_220952_000003_000002	train-clean-360	In reality they banished Him in order that He might be crushed and destroyed and that no trace of Him might be left 
none	none	Abraham then came into the region of the Holy Land His enemies considered that His exile would lead to His destruction and ruin as it seemed impossible that a man banished from His native land deprived of His rights and oppressed on all sides even though He were a king could escape extermination But Abraham stood fast and showed forth extraordinary firmness and God made this exile to be to His eternal honor until He established the Unity of God in the midst of a polytheistic generation This exile became the cause of the progress of the descendants of Abraham and the Holy Land was given to them 
4734_220952_000004_000003	train-clean-360	As a result the teachings of Abraham were spread abroad a Jacob appeared among His posterity and a Joseph who became ruler in Egypt 
4734_220952_000004_000004	train-clean-360	In consequence of His exile a Moses and a being like Christ were manifested from His posterity and Hagar was found from whom Ishmael was born one of whose descendants was Muhammad 
none	none	In consequence of His exile the Bab appeared from His posterity five and the Prophets of Israel were numbered among the descendants of Abraham 
4734_220952_000004_000006	train-clean-360	And so it will continue for ever and ever 
none	none	Finally in consequence of His exile the whole of Europe and most of Asia came under the protecting shadow of the God of Israel 
4734_220952_000004_000008	train-clean-360	See what a power it is that enabled a Man Who was a fugitive from His country to found such a family to establish such a faith and to promulgate such teachings 
none	none	Can anyone say that all this occurred accidentally 
4734_220952_000004_000010	train-clean-360	We must be just was this Man an Educator or not 
none	none	Since the exile of Abraham from Ur to Aleppo in Syria produced this result we must consider what will be the effect of the exile of Baha u llah in His several removes from Tihran to Ba gh dad from thence to Constantinople to Rumelia and to the Holy Land See what a perfect Educator Abraham was five MOSES 
4734_220952_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Moses was for a long time a shepherd in the wilderness 
none	none	Regarded outwardly He was a Man brought up in a tyrannical household and was known among men as One Who had committed a murder and become a shepherd By the government and the people of Pharaoh He was much hated and detested 
4734_220952_000009_000000	train-clean-360	It was such a Man as this that freed a great nation from the chains of captivity made them contented brought them out from Egypt and led them to the Holy Land 
4734_220952_000010_000000	train-clean-360	This people from the depths of degradation were lifted up to the height of glory 
4734_220952_000010_000001	train-clean-360	They were captive they became free 
4734_220952_000010_000002	train-clean-360	They were the most ignorant of peoples they became the most wise 
none	none	As the result of the institutions that Moses gave them they attained a position which entitled them to honor among all nations and their fame spread to all lands to such a degree indeed that among surrounding nations if one wished to praise a man one said Surely he is an Israelite Moses established laws and ordinances these gave life to the people of Israel and led them to the highest possible degree of civilization at that period To such a development did they attain that the philosophers of Greece would come and acquire knowledge from the learned men of Israel Such an one was Socrates who visited Syria and took from the children of Israel the teachings of the Unity of God and of the immortality of the soul After his return to Greece he promulgated these teachings 
4734_220952_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Later the people of Greece rose in opposition to him accused him of impiety arraigned him before the Areopagus and condemned him to death by poison 
4734_220952_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Now how could a Man Who was a stammerer Who had been brought up in the house of Pharaoh Who was known among men as a murderer Who through fear had for a long time remained in concealment and Who had become a shepherd establish so great a Cause when the wisest philosophers on earth have not displayed one thousandth part of this influence 
4734_220952_000012_000001	train-clean-360	This is indeed a prodigy 
4734_220952_000013_000000	train-clean-360	A Man Who had a stammering tongue Who could not even converse correctly succeeded in sustaining this great Cause 
none	none	If He had not been assisted by divine power He would never have been able to carry out this great work These facts are undeniable Materialist philosophers Greek thinkers the great men of Rome became famous in the world each one of them having specialized in one branch of learning only Thus Galen and Hippocrates became celebrated in medicine Aristotle in logic and reasoning and Plato in ethics and theology 
4734_220952_000013_000004	train-clean-360	How is it that a shepherd could acquire all of this knowledge 
4734_220952_000013_000005	train-clean-360	It is beyond doubt that He must have been assisted by an omnipotent power

4734_220952_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Briefly this Man Who apparently and in the eyes of all was lowly arose with such great power that He abolished a religion that had lasted fifteen hundred years at a time when the slightest deviation from it exposed the offender to danger or to death 
4734_220952_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Moreover in the days of Christ the morals of the whole world and the condition of the Israelites had become completely confused and corrupted and Israel had fallen into a state of the utmost degradation misery and bondage

none	none	Then it becomes clear and evident that this Glorious Being was a true Educator of the world of humanity and that He was helped and confirmed by divine power seven MUHAMMAD Now we come to Muhammad Americans and Europeans have heard a number of stories about the Prophet which they have thought to be true although the narrators were either ignorant or antagonistic most of them were clergy others were ignorant Muslims who repeated unfounded traditions about Muhammad which they ignorantly believed to be to His praise Thus some benighted Muslims made His polygamy the pivot of their praises and held it to be a wonder regarding it as a miracle and European historians for the most part rely on the tales of these ignorant people For example a foolish man said to a clergyman that the true proof of greatness is bravery and the shedding of blood and that in one day on the field of battle a follower of Muhammad had cut off the heads of one hundred men This misled the clergyman to infer that killing is considered the way to prove one s faith to Muhammad while this is merely imaginary The military expeditions of Muhammad on the contrary were always defensive actions a proof of this is that during thirteen years in Mecca He and His followers endured the most violent persecutions At this period they were the target for the arrows of hatred some of His companions were killed and their property confiscated others fled to foreign lands Muhammad Himself after the most extreme persecutions by the Quray sh ites who finally resolved to kill Him fled to Medina in the middle of the night Yet even then His enemies did not cease their persecutions but pursued Him to Medina and His disciples even to Abyssinia These Arab tribes were in the lowest depths of savagery and barbarism and in comparison with them the savages of Africa and wild Indians of America were as advanced as a Plato The savages of America do not bury their children alive as these Arabs did their daughters glorying in it as being an honorable thing to do seven Thus many of the men would threaten their wives saying If a daughter is born to you I will kill you Even down to the present time the Arabs dread having daughters Further a man was permitted to take a thousand women and most husbands had more than ten wives in their household When these tribes made war the one which was victorious would take the women and children of the vanquished tribe captive and treat them as slaves When a man who had ten wives died the sons of these women rushed at each other s mothers and if one of the sons threw his mantle over the head of his father s wife and cried out This woman is my lawful property at once the unfortunate woman became his prisoner and slave He could do whatever he wished with her He could kill her imprison her in a well or beat curse and torture her until death released her According to the Arab habits and customs he was her master It is evident that malignity jealousy hatred and enmity must have existed between the wives and children of a household and it is therefore needless to enlarge upon the subject Again consider what was the condition and life of these oppressed women Moreover the means by which these Arab tribes lived consisted in pillage and robbery so that they were perpetually engaged in fighting and war killing one another plundering and devastating each other s property and capturing women and children whom they would sell to strangers How often it happened that the daughters and sons of a prince who spent their day in comfort and luxury found themselves when night fell reduced to shame poverty and captivity Yesterday they were princes today they are captives yesterday they were great ladies today they are slaves Muhammad received the Divine Revelation among these tribes and after enduring thirteen years of persecution from them He fled eight But this people did not cease to oppress they united to exterminate Him and all His followers It was under such circumstances that Muhammad was forced to take up arms This is the truth we are not bigoted and do not wish to defend Him but we are just and we say what is just Look at it with justice If Christ Himself had been placed in such circumstances among such tyrannical and barbarous tribes and if for thirteen years He with His disciples had endured all these trials with patience culminating in flight from His native land if in spite of this these lawless tribes continued to pursue Him to slaughter the men to pillage their property and to capture their women and children what would have been Christ s conduct with regard to them If this oppression had fallen only upon Himself He would have forgiven them and such an act of forgiveness would have been most praiseworthy but if He had seen that these cruel and bloodthirsty murderers wished to kill to pillage and to injure all these oppressed ones and to take captive the women and children it is certain that He would have protected them and would have resisted the tyrants What objection then can be taken to Muhammad s action Is it this that He did not with His followers and their women and children submit to these savage tribes To free these tribes from their bloodthirstiness was the greatest kindness and to coerce and restrain them was a true mercy They were like a man holding in his hand a cup of poison which when about to drink a friend breaks and thus saves him If Christ had been placed in similar circumstances it is certain that with a conquering power He would have delivered the men women and children from the claws of these bloodthirsty wolves Muhammad never fought against the Christians on the contrary He treated them kindly and gave them perfect freedom A community of Christian people lived at Najran and were under His care and protection Muhammad said If anyone infringes their rights I Myself will be his enemy and in the presence of God I will bring a charge against him In the edicts which He promulgated it is clearly stated that the lives properties and honor of the Christians and Jews are under the protection of God and that if a Muhammadan married a Christian woman the husband must not prevent her from going to church nor oblige her to veil herself and that if she died he must place her remains in the care of the Christian clergy Should the Christians desire to build a church Islam ought to help them In case of war between Islam and her enemies the Christians should be exempted from the obligation of fighting unless they desired of their own free will to do so in defense of Islam because they were under its protection But as a compensation for this immunity they should pay yearly a small sum of money In short there are seven detailed edicts on these subjects some copies of which are still extant at Jerusalem This is an established fact and is not dependent on my affirmation The edict of the second Caliph nine still exists in the custody of the orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem and of this there is no doubt ten Nevertheless after a certain time and through the transgression of both the Muhammadans and the Christians hatred and enmity arose between them Beyond this fact all the narrations of the Muslims Christians and others are simply fabrications which have their origin in fanaticism or ignorance or emanate from intense hostility For example the Muslims say that Muhammad cleft the moon and that it fell on the mountain of Mecca they think that the moon is a small body which Muhammad divided into two parts and threw one part on this mountain and the other part on another mountain Such stories are pure fanaticism Also the traditions which the clergy quote and the incidents with which they find fault are all exaggerated if not entirely without foundation Briefly Muhammad appeared in the desert of Hijaz in the Arabian Peninsula which was a desolate sterile wilderness sandy and uninhabited Some parts like Mecca and Medina are extremely hot the people are nomads with the manners and customs of the dwellers in the desert and are entirely destitute of education and science Muhammad Himself was illiterate and the Qur an was originally written upon the bladebones of sheep or on palm leaves These details indicate the condition of the people to whom Muhammad was sent The first question which He put to them was Why do you not accept the Pentateuch and the Gospel and why do you not believe in Christ and in Moses This saying presented difficulties to them and they argued Our forefathers did not believe in the Pentateuch and the Gospel tell us why was this He answered They were misled you ought to reject those who do not believe in the Pentateuch and the Gospel even though they are your fathers and your ancestors In such a country and amidst such barbarous tribes an illiterate Man produced a book in which in a perfect and eloquent style He explained the divine attributes and perfections the prophethood of the Messengers of God the divine laws and some scientific facts Thus you know that before the observations of modern times that is to say during the first centuries and down to the fifteenth century of the Christian era all the mathematicians of the world agreed that the earth was the center of the universe and that the sun moved The famous astronomer who was the protagonist of the new theory discovered the movement of the earth and the immobility of the sun eleven Until his time all the astronomers and philosophers of the world followed the Ptolemaic system and whoever said anything against it was considered ignorant Though Pythagoras and Plato during the latter part of his life adopted the theory that the annual movement of the sun around the zodiac does not proceed from the sun but rather from the movement of the earth around the sun this theory had been entirely forgotten and the Ptolemaic system was accepted by all mathematicians But there are some verses revealed in the Qur an contrary to the theory of the Ptolemaic system One of them is The sun moves in a fixed place which shows the fixity of the sun and its movement around an axis twelve Again in another verse And each star moves in its own heaven thirteen Thus is explained the movement of the sun of the moon of the earth and of other bodies When the Qur an appeared all the mathematicians ridiculed these statements and attributed the theory to ignorance Even the doctors of Islam when they saw that these verses were contrary to the accepted Ptolemaic system were obliged to explain them away It was not until after the fifteenth century of the Christian era nearly nine hundred years after Muhammad that a famous astronomer made new observations and important discoveries by the aid of the telescope which he had invented fourteen The rotation of the earth the fixity of the sun and also its movement around an axis were discovered It became evident that the verses of the Qur an agreed with existing facts and that the Ptolemaic system was imaginary In short many Oriental peoples have been reared for thirteen centuries under the shadow of the religion of Muhammad During the Middle Ages while Europe was in the lowest depths of barbarism the Arab peoples were superior to the other nations of the earth in learning in the arts mathematics civilization government and other sciences The Enlightener and Educator of these Arab tribes and the Founder of the civilization and perfections of humanity among these different races was an illiterate Man Muhammad Was this illustrious Man a thorough Educator or not A just judgment is necessary eight THE BAB As for the Bab may my soul be His sacrifice at a youthful age that is to say when He had reached the twenty fifth year of His blessed life He stood forth to proclaim His Cause fifteen It was universally admitted by the Sh i is that He had never studied in any school and had not acquired knowledge from any teacher all the people of Sh iraz bear witness to this Nevertheless He suddenly appeared before the people endowed with the most complete erudition Although He was but a merchant He confounded all the ulama of Persia sixteen All alone in a way which is beyond imagination He upheld the Cause among the Persians who are renowned for their religious fanaticism This illustrious Soul arose with such power that He shook the supports of the religion of the morals the conditions the habits and the customs of Persia and instituted new rules new laws and a new religion Though the great personages of the State nearly all the clergy and the public men arose to destroy and annihilate Him He alone withstood them and moved the whole of Persia Many ulama and public men as well as other people joyfully sacrificed their lives in His Cause and hastened to the plain of martyrdom The government the nation the doctors of divinity and the great personages desired to extinguish His light but they could not do so At last His moon arose His star shone forth His foundations became firmly established and His dawning place became brilliant He imparted divine education to an unenlightened multitude and produced marvelous results on the thoughts morals customs and conditions of the Persians He announced the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Sun of Baha to His followers and prepared them to believe The appearance of such wonderful signs and great results the effects produced upon the minds of the people and upon the prevailing ideas the establishment of the foundations of progress and the organization of the principles of success and prosperity by a young merchant constitute the greatest proof that He was a perfect Educator A just person will never hesitate to believe this nine BAHA U LLAH Baha u llah seventeen appeared at a time when the Persian Empire was immersed in profound obscurantism and ignorance and lost in the blindest fanaticism In the European histories no doubt you have read detailed accounts of the morals customs and ideas of the Persians during the last centuries It is useless to repeat them Briefly we will say that Persia had fallen so low that to all foreign travelers it was a matter of regret that this country which in former times had been so glorious and highly civilized had now become so decayed ruined and upset and that its population had lost its dignity It was at this time that Baha u llah appeared His father was one of the viziers not one of the ulama As all the people of Persia know He had never studied in any school nor had He associated with the ulama or the men of learning The early part of His life was passed in the greatest happiness His companions and associates were Persians of the highest rank but not learned men As soon as the Bab became manifested Baha u llah said This great Man is the Lord of the righteous and faith in Him is incumbent upon all And He arose to assist the Bab and gave many proofs and positive evidences of His truth in spite of the fact that the ulama of the state religion had constrained the Persian government to oppose and resist Him and had further issued decrees ordering the massacre pillage persecution and expulsion of His followers In all the provinces they began to kill to burn to pillage the converts and even to assault the women and children Regardless of this Baha u llah arose to proclaim the word of the Bab with the greatest firmness and energy Not for one moment was He in concealment He mixed openly with His enemies He was occupied in showing forth evidences and proofs and was recognized as the Herald of the Word of God In many changes and chances He endured the greatest misfortunes and at every moment He ran the risk of being martyred He was put into chains and confined in an underground prison His vast property and inheritance were pillaged and confiscated He was exiled four times from land to land and found rest only in the Greatest Prison eighteen In spite of all this He never ceased for one instant His proclamation of the greatness of the Cause of God He manifested such virtue knowledge and perfections that He became a wonder to all the people of Persia So much so that in Tihran Ba gh dad Constantinople Rumelia and even in Akka every one of the learned and scientific men who entered His presence whether friend or enemy never failed to receive the most sufficient and convincing answer to whatever question was propounded All frequently acknowledged that He was alone and unique in all perfections It often happened that in Ba gh dad certain Muhammadan ulama Jewish rabbis and Christians met together with some European scholars in a blessed reunion each one had some question to propose and although they were possessed of varying degrees of culture they each heard a sufficient and convincing reply and retired satisfied Even the Persian ulama who were at Karbila and Najaf chose a wise man whom they sent on a mission to Him his name was Mulla Hasan Amu He came into the Holy Presence and proposed a number of questions on behalf of the ulama to which Baha u llah replied Then Hasan Amu said The ulama recognize without hesitation and confess the knowledge and virtue of Baha u llah and they are unanimously convinced that in all learning he has no peer or equal and it is also evident that he has never studied or acquired this learning but still the ulama say We are not contented with this we do not acknowledge the reality of his mission by virtue of his wisdom and righteousness Therefore we ask him to show us a miracle in order to satisfy and tranquilize our hearts Baha u llah replied Although you have no right to ask this for God should test His creatures and they should not test God still I allow and accept this request But the Cause of God is not a theatrical display that is presented every hour of which some new diversion may be asked for every day If it were thus the Cause of God would become mere child s play The ulamas must therefore assemble and with one accord choose one miracle and write that after the performance of this miracle they will no longer entertain doubts about Me and that all will acknowledge and confess the truth of My Cause Let them seal this paper and bring it to Me This must be the accepted criterion if the miracle is performed no doubt will remain for them and if not We shall be convicted of imposture The learned man Hasan Amu rose and replied There is no more to be said he then kissed the knee of the Blessed One although he was not a believer and went He gathered the ulama and gave them the sacred message They consulted together and said This man is an enchanter perhaps he will perform an enchantment and then we shall have nothing more to say Acting on this belief they did not dare to push the matter further nineteen This man Hasan Amu mentioned this fact at many meetings After leaving Karbila he went to Kirman sh ah and Tihran and spread a detailed account of it everywhere laying emphasis on the fear and the withdrawal of the ulama Briefly all His adversaries in the Orient acknowledged His greatness grandeur knowledge and virtue and though they were His enemies they always spoke of Him as the renowned Baha u llah At the time when this great Light suddenly arose upon the horizon of Persia all the people the ministers the ulama and men of other classes rose against Him pursuing Him with the greatest animosity and proclaiming that this man wishes to suppress and destroy the religion the law the nation and the empire The same was said of Christ But Baha u llah alone and without support resisted them all without ever showing the least weakness At last they said As long as this man is in Persia there will be no peace and tranquillity we must banish him so that Persia may return to a state of quietude They proceeded to use violence toward Him to oblige Him to ask for permission to leave Persia thinking that by this means the light of His truth would be extinguished but the result was quite the contrary The Cause became magnified and its flame more intense At first it spread throughout Persia only but the exile of Baha u llah caused the diffusion of the Cause throughout other countries Afterward His enemies said Iraq i Arab twenty is not far enough from Persia we must send him to a more distant kingdom This is why the Persian government determined to send Baha u llah from Iraq to Constantinople Again the event proved that the Cause was not in the least weakened Once more they said Constantinople is a place of passage and of sojourn for various races and peoples among them are many Persians For this reason the Persians had Him further exiled to Rumelia but when there the flame became more powerful and the Cause more exalted At last the Persians said Not one of these places is safe from his influence we must send him to some place where he will be reduced to powerlessness and where his family and followers will have to submit to the direst afflictions So they chose the prison of Akka which is reserved especially for murderers thieves and highway robbers and in truth they classed Him with such people But the power of God became manifested His word was promulgated and the greatness of Baha u llah then became evident for it was from this prison and under such humiliating circumstances that He caused Persia to advance from one state into another state He overcame all His enemies and proved to them that they could not resist the Cause His holy teachings penetrated all regions and His Cause was established Indeed in all parts of Persia His enemies arose against Him with the greatest hatred imprisoning killing and beating His converts and burning and razing to the ground thousands of dwellings striving by every means to exterminate and crush the Cause In spite of all this from the prison of murderers highway robbers and thieves it became exalted His teachings were spread abroad and His exhortations affected many of those who had been the most full of hatred and made them firm believers Even the Persian government itself became awakened and regretted that which had arisen through the fault of the ulama When Baha u llah came to this prison in the Holy Land the wise men realized that the glad tidings which God gave through the tongue of the Prophets two or three thousand years before were again manifested and that God was faithful to His promise for to some of the Prophets He had revealed and given the good news that the Lord of Hosts should be manifested in the Holy Land All these promises were fulfilled and it is difficult to understand how Baha u llah could have been obliged to leave Persia and to pitch His tent in this Holy Land but for the persecution of His enemies His banishment and exile His enemies intended that His imprisonment should completely destroy and annihilate the blessed Cause but this prison was in reality of the greatest assistance and became the means of its development The divine renown of Baha u llah reached the East and the West and the rays of the Sun of Truth illuminated all the world Praise be to God though He was a prisoner His tent was raised on Mount Carmel and He moved abroad with the greatest majesty Every person friend or stranger who came into His presence used to say This is a prince not a captive Upon His arrival in prison twenty one He addressed an epistle to Napoleon twenty two which He sent through the French ambassador The gist of it was Ask what is Our crime and why We are confined in this prison and this dungeon Napoleon made no reply Then a second epistle was issued which is contained in the Suriy i Haykal twenty three The epitome of it is Oh Napoleon as thou hast not listened to My proclamation and as thou hast not answered it thy dominion will before long be taken away from thee and thou wilt be utterly destroyed This epistle was sent to Napoleon by post through the care of Cesar Ketaphakou twenty four as was known to all the companions of His exile The text of this warning reached the whole of Persia for it was at that time that the Kitab i Haykal was spread in Persia and this epistle was among the contents of this book This happened in A D eighteen sixty nine and as this Suriy i Haykal was circulated in Persia and India and was in the hands of all believers they were waiting to see what would come to pass Not long after in A D eighteen seventy the war between Germany and France broke out and though no one at that time expected the victory of Germany Napoleon was defeated and dishonored he surrendered to his enemies and his glory was changed into deep abasement Tablets twenty five were also sent to other kings and among them was the letter to H M Nasiri d Din Sh ah In that epistle Baha u llah said Have Me summoned gather the ulama and ask for proofs and arguments so that the truth and falsehood may become known H M Nasiri d Din Sh ah sent the blessed epistle to the ulama and proposed to them that they should undertake this mission but they dared not do so Then he asked seven of the most celebrated among them to write an answer to the challenge After some time they returned the blessed letter saying This man is the opposer of religion and the enemy of the Sh ah His majesty the Sh ah of Persia was much vexed and said This is a question for proofs and arguments and of truth or falsehood what has it to do with enmity to the government Alas how much we respected these ulama who cannot even reply to this epistle Briefly all that was recorded in the Tablets to the Kings is being fulfilled if from the year A D eighteen seventy we compare the events that have occurred we will find everything that has happened has appeared as predicted only a few remain which will afterward become manifested So also foreign peoples and other sects who were not believers attributed many wonderful things to Baha u llah Some believed that He was a saint twenty six and some even wrote treatises about Him One of them Siyyid Davudi a Sunnite savant of Ba gh dad wrote a short treatise in which he related certain supernatural acts of Baha u llah Even now in all parts of the East there are some people who though they do not believe in His manifestation nevertheless believe Him to be a saint and relate miracles attributed to Him To sum up both His antagonists and His partisans as well as all those who were received in the sacred spot acknowledged and bore witness to the greatness of Baha u llah Though they did not believe in Him still they acknowledged His grandeur and as soon as they entered the sacred spot the presence of Baha u llah produced such an effect on most of them that they could not utter a word How many times it happened that one of His most bitter enemies would resolve within himself I will say such and such things when I reach His presence and I will dispute and argue thus with Him but when he entered the Holy Presence he would become amazed and confounded and remain speechless Baha u llah had never studied Arabic He had not had a tutor or teacher nor had He entered a school Nevertheless the eloquence and elegance of His blessed expositions in Arabic as well as His Arabic writings caused astonishment and stupefaction to the most accomplished Arabic scholars and all recognized and declared that He was incomparable and unequaled If we carefully examine the text of the Torah we see that the Divine Manifestation never said to those who denied Him Whatever miracle you desire I am ready to perform and I will submit to whatever test you propose But in the Epistle to the Sh ah Baha u llah said clearly Gather the ulama and summon Me that the evidences and proofs may be established twenty seven For fifty years Baha u llah faced His enemies like a mountain all wished to annihilate Him and sought His destruction A thousand times they planned to crucify and destroy Him and during these fifty years He was in constant danger In this day Persia is in such a state of decadence and ruin that all intelligent men whether Persians or foreigners who realize the true state of affairs recognize that its progress its civilization and its reconstruction depend upon the promulgation of the teachings and the development of the principles of this great Personage Christ in His blessed day in reality only educated eleven men the greatest of them was Peter who nevertheless when he was tested thrice denied Christ In spite of this the Cause of Christ subsequently permeated the world At the present day Baha u llah has educated thousands of souls who while under the menace of the sword raised to the highest heaven the cry of Ya Baha u l Abha twenty eight and in the fire of tests their faces became illuminated like gold Then reflect what will take place in the future Finally we must be just and acknowledge what an Educator this Glorious Being was what marvelous signs were manifested by Him and what power and might have been realized in the world through Him ten TRADITIONAL PROOFS EXEMPLIFIED FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL Today at table let us speak for a little of proofs If you had come to this blessed place in the days of the manifestation of the evident Light twenty nine if you had attained to the court of His presence and had witnessed His luminous beauty you would have understood that His teachings and perfection were not in need of further evidence Only through the honor of entering His presence many souls became confirmed believers they had no need of other proofs Even those people who rejected and hated Him bitterly when they had met Him would testify to the grandeur of Baha u llah saying This is a magnificent man but what a pity that he makes such a claim Otherwise all that he says is acceptable But now as that Light of Reality has set all are in need of proofs so we have undertaken to demonstrate rational proofs of the truth of His claim We will cite another which alone is sufficient for all who are just and which no one can deny It is that this illustrious Being uplifted His Cause in the Greatest Prison thirty from this Prison His light was shed abroad His fame conquered the world and the proclamation of His glory reached the East and West Until our time no such thing has ever occurred If there be justice this will be acknowledged but there are some people who even if all the proofs in the world be adduced before them still will not judge justly Thus nations and states with all their strength could not resist Him Verily single and alone imprisoned and oppressed He accomplished whatever He desired I do not wish to mention the miracles of Baha u llah for it may perhaps be said that these are traditions liable both to truth and to error like the accounts of the miracles of Christ in the Gospel which come to us from the apostles and not from anyone else and are denied by the Jews Though if I wish to mention the supernatural acts of Baha u llah they are numerous they are acknowledged in the Orient and even by some non Baha is But these narratives are not decisive proofs and evidences to all the hearer might perhaps say that this account may not be in accordance with what occurred for it is known that other sects recount miracles performed by their founders For instance the followers of Brahmanism relate miracles From what evidence may we know that those are false and that these are true If these are fables the others also are fables if these are generally accepted so also the others are generally accepted Consequently these accounts are not satisfactory proofs Yes miracles are proofs for the eyewitness only and even he may regard them not as a miracle but as an enchantment Extraordinary feats have also been related of some conjurors Briefly my meaning is that many wonderful things were done by Baha u llah but we do not recount them as they do not constitute proofs and evidences for all the peoples of the earth and they are not decisive proofs even for those who see them they may think that they are merely enchantments Also most of the miracles of the Prophets which are mentioned have an inner significance For instance in the Gospel it is written that at the martyrdom of Christ darkness prevailed and the earth quaked and the veil of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the dead came forth from their graves If these events had happened they would indeed have been awesome and would certainly have been recorded in the history of the times They would have become the cause of much troublings of heart Either the soldiers would have taken down Christ from the cross or they would have fled These events are not related in any history therefore it is evident they ought not to be taken literally but as having an inner significance thirty one Our purpose is not to deny such miracles our only meaning is that they do not constitute decisive proofs and that they have an inner significance Accordingly today at table we will refer to the explanation of the traditional proofs which are in the Holy Books Until now all that we have spoken of are rational proofs The state in which one should be to seriously search for the truth is the condition of the thirsty burning soul desiring the water of life of the fish struggling to reach the sea of the sufferer seeking for the true doctor to obtain the divine cure of the lost caravan endeavoring to find the right road of the lost and wandering ship striving to reach the shore of salvation Therefore the seeker must be endowed with certain qualities First of all he must be just and severed from all else save God his heart must be entirely turned to the supreme horizon he must be free from the bondage of self and passion for all these are obstacles Furthermore he must be able to endure all hardships He must be absolutely pure and sanctified and free from the love or the hatred of the inhabitants of the world Why because the fact of his love for any person or thing might prevent him from recognizing the truth in another and in the same way hatred for anything might be a hindrance in discerning truth This is the condition of seeking and the seeker must have these qualities and attributes Until he reaches this condition it is not possible for him to attain to the Sun of Reality Let us now return to our subject All the peoples of the world are awaiting two Manifestations Who must be contemporaneous all wait for the fulfillment of this promise In the Bible the Jews have the promise of the Lord of Hosts and the Messiah in the Gospel the return of Christ and Elijah is promised In the religion of Muhammad there is the promise of the Mihdi and the Messiah and it is the same with the Zoroastrian and the other religions but if we relate these matters in detail it would take too long The essential fact is that all are promised two Manifestations Who will come one following on the other It has been prophesied that in the time of these two Manifestations the earth will be transformed the world of existence will be renewed and beings will be clothed in new garments Justice and truth will encompass the world enmity and hatred will disappear all causes of division among peoples races and nations will vanish and the cause of union harmony and concord will appear The negligent will awake the blind will see the deaf will hear the dumb will speak the sick will be cured the dead will arise War will give place to peace enmity will be conquered by love the causes of dispute and wrangling will be entirely removed and true felicity will be attained The world will become the mirror of the Heavenly Kingdom humanity will be the Throne of Divinity All nations will become one all religions will be unified all individual men will become of one family and of one kindred All the regions of the earth will become one the superstitions caused by races countries individuals languages and politics will disappear and all men will attain to life eternal under the shadow of the Lord of Hosts Now we must prove from the Holy Books that these two Manifestations have come and we must divine the meaning of the words of the Prophets for we wish for proofs drawn from the Holy Books A few days ago at table we put forth rational proofs establishing the truth of these two Manifestations To conclude in the Book of Daniel from the rebuilding of Jerusalem to the martyrdom of Christ seventy weeks are appointed for by the martyrdom of Christ the sacrifice is accomplished and the altar destroyed thirty two This is a prophecy of the manifestation of Christ These seventy weeks begin with the restoration and the rebuilding of Jerusalem concerning which four edicts were issued by three kings The first was issued by Cyrus in the year five hundred thirty six B C this is recorded in the first chapter of the Book of Ezra The second edict with reference to the rebuilding of Jerusalem is that of Darius of Persia in the year five hundred nineteen B C this is recorded in the sixth chapter of Ezra The third is that of Artaxerxes in the seventh year of his reign that is in four hundred fifty seven B C this is recorded in the seventh chapter of Ezra The fourth is that of Artaxerxes in the year four hundred forty four B C this is recorded in the second chapter of Nehemiah But Daniel refers especially to the third edict which was issued in the year four hundred fifty seven B C Seventy weeks make four hundred and ninety days Each day according to the text of the Holy Book is a year For in the Bible it is said The day of the Lord is one year thirty three Therefore four hundred and ninety days are four hundred and ninety years The third edict of Artaxerxes was issued four hundred and fifty seven years before the birth of Christ and Christ when He was martyred and ascended was thirty three years of age When you add thirty three to four hundred and fifty seven the result is four hundred and ninety which is the time announced by Daniel for the manifestation of Christ But in the twenty fifth verse of the ninth chapter of the Book of Daniel this is expressed in another manner as seven weeks and sixty two weeks and apparently this differs from the first saying Many have remained perplexed at these differences trying to reconcile these two statements How can seventy weeks be right in one place and sixty two weeks and seven weeks in another These two sayings do not accord But Daniel mentions two dates One of these dates begins with the command of Artaxerxes to Ezra to rebuild Jerusalem this is the seventy weeks which came to an end with the ascension of Christ when by His martyrdom the sacrifice and oblation ceased The second period which is found in the twenty sixth verse means that after the termination of the rebuilding of Jerusalem until the ascension of Christ there will be sixty two weeks the seven weeks are the duration of the rebuilding of Jerusalem which took forty nine years When you add these seven weeks to the sixty two weeks it makes sixty nine weeks and in the last week sixty nine seventy the ascension of Christ took place These seventy weeks are thus completed and there is no contradiction Now that the manifestation of Christ has been proved by the prophecies of Daniel let us prove the manifestations of Baha u llah and of the Bab Up to the present we have only mentioned rational proofs now we shall speak of traditional proofs In the eighth chapter of the Book of Daniel verse thirteen it is said Then I heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot Then he answered v fourteen Unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed v seventeen But he said unto me at the time of the end shall be the vision That is to say how long will this misfortune this ruin this abasement and degradation last meaning when will be the dawn of the Manifestation Then he answered Two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed Briefly the purport of this passage is that he appoints two thousand three hundred years for in the text of the Bible each day is a year Then from the date of the issuing of the edict of Artaxerxes to rebuild Jerusalem until the day of the birth of Christ there are four hundred fifty six years and from the birth of Christ until the day of the manifestation of the Bab there are eighteen forty four years When you add four hundred fifty six years to this number it makes twenty three hundred years That is to say the fulfillment of the vision of Daniel took place in the year A D eighteen forty four and this is the year of the Bab s manifestation according to the actual text of the Book of Daniel Consider how clearly he determines the year of manifestation there could be no clearer prophecy for a manifestation than this In Matthew chapter twenty four verse three Christ clearly says that what Daniel meant by this prophecy was the date of the manifestation and this is the verse As He sat upon the mount of Olives the disciples came unto Him privately saying Tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of Thy coming and of the end of the world One of the explanations He gave them in reply was this v fifteen When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand In this answer He referred them to the eighth chapter of the Book of Daniel saying that everyone who reads it will understand that it is this time that is spoken of Consider how clearly the manifestation of the Bab is spoken of in the Old Testament and in the Gospel To conclude let us now explain the date of the manifestation of Baha u llah from the Bible The date of Baha u llah is calculated according to lunar years from the mission and the Hejira of Muhammad for in the religion of Muhammad the lunar year is in use as also it is the lunar year which is employed concerning all commands of worship In Daniel chapter twelve verse six it is said And one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river How long shall it be to the end of these wonders And I heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and sware by Him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time times and a half and that when He shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished thirty four As I have already explained the signification of one day it is not necessary to explain it further but we will say briefly that each day of the Father counts as a year and in each year there are twelve months Thus three years and a half make forty two months and forty two months are twelve hundred and sixty days The Bab the precursor of Baha u llah appeared in the year twelve sixty from the Hejira of Muhammad by the reckoning of Islam Afterward in verse eleven it is said And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolation be set up there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days Blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days thirty five The beginning of this lunar reckoning is from the day of the proclamation of the prophethood of Muhammad in the country of Hijaz and that was three years after His mission because in the beginning the prophethood of Muhammad was kept secret and no one knew it save Kh adijah and Ibn Nawfal thirty six After three years it was announced And Baha u llah in the year twelve ninety from the proclamation of the mission of Muhammad caused His manifestation to be known thirty seven eleven COMMENTARY ON THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF THE REVELATION OF saint JOHN In the beginning of the eleventh chapter of the Revelation of saint John it is said And there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein But the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months This reed is a Perfect Man Who is likened to a reed and the manner of its likeness is this when the interior of a reed is empty and free from all matter it will produce beautiful melodies and as the sound and melodies do not come from the reed but from the flute player who blows upon it so the sanctified heart of that blessed Being is free and emptied from all save God pure and exempt from the attachments of all human conditions and is the companion of the Divine Spirit Whatever He utters is not from Himself but from the real flute player and it is a divine inspiration That is why He is likened to a reed and that reed is like a rod that is to say it is the helper of every impotent one and the support of human beings It is the rod of the Divine Shepherd by which He guards His flock and leads them about the pastures of the Kingdom Then it is said The angel stood saying Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein that is to say compare and measure measuring is the discovery of proportion Thus the angel said compare the temple of God and the altar and them that are praying therein that is to say investigate what is their true condition and discover in what degree and state they are and what conditions perfections behavior and attributes they possess and make yourself cognizant of the mysteries of those holy souls who dwell in the Holy of Holies in purity and sanctity But the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles In the beginning of the seventh century after Christ when Jerusalem was conquered the Holy of Holies was outwardly preserved that is to say the house which Solomon built but outside the Holy of Holies the outer court was taken and given to the Gentiles And the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months that is to say the Gentiles shall govern and control Jerusalem forty and two months signifying twelve hundred and sixty days and as each day signifies a year by this reckoning it becomes twelve hundred and sixty years which is the duration of the cycle of the Qur an For in the texts of the Holy Book each day is a year as it is said in the fourth chapter of Ezekiel verse six Thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days I have appointed thee each day for a year This prophesies the duration of the Dispensation of Islam when Jerusalem was trodden under foot which means that it lost its glory but the Holy of Holies was preserved guarded and respected until the year twelve sixty This twelve hundred and sixty years is a prophecy of the manifestation of the Bab the Gate of Baha u llah which took place in the year twelve sixty of the Hejira of Muhammad and as the period of twelve hundred and sixty years has expired Jerusalem the Holy City is now beginning to become prosperous populous and flourishing Anyone who saw Jerusalem sixty years ago and who sees it now will recognize how populous and flourishing it has become and how it is again honored This is the outward meaning of these verses of the Revelation of saint John but they have another explanation and a symbolic sense which is as follows the Law of God is divided into two parts One is the fundamental basis which comprises all spiritual things that is to say it refers to the spiritual virtues and divine qualities this does not change nor alter it is the Holy of Holies which is the essence of the Law of Adam Noah Abraham Moses Christ Muhammad the Bab and Baha u llah and which lasts and is established in all the prophetic cycles It will never be abrogated for it is spiritual and not material truth it is faith knowledge certitude justice piety righteousness trustworthiness love of God benevolence purity detachment humility meekness patience and constancy It shows mercy to the poor defends the oppressed gives to the wretched and uplifts the fallen These divine qualities these eternal commandments will never be abolished nay they will last and remain established for ever and ever These virtues of humanity will be renewed in each of the different cycles for at the end of every cycle the spiritual Law of God that is to say the human virtues disappears and only the form subsists Thus among the Jews at the end of the cycle of Moses which coincides with the Christian manifestation the Law of God disappeared only a form without spirit remaining The Holy of Holies departed from among them but the outer court of Jerusalem which is the expression used for the form of the religion fell into the hands of the Gentiles In the same way the fundamental principles of the religion of Christ which are the greatest virtues of humanity have disappeared and its form has remained in the hands of the clergy and the priests Likewise the foundation of the religion of Muhammad has disappeared but its form remains in the hands of the official ulama These foundations of the Religion of God which are spiritual and which are the virtues of humanity cannot be abrogated they are irremovable and eternal and are renewed in the cycle of every Prophet The second part of the Religion of God which refers to the material world and which comprises fasting prayer forms of worship marriage and divorce the abolition of slavery legal processes transactions indemnities for murder violence theft and injuries this part of the Law of God which refers to material things is modified and altered in each prophetic cycle in accordance with the necessities of the times Briefly what is meant by the term Holy of Holies is that spiritual Law which will never be modified altered or abrogated and the Holy City means the material Law which may be abrogated and this material Law which is described as the Holy City was to be trodden under foot for twelve hundred and sixty years And I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days clothed in sackcloth thirty eight These two witnesses are Muhammad the Messenger of God and Ali son of Abu Talib In the Qur an it is said that God addressed Muhammad the Messenger of God saying We made You a Witness a Herald of good news and a Warner that is to say We have established Thee as the witness the giver of good tidings and as One bringing the wrath of God thirty nine The meaning of a witness is one by whose testimony things may be verified The commands of these two witnesses were to be performed for twelve hundred and sixty days each day signifying a year Now Muhammad was the root and Ali the branch like Moses and Joshua It is said they are clothed in sackcloth meaning that they apparently were to be clothed in old raiment not in new raiment in other words in the beginning they would possess no splendor in the eyes of the people nor would their Cause appear new for Muhammad s spiritual Law corresponds to that of Christ in the Gospel and most of His laws relating to material things correspond to those of the Pentateuch This is the meaning of the old raiment Then it is said These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth forty These two souls are likened to olive trees because at that time all lamps were lighted by olive oil The meaning is two persons from whom that spirit of the wisdom of God which is the cause of the illumination of the world appears These lights of God were to radiate and shine therefore they are likened to two candlesticks the candlestick is the abode of the light and from it the light shines forth In the same way the light of guidance would shine and radiate from these illumined souls Then it is said They are standing before God meaning that they are standing in the service of God and educating the creatures of God such as the barbarous nomad Arab tribes of the Arabian peninsula whom they educated in such a way that in those days they reached the highest degree of civilization and their fame and renown became worldwide And if any man would hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies forty one That is to say that no one would be able to withstand them that if a person wished to belittle their teachings and their law he would be surrounded and exterminated by this same law which proceedeth out of their mouth and everyone who attempted to injure to antagonize and to hate them would be destroyed by a command which would come out of their mouth And thus it happened all their enemies were vanquished put to flight and annihilated In this most evident way God assisted them Afterward it is said These have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy forty two meaning that in that cycle they would be like kings The law and teachings of Muhammad and the explanations and commentaries of Ali are a heavenly bounty if they wish to give this bounty they have power to do so If they do not wish it the rain will not fall in this connection rain stands for bounty Then it is said They have power over water to turn it to blood forty three meaning that the prophethood of Muhammad was the same as that of Moses and that the power of Ali was the same as that of Joshua if they wished they could turn the water of the Nile into blood so far as the Egyptians and those who denied them were concerned that is to say that that which was the cause of their life through their ignorance and pride became the cause of their death So the kingdom wealth and power of Pharaoh and his people which were the causes of the life of the nation became through their opposition denial and pride the cause of death destruction dispersion degradation and poverty Hence these two witnesses have power to destroy the nations Then it is said And smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will forty four meaning that they also would have the power and the material force necessary to educate the wicked and those who are oppressors and tyrants for to these two witnesses God granted both outward and inward power that they might educate and correct the ferocious bloodthirsty tyrannical nomad Arabs who were like beasts of prey And when they shall have finished their testimony forty five means when they should have performed that which they are commanded and should have delivered the divine message promoting the Law of God and propagating the heavenly teachings to the intent that the signs of spiritual life might be manifest in souls and the light of the virtues of the world of humanity might shine forth until complete development should be brought about among the nomad tribes The beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall war against them and shall overcome them and kill them forty six this beast means the Umayyads who attacked them from the pit of error and who rose against the religion of Muhammad and against the reality of Ali in other words the love of God It is said The beast made war against these two witnesses forty seven that is to say a spiritual war meaning that the beast would act in entire opposition to the teachings customs and institutions of these two witnesses to such an extent that the virtues and perfections which were diffused by the power of those two witnesses among the peoples and tribes would be entirely dispelled and the animal nature and carnal desires would conquer Therefore this beast making war against them would gain the victory meaning that the darkness of error coming from this beast was to have ascendency over the horizons of the world and kill those two witnesses in other words that it would destroy the spiritual life which they spread abroad in the midst of the nation and entirely remove the divine laws and teachings treading under foot the Religion of God Nothing would thereafter remain but a lifeless body without spirit And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified forty eight Their bodies means the Religion of God and the street means in public view The meaning of Sodom and Egypt the place where also our Lord was crucified is this region of Syria and especially Jerusalem where the Umayyads then had their dominions and it was here that the Religion of God and the divine teachings first disappeared and a body without spirit remained Their bodies represents the Religion of God which remained like a dead body without spirit And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves forty nine As it was before explained in the terminology of the Holy Books three days and a half signify three years and a half and three years and a half are forty and two months and forty and two months twelve hundred and sixty days and as each day by the text of the Holy Book signifies one year the meaning is that for twelve hundred and sixty years which is the cycle of the Qur an the nations tribes and peoples would look at their bodies that is to say that they would make a spectacle of the Religion of God though they would not act in accordance with it still they would not suffer their bodies meaning the Religion of God to be put in the grave That is to say that in appearance they would cling to the Religion of God and not allow it to completely disappear from their midst nor the body of it to be entirely destroyed and annihilated Nay in reality they would leave it while outwardly preserving its name and remembrance Those kindreds people and nations signify those who are gathered under the shadow of the Qur an not permitting the Cause and Law of God to be in outward appearance entirely destroyed and annihilated for there are prayer and fasting among them but the fundamental principles of the Religion of God which are morals and conduct with the knowledge of divine mysteries have disappeared the light of the virtues of the world of humanity which is the result of the love and knowledge of God is extinguished and the darkness of tyranny oppression satanic passions and desires has become victorious The body of the Law of God like a corpse has been exposed to public view for twelve hundred and sixty days each day being counted as a year and this period is the cycle of Muhammad The people forfeited all that these two persons had established which was the foundation of the Law of God and destroyed the virtues of the world of humanity which are the divine gifts and the spirit of this religion to such a degree that truthfulness justice love union purity sanctity detachment and all the divine qualities departed from among them In the religion only prayers and fasting persisted this condition lasted for twelve hundred and sixty years which is the duration of the cycle of the Furqan fifty It was as if these two persons were dead and their bodies were remaining without spirit And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth fifty one Those who dwelt upon the earth means the other nations and races such as the peoples of Europe and distant Asia who when they saw that the character of Islam was entirely changed the Law of God forsaken that virtues zeal and honor had departed from among them and that their qualities were changed became happy and rejoiced that corruption of morals had infected the people of Islam and that they would in consequence be overcome by other nations So this thing has come to pass Witness this people which had attained the summit of power how degraded and downtrodden it is now The other nations shall send gifts to one another meaning that they should help each other for these two prophets tormented them that dwelt upon the earth that is they overcame the other nations and peoples of the world and conquered them And after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them that saw them fifty two Three days and a half as we before explained is twelve hundred and sixty years Those two persons whose bodies were lying spiritless are the teachings and the law that Muhammad established and Ali promoted from which however the reality had departed and only the form remained The spirit came again into them means that those foundations and teachings were again established In other words the spirituality of the Religion of God had been changed into materiality and virtues into vices the love of God had been changed into hatred enlightenment into darkness divine qualities into satanic ones justice into tyranny mercy into enmity sincerity into hypocrisy guidance into error and purity into sensuality Then after three days and a half which by the terminology of the Holy Books is twelve hundred and sixty years these divine teachings heavenly virtues perfections and spiritual bounties were again renewed by the appearance of the Bab and the devotion of Jinab i Quddus fifty three The holy breezes were diffused the light of truth shone forth the season of the life giving spring came and the morn of guidance dawned These two lifeless bodies again became living and these two great ones one the Founder and the other the promoter arose and were like two candlesticks for they illumined the world with the light of truth And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them Come up hither And they ascended up to heaven fifty four meaning that from the invisible heaven they heard the voice of God saying You have performed all that was proper and fitting in delivering the teachings and glad tidings you have given My message to the people and raised the call of God and have accomplished your duty Now like Christ you must sacrifice your life for the Well Beloved and be martyrs And that Sun of Reality and that Moon of Guidance fifty five both like Christ set on the horizon of the greatest martyrdom and ascended to the Kingdom of God And their enemies beheld them fifty six meaning that many of their enemies after witnessing their martyrdom realized the sublimity of their station and the exaltation of their virtue and testified to their greatness and perfection And the same hour there was a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand fifty seven This earthquake occurred in Sh iraz after the martyrdom of the Bab The city was in a turmoil and many people were destroyed Great agitation also took place through diseases cholera dearth scarcity famine and afflictions the like of which had never been known And the remnant was affrighted and gave glory to the God of heaven fifty eight When the earthquake took place in Fars all the remnant lamented and cried day and night and were occupied in glorifying and praying to God They were so troubled and affrighted that they had no sleep nor rest at night The second woe is past and behold the third woe cometh quickly fifty nine The first woe is the appearance of the Prophet Muhammad the son of Abdu llah peace be upon Him The second woe is that of the Bab to Him be glory and praise The third woe is the great day of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts and the radiance of the Beauty of the Promised One The explanation of this subject woe is mentioned in the thirtieth chapter of Ezekiel where it is said The word of the Lord came again unto me saying Son of man prophesy and say Thus saith the Lord God Howl ye Woe worth the day For the day is near even the day of the Lord is near sixty Therefore it is certain that the day of woe is the day of the Lord for in that day woe is for the neglectful woe is for the sinners woe is for the ignorant That is why it is said The second woe is past behold the third woe cometh quickly This third woe is the day of the manifestation of Baha u llah the day of God and it is near to the day of the appearance of the Bab And the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ and He shall reign for ever and ever sixty one The seventh angel is a man qualified with heavenly attributes who will arise with heavenly qualities and character Voices will be raised so that the appearance of the Divine Manifestation will be proclaimed and diffused In the day of the manifestation of the Lord of Hosts and at the epoch of the divine cycle of the Omnipotent which is promised and mentioned in all the books and writings of the Prophets in that day of God the Spiritual and Divine Kingdom will be established and the world will be renewed a new spirit will be breathed into the body of creation the season of the divine spring will come the clouds of mercy will rain the sun of reality will shine the life giving breeze will blow the world of humanity will wear a new garment the surface of the earth will be a sublime paradise mankind will be educated wars disputes quarrels and malignity will disappear and truthfulness righteousness peace and the worship of God will appear union love and brotherhood will surround the world and God will rule for evermore meaning that the Spiritual and Everlasting Kingdom will be established Such is the day of God For all the days which have come and gone were the days of Abraham Moses and Christ or of the other Prophets but this day is the day of God for the Sun of Reality will arise in it with the utmost warmth and splendor And the four and twenty elders which sat before God on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped God Saying We give Thee thanks O Lord God Almighty Which art and wast and art to come because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power and hast reigned sixty two In each cycle the guardians and holy souls have been twelve So Jacob had twelve sons in the time of Moses there were twelve heads or chiefs of the tribes in the time of Christ there were twelve Apostles and in the time of Muhammad there were twelve Imams But in this glorious manifestation there are twenty four double the number of all the others for the greatness of this manifestation requires it These holy souls are in the presence of God seated on their own thrones meaning that they reign eternally These twenty four great persons though they are seated on the thrones of everlasting rule yet are worshipers of the appearance of the universal Manifestation and they are humble and submissive saying We give thanks to Thee O Lord God Almighty Which art and wast and art to come because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power and hast reigned that is to say Thou wilt issue all Thy teachings Thou wilt gather all the people of the earth under Thy shadow and Thou wilt bring all men under the shadow of one tent Although it is the Eternal Kingdom of God and He always had and has a Kingdom the Kingdom here means the manifestation of Himself sixty three and He will issue all the laws and teachings which are the spirit of the world of humanity and everlasting life And that universal Manifestation will subdue the world by spiritual power not by war and combat He will do it with peace and tranquillity not by the sword and arms He will establish this Heavenly Kingdom by true love and not by the power of war He will promote these divine teachings by kindness and righteousness and not by weapons and harshness He will so educate the nations and people that notwithstanding their various conditions their different customs and characters and their diverse religions and races they will as it is said in the Bible like the wolf and the lamb the leopard the kid the sucking child and the serpent become comrades friends and companions The contentions of races the differences of religions and the barriers between nations will be completely removed and all will attain perfect union and reconciliation under the shadow of the Blessed Tree And the nations were angry for Thy teachings opposed the passions of the other peoples and Thy wrath is come sixty four that is to say all will be afflicted by evident loss because they do not follow Thy precepts counsels and teachings they will be deprived of Thy everlasting bounty and veiled from the light of the Sun of Reality And the time of the dead that they should be judged means that the time has come that the dead sixty five that is to say those who are deprived of the spirit of the love of God and have not a share of the sanctified eternal life will be judged with justice meaning they will arise to receive that which they deserve He will make the reality of their secrets evident showing what a low degree they occupy in the world of existence and that in reality they are under the rule of death That Thou shouldst give reward unto Thy servants the prophets and the saints and them that fear Thy name small and great sixty six that is to say He will distinguish the righteous by endless bounty making them shine on the horizon of eternal honor like the stars of heaven He will assist them by endowing them with behavior and actions which are the light of the world of humanity the cause of guidance and the means of everlasting life in the Divine Kingdom And shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth sixty seven means that He will entirely deprive the neglectful for the blindness of the blind will be manifest and the vision of the seers will be evident the ignorance and want of knowledge of the people of error will be recognized and the knowledge and wisdom of the people under guidance will be apparent consequently the destroyers will be destroyed And the temple of God was opened in heaven sixty eight means that the divine Jerusalem is found and the Holy of Holies has become visible The Holy of Holies according to the terminology of the people of wisdom is the essence of the Divine Law and the heavenly and true teachings of the Lord which have not been changed in the cycle of any Prophet as it was before explained The sanctuary of Jerusalem is likened to the reality of the Law of God which is the Holy of Holies and all the laws conventions rites and material regulations are the city of Jerusalem this is why it is called the heavenly Jerusalem Briefly as in this cycle the Sun of Reality will make the light of God shine with the utmost splendor therefore the essence of the teachings of God will be realized in the world of existence and the darkness of ignorance and want of knowledge will be dispelled The world will become a new world and enlightenment will prevail So the Holy of Holies will appear And the temple of God was opened in heaven sixty nine means also that by the diffusion of the divine teachings the appearance of these heavenly mysteries and the rising of the Sun of Reality the doors of success and prosperity will be opened in all directions and the signs of goodness and heavenly benedictions will be made plain And there was seen in His temple the ark of His Testament seventy that is to say the Book of His Testament will appear in His Jerusalem the Epistle of the Covenant seventy one will be established and the meaning of the Testament and of the Covenant will become evident The renown of God will overspread the East and West and the proclamation of the Cause of God will fill the world The violators of the Covenant will be degraded and dispersed and the faithful cherished and glorified for they cling to the Book of the Testament and are firm and steadfast in the Covenant And there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail seventy two meaning that after the appearance of the Book of the Testament there will be a great storm and the lightnings of the anger and the wrath of God will flash the noise of the thunder of the violation of the Covenant will resound the earthquake of doubts will take place the hail of torments will beat upon the violators of the Covenant and even those who profess belief will fall into trials and temptations twelve COMMENTARY ON THE ELEVENTH CHAPTER OF ISAIAH In Isaiah chapter eleven verses one to ten it is said And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a Branch shall grow out of his roots And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears But with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reins The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them And the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain 
1618-220956-0016	train-other-500	for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord
none	none	 as the waters cover the sea This rod out of the stem of Jesse might be correctly applied to Christ for Joseph was of the descendants of Jesse the father of David 
1618-220956-0000	train-other-500	but as Christ found existence through the Spirit of God He called Himself the Son of God If He had not done so this description would refer to Him Besides this
1618-220956-0001	train-other-500	the events which he indicated as coming to pass in the days of that rod if interpreted symbolically were in part fulfilled in the day of Christ but not all and if not interpreted then decidedly
1618-220956-0002	train-other-500	none of these signs happened For example the leopard and the lamb the lion and the calf the child and the asp are metaphors and symbols for various nations
1618-220956-0003	train-other-500	peoples antagonistic sects and hostile races who are as opposite and inimical as the wolf and lamb We say that by the breath of the spirit of Christ
1618-220956-0004	train-other-500	they found concord and harmony they were vivified and they associated together But they shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord
1618-220956-0005	train-other-500	as the waters cover the sea These conditions did not prevail in the time of the manifestation of Christ
none	none	 for until today 
1618-220956-0006	train-other-500	various and antagonistic nations exist in the world very few acknowledge the God of Israel and the greater number are without the knowledge of God In the same way
1618-220956-0007	train-other-500	universal peace did not come into existence in the time of Christ that is to say between the antagonistic and hostile nations there was neither peace nor concord

none	none	 did not appear So even at this day among the Christian sects and nations themselves enmity hatred and the most violent hostility are met with But these verses apply word for word to Baha u llah Likewise in this marvelous cycle the earth will be transformed and the world of humanity arrayed in tranquillity and beauty Disputes quarrels and murders will be replaced by peace truth and concord among the nations peoples races and countries love and amity will appear Cooperation and union will be established and finally war will be entirely suppressed When the laws of the Most Holy Book are enforced contentions and disputes will find a final sentence of absolute justice before a general tribunal of the nations and kingdoms and the difficulties that appear will be solved The five continents of the world will form but one the numerous nations will become one the surface of the earth will become one land and mankind will be a single community The relations between the countries the mingling union and friendship of the peoples and communities will reach to such a degree that the human race will be like one family and kindred The light of heavenly love will shine 
1618-220956-0009	train-other-500	and the darkness of enmity and hatred will be dispelled from the world Universal peace will raise its tent in the center of the earth
none	none	 and the blessed Tree of Life will grow and spread 
1618-220956-0010	train-other-500	to such an extent that it will overshadow the East and the West Strong and weak rich and poor antagonistic sects and hostile nations which are like the wolf
1618-220956-0011	train-other-500	and the lamb the leopard and kid the lion and the calf will act toward each other with the most complete love friendship justice and equity
1618-220956-0012	train-other-500	The world will be filled with science with the knowledge of the reality of the mysteries of beings and with the knowledge of God Now consider in this great century
1618-220956-0013	train-other-500	which is the cycle of Baha u llah what progress science and knowledge have made how many secrets of existence have been discovered how many great inventions have been brought to light
1618-220956-0014	train-other-500	and are day by day multiplying in number Before long material science and learning as well as the knowledge of God will make such progress and will show forth such wonders
1618-220956-0015	train-other-500	that the beholders will be amazed Then the mystery of this verse in Isaiah
none	none	 For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord will be completely evident 
1618-220956-0017	train-other-500	Reflect also that in the short time since Baha u llah has appeared people from all countries nations and races have entered under the shadow of this Cause Christians Jews
1618-220956-0018	train-other-500	Zoroastrians Buddhists Hindus and Persians all associate together with the greatest friendship and love as if indeed these people had been related and connected together
1618-220956-0019	train-other-500	they and theirs for a thousand years for they are like father and child mother and daughter sister and brother This is one of the meanings of the companionship of the wolf and the lamb

none	none	 Incomparable Branch Baha u llah is the hoisting 
1618-220956-0021	train-other-500	of the Standard of God among all nations
none	none	 By this is meant that all nations and kindreds will be gathered together under the shadow of this Divine Banner which is no other than the Lordly Branch itself and will become a single nation Religious and sectarian antagonism the hostility of races and peoples and differences among nations will be eliminated All men will adhere to one religion will have one common faith will be blended into one race and become a single people All will dwell in one common fatherland which is the planet itself Universal peace and concord will be realized between all the nations and that Incomparable Branch will gather together all Israel signifying that in this cycle Israel will be gathered in the Holy Land and that the Jewish people who are scattered to the East and West South and North will be assembled together Now see 
1618-220956-0022	train-other-500	these events did not take place in the Christian cycle for the nations did not come under the One Standard which is the Divine Branch But in this cycle of the Lord of Hosts
1618-220956-0023	train-other-500	all the nations and peoples will enter under the shadow of this Flag In the same way Israel scattered all over the world was not reassembled in the Holy Land in the Christian cycle
none	none	 but in the beginning of the cycle of Baha u llah this divine promise 
1618-220956-0024	train-other-500	as is clearly stated in all the Books of the Prophets has begun to be manifest
none	none	 You can see that from all the parts of the world tribes of Jews are coming to the Holy Land they live in villages and lands which they make their own and day by day they are increasing to such an extent that all Palestine will become their home thirteen COMMENTARY ON THE TWELFTH CHAPTER OF THE REVELATION OF saint JOHN We have before explained that what is most frequently meant by the Holy City the Jerusalem of God which is mentioned in the Holy Book is the Law of God It is compared sometimes to a bride and sometimes to Jerusalem and again to the new heaven and earth So in chapter twenty one verses one two and three of the Revelation of saint John it is said And I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea And I John saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying Behold the tabernacle of God is with men and He will dwell with them and they shall be His people and God Himself shall be with them and be their God Notice how clear and evident it is that the first heaven and earth signify the former Law For it is said that the first heaven and earth have passed away and there is no more sea that is to say that the earth is the place of judgment and on this earth of judgment there is no sea meaning that the teachings and the Law of God will entirely spread over the earth and all men will enter the Cause of God and the earth will be completely inhabited by believers therefore there will be no more sea for the dwelling place and abode of man is the dry land In other words at that epoch the field of that Law will become the pleasure ground of man Such earth is solid the feet do not slip upon it The Law of God is also described as the Holy City the New Jerusalem It is evident that the New Jerusalem which descends from heaven is not a city of stone mortar bricks earth and wood It is the Law of God which descends from heaven and is called new for it is clear that the Jerusalem which is of stone and earth does not descend from heaven and that it is not renewed but that which is renewed is the Law of God The Law of God is also compared to an adorned bride who appears with most beautiful ornaments as it has been said in chapter twenty one of the Revelation of saint John And I John saw the holy city new Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband seventy three And in chapter twelve verse one it is said And there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars This woman is that bride the Law of God that descended upon Muhammad The sun with which she was clothed and the moon which was under her feet are the two nations which are under the shadow of that Law the Persian and Ottoman kingdoms for the emblem of Persia is the sun and that of the Ottoman Empire is the crescent moon Thus the sun and moon are the emblems of two kingdoms which are under the power of the Law of God Afterward it is said upon her head is a crown of twelve stars These twelve stars are the twelve Imams who were the promoters of the Law of Muhammad and the educators of the people shining like stars in the heaven of guidance Then it is said in the second verse and she being with child cried meaning that this Law fell into the greatest difficulties and endured great troubles and afflictions until a perfect offspring was produced that is the coming Manifestation the Promised One Who is the perfect offspring and Who was reared in the bosom of this Law which is as its mother The child Who is referred to is the Bab the Primal Point Who was in truth born from the Law of Muhammad that is to say the Holy Reality Who is the child and outcome of the Law of God His mother and Who is promised by that religion finds a reality in the kingdom of that Law but because of the despotism of the dragon the child was carried up to God After twelve hundred and sixty days the dragon was destroyed and the child of the Law of God the Promised One became manifest Verses three and four And there appeared a great wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth seventy four These signs are an allusion to the dynasty of the Umayyads who dominated the Muhammadan religion Seven heads and seven crowns mean seven countries and dominions over which the Umayyads had power they were the Roman dominion around Damascus and the Persian Arabian and Egyptian dominions together with the dominion of Africa that is to say Tunis Morocco and Algeria the dominion of Andalusia which is now Spain and the dominion of the Turks of Transoxania The Umayyads had power over these countries The ten horns mean the names of the Umayyad rulers that is without repetition there were ten names of rulers meaning ten names of commanders and chiefs the first is Abu Sufyan and the last Marvan but several of them bear the same name So there are two Muaviya three Yazid two Valid and two Marvan but if the names were counted without repetition there would be ten The Umayyads of whom the first was Abu Sufyan Amir of Mecca and chief of the dynasty of the Umayyads and the last was Marvan destroyed the third part of the holy and saintly people of the lineage of Muhammad who were like the stars of heaven Verse four And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour the child as soon as it was born seventy five As we have before explained this woman is the Law of God The dragon was standing near the woman to devour her child and this child was the promised Manifestation the offspring of the Law of Muhammad The Umayyads were always waiting to get possession of the Promised One Who was to come from the line of Muhammad to destroy and annihilate Him for they much feared the appearance of the promised Manifestation and they sought to kill any of Muhammad s descendants who might be highly esteemed Verse five And she brought forth a man child Who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron This great son is the promised Manifestation Who was born of the Law of God and reared in the bosom of the divine teachings The iron rod is a symbol of power and might it is not a sword and means that with divine power and might He will shepherd all the nations of the earth This son is the Bab Verse five And her child was caught up unto God and to His throne This is a prophecy of the Bab Who ascended to the heavenly realm to the Throne of God and to the center of His Kingdom Consider how all this corresponds to what happened Verse six And the woman fled into the wilderness that is to say the Law of God fled to the wilderness meaning the vast desert of Hijaz and the Arabian Peninsula Verse six Where she had a place prepared of God seventy six The Arabian Peninsula became the abode and dwelling place and the center of the Law of God Verse six That they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days In the terminology of the Holy Book these twelve hundred and sixty days mean the twelve hundred and sixty years that the Law of God was set up in the wilderness of Arabia the great desert from it the Promised One has come After twelve hundred and sixty years that Law will have no more influence for the fruit of that tree will have appeared and the result will have been produced Consider how the prophecies correspond to one another In the Apocalypse the appearance of the Promised One is appointed after forty two months and Daniel expresses it as three times and a half which is also forty two months which are twelve hundred and sixty days In another passage of John s Revelation it is clearly spoken of as twelve hundred and sixty days and in the Holy Book it is said that each day signifies one year Nothing could be clearer than this agreement of the prophecies with one another The Bab appeared in the year twelve sixty of the Hejira of Muhammad which is the beginning of the universal era reckoning of all Islam There are no clearer proofs than this in the Holy Books for any Manifestation For him who is just the agreement of the times indicated by the tongues of the Great Ones is the most conclusive proof There is no other possible explanation of these prophecies Blessed are the just souls who seek the truth But failing justice the people attack dispute and openly deny the evidence like the Pharisees who at the manifestation of Christ denied with the greatest obstinacy the explanations of Christ and of His disciples They obscured Christ s Cause before the ignorant people saying These prophecies are not of Jesus but of the Promised One Who shall come later according to the conditions mentioned in the Bible Some of these conditions were that He must have a kingdom be seated on the throne of David enforce the Law of the Bible and manifest such justice that the wolf and the lamb shall gather at the same spring And thus they prevented the people from knowing Christ Note In these last conversations Abdu l Baha wishes to reconcile in a new interpretation the apocalyptic prophecies of the Jews the Christians and the Muslims rather than to show their supernatural character On the powers of the Prophets cf The Knowledge of the Divine Manifestations p one hundred fifty seven and Visions and Communication with Spirits p two hundred fifty one fourteen SPIRITUAL PROOFS In this material world time has cycles places change through alternating seasons and for souls there are progress retrogression and education At one time it is the season of spring at another it is the season of autumn and again it is the season of summer or the season of winter In the spring there are the clouds which send down the precious rain the musk scented breezes and life giving zephyrs the air is perfectly temperate the rain falls the sun shines the fecundating wind wafts the clouds the world is renewed and the breath of life appears in plants in animals and in men Earthly beings pass from one condition to another All things are clothed in new garments and the black earth is covered with herbage mountains and plains are adorned with verdure trees bear leaves and blossoms gardens bring forth flowers and fragrant herbs The world becomes another world and it attains to a life giving spirit The earth was a lifeless body it finds a new spirit and produces endless beauty grace and freshness Thus the spring is the cause of new life and infuses a new spirit Afterward comes the summer when the heat increases and growth and development attain their greatest power The energy of life in the vegetable kingdom reaches to the degree of perfection the fruit appears and the time of harvest ripens a seed has become a sheaf and the food is stored for winter Afterward comes tumultuous autumn when unwholesome and sterile winds blow it is the season of sickness when all things are withered and the balmy air is vitiated The breezes of spring are changed to autumn winds the fertile green trees have become withered and bare flowers and fragrant herbs fade away the beautiful garden becomes a dustheap Following this comes the season of winter with cold and tempests It snows rains hails storms thunders and lightens freezes and congeals all plants die and animals languish and are wretched When this state is reached again a new life giving spring returns and the cycle is renewed The season of spring with its hosts of freshness and beauty spreads its tent on the plains and mountains with great pomp and magnificence A second time the form of the creatures is renewed and the creation of beings begins afresh bodies grow and develop the plains and wildernesses become green and fertile trees bring forth blossoms and the spring of last year returns in the utmost fullness and glory Such is and such ought to be the cycle and succession of existence Such is the cycle and revolution of the material world It is the same with the spiritual cycles of the Prophets that is to say the day of the appearance of the Holy Manifestations is the spiritual springtime it is the divine splendor it is the heavenly bounty the breeze of life the rising of the Sun of Reality Spirits are quickened hearts are refreshed and invigorated souls become good existence is set in motion human realities are gladdened and grow and develop in good qualities and perfections General progress is achieved and revival takes place for it is the day of resurrection the time of excitement and ferment and the season of bliss of joy and of intense rapture Afterward the life giving spring ends in fruitful summer The word of God is exalted the Law of God is promulgated all things reach perfection The heavenly table is spread the holy breezes perfume the East and the West the teachings of God conquer the world men become educated praiseworthy results are produced universal progress appears in the world of humanity and the divine bounties surround all things The Sun of Reality rises from the horizon of the Kingdom with the greatest power and heat When it reaches the meridian it will begin to decline and descend and the spiritual summer will be followed by autumn when growth and development are arrested Breezes change into blighting winds and the unwholesome season dissipates the beauty and freshness of the gardens plains and bowers that is to say attraction and goodwill do not remain divine qualities are changed the radiance of hearts is dimmed the spirituality of souls is altered virtues are replaced by vices and holiness and purity disappear Only the name of the Religion of God remains and the exoteric forms of the divine teachings The foundations of the Religion of God are destroyed and annihilated and nothing but forms and customs exist Divisions appear firmness is changed into instability and spirits become dead hearts languish souls become inert and winter arrives that is to say the coldness of ignorance envelops the world and the darkness of human error prevails After this come indifference disobedience inconsiderateness indolence baseness animal instincts and the coldness and insensibility of stones It is like the season of winter when the terrestrial globe deprived of the effect of the heat of the sun becomes desolate and dreary When the world of intelligence and thought has reached to this state there remain only continual death and perpetual nonexistence When the season of winter has had its effect again the spiritual springtime returns and a new cycle appears Spiritual breezes blow the luminous dawn gleams the divine clouds give rain the rays of the Sun of Reality shine forth the contingent world attains unto a new life and is clad in a wonderful garment All the signs and the gifts of the past springtime reappear with perhaps even greater splendor in this new season The spiritual cycles of the Sun of Reality are like the cycles of the material sun they are always revolving and being renewed The Sun of Reality like the material sun has numerous rising and dawning places one day it rises from the zodiacal sign of Cancer another day from the sign of Libra or Aquarius another time it is from the sign of Aries that it diffuses its rays But the sun is one sun and one reality the people of knowledge are lovers of the sun and are not fascinated by the places of its rising and dawning The people of perception are the seekers of the truth and not of the places of its appearance nor of its dawning points therefore they will adore the Sun from whatever point in the zodiac it may appear and they will seek the Reality in every Sanctified Soul Who manifests it Such people always attain to the truth and are not veiled from the Sun of the Divine World So the lover of the sun and the seeker of the light will always turn toward the sun whether it shines from the sign of Aries or gives its bounty from the sign of Cancer or radiates from Gemini but the ignorant and uninstructed are lovers of the signs of the zodiac and enamored and fascinated by the rising places and not by the sun When it was in the sign of Cancer they turned toward it though afterward the sun changed to the sign of Libra as they were lovers of the sign they turned toward it and attached themselves to it and were deprived of the influences of the sun merely because it had changed its place For example once the Sun of Reality poured forth its rays from the sign of Abraham and then it dawned from the sign of Moses and illuminated the horizon Afterward it rose with the greatest power and brilliancy from the sign of Christ Those who were the seekers of Reality worshiped that Reality wherever they saw it but those who were attached to Abraham were deprived of its influences when it shone upon Sinai and illuminated the reality of Moses Those who held fast to Moses when the Sun of Reality shone from Christ with the utmost radiance and lordly splendor were also veiled and so forth Therefore man must be the seeker after the Reality and he will find that Reality in each of the Sanctified Souls He must be fascinated and enraptured and attracted to the divine bounty he must be like the butterfly who is the lover of the light from whatever lamp it may shine and like the nightingale who is the lover of the rose in whatever garden it may grow If the sun were to rise in the West it would still be the sun one must not withdraw from it on account of its rising place nor consider the West to be always the place of sunset In the same way one must look for the heavenly bounties and seek for the Divine Aurora In every place where it appears one must become its distracted lover Consider that if the Jews had not kept turning to the horizon of Moses and had only regarded the Sun of Reality without any doubt they would have recognized the Sun in the dawning place of the reality of Christ in the greatest divine splendor But alas a thousand times alas attaching themselves to the outward words of Moses they were deprived of the divine bounties and the lordly splendors fifteen TRUE WEALTH The honor and exaltation of every existing being depends upon causes and circumstances The excellency the adornment and the perfection of the earth is to be verdant and fertile through the bounty of the clouds of springtime Plants grow flowers and fragrant herbs spring up fruit bearing trees become full of blossoms and bring forth fresh and new fruit Gardens become beautiful and meadows adorned mountains and plains are clad in a green robe and gardens fields villages and cities are decorated This is the prosperity of the mineral world The height of exaltation and the perfection of the vegetable world is that a tree should grow on the bank of a stream of fresh water that a gentle breeze should blow on it that the warmth of the sun should shine on it that a gardener should attend to its cultivation and that day by day it should develop and yield fruit But its real prosperity is to progress into the animal and human world and replace that which has been exhausted in the bodies of animals and men The exaltation of the animal world is to possess perfect members organs and powers and to have all its needs supplied This is its chief glory its honor and exaltation So the supreme happiness of an animal is to have possession of a green and fertile meadow perfectly pure flowing water and a lovely verdant forest If these things are provided for it no greater prosperity can be imagined For example if a bird builds its nest in a green and fruitful forest in a beautiful high place upon a strong tree and at the top of a lofty branch and if it finds all it needs of seeds and water this is its perfect prosperity But real prosperity for the animal consists in passing from the animal world to the human world like the microscopic beings that through the water and air enter into man and are assimilated and replace that which has been consumed in his body This is the great honor and prosperity for the animal world no greater honor can be conceived for it Therefore it is evident and clear that this wealth this comfort and this material abundance form the complete prosperity of minerals vegetables and animals No riches wealth comfort or ease of the material world is equal to the wealth of a bird all the areas of these plains and mountains are its dwelling and all the seeds and harvests are its food and wealth and all the lands villages meadows pastures forests and wildernesses are its possessions Now which is the richer this bird or the most wealthy man for no matter how many seeds it may take or bestow its wealth does not decrease Then it is clear that the honor and exaltation of man must be something more than material riches Material comforts are only a branch but the root of the exaltation of man is the good attributes and virtues which are the adornments of his reality These are the divine appearances the heavenly bounties the sublime emotions the love and knowledge of God universal wisdom intellectual perception scientific discoveries justice equity truthfulness benevolence natural courage and innate fortitude the respect for rights and the keeping of agreements and covenants rectitude in all circumstances serving the truth under all conditions the sacrifice of one s life for the good of all people kindness and esteem for all nations obedience to the teachings of God service in the Divine Kingdom the guidance of the people and the education of the nations and races This is the prosperity of the human world This is the exaltation of man in the world This is eternal life and heavenly honor These virtues do not appear from the reality of man except through the power of God and the divine teachings for they need supernatural power for their manifestation It may be that in the world of nature a trace of these perfections may appear but they are unstable and ephemeral they are like the rays of the sun upon the wall As the compassionate God has placed such a wonderful crown upon the head of man man should strive that its brilliant jewels may become visible in the world PART TWO SOME CHRISTIAN SUBJECTS sixteen OUTWARD FORMS AND SYMBOLS MUST BE USED TO CONVEY INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTIONS A subject that is essential seventy seven for the comprehension of the questions that we have mentioned and of others of which we are about to speak so that the essence of the problems may be understood is this that human knowledge is of two kinds 
6385_220959_000002_000001	train-clean-100	One is the knowledge of things perceptible to the senses that is to say things which the eye or ear or smell or taste or touch can perceive which are called objective or sensible 
6385_220959_000002_000002	train-clean-100	So the sun because it can be seen is said to be objective and in the same way sounds are sensible because the ear hears them perfumes are sensible because they can be inhaled and the sense of smell perceives them foods are sensible because the palate perceives their sweetness sourness or saltness heat and cold are sensible because the feelings perceive them These are said to be sensible realities 
none	none	The other kind of human knowledge is intellectual that is to say it is a reality of the intellect it has no outward form and no place and is not perceptible to the senses 
6385_220959_000003_000001	train-clean-100	For example the power of intellect is not sensible none of the inner qualities of man is a sensible thing on the contrary they are intellectual realities 
6385_220959_000003_000002	train-clean-100	So love is a mental reality and not sensible for this reality the ear does not hear the eye does not see the smell does not perceive the taste does not discern the touch does not feel 
6385_220959_000003_000003	train-clean-100	Even ethereal matter the forces of which are said in physics to be heat light electricity and magnetism is an intellectual reality and is not sensible 
6385_220959_000003_000004	train-clean-100	In the same way nature also in its essence is an intellectual reality and is not sensible the human spirit is an intellectual not sensible reality 
6385_220959_000003_000005	train-clean-100	In explaining these intellectual realities one is obliged to express them by sensible figures because in exterior existence there is nothing that is not material 
6385_220959_000003_000006	train-clean-100	Therefore to explain the reality of the spirit its condition its station one is obliged to give explanations under the forms of sensible things because in the external world all that exists is sensible 
none	none	For example grief and happiness are intellectual things when you wish to express those spiritual qualities you say My heart is oppressed my heart is dilated though the heart of man is neither oppressed nor dilated 
6385_220959_000003_000008	train-clean-100	This is an intellectual or spiritual state to explain which you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures 
none	none	Another example you say such an individual made great progress though he is remaining in the same place or again such a one s position was exalted although like everyone else he walks upon the earth 
6385_220959_000003_000010	train-clean-100	This exaltation and this progress are spiritual states and intellectual realities but to explain them you are obliged to have recourse to sensible figures because in the exterior world there is nothing that is not sensible 
6385_220959_000004_000000	train-clean-100	So the symbol of knowledge is light and of ignorance darkness but reflect is knowledge sensible light or ignorance sensible darkness 
6385_220959_000004_000001	train-clean-100	No they are merely symbols 
6385_220959_000004_000002	train-clean-100	These are only intellectual states but when you desire to express them outwardly you call knowledge light and ignorance darkness 
none	none	You say My heart was gloomy and it became enlightened Now that light of knowledge and that darkness of ignorance are intellectual realities not sensible ones but when we seek for explanations in the external world we are obliged to give them a sensible form Then it is evident that the dove which descended upon Christ was not a material dove but it was a spiritual state which that it might be comprehensible was expressed by a sensible figure 
6385_220959_000005_000001	train-clean-100	Thus in the Old Testament it is said that God appeared as a pillar of fire this does not signify the material form it is an intellectual reality which is expressed by a sensible image 
6385_220959_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Christ says The Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father Was Christ within God or God within Christ 
none	none	No in the name of God 
6385_220959_000006_000002	train-clean-100	On the contrary this is an intellectual state which is expressed in a sensible figure 
6385_220959_000007_000000	train-clean-100	We come to the explanation of the words of Baha u llah when He says O king 
none	none	I was but a man like others asleep upon My couch when lo the breezes of the All Glorious were wafted over Me and taught Me the knowledge of all that hath been This thing is not from Me but from One Who is Almighty and All Knowing seventy eight This is the state of manifestation it is not sensible it is an intellectual reality exempt and freed from time from past present and future it is an explanation a simile a metaphor and is not to be accepted literally it is not a state that can be comprehended by man 
6385_220959_000007_000003	train-clean-100	Sleeping and waking is passing from one state to another 
6385_220959_000007_000004	train-clean-100	Sleeping is the condition of repose and wakefulness is the condition of movement 
6385_220959_000007_000005	train-clean-100	Sleeping is the state of silence wakefulness is the state of speech 
6385_220959_000007_000006	train-clean-100	Sleeping is the state of mystery wakefulness is the state of manifestation 
6385_220959_000008_000000	train-clean-100	For example it is a Persian and Arabic expression to say that the earth was asleep and the spring came and it awoke or the earth was dead and the spring came and it revived 
6385_220959_000008_000001	train-clean-100	These expressions are metaphors allegories mystic explanations in the world of signification 
6385_220959_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Briefly the Holy Manifestations have ever been and ever will be Luminous Realities no change or variation takes place in Their essence Before declaring Their manifestation They are silent and quiet like a sleeper and after Their manifestation They speak and are illuminated like one who is awake 
none	none	seventeen THE BIRTH OF CHRIST 
6385_220959_000011_000000	train-clean-100	Question How was Christ born of the Holy Spirit 
6385_220959_000012_000000	train-clean-100	Answer In regard to this question theologians and materialists disagree The theologians believe that Christ was born of the Holy Spirit but the materialists think this is impossible and inadmissible and that without doubt He had a human father 
none	none	In the Qur an it is said And We sent Our Spirit unto her and He appeared unto her in the shape of a perfect man seventy nine meaning that the Holy Spirit took the likeness of the human form as an image is produced in a mirror and he addressed Mary 
6385_220959_000014_000000	train-clean-100	The materialists believe that there must be marriage and say that a living body cannot be created from a lifeless body and without male and female there cannot be fecundation 
6385_220959_000014_000001	train-clean-100	And they think that not only with man but also with animals and plants it is impossible 
6385_220959_000014_000002	train-clean-100	For this union of the male and female exists in all living beings and plants

6385_220959_000017_000000	train-clean-100	The theologians say Then from your statement it has become evident and clear that mankind is phenomenal upon the globe and not eternal

none	none	To conclude the splendor and honor of the holy souls and the Divine Manifestations come from Their heavenly perfections bounties and glory and from nothing else nineteen THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST Question It is said in the Gospel of saint Matthew chapter three verses thirteen fourteen fifteen Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him But John forbade Him saying I have need to be baptized of Thee and comest Thou to me And Jesus answering said unto him Suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness Then he suffered Him What is the wisdom of this since Christ possessed all essential perfection why did He need baptism Answer The principle of baptism is purification by repentance John admonished and exhorted the people and caused them to repent then he baptized them Therefore it is apparent that this baptism is a symbol of repentance from all sin its meaning is expressed in these words O God as my body has become purified and cleansed from physical impurities in the same way purify and sanctify my spirit from the impurities of the world of nature which are not worthy of the Threshold of Thy Unity Repentance is the return from disobedience to obedience Man after remoteness and deprivation from God repents and undergoes purification and this is a symbol signifying O God make my heart good and pure freed and sanctified from all save Thy love As Christ desired that this institution of John should be used at that time by all He Himself conformed to it in order to awaken the people and to complete the law of the former religion Although the ablution of repentance was the institution of John it was in reality formerly practiced in the religion of God Christ was not in need of baptism but as at that time it was an acceptable and praiseworthy action and a sign of the glad tidings of the Kingdom therefore He confirmed it However afterward He said the true baptism is not with material water but it must be with spirit and with water In this case water does not signify material water for elsewhere it is explicitly said baptism is with spirit and with fire from which it is clear that the reference is not to material fire and material water for baptism with fire is impossible Therefore the spirit is the bounty of God the water is knowledge and life and the fire is the love of God For material water does not purify the heart of man no it cleanses his body But the heavenly water and spirit which are knowledge and life make the human heart good and pure the heart which receives a portion of the bounty of the Spirit becomes sanctified good and pure that is to say the reality of man becomes purified and sanctified from the impurities of the world of nature These natural impurities are evil qualities anger lust worldliness pride lying hypocrisy fraud self love et cetera Man cannot free himself from the rage of the carnal passions except by the help of the Holy Spirit That is why He says baptism with the spirit with water and with fire is necessary and that it is essential that is to say the spirit of divine bounty the water of knowledge and life and the fire of the love of God Man must be baptized with this spirit this water and this fire so as to become filled with the eternal bounty Otherwise what is the use of baptizing with material water No this baptism with water was a symbol of repentance and of seeking forgiveness of sins But in the cycle of Baha u llah there is no longer need of this symbol for its reality which is to be baptized with the spirit and love of God is understood and established twenty THE NECESSITY OF BAPTISM Question Is the ablution of baptism useful and necessary or is it useless and unnecessary In the first case if it is useful why was it abrogated And in the second case if it is useless why did John practice it Answer The change in conditions alterations and transformations are necessities of the essence of beings and essential necessities cannot be separated from the reality of things So it is absolutely impossible to separate heat from fire humidity from water or light from the sun for they are essential necessities As the change and alteration of conditions are necessities for beings so laws also are changed and altered in accordance with the changes and alterations of the times For example in the time of Moses His Law was conformed and adapted to the conditions of the time but in the days of Christ these conditions had changed and altered to such an extent that the Mosaic Law was no longer suited and adapted to the needs of mankind and it was therefore abrogated Thus it was that Christ broke the Sabbath and forbade divorce After Christ four disciples among whom were Peter and Paul permitted the use of animal food forbidden by the Bible except the eating of those animals which had been strangled or which were sacrificed to idols and of blood eighty four They also forbade fornication They maintained these four commandments Afterward Paul permitted even the eating of strangled animals those sacrificed to idols and blood and only maintained the prohibition of fornication So in chapter fourteen verse fourteen of his Epistle to the Romans Paul writes I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean Also in the Epistle of Paul to Titus chapter one verse fifteen Unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled Now this change these alterations and this abrogation are due to the impossibility of comparing the time of Christ with that of Moses The conditions and requirements in the later period were entirely changed and altered The former laws were therefore abrogated The existence of the world may be compared to that of a man and the Prophets and Messengers of God to skillful doctors The human being cannot remain in one condition different maladies occur which have each a special remedy The skillful physician does not give the same medicine to cure each disease and each malady but he changes remedies and medicines according to the different necessities of the diseases and constitutions One person may have a severe illness caused by fever and the skilled doctor will give him cooling remedies and when at some other time the condition of this person has changed and fever is replaced by chills without doubt the skilled doctor will discard cooling medicine and permit the use of heating drugs This change and alteration is required by the condition of the patient and is an evident proof of the skill of the physician Consider could the Law of the Old Testament be enforced at this epoch and time No in the name of God it would be impossible and impracticable therefore most certainly God abrogated the laws of the Old Testament at the time of Christ Reflect also that baptism in the days of John the Baptist was used to awaken and admonish the people to repent from all sin and to watch for the appearance of the Kingdom of Christ But at present in Asia the Catholics and the Orthodox Church plunge newly born children into water mixed with olive oil and many of them become ill from the shock at the time of baptism they struggle and become agitated In other places the clergy sprinkle the water of baptism on the forehead But neither from the first form nor from the second do the children derive any spiritual benefit Then what result is obtained from this form Other peoples are amazed and wonder why the infant is plunged into the water since this is neither the cause of the spiritual awakening of the child nor of its faith or conversion but it is only a custom which is followed In the time of John the Baptist it was not so no at first John used to exhort the people and to guide them to repentance from sin and to fill them with the desire to await the manifestation of Christ Whoever received the ablution of baptism and repented of sins in absolute humility and meekness would also purify and cleanse his body from outward impurities With perfect yearning night and day he would constantly wait for the manifestation of Christ and the entrance to the Kingdom of the Spirit of God eighty five To recapitulate our meaning is that the change and modification of conditions and the altered requirements of different centuries and times are the cause of the abrogation of laws For a time comes when these laws are no longer suitably adapted to conditions Consider how very different are the requirements of the first centuries of the Middle Ages and of modern times Is it possible that the laws of the first centuries could be enforced at present It is evident that it would be impossible and impracticable In the same manner after the lapse of a few centuries the requirements of the present time will not be the same as those of the future and certainly there will be change and alteration In Europe the laws are unceasingly altered and modified in bygone years how many laws existed in the organizations and systems of Europe which are now abrogated These changes and alterations are due to the variation and mutation of thought conditions and customs If it were not so the prosperity of the world of humanity would be wrecked For example there is in the Pentateuch a law that if anyone break the Sabbath he shall be put to death Moreover there are ten sentences of death in the Pentateuch Would it be possible to keep these laws in our time It is clear that it would be absolutely impossible Consequently there are changes and modifications in the laws and these are a sufficient proof of the supreme wisdom of God This subject needs deep thought Then the cause of these changes will be evident and apparent Blessed are those who reflect twenty one THE SYMBOLISM OF THE BREAD AND THE WINE Question The Christ said I am the living bread which came down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die eighty six What is the meaning of this utterance Answer This bread signifies the heavenly food and divine perfections So If any man eateth of this bread means if any man acquires heavenly bounty receives the divine light or partakes of Christ s perfections he thereby gains everlasting life The blood also signifies the spirit of life and the divine perfections the lordly splendor and eternal bounty For all the members of the body gain vital substance from the circulation of the blood In the Gospel of saint John chapter six verse twenty six it is written Ye seek Me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled It is evident that the bread of which the disciples ate and were filled was the heavenly bounty for in verse thirty three of the same chapter it is said For the bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world It is clear that the body of Christ did not descend from heaven but it came from the womb of Mary and that which descended from the heaven of God was the spirit of Christ As the Jews thought that Christ spoke of His body they made objections for it is said in the forty second verse of the same chapter And they said Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith I came down from heaven Reflect how clear it is that what Christ meant by the heavenly bread was His spirit His bounties His perfections and His teachings for it is said in the sixty third verse It is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing Therefore it is evident that the spirit of Christ is a heavenly grace which descends from heaven whosoever receives light from that spirit in abundance that is to say the heavenly teachings finds everlasting life That is why it is said in the thirty fifth verse And Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to Me shall never hunger and he that believeth on Me shall never thirst Notice that coming to Him He expresses as eating and belief in Him as drinking Then it is evident and established that the celestial food is the divine bounties the spiritual splendors the heavenly teachings the universal meaning of Christ To eat is to draw near to Him and to drink is to believe in Him For Christ had an elemental body and a celestial form The elemental body was crucified but the heavenly form is living and eternal and the cause of everlasting life the first was the human nature and the second is the divine nature It is thought by some that the Eucharist is the reality of Christ and that the Divinity and the Holy Spirit descend into and exist in it Now when once the Eucharist is taken after a few moments it is simply disintegrated and entirely transformed Therefore how can such a thought be conceived God forbid certainly it is an absolute fantasy To conclude through the manifestation of Christ the divine teachings which are an eternal bounty were spread abroad the light of guidance shone forth and the spirit of life was conferred on man Whoever found guidance became living whoever remained lost was seized by enduring death This bread which came down from heaven was the divine body of Christ His spiritual elements which the disciples ate and through which they gained eternal life The disciples had taken many meals from the hand of Christ why was the last supper distinguished from the others It is evident that the heavenly bread did not signify this material bread but rather the divine nourishment of the spiritual body of Christ the divine graces and heavenly perfections of which His disciples partook and with which they became filled In the same way reflect that when Christ blessed the bread and gave it to His disciples saying This is My body eighty seven and gave grace to them He was with them in person in presence and form He was not transformed into bread and wine if He had been turned into bread and wine He could not have remained with the disciples in body in person and in presence Then it is clear that the bread and wine were symbols which signified I have given you My bounties and perfections and when you have received this bounty you have gained eternal life and have partaken of your share and your portion of the heavenly nourishment twenty two MIRACLES Question It is recorded that miracles were performed by Christ Are the reports of these miracles really to be accepted literally or have they another meaning It has been proved by exact science that the essence of things does not change and that all beings are under one universal law and organization from which they cannot deviate and therefore that which is contrary to universal law is impossible Answer The Holy Manifestations are the sources of miracles and the originators of wonderful signs For Them any difficult and impracticable thing is possible and easy For through a supernatural power wonders appear from Them and by this power which is beyond nature They influence the world of nature From all the Manifestations marvelous things have appeared But in the Holy Books an especial terminology is employed and for the Manifestations these miracles and wonderful signs have no importance They do not even wish to mention them For if we consider miracles a great proof they are still only proofs and arguments for those who are present when they are performed and not for those who are absent For example if we relate to a seeker a stranger to Moses and Christ marvelous signs he will deny them and will say Wonderful signs are also continually related of false gods by the testimony of many people and they are affirmed in the Books The Brahmans have written a book about wonderful prodigies from Brahma He will also say How can we know that the Jews and the Christians speak the truth and that the Brahmans tell a lie For both are generally admitted traditions which are collected in books and may be supposed to be true or false The same may be said of other religions if one is true all are true if one is accepted all must be accepted Therefore miracles are not a proof For if they are proofs for those who are present they fail as proofs to those who are absent But in the day of the Manifestation the people with insight see that all the conditions of the Manifestation are miracles for They are superior to all others and this alone is an absolute miracle Recollect that Christ solitary and alone without a helper or protector without armies and legions and under the greatest oppression uplifted the standard of God before all the people of the world and withstood them and finally conquered all although outwardly He was crucified Now this is a veritable miracle which can never be denied There is no need of any other proof of the truth of Christ The outward miracles have no importance for the people of Reality If a blind man receives sight for example he will finally again become sightless for he will die and be deprived of all his senses and powers Therefore causing the blind man to see is comparatively of little importance for this faculty of sight will at last disappear If the body of a dead person be resuscitated of what use is it since the body will die again But it is important to give perception and eternal life that is the spiritual and divine life For this physical life is not immortal and its existence is equivalent to nonexistence So it is that Christ said to one of His disciples Let the dead bury their dead for That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit eighty eight Observe those who in appearance were physically alive Christ considered dead for life is the eternal life and existence is the real existence Wherever in the Holy Books they speak of raising the dead the meaning is that the dead were blessed by eternal life where it is said that the blind received sight the signification is that he obtained the true perception where it is said a deaf man received hearing the meaning is that he acquired spiritual and heavenly hearing This is ascertained from the text of the Gospel where Christ said These are like those of whom Isaiah said They have eyes and see not they have ears and hear not and I healed them eighty nine The meaning is not that the Manifestations are unable to perform miracles for They have all power But for Them inner sight spiritual healing and eternal life are the valuable and important things Consequently whenever it is recorded in the Holy Books that such a one was blind and recovered his sight the meaning is that he was inwardly blind and that he obtained spiritual vision or that he was ignorant and became wise or that he was negligent and became heedful or that he was worldly and became heavenly As this inner sight hearing life and healing are eternal they are of importance What comparatively is the importance the value and the worth of this animal life with its powers In a few days it will cease like fleeting thoughts For example if one relights an extinguished lamp it will again become extinguished but the light of the sun is always luminous This is of importance twenty three THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST Question What is the meaning of Christ s resurrection after three days Answer The resurrections of the Divine Manifestations are not of the body All Their states Their conditions Their acts the things They have established Their teachings Their expressions Their parables and Their instructions have a spiritual and divine signification and have no connection with material things For example there is the subject of Christ s coming from heaven it is clearly stated in many places in the Gospel that the Son of man came from heaven He is in heaven and He will go to heaven So in chapter six verse thirty eight of the Gospel of John it is written For I came down from heaven and also in verse forty two we find And they said Is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know How is it then that he saith I came down from heaven Also in John chapter three verse thirteen And no man hath ascended up to heaven but He that came down from heaven even the Son of man which is in heaven Observe that it is said The Son of man is in heaven while at that time Christ was on earth Notice also that it is said that Christ came from heaven though He came from the womb of Mary and His body was born of Mary It is clear then that when it is said that the Son of man is come from heaven this has not an outward but an inward signification it is a spiritual not a material fact The meaning is that though apparently Christ was born from the womb of Mary in reality He came from heaven from the center of the Sun of Reality from the Divine World and the Spiritual Kingdom And as it has become evident that Christ came from the spiritual heaven of the Divine Kingdom therefore His disappearance under the earth for three days has an inner signification and is not an outward fact In the same way His resurrection from the interior of the earth is also symbolical it is a spiritual and divine fact and not material and likewise His ascension to heaven is a spiritual and not material ascension Beside these explanations it has been established and proved by science that the visible heaven is a limitless area void and empty where innumerable stars and planets revolve Therefore we say that the meaning of Christ s resurrection is as follows the disciples were troubled and agitated after the martyrdom of Christ The Reality of Christ which signifies His teachings His bounties His perfections and His spiritual power was hidden and concealed for two or three days after His martyrdom and was not resplendent and manifest No rather it was lost for the believers were few in number and were troubled and agitated The Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body and when after three days the disciples became assured and steadfast and began to serve the Cause of Christ and resolved to spread the divine teachings putting His counsels into practice and arising to serve Him the Reality of Christ became resplendent and His bounty appeared His religion found life His teachings and His admonitions became evident and visible In other words the Cause of Christ was like a lifeless body until the life and the bounty of the Holy Spirit surrounded it Such is the meaning of the resurrection of Christ and this was a true resurrection But as the clergy have neither understood the meaning of the Gospels nor comprehended the symbols therefore it has been said that religion is in contradiction to science and science in opposition to religion as for example this subject of the ascension of Christ with an elemental body to the visible heaven is contrary to the science of mathematics But when the truth of this subject becomes clear and the symbol is explained science in no way contradicts it but on the contrary science and the intelligence affirm it twenty four THE DESCENT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT UPON THE APOSTLES Question What is the manner and what is the meaning of the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles as described in the Gospel Answer The descent of the Holy Spirit is not like the entrance of air into man it is an expression and a simile rather than an exact or a literal image No rather it is like the entrance of the image of the sun into the mirror that is to say its splendor becomes apparent in it After the death of Christ the disciples were troubled and their ideas and thoughts were discordant and contradictory later they became firm and united and at the feast of Pentecost they gathered together and detached themselves from the things of this world Disregarding themselves they renounced their comfort and worldly happiness sacrificing their body and soul to the Beloved abandoning their houses and becoming wanderers and homeless even forgetting their own existence Then they received the help of God and the power of the Holy Spirit became manifested the spirituality of Christ triumphed and the love of God reigned They were given help at that time and dispersed in different directions teaching the Cause of God and giving forth proofs and evidences So the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles means their attraction by the Christ Spirit whereby they acquired stability and firmness Through the spirit of the love of God they gained a new life and they saw Christ living helping and protecting them They were like drops and they became seas they were like feeble insects and they became majestic eagles they were weak and became powerful They were like mirrors facing the sun verily some of the light became manifest in them twenty five THE HOLY SPIRIT Question What is the Holy Spirit Answer The Holy Spirit is the Bounty of God and the luminous rays which emanate from the Manifestations for the focus of the rays of the Sun of Reality was Christ and from this glorious focus which is the Reality of Christ the Bounty of God reflected upon the other mirrors which were the reality of the Apostles The descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles signifies that the glorious divine bounties reflected and appeared in their reality Moreover entrance and exit descent and ascent are characteristics of bodies and not of spirits that is to say sensible realities enter and come forth but intellectual subtleties and mental realities such as intelligence love knowledge imagination and thought do not enter nor come forth nor descend but rather they have direct connection For example knowledge which is a state attained to by the intelligence is an intellectual condition and entering and coming out of the mind are imaginary conditions but the mind is connected with the acquisition of knowledge like images reflected in a mirror Therefore as it is evident and clear that the intellectual realities do not enter and descend and it is absolutely impossible that the Holy Spirit should ascend and descend enter come out or penetrate it can only be that the Holy Spirit appears in splendor as the sun appears in the mirror In some passages in the Holy Books the Spirit is spoken of signifying a certain person as it is currently said in speech and conversation that such a person is an embodied spirit or he is a personification of mercy and generosity In this case it is the light we look at and not the glass In the Gospel of John in speaking of the Promised One Who was to come after Christ it is said in chapter sixteen verses twelve thirteen I have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now Howbeit when He the Spirit of truth is come He will guide you into all truth for He shall not speak of Himself but whatsoever He shall hear that shall He speak Now consider carefully that from these words for He shall not speak of Himself but whatsoever He shall hear that shall He speak it is clear that the Spirit of truth is embodied in a Man Who has individuality Who has ears to hear and a tongue to speak In the same way the name Spirit of God is used in relation to Christ as you speak of a light meaning both the light and the lamp twenty six THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST AND THE DAY OF JUDGMENT It is said in the Holy Books that Christ will come again and that His coming depends upon the fulfillment of certain signs when He comes it will be with these signs For example The sun will be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory ninety Baha u llah has explained these verses in the Kitab i Iqan ninety one There is no need of repetition refer to it and you will understand these sayings But I have something further to say upon this subject At His first coming Christ also came from heaven as it is explicitly stated in the Gospel Christ Himself says And no man hath ascended up to heaven but He that came down from heaven even the Son of man which is in heaven ninety two It is clear to all that Christ came from heaven although apparently He came from the womb of Mary At the first coming He came from heaven though apparently from the womb in the same way also at His second coming He will come from heaven though apparently from the womb The conditions that are indicated in the Gospel for the second coming of Christ are the same as those that were mentioned for the first coming as we said before The Book of Isaiah announces that the Messiah will conquer the East and the West and all nations of the world will come under His shadow that His Kingdom will be established that He will come from an unknown place that the sinners will be judged and that justice will prevail to such a degree that the wolf and the lamb the leopard and the kid the sucking child and the asp shall all gather at one spring and in one meadow and one dwelling ninety three The first coming was also under these conditions though outwardly none of them came to pass Therefore the Jews rejected Christ and God forbid called the Messiah masi kh ninety four considered Him to be the destroyer of the edifice of God regarded Him as the breaker of the Sabbath and the Law and sentenced Him to death Nevertheless each one of these conditions had a signification that the Jews did not understand therefore they were debarred from perceiving the truth of Christ The second coming of Christ also will be in like manner the signs and conditions which have been spoken of all have meanings and are not to be taken literally Among other things it is said that the stars will fall upon the earth The stars are endless and innumerable and modern mathematicians have established and proved scientifically that the globe of the sun is estimated to be about one million and a half times greater than the earth and each of the fixed stars to be a thousand times larger than the sun If these stars were to fall upon the surface of the earth how could they find place there It would be as though a thousand million of Himalaya mountains were to fall upon a grain of mustard seed According to reason and science this thing is quite impossible What is even more strange is that Christ said Perhaps I shall come when you are yet asleep for the coming of the Son of man is like the coming of a thief ninety five Perhaps the thief will be in the house and the owner will not know it It is clear and evident that these signs have symbolic signification and that they are not literal They are fully explained in the Kitab i Iqan Refer to it twenty seven THE TRINITY Question What is the meaning of the Trinity of the Three Persons in One Answer The Divine Reality which is purified and sanctified from the understanding of human beings and which can never be imagined by the people of wisdom and of intelligence is exempt from all conception That Lordly Reality admits of no division for division and multiplicity are properties of creatures which are contingent existences and not accidents which happen to the self existent The Divine Reality is sanctified from singleness then how much more from plurality The descent of that Lordly Reality into conditions and degrees would be equivalent to imperfection and contrary to perfection and is therefore absolutely impossible It perpetually has been and is in the exaltation of holiness and sanctity All that is mentioned of the Manifestations and Dawning places of God signifies the divine reflection and not a descent into the conditions of existence ninety six God is pure perfection and creatures are but imperfections For God to descend into the conditions of existence would be the greatest of imperfections on the contrary His manifestation His appearance His rising are like the reflection of the sun in a clear pure polished mirror All the creatures are evident signs of God like the earthly beings upon all of which the rays of the sun shine But upon the plains the mountains the trees and fruits only a portion of the light shines through which they become visible and are reared and attain to the object of their existence while the Perfect Man ninety seven is in the condition of a clear mirror in which the Sun of Reality becomes visible and manifest with all its qualities and perfections So the Reality of Christ was a clear and polished mirror of the greatest purity and fineness The Sun of Reality the Essence of Divinity reflected itself in this mirror and manifested its light and heat in it but from the exaltation of its holiness and the heaven of its sanctity the Sun did not descend to dwell and abide in the mirror No it continues to subsist in its exaltation and sublimity while appearing and becoming manifest in the mirror in beauty and perfection Now if we say that we have seen the Sun in two mirrors one the Christ and one the Holy Spirit that is to say that we have seen three Suns one in heaven and the two others on the earth we speak truly And if we say that there is one Sun and it is pure singleness and has no partner and equal we again speak truly The epitome of the discourse is that the Reality of Christ was a clear mirror and the Sun of Reality that is to say the Essence of Oneness with its infinite perfections and attributes became visible in the mirror The meaning is not that the Sun which is the Essence of the Divinity became divided and multiplied for the Sun is one but it appeared in the mirror This is why Christ said The Father is in the Son meaning that the Sun is visible and manifest in this mirror The Holy Spirit is the Bounty of God which becomes visible and evident in the Reality of Christ The Sonship station is the heart of Christ and the Holy Spirit is the station of the spirit of Christ Hence it has become certain and proved that the Essence of Divinity is absolutely unique and has no equal no likeness no equivalent This is the signification of the Three Persons of the Trinity If it were otherwise the foundations of the Religion of God would rest upon an illogical proposition which the mind could never conceive and how can the mind be forced to believe a thing which it cannot conceive A thing cannot be grasped by the intelligence except when it is clothed in an intelligible form otherwise it is but an effort of the imagination It has now become clear from this explanation what is the meaning of the Three Persons of the Trinity The Oneness of God is also proved twenty eight EXPLANATION OF VERSE FIVE CHAPTER SEVENTEEN OF THE GOSPEL OF saint JOHN And now O Father glorify Thou Me with Thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was ninety eight There are two kinds of priorities one is essential and is not preceded by a cause but its existence is in itself as for example the sun has light in itself for its shining is not dependent on the light of other stars This is called an essential light But the light of the moon is received from the sun for the moon is dependent on the sun for its light therefore the sun with regard to light is the cause and the moon becomes the effect The former is the ancient the precedent the antecedent while the latter is the preceded and the last The second sort of preexistence is the preexistence of time and that has no beginning The Word of God is sanctified from time ninety nine The past the present the future all in relation to God are equal Yesterday today tomorrow do not exist in the sun In the same way there is a priority with regard to glory that is to say the most glorious precedes the glorious Therefore the Reality of Christ Who is the Word of God with regard to essence attributes and glory certainly precedes the creatures Before appearing in the human form the Word of God was in the utmost sanctity and glory existing in perfect beauty and splendor in the height of its magnificence When through the wisdom of God the Most High it shone from the heights of glory in the world of the body the Word of God through this body became oppressed so that it fell into the hands of the Jews and became the captive of the tyrannical and ignorant and at last was crucified That is why He addressed God saying Free Me from the bonds of the world of the body and liberate Me from this cage so that I may ascend to the heights of honor and glory and attain unto the former grandeur and might which existed before the bodily world that I may rejoice in the eternal world and may ascend to the original abode the placeless world the invisible kingdom It is thus that you see even in the kingdom of this world that is to say in the realm of souls and countries that the glory and the grandeur of Christ appeared in this earth after His ascension When in the world of the body He was subject to the contempt and jeers of the weakest nation of the world the Jews who thought it fitting to set a crown of thorns upon His sacred head But after His ascension the bejeweled crowns of all the kings were humbled and bowed before the crown of thorns Behold the glory that the Word of God attained even in this world twenty nine EXPLANATION OF VERSE TWENTY TWO CHAPTER FIFTEEN OF THE FIRST EPISTLE OF saint PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS Question In verse twenty two of chapter fifteen of one Corinthians it is written For as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive What is the meaning of these words Answer Know that there are two natures in man the physical nature and the spiritual nature The physical nature is inherited from Adam and the spiritual nature is inherited from the Reality of the Word of God which is the spirituality of Christ The physical nature is born of Adam but the spiritual nature is born from the bounty of the Holy Spirit The first is the source of all imperfection the second is the source of all perfection The Christ sacrificed Himself so that men might be freed from the imperfections of the physical nature and might become possessed of the virtues of the spiritual nature This spiritual nature which came into existence through the bounty of the Divine Reality is the union of all perfections and appears through the breath of the Holy Spirit It is the divine perfections it is light spirituality guidance exaltation high aspiration justice love grace kindness to all philanthropy the essence of life It is the reflection of the splendor of the Sun of Reality The Christ is the central point of the Holy Spirit He is born of the Holy Spirit He is raised up by the Holy Spirit He is the descendant of the Holy Spirit that is to say that the Reality of Christ does not descend from Adam no it is born of the Holy Spirit Therefore this verse in Corinthians As in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive means according to this terminology that Adam one hundred is the father of man that is to say He is the cause of the physical life of mankind His was the physical fatherhood He is a living soul but He is not the giver of spiritual life whereas Christ is the cause of the spiritual life of man and with regard to the spirit His was the spiritual fatherhood Adam is a living soul Christ is a quickening spirit This physical world of man is subject to the power of the lusts and sin is the consequence of this power of the lusts for it is not subject to the laws of justice and holiness The body of man is a captive of nature it will act in accordance with whatever nature orders It is therefore certain that sins such as anger jealousy dispute covetousness avarice ignorance prejudice hatred pride and tyranny exist in the physical world All these brutal qualities exist in the nature of man A man who has not had a spiritual education is a brute Like the savages of Africa whose actions habits and morals are purely sensual they act according to the demands of nature to such a degree that they rend and eat one another Thus it is evident that the physical world of man is a world of sin In this physical world man is not distinguished from the animal All sin comes from the demands of nature and these demands which arise from the physical qualities are not sins with respect to the animals while for man they are sin The animal is the source of imperfections such as anger sensuality jealousy avarice cruelty pride all these defects are found in animals but do not constitute sins But in man they are sins Adam is the cause of man s physical life but the Reality of Christ that is to say the Word of God is the cause of spiritual life It is a quickening spirit meaning that all the imperfections which come from the requirements of the physical life of man are transformed into human perfections by the teachings and education of that spirit Therefore Christ was a quickening spirit and the cause of life in all mankind Adam was the cause of physical life and as the physical world of man is the world of imperfections and imperfections are the equivalent of death Paul compared the physical imperfections to death But the mass of the Christians believe that as Adam ate of the forbidden tree He sinned in that He disobeyed and that the disastrous consequences of this disobedience have been transmitted as a heritage and have remained among His descendants Hence Adam became the cause of the death of humanity This explanation is unreasonable and evidently wrong for it means that all men even the Prophets and the Messengers of God without committing any sin or fault but simply because they are the posterity of Adam have become without reason guilty sinners and until the day of the sacrifice of Christ were held captive in hell in painful torment This is far from the justice of God If Adam was a sinner what is the sin of Abraham What is the fault of Isaac or of Joseph Of what is Moses guilty But Christ Who is the Word of God sacrificed Himself This has two meanings an apparent and an esoteric meaning The outward meaning is this Christ s intention was to represent and promote a Cause which was to educate the human world to quicken the children of Adam and to enlighten all mankind and since to represent such a great Cause a Cause which was antagonistic to all the people of the world and all the nations and kingdoms meant that He would be killed and crucified so Christ in proclaiming His mission sacrificed His life He regarded the cross as a throne the wound as a balm the poison as honey and sugar He arose to teach and educate men and so He sacrificed Himself to give the spirit of life He perished in body so as to quicken others by the spirit The second meaning of sacrifice is this Christ was like a seed and this seed sacrificed its own form so that the tree might grow and develop Although the form of the seed was destroyed its reality became apparent in perfect majesty and beauty in the form of a tree The position of Christ was that of absolute perfection He made His divine perfections shine like the sun upon all believing souls and the bounties of the light shone and radiated in the reality of men This is why He says I am the bread which descended from heaven whosoever shall eat of this bread will not die one hundred one that is to say that whosoever shall partake of this divine food will attain unto eternal life that is every one who partakes of this bounty and receives these perfections will find eternal life will obtain preexistent favors will be freed from the darkness of error and will be illuminated by the light of His guidance The form of the seed was sacrificed for the tree but its perfections because of this sacrifice became evident and apparent the tree the branches the leaves and the blossoms being concealed in the seed When the form of the seed was sacrificed its perfections appeared in the perfect form of leaves blossoms and fruits thirty ADAM AND EVE Question What is the truth of the story of Adam and His eating of the fruit of the tree Answer In the Bible it is written that God put Adam in the garden of Eden to cultivate and take care of it and said to Him Eat of every tree of the garden except the tree of good and evil for if You eat of that You will die one hundred two Then it is said that God caused Adam to sleep and He took one of His ribs and created woman in order that she might be His companion After that it is said the serpent induced the woman to eat of the tree saying God has forbidden you to eat of the tree in order that your eyes may not be opened and that you may not know good from evil one hundred three Then Eve ate from the tree and gave unto Adam Who also ate their eyes were opened they found themselves naked and they hid their bodies with leaves In consequence of this act they received the reproaches of God God said to Adam Hast Thou eaten of the forbidden tree Adam answered Eve tempted Me and I did eat God then reproved Eve Eve said The serpent tempted me and I did eat For this the serpent was cursed and enmity was put between the serpent and Eve and between their descendants And God said The man is become like unto Us knowing good and evil and perhaps He will eat of the tree of life and live forever So God guarded the tree of life one hundred four If we take this story in its apparent meaning according to the interpretation of the masses it is indeed extraordinary The intelligence cannot accept it affirm it or imagine it for such arrangements such details such speeches and reproaches are far from being those of an intelligent man how much less of the Divinity that Divinity Who has organized this infinite universe in the most perfect form and its innumerable inhabitants with absolute system strength and perfection We must reflect a little if the literal meaning of this story were attributed to a wise man certainly all would logically deny that this arrangement this invention could have emanated from an intelligent being Therefore this story of Adam and Eve who ate from the tree and their expulsion from Paradise must be thought of simply as a symbol It contains divine mysteries and universal meanings and it is capable of marvelous explanations Only those who are initiated into mysteries and those who are near the Court of the All Powerful are aware of these secrets Hence these verses of the Bible have numerous meanings We will explain one of them and we will say Adam signifies the heavenly spirit of Adam and Eve His human soul For in some passages in the Holy Books where women are mentioned they represent the soul of man The tree of good and evil signifies the human world for the spiritual and divine world is purely good and absolutely luminous but in the human world light and darkness good and evil exist as opposite conditions The meaning of the serpent is attachment to the human world This attachment of the spirit to the human world led the soul and spirit of Adam from the world of freedom to the world of bondage and caused Him to turn from the Kingdom of Unity to the human world When the soul and spirit of Adam entered the human world He came out from the paradise of freedom and fell into the world of bondage From the height of purity and absolute goodness He entered into the world of good and evil The tree of life is the highest degree of the world of existence the position of the Word of God and the supreme Manifestation Therefore that position has been preserved and at the appearance of the most noble supreme Manifestation it became apparent and clear For the position of Adam with regard to the appearance and manifestation of the divine perfections was in the embryonic condition the position of Christ was the condition of maturity and the age of reason and the rising of the Greatest Luminary one hundred five was the condition of the perfection of the essence and of the qualities This is why in the supreme Paradise the tree of life is the expression for the center of absolutely pure sanctity that is to say of the divine supreme Manifestation From the days of Adam until the days of Christ They spoke little of eternal life and the heavenly universal perfections This tree of life was the position of the Reality of Christ through His manifestation it was planted and adorned with everlasting fruits Now consider how far this meaning conforms to the reality For the spirit and the soul of Adam when they were attached to the human world passed from the world of freedom into the world of bondage and His descendants continued in bondage This attachment of the soul and spirit to the human world which is sin was inherited by the descendants of Adam and is the serpent which is always in the midst of and at enmity with the spirits and the descendants of Adam That enmity continues and endures For attachment to the world has become the cause of the bondage of spirits and this bondage is identical with sin which has been transmitted from Adam to His posterity It is because of this attachment that men have been deprived of essential spirituality and exalted position When the sanctified breezes of Christ and the holy light of the Greatest Luminary one hundred six were spread abroad the human realities that is to say those who turned toward the Word of God and received the profusion of His bounties were saved from this attachment and sin obtained everlasting life were delivered from the chains of bondage and attained to the world of liberty They were freed from the vices of the human world and were blessed by the virtues of the Kingdom This is the meaning of the words of Christ I gave My blood for the life of the world one hundred seven that is to say I have chosen all these troubles these sufferings calamities and even the greatest martyrdom to attain this object the remission of sins that is the detachment of spirits from the human world and their attraction to the divine world in order that souls may arise who will be the very essence of the guidance of mankind and the manifestations of the perfections of the Supreme Kingdom Observe that if according to the suppositions of the People of the Book one hundred eight the meaning were taken in its exoteric sense it would be absolute injustice and complete predestination If Adam sinned by going near the forbidden tree what was the sin of the glorious Abraham and what was the error of Moses the Interlocutor What was the crime of Noah the Prophet What was the transgression of Joseph the Truthful What was the iniquity of the Prophets of God and what was the trespass of John the Chaste Would the justice of God have allowed these enlightened Manifestations on account of the sin of Adam to find torment in hell until Christ came and by the sacrifice of Himself saved them from excruciating tortures Such an idea is beyond every law and rule and cannot be accepted by any intelligent person No it means what has already been said Adam is the spirit of Adam and Eve is His soul the tree is the human world and the serpent is that attachment to this world which constitutes sin and which has infected the descendants of Adam Christ by His holy breezes saved men from this attachment and freed them from this sin The sin in Adam is relative to His position Although from this attachment there proceed results nevertheless attachment to the earthly world in relation to attachment to the spiritual world is considered as a sin The good deeds of the righteous are the sins of the Near Ones This is established So bodily power is not only defective in relation to spiritual power it is weakness in comparison In the same way physical life in comparison with eternal life in the Kingdom is considered as death So Christ called the physical life death and said Let the dead bury their dead one hundred nine Though those souls possessed physical life yet in His eyes that life was death This is one of the meanings of the biblical story of Adam Reflect until you discover the others Salutations be upon you thirty one EXPLANATION OF BLASPHEMY AGAINST THE HOLY SPIRIT Question Wherefore I say unto you All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come Matt twelve thirty one thirty two Answer The holy realities of the Manifestations of God have two spiritual positions One is the place of manifestation which can be compared to the position of the globe of the sun and the other is the resplendency of the manifestation which is like its light and radiance these are the perfections of God in other words the Holy Spirit For the Holy Spirit is the divine bounties and lordly perfections and these divine perfections are as the rays and heat of the sun The brilliant rays of the sun constitute its being and without them it would not be the sun If the manifestation and the reflection of the divine perfections were not in Christ Jesus would not be the Messiah He is a Manifestation because He reflects in Himself the divine perfections The Prophets of God are manifestations for the lordly perfections that is the Holy Spirit is apparent in Them If a soul remains far from the manifestation he may yet be awakened for he did not recognize the manifestation of the divine perfections But if he loathe the divine perfections themselves in other words the Holy Spirit it is evident that he is like a bat which hates the light This detestation of the light has no remedy and cannot be forgiven that is to say it is impossible for him to come near unto God This lamp is a lamp because of its light without the light it would not be a lamp Now if a soul has an aversion for the light of the lamp he is as it were blind and cannot comprehend the light and blindness is the cause of everlasting banishment from God It is evident that the souls receive grace from the bounty of the Holy Spirit which appears in the Manifestations of God and not from the personality of the Manifestation Therefore if a soul does not receive grace from the bounties of the Holy Spirit he remains deprived of the divine gift and the banishment itself puts the soul beyond the reach of pardon This is why many people who were the enemies of the Manifestations and who did not recognize Them when once they had known Them became Their friends So enmity toward the Manifestation did not become the cause of perpetual banishment for they who indulged in it were the enemies of the light holders not knowing that They were the shining lights of God They were not the enemies of the light and when once they understood that the light holder was the place of manifestation of the light they became sincere friends of it The meaning is this to remain far from the light holder does not entail everlasting banishment for one may become awakened and vigilant but enmity toward the light is the cause of everlasting banishment and for this there is no remedy thirty two EXPLANATION OF THE VERSE FOR MANY ARE CALLED BUT FEW ARE CHOSEN Question In the Gospel Christ said Many are called but few are chosen one hundred ten and in the Qur an it is written He will confer particular mercy on whom He pleaseth What is the wisdom of this Answer Know that the order and the perfection of the whole universe require that existence should appear in numberless forms For existing beings could not be embodied in only one degree one station one kind one species and one class undoubtedly the difference of degrees and distinction of forms and the variety of genus and species are necessary that is to say the degree of mineral vegetable animal substances and of man are inevitable for the world could not be arranged adorned organized and perfected with man alone In the same way with only animals only plants or only minerals this world could not show forth beautiful scenery exact organization and exquisite adornment Without doubt it is because of the varieties of degrees stations species and classes that existence becomes resplendent with utmost perfection For example if this tree were entirely fruit the vegetable perfections could not be attained for leaves blossoms and fruits are all necessary so that the tree may be adorned with utmost beauty and perfection In the same way consider the body of man It must be composed of different organs parts and members Human beauty and perfection require the existence of the ear the eye the brain and even that of the nails and hair if man were all brain eyes or ears it would be equivalent to imperfection So the absence of hair eyelashes teeth and nails would be an absolute defect though in comparison with the eye they are without feeling and in this resemble the mineral and plant but their absence in the body of man is necessarily faulty and displeasing As the degrees of existence are different and various some beings are higher in the scale than others Therefore it is by the will and wish of God that some creatures are chosen for the highest degree as man and some others are placed in the middle degree as the vegetable and some are left in the lowest degree like the mineral It is from the bounty of God that man is selected for the highest degree and the differences which exist between men in regard to spiritual progress and heavenly perfections are also due to the choice of the Compassionate One For faith which is life eternal is the sign of bounty and not the result of justice The flame of the fire of love in this world of earth and water comes through the power of attraction and not by effort and striving Nevertheless by effort and perseverance knowledge science and other perfections can be acquired but only the light of the Divine Beauty can transport and move the spirits through the force of attraction Therefore it is said Many are called but few are chosen one hundred eleven But the material beings are not despised judged and held responsible for their own degree and station For example mineral vegetable and animal in their various degrees are acceptable but if in their own degree they remain imperfect they are blamable the degree itself being purely perfect The differences among mankind are of two sorts one is a difference of station and this difference is not blameworthy The other is a difference of faith and assurance the loss of these is blameworthy for then the soul is overwhelmed by his desires and passions which deprive him of these blessings and prevent him from feeling the power of attraction of the love of God Though that man is praiseworthy and acceptable in his station yet as he is deprived of the perfections of that degree he will become a source of imperfections for which he is held responsible one hundred twelve thirty three THE RETURN SPOKEN OF BY THE PROPHETS Question Will you explain the subject of Return Answer Baha u llah has explained this question fully and clearly in the Iqan one hundred thirteen Read it and the truth of this subject will become apparent But since you have asked about it I will explain it briefly We will begin to elucidate it from the Gospel for there it is plainly said that when John the son of Zacharias appeared and gave to men the glad tidings of the Kingdom of God they asked him Who art thou Art thou the promised Messiah He replied I am not the Messiah Then they asked him Art thou Elijah He said I am not one hundred fourteen These words prove and show that John the son of Zacharias was not the promised Elias But on the day of the transfiguration on Mount Tabor Christ said plainly that John the son of Zacharias was the promised Elias In chapter nine verses eleven thirteen of the Gospel of Mark it is said And they asked Him saying Why say the scribes that Elias must first come And He answered and told them Elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the Son of man that He must suffer many things and be set at nought But I say unto you That Elias is indeed come and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of him In chapter seventeen verse thirteen of Matthew it is said Then the disciples understood that He spake unto them of John the Baptist They asked John the Baptist Are you Elias He answered No I am not although it is said in the Gospel that John was the promised Elias and Christ also said so clearly one hundred fifteen Then if John was Elias why did he say I am not And if he was not Elias why did Christ say that he was The explanation is this not the personality but the reality of the perfections is meant that is to say the same perfections that were in Elias existed in John the Baptist and were exactly realized in him Therefore John the Baptist was the promised Elias In this case not the essence one hundred sixteen but the qualities are regarded For example there was a flower last year and this year there is also a flower I say the flower of last year has returned Now I do not mean that same flower in its exact individuality has come back but as this flower has the same qualities as that of last year as it has the same perfume delicacy color and form I say the flower of last year has returned and this flower is the former flower When spring comes we say last year s spring has come back because all that was found in last year s spring exists in this spring That is why Christ said You will see all that happened in the days of the former Prophets We will give another illustration The seed of last year is sown branches and leaves grow forth blossoms and fruits appear and all has again returned to seed When this second seed is planted a tree will grow from it and once more those branches leaves blossoms and fruits will return and that tree will appear in perfection As the beginning was a seed and the end is a seed we say that the seed has returned When we look at the substance of the tree it is another substance but when we look at the blossoms leaves and fruits the same fragrance delicacy and taste are produced Therefore the perfection of the tree has returned a second time In the same way if we regard the return of the individual it is another individual but if we regard the qualities and perfections the same have returned Therefore when Christ said This is Elias He meant this person is a manifestation of the bounty the perfections the character the qualities and the virtues of Elias John the Baptist said I am not Elias Christ considered the qualities the perfections the character and the virtues of both and John regarded his substance and individuality It is like this lamp it was here last night and tonight it is also lighted and tomorrow night it will also shine We say that the lamp of this night is the same light as that of last night and that it has returned It refers to the light and not to the oil the wick or the holder This subject is fully and clearly explained in the Kitab i Iqan thirty four PETER S CONFESSION OF FAITH Question In the Gospel of saint Matthew it is said Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build My church one hundred seventeen What is the meaning of this verse Answer This utterance of Christ is a confirmation of the statement of Peter when Christ asked Whom do you believe Me to be and Peter answered I believe that Thou art the Son of the living God Then Christ said to him Thou art Peter one hundred eighteen for Cephas in Aramaic means rock and upon this rock I will build My church For the others in answer to Christ said that He was Elias and some said John the Baptist and some others Jeremias or one of the Prophets one hundred nineteen Christ wished by suggestion or an allusion to confirm the words of Peter so on account of the suitability of his name Peter He said and upon this rock I will build My church meaning thy belief that Christ is the Son of the living God will be the foundation of the Religion of God and upon this belief the foundation of the church of God which is the Law of God shall be established The existence of the tomb of Peter in Rome is doubtful it is not authenticated Some say it is in Antioch Moreover let us compare the lives of some of the Popes with the religion of Christ Christ hungry and without shelter ate herbs in the wilderness and was unwilling to hurt the feelings of anyone The Pope sits in a carriage covered with gold and passes his time in the utmost splendor amidst such pleasures and luxuries such riches and adoration as kings have never had Christ hurt no one but some of the Popes killed innocent people refer to history How much blood the Popes have shed merely to retain temporal power For mere differences of opinion they arrested imprisoned and slew thousands of the servants of the world of humanity and learned men who had discovered the secrets of nature To what a degree they opposed the truth Reflect upon the instructions of Christ and investigate the habits and customs of the Popes Consider is there any resemblance between the instructions of Christ and the manner of government of the Popes We do not like to criticize but the history of the Vatican is very extraordinary The purport of our argument is this that the instructions of Christ are one thing and the manner of the Papal government is quite another they do not agree See how many Protestants have been killed by the order of the Popes how many tyrannies and oppressions have been countenanced and how many punishments and tortures have been inflicted Can any of the sweet fragrances of Christ be detected in these actions No in the name of God These people did not obey Christ while Saint Barbara whose picture is before us did obey Christ and followed in His footsteps and put His commands into practice Among the Popes there are also some blessed souls who followed in the footsteps of Christ particularly in the first centuries of the Christian era when temporal things were lacking and the tests of God were severe But when they came into possession of governmental power and worldly honor and prosperity were gained the Papal government entirely forgot Christ and was occupied with temporal power grandeur comfort and luxuries It killed people opposed the diffusion of learning tormented the men of science obstructed the light of knowledge and gave the order to slay and to pillage Thousands of souls men of science and learning and sinless ones perished in the prisons of Rome With all these proceedings and actions how can the Vicarship of Christ be believed in The Papal See has constantly opposed knowledge even in Europe it is admitted that religion is the opponent of science and that science is the destroyer of the foundations of religion While the religion of God is the promoter of truth the founder of science and knowledge it is full of goodwill for learned men it is the civilizer of mankind the discoverer of the secrets of nature and the enlightener of the horizons of the world Consequently how can it be said to oppose knowledge God forbid Nay for God knowledge is the most glorious gift of man and the most noble of human perfections To oppose knowledge is ignorant and he who detests knowledge and science is not a man but rather an animal without intelligence For knowledge is light life felicity perfection beauty and the means of approaching the Threshold of Unity It is the honor and glory of the world of humanity and the greatest bounty of God Knowledge is identical with guidance and ignorance is real error Happy are those who spend their days in gaining knowledge in discovering the secrets of nature and in penetrating the subtleties of pure truth Woe to those who are contented with ignorance whose hearts are gladdened by thoughtless imitation who have fallen into the lowest depths of ignorance and foolishness and who have wasted their lives thirty five PREDESTINATION Question If God has knowledge of an action which will be performed by someone and it has been written on the Tablet of Fate is it possible to resist it Answer The foreknowledge of a thing is not the cause of its realization for the essential knowledge of God surrounds in the same way the realities of things before as well as after their existence and it does not become the cause of their existence It is a perfection of God But that which was prophesied by the inspiration of God through the tongues of the Prophets concerning the appearance of the Promised One of the Bible was not the cause of the manifestation of Christ The hidden secrets of the future were revealed to the Prophets and They thus became acquainted with the future events which They announced This knowledge and these prophecies were not the cause of the occurrences For example tonight everyone knows that after seven hours the sun will rise but this general foreknowledge does not cause the rising and appearance of the sun Therefore the knowledge of God in the realm of contingency does not produce the forms of the things On the contrary it is purified from the past present and future It is identical with the reality of the things it is not the cause of their occurrence In the same way the record and the mention of a thing in the Book does not become the cause of its existence The Prophets through the divine inspiration knew what would come to pass For instance through the divine inspiration They knew that Christ would be martyred and They announced it Now was Their knowledge and information the cause of the martyrdom of Christ No this knowledge is a perfection of the Prophets and did not cause the martyrdom The mathematicians by astronomical calculations know that at a certain time an eclipse of the moon or the sun will occur Surely this discovery does not cause the eclipse to take place This is of course only an analogy and not an exact image PART THREE ON THE POWERS AND CONDITIONS OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF GOD thirty six THE FIVE ASPECTS OF SPIRIT Know that speaking generally there are five divisions of the spirit First the vegetable spirit this is a power which results from the combination of elements and the mingling of substances by the decree of the Supreme God and from the influence the effect and connection of other existences When these substances and elements are separated from each other the power of growth also ceases to exist So to use another figure electricity results from the combination of elements and when these elements are separated the electric force is dispersed and lost Such is the vegetable spirit After this is the animal spirit which also results from the mingling and combination of elements But this combination is more complete and through the decree of the Almighty Lord a perfect mingling is obtained and the animal spirit in other words the power of the senses is produced It will perceive the reality of things from that which is seen and visible audible edible tangible and that which can be smelled After the dissociation and decomposition of the combined elements this spirit also will naturally disappear It is like this lamp which you see when the oil and wick and fire are brought together light is the result but when the oil is finished and the wick consumed the light will also vanish and be lost The human spirit may be likened to the bounty of the sun shining on a mirror The body of man which is composed from the elements is combined and mingled in the most perfect form it is the most solid construction the noblest combination the most perfect existence It grows and develops through the animal spirit This perfected body can be compared to a mirror and the human spirit to the sun Nevertheless if the mirror breaks the bounty of the sun continues and if the mirror is destroyed or ceases to exist no harm will happen to the bounty of the sun which is everlasting This spirit has the power of discovery it encompasses all things All these wonderful signs these scientific discoveries great enterprises and important historical events which you know are due to it From the realm of the invisible and hidden through spiritual power it brought them to the plane of the visible So man is upon the earth yet he makes discoveries in the heavens From known realities that is to say from the things which are known and visible he discovers unknown things For example man is in this hemisphere but like Columbus through the power of his reason he discovers another hemisphere that is America which was until then unknown His body is heavy but through the help of vehicles which he invents he is able to fly He is slow of movement but by vehicles which he invents he travels to the East and West with extreme rapidity Briefly this power embraces all things But the spirit of man has two aspects one divine one satanic that is to say it is capable of the utmost perfection or it is capable of the utmost imperfection If it acquires virtues it is the most noble of the existing beings and if it acquires vices it becomes the most degraded existence The fourth degree of spirit is the heavenly spirit it is the spirit of faith and the bounty of God it comes from the breath of the Holy Spirit and by the divine power it becomes the cause of eternal life It is the power which makes the earthly man heavenly and the imperfect man perfect It makes the impure to be pure the silent eloquent it purifies and sanctifies those made captive by carnal desires it makes the ignorant wise The fifth spirit is the Holy Spirit This Holy Spirit is the mediator between God and His creatures It is like a mirror facing the sun As the pure mirror receives light from the sun and transmits this bounty to others so the Holy Spirit is the mediator of the Holy Light from the Sun of Reality which it gives to the sanctified realities It is adorned with all the divine perfections Every time it appears the world is renewed and a new cycle is founded The body of the world of humanity puts on a new garment It can be compared to the spring whenever it comes the world passes from one condition to another Through the advent of the season of spring the black earth and the fields and wildernesses will become verdant and blooming and all sorts of flowers and sweet scented herbs will grow the trees will have new life and new fruits will appear and a new cycle is founded The appearance of the Holy Spirit is like this Whenever it appears it renews the world of humanity and gives a new spirit to the human realities it arrays the world of existence in a praiseworthy garment dispels the darkness of ignorance and causes the radiation of the light of perfections Christ with this power has renewed this cycle the heavenly spring with the utmost freshness and sweetness spread its tent in the world of humanity and the life giving breeze perfumed the nostrils of the enlightened ones In the same way the appearance of Baha u llah was like a new springtime which appeared with holy breezes with the hosts of everlasting life and with heavenly power It established the Throne of the Divine Kingdom in the center of the world and by the power of the Holy Spirit revived souls and established a new cycle thirty seven THE DIVINITY CAN ONLY BE COMPREHENDED THROUGH THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS Question What connection has the Reality of Divinity with the Lordly Rising places and the Divine Dawning points Answer Know that the Reality of Divinity or the substance of the Essence of Oneness is pure sanctity and absolute holiness that is to say it is sanctified and exempt from all praise The whole of the supreme attributes of the degrees of existence in reference to this plane are only imaginations It is invisible incomprehensible inaccessible a pure essence which cannot be described for the Divine Essence surrounds all things Verily that which surrounds is greater than the surrounded and the surrounded cannot contain that by which it is surrounded nor comprehend its reality However far mind may progress though it may reach to the final degree of comprehension the limit of understanding it beholds the divine signs and attributes in the world of creation and not in the world of God For the essence and the attributes of the Lord of Unity are in the heights of sanctity and for the minds and understandings there is no way to approach that position The way is closed and seeking is forbidden It is evident that the human understanding is a quality of the existence of man and that man is a sign of God how can the quality of the sign surround the creator of the sign that is to say how can the understanding which is a quality of the existence of man comprehend God Therefore the Reality of the Divinity is hidden from all comprehension and concealed from the minds of all men It is absolutely impossible to ascend to that plane We see that everything which is lower is powerless to comprehend the reality of that which is higher So the stone the earth the tree however much they may evolve cannot comprehend the reality of man and cannot imagine the powers of sight of hearing and of the other senses although they are all alike created Therefore how can man the created understand the reality of the pure Essence of the Creator This plane is unapproachable by the understanding no explanation is sufficient for its comprehension and there is no power to indicate it What has an atom of dust to do with the pure world and what relation is there between the limited mind and the infinite world Minds are powerless to comprehend God and the souls become bewildered in explaining Him The eyes see Him not but He seeth the eyes He is the Omniscient the Knower one hundred twenty Consequently with reference to this plane of existence every statement and elucidation is defective all praise and all description are unworthy every conception is vain and every meditation is futile But for this Essence of the essences this Truth of truths this Mystery of mysteries there are reflections auroras appearances and resplendencies in the world of existence The dawning place of these splendors the place of these reflections and the appearance of these manifestations are the Holy Dawning places the Universal Realities and the Divine Beings Who are the true mirrors of the sanctified Essence of God All the perfections the bounties the splendors which come from God are visible and evident in the Reality of the Holy Manifestations like the sun which is resplendent in a clear polished mirror with all its perfections and bounties If it be said that the mirrors are the manifestations of the sun and the dawning places of the rising star this does not mean that the sun has descended from the height of its sanctity and become incorporated in the mirror nor that the Unlimited Reality is limited to this place of appearance God forbid This is the belief of the adherents of anthropomorphism No all the praises the descriptions and exaltations refer to the Holy Manifestations that is to say all the descriptions the qualities the names and the attributes which we mention return to the Divine Manifestations but as no one has attained to the reality of the Essence of Divinity so no one is able to describe explain praise or glorify it Therefore all that the human reality knows discovers and understands of the names the attributes and the perfections of God refer to these Holy Manifestations There is no access to anything else the way is closed and seeking is forbidden Nevertheless we speak of the names and attributes of the Divine Reality and we praise Him by attributing to Him sight hearing power life and knowledge We affirm these names and attributes not to prove the perfections of God but to deny that He is capable of imperfections When we look at the existing world we see that ignorance is imperfection and knowledge is perfection therefore we say that the sanctified Essence of God is wisdom Weakness is imperfection and power is perfection consequently we say that the sanctified Essence of God is the acme of power It is not that we can comprehend His knowledge His sight His power and life for it is beyond our comprehension for the essential names and attributes of God are identical with His Essence and His Essence is above all comprehension If the attributes are not identical with the Essence there must also be a multiplicity of preexistences and differences between the attributes and the Essence must also exist and as Preexistence is necessary therefore the sequence of preexistences would become infinite This is an evident error Accordingly all these attributes names praises and eulogies apply to the Places of Manifestation and all that we imagine and suppose beside them is mere imagination for we have no means of comprehending that which is invisible and inaccessible This is why it is said All that you have distinguished through the illusion of your imagination in your subtle mental images is but a creation like unto yourself and returns to you one hundred twenty one It is clear that if we wish to imagine the Reality of Divinity this imagination is the surrounded and we are the surrounding one and it is sure that the one who surrounds is greater than the surrounded From this it is certain and evident that if we imagine a Divine Reality outside of the Holy Manifestations it is pure imagination for there is no way to approach the Reality of Divinity which is not cut off to us and all that we imagine is mere supposition Therefore reflect that different peoples of the world are revolving around imaginations and are worshipers of the idols of thoughts and conjectures They are not aware of this they consider their imaginations to be the Reality which is withdrawn from all comprehension and purified from all descriptions They regard themselves as the people of Unity and the others as worshipers of idols but idols at least have a mineral existence while the idols of thoughts and the imaginations of man are but fancies they have not even mineral existence Take heed ye who are endued with discernment one hundred twenty two Know that the attributes of perfection the splendor of the divine bounties and the lights of inspiration are visible and evident in all the Holy Manifestations but the glorious Word of God Christ and the Greatest Name Baha u llah are manifestations and evidences which are beyond imagination for They possess all the perfections of the former Manifestations and more than that They possess some perfections which make the other Manifestations dependent upon Them So all the Prophets of Israel were centers of inspiration Christ also was a receiver of inspiration but what a difference between the inspiration of the Word of God and the revelations of Isaiah Jeremiah and Elijah Reflect that light is the expression of the vibrations of the etheric matter the nerves of the eye are affected by these vibrations and sight is produced The light of the lamp exists through the vibration of the etheric matter so also does that of the sun but what a difference between the light of the sun and that of the stars or the lamp The spirit of man appears and is manifest in the embryonic condition and also in that of childhood and of maturity and it is resplendent and evident in the condition of perfection The spirit is one but in the embryonic condition the power of sight and of hearing is lacking In the state of maturity and perfection it appears in the utmost splendor and brilliance In the same way the seed in the beginning becomes leaves and is the place where the vegetable spirit appears in the condition of fruit it manifests the same spirit that is to say the power of growth appears in the utmost perfection but what a difference between the condition of the leaves and that of the fruit For from the fruit a hundred thousand leaves appear though they all grow and develop through the same vegetable spirit Notice the difference between the virtues and perfections of Christ the splendors and brilliance of Baha u llah and the virtues of the Prophets of Israel such as Ezekiel or Samuel All were the manifestations of inspiration but between them there is an infinite difference Salutations thirty eight THE THREE STATIONS OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS Know that the Holy Manifestations though They have the degrees of endless perfections yet speaking generally have only three stations The first station is the physical the second station is the human which is that of the rational soul the third is that of the divine appearance and the heavenly splendor The physical station is phenomenal it is composed of elements and necessarily everything that is composed is subject to decomposition It is not possible that a composition should not be disintegrated The second is the station of the rational soul which is the human reality This also is phenomenal and the Holy Manifestations share it with all mankind Know that although the human soul has existed on the earth for prolonged times and ages yet it is phenomenal As it is a divine sign when once it has come into existence it is eternal The spirit of man has a beginning but it has no end it continues eternally In the same way the species existing on this earth are phenomenal for it is established that there was a time when these species did not exist on the surface of the earth Moreover the earth has not always existed but the world of existence has always been for the universe is not limited to this terrestrial globe The meaning of this is that although human souls are phenomenal they are nevertheless immortal everlasting and perpetual for the world of things is the world of imperfection in comparison with that of man and the world of man is the world of perfection in comparison with that of things When imperfections reach the station of perfection they become eternal one hundred twenty three This is an example of which you must comprehend the meaning The third station is that of the divine appearance and heavenly splendor it is the Word of God the Eternal Bounty the Holy Spirit It has neither beginning nor end for these things are related to the world of contingencies and not to the divine world For God the end is the same thing as the beginning So the reckoning of days weeks months and years of yesterday and today is connected with the terrestrial globe but in the sun there is no such thing there is neither yesterday today nor tomorrow neither months nor years all are equal In the same way the Word of God is purified from all these conditions and is exempt from the boundaries the laws and the limits of the world of contingency Therefore the reality of prophethood which is the Word of God and the perfect state of manifestation did not have any beginning and will not have any end its rising is different from all others and is like that of the sun For example its dawning in the sign of Christ was with the utmost splendor and radiance and this is eternal and everlasting See how many conquering kings there have been how many statesmen and princes powerful organizers all of whom have disappeared whereas the breezes of Christ are still blowing His light is still shining His melody is still resounding His standard is still waving His armies are still fighting His heavenly voice is still sweetly melodious His clouds are still showering gems His lightning is still flashing His reflection is still clear and brilliant His splendor is still radiating and luminous and it is the same with those souls who are under His protection and are shining with His light Then it is evident that the Manifestations possess three conditions the physical condition the condition of the rational soul and the condition of the divine appearance and heavenly splendor The physical condition will certainly become decomposed but the condition of the rational soul though it has a beginning has no end nay it is endowed with everlasting life But the Holy Reality of which Christ says The Father is in the Son one hundred twenty four has neither beginning nor end When beginning is spoken of it signifies the state of manifesting and symbolically the condition of silence is compared to sleep For example a man is sleeping when he begins to speak he is awake but it is always the same individual whether he be asleep or awake no difference has occurred in his station his elevation his glory his reality or his nature The state of silence is compared to sleep and that of manifestation to wakefulness A man sleeping or waking is the same man sleep is one state and wakefulness is another The time of silence is compared to sleep and manifestation and guidance are compared to wakefulness In the Gospel it is said In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God one hundred twenty five Then it is evident and clear that Christ did not reach to the station of Messiahship and its perfections at the time of baptism when the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the likeness of a dove Nay the Word of God from all eternity has always been and will be in the exaltation of sanctification thirty nine THE HUMAN CONDITION AND THE SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS We said that the Manifestations have three planes First the physical reality which depends upon the body second the individual reality that is to say the rational soul third the divine appearance which is the divine perfections the cause of the life of existence of the education of souls of the guidance of people and of the enlightenment of the contingent world The physical state is the human state which perishes because it is composed of elements and all that is composed of elements will necessarily be decomposed and dispersed But the individual reality of the Manifestations of God is a holy reality and for that reason it is sanctified and in that which concerns its nature and quality is distinguished from all other things It is like the sun which by its essential nature produces light and cannot be compared to the moon just as the particles that compose the globe of the sun cannot be compared with those which compose the moon The particles and organization of the former produce rays but the particles of which the moon is composed do not produce rays but need to borrow light So other human realities are those souls who like the moon take light from the sun but that Holy Reality is luminous in Himself The third plane of that Being one hundred twenty six is the Divine Bounty the splendor of the Preexistent Beauty and the radiance of the light of the Almighty The individual realities of the Divine Manifestations have no separation from the Bounty of God and the Lordly Splendor In the same way the orb of the sun has no separation from the light Therefore it may be said that the ascension of the Holy Manifestation is simply the leaving of this elemental form For example if a lamp illumines this niche and if its light ceases to illuminate it because the niche is destroyed the bounty of the lamp is not cut off Briefly in the Holy Manifestations the Preexistent Bounty is like the light the individuality is represented by the glass globe and the human body is like the niche if the niche is destroyed the lamp continues to burn The Divine Manifestations are so many different mirrors because They have a special individuality but that which is reflected in the mirrors is one sun It is clear that the reality of Christ is different from that of Moses Verily from the beginning that Holy Reality one hundred twenty seven is conscious of the secret of existence and from the age of childhood signs of greatness appear and are visible in Him Therefore how can it be that with all these bounties and perfections He should have no consciousness We have mentioned that the Holy Manifestations have three planes The physical condition the individual reality and the center of the appearance of perfection it is like the sun its heat and its light Other individuals have the physical plane the plane of the rational soul the spirit and mind one hundred twenty eight So the saying I was asleep and the divine breezes passed over Me and I awoke is like Christ s saying The body is sad and the spirit is happy or again I am afflicted or I am at ease or I am troubled these refer to the physical condition and have no reference to the individual reality nor to the manifestation of the Divine Reality Thus consider what thousands of vicissitudes can happen to the body of man but the spirit is not affected by them it may even be that some members of the body are entirely crippled but the essence of the mind remains and is everlasting A thousand accidents may happen to a garment but for the wearer of it there is no danger These words which Baha u llah said I was asleep and the breeze passed over Me and awakened Me refer to the body In the world of God there is no past no future and no present all are one So when Christ said In the beginning was the Word one hundred twenty nine that means it was is and shall be for in the world of God there is no time Time has sway over creatures but not over God For example in the prayer He says Hallowed be Thy name the meaning is that Thy name was is and shall be hallowed one hundred thirty Morning noon and evening are related to this earth but in the sun there is neither morning noon nor evening forty THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS Question One of the powers possessed by the Divine Manifestations is knowledge To what extent is it limited Answer Knowledge is of two kinds One is subjective and the other objective knowledge that is to say an intuitive knowledge and a knowledge derived from perception The knowledge of things which men universally have is gained by reflection or by evidence that is to say either by the power of the mind the conception of an object is formed or from beholding an object the form is produced in the mirror of the heart The circle of this knowledge is very limited because it depends upon effort and attainment But the second sort of knowledge which is the knowledge of being is intuitive it is like the cognizance and consciousness that man has of himself For example the mind and the spirit of man are cognizant of the conditions and states of the members and component parts of the body and are aware of all the physical sensations in the same way they are aware of their power of their feelings and of their spiritual conditions This is the knowledge of being which man realizes and perceives for the spirit surrounds the body and is aware of its sensations and powers This knowledge is not the outcome of effort and study It is an existing thing it is an absolute gift Since the Sanctified Realities the supreme Manifestations of God surround the essence and qualities of the creatures transcend and contain existing realities and understand all things therefore Their knowledge is divine knowledge and not acquired that is to say it is a holy bounty it is a divine revelation We will mention an example expressly for the purpose of comprehending this subject The most noble being on the earth is man He embraces the animal vegetable and mineral kingdoms that is to say these conditions are contained in him to such an extent that he is the possessor of these conditions and states he is aware of their mysteries and of the secrets of their existence This is simply an example and not an analogy Briefly the supreme Manifestations of God are aware of the reality of the mysteries of beings Therefore They establish laws which are suitable and adapted to the state of the world of man for religion is the essential connection which proceeds from the realities of things The Manifestation that is the Holy Lawgiver unless He is aware of the realities of beings will not comprehend the essential connection which proceeds from the realities of things and He will certainly not be able to establish a religion conformable to the facts and suited to the conditions The Prophets of God the supreme Manifestations are like skilled physicians and the contingent world is like the body of man the divine laws are the remedy and treatment Consequently the doctor must be aware of and know all the members and parts as well as the constitution and state of the patient so that he can prescribe a medicine which will be beneficial against the violent poison of the disease In reality the doctor deduces from the disease itself the treatment which is suited to the patient for he diagnoses the malady and afterward prescribes the remedy for the illness Until the malady be discovered how can the remedy and treatment be prescribed The doctor then must have a thorough knowledge of the constitution members organs and state of the patient and be acquainted with all diseases and all remedies in order to prescribe a fitting medicine Religion then is the necessary connection which emanates from the reality of things and as the supreme Manifestations of God are aware of the mysteries of beings therefore They understand this essential connection and by this knowledge establish the Law of God forty one THE UNIVERSAL CYCLES Question What is the real explanation of the cycles which occur in the world of existence Answer Each one of the luminous bodies in this limitless firmament has a cycle of revolution which is of a different duration and every one revolves in its own orbit and again begins a new cycle So the earth every three hundred and sixty five days five hours forty eight minutes and a fraction completes a revolution and then it begins a new cycle that is to say the first cycle is again renewed In the same way for the whole universe whether for the heavens or for men there are cycles of great events of important facts and occurrences When a cycle is ended a new cycle begins and the old one on account of the great events which take place is completely forgotten and not a trace or record of it will remain As you see we have no records of twenty thousand years ago although we have before proved by argument that life on this earth is very ancient It is not one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand or one million or two million years old it is very ancient and the ancient records and traces are entirely obliterated Each of the Divine Manifestations has likewise a cycle and during the cycle His laws and commandments prevail and are performed When His cycle is completed by the appearance of a new Manifestation a new cycle begins In this way cycles begin end and are renewed until a universal cycle is completed in the world when important events and great occurrences will take place which entirely efface every trace and every record of the past then a new universal cycle begins in the world for this universe has no beginning We have before stated proofs and evidences concerning this subject there is no need of repetition Briefly we say a universal cycle in the world of existence signifies a long duration of time and innumerable and incalculable periods and epochs In such a cycle the Manifestations appear with splendor in the realm of the visible until a great and supreme Manifestation makes the world the center of His radiance His appearance causes the world to attain to maturity and the extension of His cycle is very great Afterward other Manifestations will arise under His shadow Who according to the needs of the time will renew certain commandments relating to material questions and affairs while remaining under His shadow We are in the cycle which began with Adam and its supreme Manifestation is Baha u llah forty two THE POWER AND INFLUENCE OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS Question What is the degree of the power and the perfections of the Thrones of Reality the Manifestations of God and what is the limit of Their influence Answer Consider the world of existence that is to say the world of material things The solar system is dark and obscure and in it the sun is the center of light and all the planets of the system revolve around its might and are partakers of its bounty The sun is the cause of life and illumination and the means of the growth and development of all the beings of the solar system for without the bounty of the sun no living being could exist all would be dark and destroyed Therefore it is evident and clear that the sun is the center of light and the cause of the life of the beings of the solar system In like manner the Holy Manifestations of God are the centers of the light of reality of the source of mysteries and of the bounties of love They are resplendent in the world of hearts and thoughts and shower eternal graces upon the world of spirits They give spiritual life and are shining with the light of realities and meanings The enlightenment of the world of thought comes from these centers of light and sources of mysteries Without the bounty of the splendor and the instructions of these Holy Beings the world of souls and thoughts would be opaque darkness Without the irrefutable teachings of those sources of mysteries the human world would become the pasture of animal appetites and qualities the existence of everything would be unreal and there would be no true life That is why it is said in the Gospel In the beginning was the Word meaning that it became the cause of all life one hundred thirty one Now consider the influence of the sun upon the earthly beings what signs and results become evident and clear from its nearness and remoteness from its rising or its setting At one time it is autumn at another time spring or again it is summer or winter When the sun passes the line of the equator the life giving spring will become manifest in splendor and when it is in the summer solstice the fruits will attain to the acme of perfection grains and plants will yield their produce and earthly beings will attain their most complete development and growth In like manner when the Holy Manifestation of God Who is the sun of the world of His creation shines upon the worlds of spirits of thoughts and of hearts then the spiritual spring and new life appear the power of the wonderful springtime becomes visible and marvelous benefits are apparent As you have observed at the time of the appearance of each Manifestation of God extraordinary progress has occurred in the world of minds thoughts and spirits For example in this divine age see what development has been attained in the world of minds and thoughts and it is now only the beginning of its dawn Before long you will see that new bounties and divine teachings will illuminate this dark world and will transform these sad regions into the paradise of Eden If we were to explain the signs and bounties of each of the Holy Manifestations it would take too long Think and reflect upon it yourself and then you will attain to the truth of this subject forty three THE TWO CLASSES OF PROPHETS Question How many kinds of Prophets are there Answer Universally the Prophets are of two kinds One are the independent Prophets Who are followed the other kind are not independent and are themselves followers The independent Prophets are the lawgivers and the founders of a new cycle Through Their appearance the world puts on a new garment the foundations of religion are established and a new book is revealed Without an intermediary They receive bounty from the Reality of the Divinity and Their illumination is an essential illumination They are like the sun which is luminous in itself the light is its essential necessity it does not receive light from any other star These Dawning places of the morn of Unity are the sources of bounty and the mirrors of the Essence of Reality The other Prophets are followers and promoters for they are branches and not independent they receive the bounty of the independent Prophets and they profit by the light of the Guidance of the universal Prophets They are like the moon which is not luminous and radiant in itself but receives its light from the sun The Manifestations of universal Prophethood Who appeared independently are for example Abraham Moses Christ Muhammad the Bab and Baha u llah But the others who are followers and promoters are like Solomon David Isaiah Jeremiah and Ezekiel For the independent Prophets are founders They establish a new religion and make new creatures of men They change the general morals promote new customs and rules renew the cycle and the Law Their appearance is like the season of spring which arrays all earthly beings in a new garment and gives them a new life With regard to the second sort of Prophets who are followers these also promote the Law of God make known the Religion of God and proclaim His word Of themselves they have no power and might except what they receive from the independent Prophets Question To which category do Buddha and Confucius belong Answer Buddha also established a new religion and Confucius renewed morals and ancient virtues but their institutions have been entirely destroyed The beliefs and rites of the Buddhists and Confucianists have not continued in accordance with their fundamental teachings The founder of Buddhism was a wonderful soul He established the Oneness of God but later the original principles of His doctrines gradually disappeared and ignorant customs and ceremonials arose and increased until they finally ended in the worship of statues and images Now consider Christ frequently repeated that the Ten Commandments in the Pentateuch were to be followed and He insisted that they should be maintained Among the Ten Commandments is one which says Do not worship any picture or image one hundred thirty two At present in some of the Christian churches many pictures and images exist It is therefore clear and evident that the Religion of God does not maintain its original principles among the people but that it has gradually changed and altered until it has been entirely destroyed and annihilated Because of this the manifestation is renewed and a new religion established But if religions did not change and alter there would be no need of renewal In the beginning the tree was in all its beauty and full of blossoms and fruits but at last it became old and entirely fruitless and it withered and decayed This is why the True Gardener plants again an incomparable young tree of the same kind and species which grows and develops day by day and spreads a wide shadow in the divine garden and yields admirable fruit So it is with religions through the passing of time they change from their original foundation the truth of the Religion of God entirely departs and the spirit of it does not stay heresies appear and it becomes a body without a soul That is why it is renewed The meaning is that the Buddhists and Confucianists now worship images and statues They are entirely heedless of the Oneness of God and believe in imaginary gods like the ancient Greeks But in the beginning it was not so there were different principles and other ordinances Again consider how much the principles of the religion of Christ have been forgotten and how many heresies have appeared For example Christ forbade revenge and transgression furthermore He commanded benevolence and mercy in return for injury and evil Now reflect among the Christian nations themselves how many sanguinary wars have taken place and how much oppression cruelty rapacity and bloodthirstiness have occurred Many of these wars were carried on by command of the Popes It is then clear and evident that in the passage of time religions become entirely changed and altered Therefore they are renewed forty four EXPLANATION OF THE REBUKES ADDRESSED BY GOD TO THE PROPHETS Question In the Holy Books there are some addresses of reproach and rebuke directed to the Prophets Who is addressed and for whom is the rebuke Answer All the divine discourses containing reproof though apparently addressed to the Prophets in reality are directed to the people through a wisdom which is absolute mercy in order that the people may not be discouraged and disheartened They therefore appear to be addressed to the Prophets but though outwardly for the Prophets they are in truth for the people and not for the Prophets Moreover the powerful and independent king represents his country that which he says is the word of all and every agreement that he makes is the agreement of all for the wishes and desires of all his subjects are included in his wishes and desires In the same way every Prophet is the expression of the whole of the people So the promise and speech of God addressed to Him is addressed to all Generally the speech of reproach and rebuke is rather too severe for the people and would be heartbreaking to them So the Perfect Wisdom makes use of this form of address as is clearly shown in the Bible itself as for example when the children of Israel rebelled and said to Moses We cannot fight with the Amalekites for they are powerful mighty and courageous God then rebuked Moses and Aaron though Moses was in complete obedience and not in rebellion Surely such a great Man Who is the mediator of the Divine Bounty and the deliverer of the Law must necessarily obey the commands of God These Holy Souls are like the leaves of a tree which are put in motion by the blowing of the wind and not by Their own desire for They are attracted by the breeze of the love of God and Their will is absolutely submissive Their word is the word of God Their commandment is the commandment of God Their prohibition is the prohibition of God They are like the glass globe which receives light from the lamp Although the light appears to emanate from the glass in reality it is shining from the lamp In the same way for the Prophets of God the centers of manifestation Their movement and repose come from divine inspiration not from human passions If it were not so how could the Prophet be worthy of trust and how could He be the Messenger of God delivering the commands and the prohibitions of God All the defects that are mentioned in the Holy Books with reference to the Manifestations refer to questions of this kind Praise be to God that you have come here and have met the servants of God Have you perceived in them anything except the fragrance of the pleasure of God Indeed no You have seen with your own eyes that day and night they endeavor and strive and that they have no aim except the exaltation of the word of God the education of men the improvement of the masses spiritual progress the promulgation of universal peace goodwill to all mankind and kindness toward all nations Sacrificing themselves for the good of humanity they are detached from material advantages and labor to give virtues to mankind But let us return to our subject For example in the Old Testament it is said in the Book of Isaiah chapter forty eight verse twelve Hearken unto Me O Jacob and Israel My called I am He I am the first I also am the last It is evident that it does not mean Jacob who was Israel but the people of Israel Also in the Book of Isaiah chapter forty three verse one it is said But now thus saith the Lord that created thee O Jacob and He that formed thee O Israel Fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by thy name thou art Mine Furthermore in Numbers chapter twenty verse twenty three And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor by the coast of the land of Edom saying Aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel because ye rebelled against My word at the water of Meribah one hundred thirty three and in verse thirteen This is the water of Meribah because the children of Israel strove with the Lord and He was sanctified in them Observe the people of Israel rebelled but apparently the reproach was for Moses and Aaron As it is said in the Book of Deuteronomy chapter three verse twenty six But the Lord was wroth with Me for your sakes and would not hear Me and the Lord said unto Me Let it suffice Thee speak no more unto Me of this matter Now this discourse and reproach really refer to the children of Israel who for having rebelled against the command of God were held captive a long time in the arid desert on the other side of Jordan until the time of Joshua upon him be salutations This address and reproach appeared to be for Moses and Aaron but in reality they were for the people of Israel In the same way in the Qur an it is said to Muhammad We have granted Thee a manifest victory so that God may forgive Thee Thy preceding and subsequent sin one hundred thirty four This address although apparently directed to Muhammad was in reality for all the people This mode of address as before said was used by the perfect wisdom of God so that the hearts of the people might not be troubled anxious and tormented How often the Prophets of God and His supreme Manifestations in Their prayers confess Their sins and faults This is only to teach other men to encourage and incite them to humility and meekness and to induce them to confess their sins and faults For these Holy Souls are pure from every sin and sanctified from faults In the Gospel it is said that a man came to Christ and called Him Good Master Christ answered Why callest thou Me good there is none good but One that is God one hundred thirty five This did not mean God forbid that Christ was a sinner but the intention was to teach submission humility meekness and modesty to the man to whom He spoke These Holy Beings are lights and light does not unite itself with darkness They are life and life and death are not confounded They are for guidance and guidance and error cannot be together They are the essence of obedience and obedience cannot exist with rebellion To conclude the addresses in the form of reproach which are in the Holy Books though apparently directed to the Prophets that is to say to the Manifestations of God in reality are intended for the people This will become evident and clear to you when you have diligently examined the Holy Books Salutations be upon you forty five EXPLANATION OF THE VERSE OF THE KITAB I AQDAS THERE IS NO PARTNER FOR HIM WHO IS THE DAYSPRING OF REVELATION IN HIS MOST GREAT INFALLIBILITY It is said in the holy verse There is no partner for Him Who is the Dayspring of Revelation one hundred thirty six in His Most Great Infallibility He is in truth the exponent of God doeth whatsoever He willeth in the kingdom of creation Indeed the Almighty hath exclusively reserved this station for Himself and to none is given a share in this sublime and highly exalted distinction one hundred thirty seven Know that infallibility is of two kinds essential infallibility and acquired infallibility In like manner there is essential knowledge and acquired knowledge and so it is with other names and attributes Essential infallibility is peculiar to the supreme Manifestation for it is His essential requirement and an essential requirement cannot be separated from the thing itself The rays are the essential necessity of the sun and are inseparable from it Knowledge is an essential necessity of God and is inseparable from Him Power is an essential necessity of God and is inseparable from Him If it could be separated from Him He would not be God If the rays could be separated from the sun it would not be the sun Therefore if one imagines separation of the Most Great Infallibility from the supreme Manifestation He would not be the supreme Manifestation and He would lack the essential perfections But acquired infallibility is not a natural necessity on the contrary it is a ray of the bounty of infallibility which shines from the Sun of Reality upon hearts and grants a share and portion of itself to souls Although these souls have not essential infallibility still they are under the protection of God that is to say God preserves them from error Thus many of the holy beings who were not dawning points of the Most Great Infallibility were yet kept and preserved from error under the shadow of the protection and guardianship of God for they were the mediators of grace between God and men If God did not protect them from error their error would cause believing souls to fall into error and thus the foundation of the Religion of God would be overturned which would not be fitting nor worthy of God To epitomize essential infallibility belongs especially to the supreme Manifestations and acquired infallibility is granted to every holy soul For instance the Universal House of Justice one hundred thirty eight if it be established under the necessary conditions with members elected from all the people that House of Justice will be under the protection and the unerring guidance of God If that House of Justice shall decide unanimously or by a majority upon any question not mentioned in the Book that decision and command will be guarded from mistake Now the members of the House of Justice have not individually essential infallibility but the body of the House of Justice is under the protection and unerring guidance of God this is called conferred infallibility Briefly it is said that the Dayspring of Revelation is the manifestation of these words He doeth whatsoever He willeth this condition is peculiar to that Holy Being and others have no share of this essential perfection That is to say that as the supreme Manifestations certainly possess essential infallibility therefore whatever emanates from Them is identical with the truth and conformable to reality They are not under the shadow of the former laws Whatever They say is the word of God and whatever They perform is an upright action No believer has any right to criticize his condition must be one of absolute submission for the Manifestation arises with perfect wisdom so that whatever the supreme Manifestation says and does is absolute wisdom and is in accordance with reality If some people do not understand the hidden secret of one of His commands and actions they ought not to oppose it for the supreme Manifestation does what He wishes How often it has occurred when an act has been performed by a wise perfect intelligent man that others incapable of comprehending its wisdom have objected to it and been amazed that this wise man could say or do such a thing This opposition comes from their ignorance and the wisdom of the sage is pure and exempt from error In the same way the skilled doctor in treating the patient does what he wishes and the patient has no right to object whatever the doctor says and does is right all ought to consider him the manifestation of these words He doeth whatsoever He willeth and commandeth whatever He desireth It is certain that the doctor will use some medicine contrary to the ideas of other people now opposition is not permitted to those who have not the advantage of science and the medical art No in the name of God on the contrary all ought to be submissive and to perform whatever the skilled doctor says Therefore the skilled doctor does what he wishes and the patients have no share in this right The skill of the doctor must be first ascertained but when the skill of the doctor is once established he does what he wishes So also when the head of the army is unrivaled in the art of war in what he says and commands he does what he wishes When the captain of a ship is proficient in the art of navigation in whatever he says and commands he does what he wishes And as the real educator is the Perfect Man in whatever He says and commands He does what He wishes In short the meaning of He doeth whatsoever He willeth is that if the Manifestation says something or gives a command or performs an action and believers do not understand its wisdom they still ought not to oppose it by a single thought seeking to know why He spoke so or why He did such a thing The other souls who are under the shadow of the supreme Manifestations are submissive to the commandments of the Law of God and are not to deviate as much as a hairsbreadth from it they must conform their acts and words to the Law of God If they do deviate from it they will be held responsible and reproved in the presence of God It is certain that they have no share in the permission He doeth whatsoever He willeth for this condition is peculiar to the supreme Manifestations So Christ may my spirit be sacrificed to Him was the manifestation of these words He doeth whatsoever He willeth but the disciples were not partakers of this condition for as they were under the shadow of Christ they could not deviate from His command and will PART FOUR ON THE ORIGIN POWERS AND CONDITIONS OF MAN forty six MODIFICATION OF SPECIES We have now come to the question of the modification of species and of organic development that is to say to the point of inquiring whether man s descent is from the animal This theory has found credence in the minds of some European philosophers and it is now very difficult to make its falseness understood but in the future it will become evident and clear and the European philosophers will themselves realize its untruth For verily it is an evident error When man looks at the beings with a penetrating regard and attentively examines the condition of existences and when he sees the state the organization and the perfection of the world he will be convinced that in the possible world there is nothing more wonderful than that which already exists For all existing beings terrestrial and celestial as well as this limitless space and all that is in it have been created and organized composed arranged and perfected as they ought to be the universe has no imperfection so that if all beings became pure intelligence and reflected for ever and ever it is impossible that they could imagine anything better than that which exists If however the creation in the past had not been adorned with utmost perfection then existence would have been imperfect and meaningless and in this case creation would have been incomplete This question needs to be considered with the greatest attention and thought For example imagine that the contingent world resembles in a general way the body of man If this composition organization perfection beauty and completeness which now exist in the human body were different it would be absolute imperfection Now if we imagine a time when man belonged to the animal world or when he was merely an animal we shall find that existence would have been imperfect that is to say there would have been no man and this chief member which in the body of the world is like the brain and mind in man would have been missing The world would then have been quite imperfect It is thus proved that if there had been a time when man was in the animal kingdom the perfection of existence would have been destroyed for man is the greatest member of this world and if the body was without this chief member surely it would be imperfect We consider man as the greatest member because among the creatures he is the sum of all existing perfections When we speak of man we mean the perfect one the foremost individual in the world who is the sum of spiritual and apparent perfections and who is like the sun among the beings Then imagine that at one time the sun did not exist but that it was a planet surely at such a time the relations of existence would be disordered How can such a thing be imagined To a man who examines the world of existence what we have said is sufficient There is another more subtle proof all these endless beings which inhabit the world whether man animal vegetable mineral whatever they may be are surely each one of them composed of elements There is no doubt that this perfection which is in all beings is caused by the creation of God from the composing elements by their appropriate mingling and proportionate quantities the mode of their composition and the influence of other beings For all beings are connected together like a chain and reciprocal help assistance and interaction belonging to the properties of things are the causes of the existence development and growth of created beings It is confirmed through evidences and proofs that every being universally acts upon other beings either absolutely or through association Finally the perfection of each individual being that is to say the perfection which you now see in man or apart from him with regard to their atoms members or powers is due to the composition of the elements to their measure to their balance to the mode of their combination and to mutual influence When all these are gathered together then man exists As the perfection of man is entirely due to the composition of the atoms of the elements to their measure to the method of their combination and to the mutual influence and action of the different beings then since man was produced ten or a hundred thousand years ago from these earthly elements with the same measure and balance the same method of combination and mingling and the same influence of the other beings exactly the same man existed then as now This is evident and not worth debating A thousand million years hence if these elements of man are gathered together and arranged in this special proportion and if the elements are combined according to the same method and if they are affected by the same influence of other beings exactly the same man will exist For example if after a hundred thousand years there is oil fire a wick a lamp and the lighter of the lamp briefly if there are all the necessaries which now exist exactly the same lamp will be obtained These are conclusive and evident facts But the arguments which these European philosophers have used raise doubtful proofs and are not conclusive forty seven THE UNIVERSE IS WITHOUT BEGINNING THE ORIGIN OF MAN Know that it is one of the most abstruse spiritual truths that the world of existence that is to say this endless universe has no beginning We have already explained that the names and attributes of the Divinity themselves require the existence of beings Although this subject has been explained in detail we will speak of it again briefly Know that an educator without pupils cannot be imagined a monarch without subjects could not exist a master without scholars cannot be appointed a creator without a creature is impossible a provider without those provided for cannot be conceived for all the divine names and attributes demand the existence of beings If we could imagine a time when no beings existed this imagination would be the denial of the Divinity of God Moreover absolute nonexistence cannot become existence If the beings were absolutely nonexistent existence would not have come into being Therefore as the Essence of Unity that is the existence of God is everlasting and eternal that is to say it has neither beginning nor end it is certain that this world of existence this endless universe has neither beginning nor end Yes it may be that one of the parts of the universe one of the globes for example may come into existence or may be disintegrated but the other endless globes are still existing the universe would not be disordered nor destroyed On the contrary existence is eternal and perpetual As each globe has a beginning necessarily it has an end because every composition collective or particular must of necessity be decomposed The only difference is that some are quickly decomposed and others more slowly but it is impossible that a composed thing should not eventually be decomposed It is necessary therefore that we should know what each of the important existences was in the beginning for there is no doubt that in the beginning the origin was one the origin of all numbers is one and not two Then it is evident that in the beginning matter was one and that one matter appeared in different aspects in each element Thus various forms were produced and these various aspects as they were produced became permanent and each element was specialized But this permanence was not definite and did not attain realization and perfect existence until after a very long time Then these elements became composed and organized and combined in infinite forms or rather from the composition and combination of these elements innumerable beings appeared This composition and arrangement through the wisdom of God and His preexistent might were produced from one natural organization which was composed and combined with the greatest strength conformable to wisdom and according to a universal law From this it is evident that it is the creation of God and is not a fortuitous composition and arrangement This is why from every natural composition a being can come into existence but from an accidental composition no being can come into existence For example if a man of his own mind and intelligence collects some elements and combines them a living being will not be brought into existence since the system is unnatural This is the answer to the implied question that since beings are made by the composition and the combination of elements why is it not possible for us to gather elements and mingle them together and so create a living being This is a false supposition for the origin of this composition is from God it is God Who makes the combination and as it is done according to the natural system from each composition one being is produced and an existence is realized A composition made by man produces nothing because man cannot create Briefly we have said that from the composition and combination of elements from their decomposition from their measure and from the effect of other beings upon them resulted forms endless realities and innumerable beings But it is clear that this terrestrial globe in its present form did not come into existence all at once but that this universal existence gradually passed through different phases until it became adorned with its present perfection Universal beings resemble and can be compared to particular beings for both are subjected to one natural system one universal law and divine organization So you will find the smallest atoms in the universal system are similar to the greatest beings of the universe It is clear that they come into existence from one laboratory of might under one natural system and one universal law therefore they may be compared to one another Thus the embryo of man in the womb of the mother gradually grows and develops and appears in different forms and conditions until in the degree of perfect beauty it reaches maturity and appears in a perfect form with the utmost grace And in the same way the seed of this flower which you see was in the beginning an insignificant thing and very small and it grew and developed in the womb of the earth and after appearing in various forms came forth in this condition with perfect freshness and grace In the same manner it is evident that this terrestrial globe having once found existence grew and developed in the matrix of the universe and came forth in different forms and conditions until gradually it attained this present perfection and became adorned with innumerable beings and appeared as a finished organization Then it is clear that original matter which is in the embryonic state and the mingled and composed elements which were its earliest forms gradually grew and developed during many ages and cycles passing from one shape and form to another until they appeared in this perfection this system this organization and this establishment through the supreme wisdom of God Let us return to our subject that man in the beginning of his existence and in the womb of the earth like the embryo in the womb of the mother gradually grew and developed and passed from one form to another from one shape to another until he appeared with this beauty and perfection this force and this power It is certain that in the beginning he had not this loveliness and grace and elegance and that he only by degrees attained this shape this form this beauty and this grace There is no doubt that the human embryo did not at once appear in this form neither did it then become the manifestation of the words Blessed therefore be God the most excellent of Makers one hundred thirty nine Gradually it passed through various conditions and different shapes until it attained this form and beauty this perfection grace and loveliness Thus it is evident and confirmed that the development and growth of man on this earth until he reached his present perfection resembled the growth and development of the embryo in the womb of the mother by degrees it passed from condition to condition from form to form from one shape to another for this is according to the requirement of the universal system and Divine Law That is to say the embryo passes through different states and traverses numerous degrees until it reaches the form in which it manifests the words Praise be to God the best of Creators and until the signs of reason and maturity appear And in the same way man s existence on this earth from the beginning until it reaches this state form and condition necessarily lasts a long time and goes through many degrees until it reaches this condition But from the beginning of man s existence he is a distinct species In the same way the embryo of man in the womb of the mother was at first in a strange form then this body passes from shape to shape from state to state from form to form until it appears in utmost beauty and perfection But even when in the womb of the mother and in this strange form entirely different from his present form and figure he is the embryo of the superior species and not of the animal his species and essence undergo no change Now admitting that the traces of organs which have disappeared actually exist this is not a proof of the impermanence and the nonoriginality of the species At the most it proves that the form and fashion and the organs of man have progressed Man was always a distinct species a man not an animal So if the embryo of man in the womb of the mother passes from one form to another so that the second form in no way resembles the first is this a proof that the species has changed that it was at first an animal and that its organs progressed and developed until it became a man No indeed How puerile and unfounded is this idea and this thought For the proof of the originality of the human species and of the permanency of the nature of man is clear and evident forty eight THE DIFFERENCE EXISTING BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL Already we have talked once or twice on the subject of the spirit but our words have not been written down Know that people belong to two categories that is to say they constitute two parties One party deny the spirit and say that man also is a species of animal for they say Do we not see that animals and men share the same powers and senses These simple single elements which fill space are endlessly combined and from each of these combinations one of the beings is produced Among these beings is the possessor of spirit one hundred forty of the powers and of the senses The more perfect the combination the nobler is the being The combination of the elements in the body of man is more perfect than the composition of any other being it is mingled in absolute equilibrium therefore it is more noble and more perfect It is not they say that he has a special power and spirit which the other animals lack animals possess sensitive bodies but man in some powers has more sensation although in what concerns the outer senses such as hearing sight taste smell touch and even in some interior powers like memory the animal is more richly endowed than man The animal too they say has intelligence and perception All that they concede is that man s intelligence is greater This is what the philosophers of the present state this is their saying this is their supposition and thus their imagination decrees So with powerful arguments and proofs they make the descent of man go back to the animal and say that there was once a time when man was an animal that then the species changed and progressed little by little until it reached the present status of man But the theologians say No this is not so Though man has powers and outer senses in common with the animal yet an extraordinary power exists in him of which the animal is bereft The sciences arts inventions trades and discoveries of realities are the results of this spiritual power This is a power which encompasses all things comprehends their realities discovers all the hidden mysteries of beings and through this knowledge controls them It even perceives things which do not exist outwardly that is to say intellectual realities which are not sensible and which have no outward existence because they are invisible so it comprehends the mind the spirit the qualities the characters the love and sorrow of man which are intellectual realities Moreover these existing sciences arts laws and endless inventions of man at one time were invisible mysterious and hidden secrets it is only the all encompassing human power which has discovered and brought them out from the plane of the invisible to the plane of the visible So telegraphy photography phonography and all such inventions and wonderful arts were at one time hidden mysteries The human reality discovered and brought them out from the plane of the invisible to the plane of the visible There was even a time when the qualities of this iron which you see indeed of all the minerals were hidden mysteries men discovered this mineral and wrought it in this industrial form It is the same with all the other discoveries and inventions of man which are innumerable This we cannot deny If we say that these are effects of powers which animals also have and of the powers of the bodily senses we see clearly and evidently that the animals are in regard to these powers superior to man For example the sight of animals is much more keen than the sight of man so also is their power of smell and taste Briefly in the powers which animals and men have in common the animal is often the more powerful For example let us take the power of memory If you carry a pigeon from here to a distant country and there set it free it will return for it remembers the way Take a dog from here to the center of Asia set him free and he will come back here and never once lose the road So it is with the other powers such as hearing sight smell taste and touch Thus it is clear that if there were not in man a power different from any of those of the animals the latter would be superior to man in inventions and the comprehension of realities Therefore it is evident that man has a gift which the animal does not possess Now the animal perceives sensible things but does not perceive intellectual realities For example that which is within the range of its vision the animal sees but that which is beyond the range of sight it is not possible for it to perceive and it cannot imagine it So it is not possible for the animal to understand that the earth has the form of a globe But man from known things proves unknown things and discovers unknown truths For example man sees the curve of the horizon and from this he infers the roundness of the earth The Pole Star at Akka for instance is at thirty three that is to say it is thirty three above the horizon When a man goes toward the North Pole the Pole Star rises one degree above the horizon for each degree of distance that he travels that is to say the altitude of the Pole Star will be thirty four then forty then fifty then sixty then seventy If he reaches the North Pole the altitude of the Pole Star will be ninety or have attained the zenith that is to say will be directly overhead This Pole Star and its ascension are sensible things The further one goes toward the Pole the higher the Pole Star rises from these two known truths an unknown thing has been discovered that is that the horizon is curved meaning that the horizon of each degree of the earth is a different horizon from that of another degree Man perceives this and proves from it an invisible thing which is the roundness of the earth This it is impossible for the animal to perceive In the same way it cannot understand that the sun is the center and that the earth revolves around it The animal is the captive of the senses and bound by them all that is beyond the senses the things that they do not control the animal can never understand although in the outer senses it is greater than man Hence it is proved and verified that in man there is a power of discovery by which he is distinguished from the animals and this is the spirit of man Praise be to God man is always turned toward the heights and his aspiration is lofty he always desires to reach a greater world than the world in which he is and to mount to a higher sphere than that in which he is The love of exaltation is one of the characteristics of man I am astonished that certain philosophers of America and Europe are content to gradually approach the animal world and so to go backward for the tendency of existence must be toward exaltation Nevertheless if you said to one of them You are an animal he would be extremely hurt and angry What a difference between the human world and the world of the animal between the elevation of man and the abasement of the animal between the perfections of man and the ignorance of the animal between the light of man and the darkness of the animal between the glory of man and the degradation of the animal An Arab child of ten years can manage two or three hundred camels in the desert and with his voice can lead them forward or turn them back A weak Hindu can so control a huge elephant that the elephant becomes the most obedient of servants All things are subdued by the hand of man he can resist nature while all other creatures are captives of nature none can depart from her requirements Man alone can resist nature Nature attracts bodies to the center of the earth man through mechanical means goes far from it and soars in the air Nature prevents man from crossing the seas man builds a ship and he travels and voyages across the great ocean and so on the subject is endless For example man drives engines over the mountains and through the wildernesses and gathers in one spot the news of the events of the East and West All this is contrary to nature The sea with its grandeur cannot deviate by an atom from the laws of nature the sun in all its magnificence cannot deviate as much as a needle s point from the laws of nature and can never comprehend the conditions the state the qualities the movements and the nature of man What then is the power in this small body of man which encompasses all this What is this ruling power by which he subdues all things One more point remains Modern philosophers say We have never seen the spirit in man and in spite of our researches into the secrets of the human body we do not perceive a spiritual power How can we imagine a power which is not sensible The theologians reply The spirit of the animal also is not sensible and through its bodily powers it cannot be perceived By what do you prove the existence of the spirit of the animal There is no doubt that from its effects you prove that in the animal there is a power which is not in the plant and this is the power of the senses that is to say sight hearing and also other powers from these you infer that there is an animal spirit In the same way from the proofs and signs we have mentioned we argue that there is a human spirit Since in the animal there are signs which are not in the plant you say this power of sensation is a property of the animal spirit you also see in man signs powers and perfections which do not exist in the animal therefore you infer that there is a power in him which the animal is without If we wish to deny everything that is not sensible then we must deny the realities which unquestionably exist For example ethereal matter is not sensible though it has an undoubted existence The power of attraction is not sensible though it certainly exists From what do we affirm these existences From their signs Thus this light is the vibration of that ethereal matter and from this vibration we infer the existence of ether forty nine THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN RACE Question What do you say with regard to the theories held by some European philosophers on the growth and development of beings Answer This subject was spoken of the other day but we will speak of it again Briefly this question will be decided by determining whether species are original or not that is to say has the species of man been established from its origin or was it afterward derived from the animals Certain European philosophers agree that the species grows and develops and that even change and alteration are also possible One of the proofs that they give for this theory is that through the attentive study and verification of the science of geology it has become clear that the existence of the vegetable preceded that of the animal and that of the animal preceded that of man They admit that both the vegetable and the animal species have changed for in some of the strata of the earth they have discovered plants which existed in the past and are now extinct they have progressed grown in strength their form and appearance have changed and so the species have altered In the same way in the strata of the earth there are some species of animals which have changed and are transformed One of these animals is the serpent There are indications that the serpent once had feet but through the lapse of time those members have disappeared In the same way in the vertebral column of man there is an indication which amounts to a proof that like other animals he once had a tail At one time that member was useful but when man developed it was no longer of use and therefore it gradually disappeared As the serpent took refuge under the ground and became a creeping animal it was no longer in need of feet so they disappeared but their traces survive The principal argument is this that the existence of traces of members proves that they once existed and as now they are no longer of service they have gradually disappeared Therefore while the perfect and necessary members have remained those which are unnecessary have gradually disappeared by the modification of the species but the traces of them continue The first answer to this argument is the fact that the animal having preceded man is not a proof of the evolution change and alteration of the species nor that man was raised from the animal world to the human world For while the individual appearance of these different beings is certain it is possible that man came into existence after the animal So when we examine the vegetable kingdom we see that the fruits of the different trees do not arrive at maturity at one time on the contrary some come first and others afterward This priority does not prove that the later fruit of one tree was produced from the earlier fruit of another tree Second these slight signs and traces of members have perhaps a great reason of which the mind is not yet cognizant How many things exist of which we do not yet know the reason So the science of physiology that is to say the knowledge of the composition of the members records that the reason and cause of the difference in the colors of animals and of the hair of men of the redness of the lips and of the variety of the colors of birds is still unknown it is secret and hidden But it is known that the pupil of the eye is black so as to attract the rays of the sun for if it were another color that is uniformly white it would not attract the rays of the sun Therefore as the reason of the things we have mentioned is unknown it is possible that the reason and the wisdom of these traces of members whether they be in the animal or man are equally unknown Certainly there is a reason even though it is not known Third let us suppose that there was a time when some animals or even man possessed some members which have now disappeared this is not a sufficient proof of the change and evolution of the species For man from the beginning of the embryonic period till he reaches the degree of maturity goes through different forms and appearances His aspect his form his appearance and color change he passes from one form to another and from one appearance to another Nevertheless from the beginning of the embryonic period he is of the species of man that is to say an embryo of a man and not of an animal but this is not at first apparent but later it becomes visible and evident For example let us suppose that man once resembled the animal and that now he has progressed and changed Supposing this to be true it is still not a proof of the change of species No as before mentioned it is merely like the change and alteration of the embryo of man until it reaches the degree of reason and perfection We will state it more clearly Let us suppose that there was a time when man walked on his hands and feet or had a tail this change and alteration is like that of the fetus in the womb of the mother Although it changes in all ways and grows and develops until it reaches the perfect form from the beginning it is a special species We also see in the vegetable kingdom that the original species of the genus do not change and alter but the form color and bulk will change and alter or even progress To recapitulate as man in the womb of the mother passes from form to form from shape to shape changes and develops and is still the human species from the beginning of the embryonic period in the same way man from the beginning of his existence in the matrix of the world is also a distinct species that is man and has gradually evolved from one form to another Therefore this change of appearance this evolution of members this development and growth even though we admit the reality of growth and progress one hundred forty one does not prevent the species from being original Man from the beginning was in this perfect form and composition and possessed capacity and aptitude for acquiring material and spiritual perfections and was the manifestation of these words We will make man in Our image and likeness one hundred forty two He has only become more pleasing more beautiful and more graceful Civilization has brought him out of his wild state just as the wild fruits which are cultivated by a gardener become finer sweeter and acquire more freshness and delicacy The gardeners of the world of humanity are the Prophets of God fifty SPIRITUAL PROOFS OF THE ORIGIN OF MAN The proofs which we have adduced relative to the origin of the human species were logical proofs Now we will give the spiritual proofs which are essential For as we have proved Divinity by logical arguments and have also proved logically that man exists from his origin and foundation as man and that his species has existed from all eternity now we will establish spiritual proofs that human existence that is the species of man is a necessary existence and that without man the perfections of Divinity would not appear But these are spiritual proofs not logical proofs We have many times demonstrated and established that man is the noblest of beings the sum of all perfections and that all beings and all existences are the centers from which the glory of God is reflected that is to say the signs of the Divinity of God are apparent in the realities of things and of creatures Just as the terrestrial globe is the place where the rays of the sun are reflected as its light its heat and its influence are apparent and visible in all the atoms of the earth so in the same way the atoms of beings in this infinite space proclaim and prove one of the divine perfections Nothing is deprived of this benefit either it is a sign of the mercy of God or it is a sign of His power His greatness His justice His nurturing providence or it is a sign of the generosity of God His vision His hearing His knowledge His grace and so on Without doubt each being is the center of the shining forth of the glory of God that is to say the perfections of God appear from it and are resplendent in it It is like the sun which is resplendent in the desert upon the sea in the trees in the fruits and blossoms and in all earthly things The world indeed each existing being proclaims to us one of the names of God but the reality of man is the collective reality the general reality and is the center where the glory of all the perfections of God shine forth that is to say for each name each attribute each perfection which we affirm of God there exists a sign in man If it were otherwise man could not imagine these perfections and could not understand them So we say that God is the seer and the eye is the sign of His vision if this sight were not in man how could we imagine the vision of God For the blind that is one born blind cannot imagine sight and the deaf that is one deaf from birth cannot imagine hearing and the dead cannot realize life Consequently the Divinity of God which is the sum of all perfections reflects itself in the reality of man that is to say the Essence of Oneness is the gathering of all perfections and from this unity He casts a reflection upon the human reality Man then is the perfect mirror facing the Sun of Truth and is the center of radiation the Sun of Truth shines in this mirror The reflection of the divine perfections appears in the reality of man so he is the representative of God the messenger of God If man did not exist the universe would be without result for the object of existence is the appearance of the perfections of God Therefore it cannot be said there was a time when man was not All that we can say is that this terrestrial globe at one time did not exist and at its beginning man did not appear upon it But from the beginning which has no beginning to the end which has no end a Perfect Manifestation always exists This Man of Whom we speak is not every man we mean the Perfect Man For the noblest part of the tree is the fruit which is the reason of its existence If the tree had no fruit it would have no meaning Therefore it cannot be imagined that the worlds of existence whether the stars or this earth were once inhabited by the donkey cow mouse and cat and that they were without man This supposition is false and meaningless The word of God is clear as the sun This is a spiritual proof but one which we cannot at the beginning put forth for the benefit of the materialists First we must speak of the logical proofs afterward the spiritual proofs fifty one THE SPIRIT AND MIND OF MAN HAVE EXISTED FROM THE BEGINNING Question Does man in the beginning possess mind and spirit or are they an outcome of his evolution Answer The beginning of the existence of man on the terrestrial globe resembles his formation in the womb of the mother The embryo in the womb of the mother gradually grows and develops until birth after which it continues to grow and develop until it reaches the age of discretion and maturity Though in infancy the signs of the mind and spirit appear in man they do not reach the degree of perfection they are imperfect Only when man attains maturity do the mind and the spirit appear and become evident in utmost perfection So also the formation of man in the matrix of the world was in the beginning like the embryo then gradually he made progress in perfectness and grew and developed until he reached the state of maturity when the mind and spirit became visible in the greatest power In the beginning of his formation the mind and spirit also existed but they were hidden later they were manifested In the womb of the world mind and spirit also existed in the embryo but they were concealed afterward they appeared So it is that in the seed the tree exists but it is hidden and concealed when it develops and grows the complete tree appears In the same way the growth and development of all beings is gradual this is the universal divine organization and the natural system The seed does not at once become a tree the embryo does not at once become a man the mineral does not suddenly become a stone No they grow and develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection All beings whether large or small were created perfect and complete from the first but their perfections appear in them by degrees The organization of God is one the evolution of existence is one the divine system is one Whether they be small or great beings all are subject to one law and system Each seed has in it from the first all the vegetable perfections For example in the seed all the vegetable perfections exist from the beginning but not visibly afterward little by little they appear So it is first the shoot which appears from the seed then the branches leaves blossoms and fruits but from the beginning of its existence all these things are in the seed potentially though not apparently In the same way the embryo possesses from the first all perfections such as the spirit the mind the sight the smell the taste in one word all the powers but they are not visible and become so only by degrees Similarly the terrestrial globe from the beginning was created with all its elements substances minerals atoms and organisms but these only appeared by degrees first the mineral then the plant afterward the animal and finally man But from the first these kinds and species existed but were undeveloped in the terrestrial globe and then appeared only gradually For the supreme organization of God and the universal natural system surround all beings and all are subject to this rule When you consider this universal system you see that there is not one of the beings which at its coming into existence has reached the limit of perfection No they gradually grow and develop and then attain the degree of perfection fifty two THE APPEARING OF THE SPIRIT IN THE BODY Question What is the wisdom of the spirit s appearing in the body Answer The wisdom of the appearance of the spirit in the body is this the human spirit is a Divine Trust and it must traverse all conditions for its passage and movement through the conditions of existence will be the means of its acquiring perfections So when a man travels and passes through different regions and numerous countries with system and method it is certainly a means of his acquiring perfection for he will see places scenes and countries from which he will discover the conditions and states of other nations He will thus become acquainted with the geography of countries and their wonders and arts he will familiarize himself with the habits customs and usages of peoples he will see the civilization and progress of the epoch he will become aware of the policy of governments and the power and capacity of each country It is the same when the human spirit passes through the conditions of existence it will become the possessor of each degree and station Even in the condition of the body it will surely acquire perfections Besides this it is necessary that the signs of the perfection of the spirit should be apparent in this world so that the world of creation may bring forth endless results and this body may receive life and manifest the divine bounties So for example the rays of the sun must shine upon the earth and the solar heat develop the earthly beings if the rays and heat of the sun did not shine upon the earth the earth would be uninhabited without meaning and its development would be retarded In the same way if the perfections of the spirit did not appear in this world this world would be unenlightened and absolutely brutal By the appearance of the spirit in the physical form this world is enlightened As the spirit of man is the cause of the life of the body so the world is in the condition of the body and man is in the condition of the spirit If there were no man the perfections of the spirit would not appear and the light of the mind would not be resplendent in this world This world would be like a body without a soul This world is also in the condition of a fruit tree and man is like the fruit without fruit the tree would be useless Moreover these members these elements this composition which are found in the organism of man are an attraction and magnet for the spirit it is certain that the spirit will appear in it So a mirror which is clear will certainly attract the rays of the sun It will become luminous and wonderful images will appear in it that is to say when these existing elements are gathered together according to the natural order and with perfect strength they become a magnet for the spirit and the spirit will become manifest in them with all its perfections Under these conditions it cannot be said What is the necessity for the rays of the sun to descend upon the mirror for the connection which exists between the reality of things whether they be spiritual or material requires that when the mirror is clear and faces the sun the light of the sun must become apparent in it In the same way when the elements are arranged and combined in the most glorious system organization and manner the human spirit will appear and be manifest in them This is the decree of the Powerful the Wise fifty three THE RELATION BETWEEN GOD AND THE CREATURE Question What is the nature of the connection between God and the creature that is to say between the Independent the Most High and the other beings Answer The connection between God and the creatures is that of the creator to the creation it is like the connection between the sun and the dark bodies of contingent beings and is the connection between the maker and the things that he has made The sun in its own essence is independent of the bodies which it lights for its light is in itself and is free and independent of the terrestrial globe so the earth is under the influence of the sun and receives its light whereas the sun and its rays are entirely independent of the earth But if there were no sun the earth and all earthly beings could not exist The dependence of the creatures upon God is a dependence of emanation that is to say creatures emanate from God they do not manifest Him one hundred forty three The relation is that of emanation and not that of manifestation The light of the sun emanates from the sun it does not manifest it The appearance through emanation is like the appearance of the rays from the luminary of the horizons of the world that is to say the holy essence of the Sun of Truth is not divided and does not descend to the condition of the creatures In the same way the globe of the sun does not become divided and does not descend to the earth No the rays of the sun which are its bounty emanate from it and illumine the dark bodies But the appearance through manifestation is the manifestation of the branches leaves blossoms and fruit from the seed for the seed in its own essence becomes branches and fruits and its reality enters into the branches the leaves and fruits This appearance through manifestation would be for God the Most High simple imperfection and this is quite impossible for the implication would be that the Absolute Preexistent is qualified with phenomenal attributes But if this were so pure independence would become mere poverty and true existence would become nonexistence and this is impossible Therefore all creatures emanate from God that is to say it is by God that all things are realized and by Him that all beings have attained to existence The first thing which emanated from God is that universal reality which the ancient philosophers termed the First Mind and which the people of Baha call the First Will This emanation in that which concerns its action in the world of God is not limited by time or place it is without beginning or end beginning and end in relation to God are one The preexistence of God is the preexistence of essence and also preexistence of time and the phenomenality of contingency is essential and not temporal as we have already explained one day at table one hundred forty four Though the First Mind is without beginning it does not become a sharer in the preexistence of God for the existence of the universal reality in relation to the existence of God is nothingness and it has not the power to become an associate of God and like unto Him in preexistence This subject has been before explained The existence of living things signifies composition and their death decomposition But universal matter and the elements do not become absolutely annihilated and destroyed No their nonexistence is simply transformation For instance when man is annihilated he becomes dust but he does not become absolutely nonexistent He still exists in the shape of dust but transformation has taken place and this composition is accidentally decomposed The annihilation of the other beings is the same for existence does not become absolute nonexistence and absolute nonexistence does not become existence fifty four ON THE PROCEEDING OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT FROM GOD Question In the Bible it is said that God breathed the spirit into the body of man What is the meaning of this verse Answer Know that proceeding is of two kinds the proceeding and appearance through emanation and the proceeding and appearance through manifestation The proceeding through emanation is like the coming forth of the action from the actor of the writing from the writer Now the writing emanates from the writer and the discourse emanates from the speaker and in the same way the human spirit emanates from God It is not that it manifests God that is to say no part has been detached from the Divine Reality to enter the body of man No as the discourse emanates from the speaker the spirit appears in the body of man But the proceeding through manifestation is the manifestation of the reality of a thing in other forms like the coming forth of this tree from the seed of the tree or the coming forth of the flower from the seed of the flower for it is the seed itself which appears in the form of the branches leaves and flowers This is called the proceeding through manifestation The spirits of men with reference to God have dependence through emanation just as the discourse proceeds from the speaker and the writing from the writer that is to say the speaker himself does not become the discourse nor does the writer himself become the writing no rather they have the proceeding of emanation The speaker has perfect ability and power and the discourse emanates from him as the action does from the actor The Real Speaker the Essence of Unity has always been in one condition which neither changes nor alters has neither transformation nor vicissitude He is the Eternal the Immortal Therefore the proceeding of the human spirits from God is through emanation When it is said in the Bible that God breathed His spirit into man this spirit is that which like the discourse emanates from the Real Speaker taking effect in the reality of man But the proceeding through manifestation if by this is meant the divine appearance and not division into parts we have said is the proceeding and the appearance of the Holy Spirit and the Word which is from God As it is said in the Gospel of John In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God one hundred forty five then the Holy Spirit and the Word are the appearance of God The Spirit and the Word mean the divine perfections that appeared in the Reality of Christ and these perfections were with God so the sun manifests all its glory in the mirror For the Word does not signify the body of Christ no but the divine perfections manifested in Him For Christ was like a clear mirror which was facing the Sun of Reality and the perfections of the Sun of Reality that is to say its light and heat were visible and apparent in this mirror If we look into the mirror we see the sun and we say It is the sun Therefore the Word and the Holy Spirit which signify the perfections of God are the divine appearance This is the meaning of the verse in the Gospel which says The Word was with God and the Word was God one hundred forty six for the divine perfections are not different from the Essence of Oneness The perfections of Christ are called the Word because all the beings are in the condition of letters and one letter has not a complete meaning while the perfections of Christ have the power of the word because a complete meaning can be inferred from a word As the Reality of Christ was the manifestation of the divine perfections therefore it was like the word Why because He is the sum of perfect meanings This is why He is called the Word And know that the proceeding of the Word and the Holy Spirit from God which is the proceeding and appearance of manifestation must not be understood to mean that the Reality of Divinity had been divided into parts or multiplied or that it had descended from the exaltation of holiness and purity God forbid If a pure fine mirror faces the sun the light and heat the form and the image of the sun will be resplendent in it with such manifestation that if a beholder says of the sun which is brilliant and visible in the mirror This is the sun it is true Nevertheless the mirror is the mirror and the sun is the sun The One Sun even if it appears in numerous mirrors is one This state is neither abiding nor entering neither commingling nor descending for entering abiding descending issuing forth and commingling are the necessities and characteristics of bodies not of spirits then how much less do they belong to the sanctified and pure Reality of God God is exempt from all that is not in accordance with His purity and His exalted and sublime sanctity The Sun of Reality as we have said has always been in one condition it has no change no alteration no transformation and no vicissitude It is eternal and everlasting But the Holy Reality of the Word of God is in the condition of the pure fine and shining mirror the heat the light the image and likeness that is to say the perfections of the Sun of Reality appear in it That is why Christ says in the Gospel The Father is in the Son that is to say the Sun of Reality appears in the mirror one hundred forty seven Praise be to the One Who shone upon this Holy Reality Who is sanctified among the beings fifty five SOUL SPIRIT AND MIND Question What is the difference between the mind spirit and soul Answer It has been before explained that spirit is universally divided into five categories the vegetable spirit the animal spirit the human spirit the spirit of faith and the Holy Spirit The vegetable spirit is the power of growth which is brought about in the seed through the influence of other existences The animal spirit is the power of all the senses which is realized from the composition and mingling of elements when this composition decomposes the power also perishes and becomes annihilated It may be likened to this lamp when the oil wick and fire are combined it is lighted and when this combination is dissolved that is to say when the combined parts are separated from one another the lamp also is extinguished The human spirit which distinguishes man from the animal is the rational soul and these two names the human spirit and the rational soul designate one thing This spirit which in the terminology of the philosophers is the rational soul embraces all beings and as far as human ability permits discovers the realities of things and becomes cognizant of their peculiarities and effects and of the qualities and properties of beings But the human spirit unless assisted by the spirit of faith does not become acquainted with the divine secrets and the heavenly realities It is like a mirror which although clear polished and brilliant is still in need of light Until a ray of the sun reflects upon it it cannot discover the heavenly secrets But the mind is the power of the human spirit Spirit is the lamp mind is the light which shines from the lamp Spirit is the tree and the mind is the fruit Mind is the perfection of the spirit and is its essential quality as the sun s rays are the essential necessity of the sun This explanation though short is complete therefore reflect upon it and if God wills you may become acquainted with the details fifty six THE PHYSICAL POWERS AND THE INTELLECTUAL POWERS In man five outer powers exist which are the agents of perception that is to say through these five powers man perceives material beings These are sight which perceives visible forms hearing which perceives audible sounds smell which perceives odors taste which perceives foods and feeling which is in all parts of the body and perceives tangible things These five powers perceive outward existences Man has also spiritual powers imagination which conceives things thought which reflects upon realities comprehension which comprehends realities memory which retains whatever man imagines thinks and comprehends The intermediary between the five outward powers and the inward powers is the sense which they possess in common that is to say the sense which acts between the outer and inner powers conveys to the inward powers whatever the outer powers discern It is termed the common faculty because it communicates between the outward and inward powers and thus is common to the outward and inward powers For instance sight is one of the outer powers it sees and perceives this flower and conveys this perception to the inner power the common faculty which transmits this perception to the power of imagination which in its turn conceives and forms this image and transmits it to the power of thought the power of thought reflects and having grasped the reality conveys it to the power of comprehension the comprehension when it has comprehended it delivers the image of the object perceived to the memory and the memory keeps it in its repository The outward powers are five the power of sight of hearing of taste of smell and of feeling The inner powers are also five the common faculty and the powers of imagination thought comprehension and memory fifty seven THE CAUSES OF THE DIFFERENCES IN THE CHARACTERS OF MEN Question How many kinds of character has man and what is the cause of the differences and varieties in men Answer He has the innate character the inherited character and the acquired character which is gained by education With regard to the innate character although the divine creation is purely good yet the varieties of natural qualities in man come from the difference of degree all are excellent but they are more or less so according to the degree So all mankind possess intelligence and capacities but the intelligence the capacity and the worthiness of men differ This is evident For example take a number of children of one family of one place of one school instructed by one teacher reared on the same food in the same climate with the same clothing and studying the same lessons it is certain that among these children some will be clever in the sciences some will be of average ability and some dull Hence it is clear that in the original nature there exists a difference of degree and varieties of worthiness and capacity This difference does not imply good or evil but is simply a difference of degree One has the highest degree another the medium degree and another the lowest degree So man exists the animal the plant and the mineral exist also but the degrees of these four existences vary What a difference between the existence of man and of the animal Yet both are existences It is evident that in existence there are differences of degrees The variety of inherited qualities comes from strength and weakness of constitution that is to say when the two parents are weak the children will be weak if they are strong the children will be robust In the same way purity of blood has a great effect for the pure germ is like the superior stock which exists in plants and animals For example you see that children born from a weak and feeble father and mother will naturally have a feeble constitution and weak nerves they will be afflicted and will have neither patience nor endurance nor resolution nor perseverance and will be hasty for the children inherit the weakness and debility of their parents Besides this an especial blessing is conferred on some families and some generations Thus it is an especial blessing that from among the descendants of Abraham should have come all the Prophets of the children of Israel This is a blessing that God has granted to this descent to Moses from His father and mother to Christ from His mother s line also to Muhammad and the Bab and to all the Prophets and the Holy Manifestations of Israel The Blessed Beauty one hundred forty eight is also a lineal descendant of Abraham for Abraham had other sons besides Ishmael and Isaac who in those days migrated to the lands of Persia and Afghanistan and the Blessed Beauty is one of their descendants Hence it is evident that inherited character also exists and to such a degree that if the characters are not in conformity with their origin although they belong physically to that lineage spiritually they are not considered members of the family like Canaan one hundred forty nine who is not reckoned as being of the race of Noah But the difference of the qualities with regard to culture is very great for education has great influence Through education the ignorant become learned the cowardly become valiant Through cultivation the crooked branch becomes straight the acid bitter fruit of the mountains and woods becomes sweet and delicious and the five petaled flower becomes hundred petaled Through education savage nations become civilized and even the animals become domesticated Education must be considered as most important for as diseases in the world of bodies are extremely contagious so in the same way qualities of spirit and heart are extremely contagious Education has a universal influence and the differences caused by it are very great Perhaps someone will say that since the capacity and worthiness of men differ therefore the difference of capacity certainly causes the difference of characters one hundred fifty But this is not so for capacity is of two kinds natural capacity and acquired capacity The first which is the creation of God is purely good in the creation of God there is no evil but the acquired capacity has become the cause of the appearance of evil For example God has created all men in such a manner and has given them such a constitution and such capacities that they are benefited by sugar and honey and harmed and destroyed by poison This nature and constitution is innate and God has given it equally to all mankind But man begins little by little to accustom himself to poison by taking a small quantity each day and gradually increasing it until he reaches such a point that he cannot live without a gram of opium every day The natural capacities are thus completely perverted Observe how much the natural capacity and constitution can be changed until by different habits and training they become entirely perverted One does not criticize vicious people because of their innate capacities and nature but rather for their acquired capacities and nature In creation there is no evil all is good Certain qualities and natures innate in some men and apparently blameworthy are not so in reality For example from the beginning of his life you can see in a nursing child the signs of greed of anger and of temper Then it may be said good and evil are innate in the reality of man and this is contrary to the pure goodness of nature and creation The answer to this is that greed which is to ask for something more is a praiseworthy quality provided that it is used suitably So if a man is greedy to acquire science and knowledge or to become compassionate generous and just it is most praiseworthy If he exercises his anger and wrath against the bloodthirsty tyrants who are like ferocious beasts it is very praiseworthy but if he does not use these qualities in a right way they are blameworthy Then it is evident that in creation and nature evil does not exist at all but when the natural qualities of man are used in an unlawful way they are blameworthy So if a rich and generous person gives a sum of money to a poor man for his own necessities and if the poor man spends that sum of money on unlawful things that will be blameworthy It is the same with all the natural qualities of man which constitute the capital of life if they be used and displayed in an unlawful way they become blameworthy Therefore it is clear that creation is purely good Consider that the worst of qualities and most odious of attributes which is the foundation of all evil is lying No worse or more blameworthy quality than this can be imagined to exist it is the destroyer of all human perfections and the cause of innumerable vices There is no worse characteristic than this it is the foundation of all evils Notwithstanding all this if a doctor consoles a sick man by saying Thank God you are better and there is hope of your recovery though these words are contrary to the truth yet they may become the consolation of the patient and the turning point of the illness This is not blameworthy This question is now clearly elucidated Salutations fifty eight THE DEGREE OF KNOWLEDGE POSSESSED BY MAN AND THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS Question Of what degree is the perception of the human world and what are its limitations Answer Know that perception varies The lowest degree of perception is that of the animals that is to say the natural feeling which appears through the powers of the senses and which is called sensation In this men and animals are sharers moreover some animals with regard to the senses are more powerful than man But in humanity perception differs and varies in accordance with the different conditions of man The first condition of perception in the world of nature is the perception of the rational soul In this perception and in this power all men are sharers whether they be neglectful or vigilant believers or deniers This human rational soul is God s creation it encompasses and excels other creatures as it is more noble and distinguished it encompasses things The power of the rational soul can discover the realities of things comprehend the peculiarities of beings and penetrate the mysteries of existence All sciences knowledge arts wonders institutions discoveries and enterprises come from the exercised intelligence of the rational soul There was a time when they were unknown preserved mysteries and hidden secrets the rational soul gradually discovered them and brought them out from the plane of the invisible and the hidden into the realm of the visible This is the greatest power of perception in the world of nature which in its highest flight and soaring comprehends the realities the properties and the effects of the contingent beings But the universal divine mind which is beyond nature is the bounty of the Preexistent Power This universal mind is divine it embraces existing realities and it receives the light of the mysteries of God It is a conscious power not a power of investigation and of research The intellectual power of the world of nature is a power of investigation and by its researches it discovers the realities of beings and the properties of existences but the heavenly intellectual power which is beyond nature embraces things and is cognizant of things knows them understands them is aware of mysteries realities and divine significations and is the discoverer of the concealed verities of the Kingdom This divine intellectual power is the special attribute of the Holy Manifestations and the Dawning places of prophethood a ray of this light falls upon the mirrors of the hearts of the righteous and a portion and a share of this power comes to them through the Holy Manifestations The Holy Manifestations have three conditions one the physical condition one that of the rational soul and one that of the manifestation of perfection and of the lordly splendor The body comprehends things according to the degree of its ability in the physical world therefore in certain cases it shows physical weakness For example I was sleeping and unconscious the breeze of God passed over Me and awoke Me and commanded Me to proclaim the Word or when Christ in His thirtieth year was baptized and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him before this the Holy Spirit did not manifest itself in Him All these things refer to the bodily condition of the Manifestations but Their heavenly condition embraces all things knows all mysteries discovers all signs and rules over all things before as well as after Their mission it is the same That is why Christ has said I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last one hundred fifty one that is to say there has never been and never shall be any change and alteration in Me fifty nine MAN S KNOWLEDGE OF GOD Question To what extent can the understanding of man comprehend God Answer This subject requires ample time and to explain it thus at table is not easy nevertheless we will speak of it briefly Know that there are two kinds of knowledge the knowledge of the essence of a thing and the knowledge of its qualities The essence of a thing is known through its qualities otherwise it is unknown and hidden As our knowledge of things even of created and limited things is knowledge of their qualities and not of their essence how is it possible to comprehend in its essence the Divine Reality which is unlimited For the inner essence of anything is not comprehended but only its qualities For example the inner essence of the sun is unknown but is understood by its qualities which are heat and light The inner essence of man is unknown and not evident but by its qualities it is characterized and known Thus everything is known by its qualities and not by its essence Although the mind encompasses all things and the outward beings are comprehended by it nevertheless these beings with regard to their essence are unknown they are only known with regard to their qualities Then how can the eternal everlasting Lord Who is held sanctified from comprehension and conception be known by His essence That is to say as things can only be known by their qualities and not by their essence it is certain that the Divine Reality is unknown with regard to its essence and is known with regard to its attributes Besides how can the phenomenal reality embrace the Preexistent Reality For comprehension is the result of encompassing embracing must be so that comprehension may be and the Essence of Unity surrounds all and is not surrounded Also the difference of conditions in the world of beings is an obstacle to comprehension For example this mineral belongs to the mineral kingdom however far it may rise it can never comprehend the power of growth The plants the trees whatever progress they may make cannot conceive of the power of sight or the powers of the other senses and the animal cannot imagine the condition of man that is to say his spiritual powers Difference of condition is an obstacle to knowledge the inferior degree cannot comprehend the superior degree How then can the phenomenal reality comprehend the Preexistent Reality Knowing God therefore means the comprehension and the knowledge of His attributes and not of His Reality This knowledge of the attributes is also proportioned to the capacity and power of man it is not absolute Philosophy consists in comprehending the reality of things as they exist according to the capacity and the power of man For the phenomenal reality can comprehend the Preexistent attributes only to the extent of the human capacity The mystery of Divinity is sanctified and purified from the comprehension of the beings for all that comes to the imagination is that which man understands and the power of the understanding of man does not embrace the Reality of the Divine Essence All that man is able to understand are the attributes of Divinity the radiance of which appears and is visible in the world and within men s souls When we look at the world and within men s souls we see wonderful signs of the divine perfections which are clear and apparent for the reality of things proves the Universal Reality The Reality of Divinity may be compared to the sun which from the height of its magnificence shines upon all the horizons and each horizon and each soul receives a share of its radiance If this light and these rays did not exist beings would not exist all beings express something and partake of some ray and portion of this light The splendors of the perfections bounties and attributes of God shine forth and radiate from the reality of the Perfect Man that is to say the Unique One the supreme Manifestation of God Other beings receive only one ray but the supreme Manifestation is the mirror for this Sun which appears and becomes manifest in it with all its perfections attributes signs and wonders The knowledge of the Reality of the Divinity is impossible and unattainable but the knowledge of the Manifestations of God is the knowledge of God for the bounties splendors and divine attributes are apparent in Them Therefore if man attains to the knowledge of the Manifestations of God he will attain to the knowledge of God and if he be neglectful of the knowledge of the Holy Manifestations he will be bereft of the knowledge of God It is then ascertained and proved that the Holy Manifestations are the center of the bounty signs and perfections of God Blessed are those who receive the light of the divine bounties from the enlightened Dawning points We hope that the Friends of God like an attractive force will draw these bounties from the source itself and that they will arise with such illumination and signs that they will be evident proofs of the Sun of Reality sixty THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SPIRIT one Having shown that the spirit of man exists one hundred fifty two we must prove its immortality The immortality of the spirit is mentioned in the Holy Books it is the fundamental basis of the divine religions Now punishments and rewards are said to be of two kinds first the rewards and punishments of this life second those of the other world But the paradise and hell of existence are found in all the worlds of God whether in this world or in the spiritual heavenly worlds Gaining these rewards is the gaining of eternal life That is why Christ said Act in such a way that you may find eternal life and that you may be born of water and the spirit so that you may enter into the Kingdom one hundred fifty three The rewards of this life are the virtues and perfections which adorn the reality of man For example he was dark and becomes luminous he was ignorant and becomes wise he was neglectful and becomes vigilant he was asleep and becomes awakened he was dead and becomes living he was blind and becomes a seer he was deaf and becomes a hearer he was earthly and becomes heavenly he was material and becomes spiritual Through these rewards he gains spiritual birth and becomes a new creature He becomes the manifestation of the verse in the Gospel where it is said of the disciples that they were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God one hundred fifty four that is to say they were delivered from the animal characteristics and qualities which are the characteristics of human nature and they became qualified with the divine characteristics which are the bounty of God This is the meaning of the second birth For such people there is no greater torture than being veiled from God and no more severe punishment than sensual vices dark qualities lowness of nature engrossment in carnal desires When they are delivered through the light of faith from the darkness of these vices and become illuminated with the radiance of the sun of reality and ennobled with all the virtues they esteem this the greatest reward and they know it to be the true paradise In the same way they consider that the spiritual punishment that is to say the torture and punishment of existence is to be subjected to the world of nature to be veiled from God to be brutal and ignorant to fall into carnal lusts to be absorbed in animal frailties to be characterized with dark qualities such as falsehood tyranny cruelty attachment to the affairs of the world and being immersed in satanic ideas For them these are the greatest punishments and tortures Likewise the rewards of the other world are the eternal life which is clearly mentioned in all the Holy Books the divine perfections the eternal bounties and everlasting felicity The rewards of the other world are the perfections and the peace obtained in the spiritual worlds after leaving this world while the rewards of this life are the real luminous perfections which are realized in this world and which are the cause of eternal life for they are the very progress of existence It is like the man who passes from the embryonic world to the state of maturity and becomes the manifestation of these words Blessed therefore be God the most excellent of Makers one hundred fifty five The rewards of the other world are peace the spiritual graces the various spiritual gifts in the Kingdom of God the gaining of the desires of the heart and the soul and the meeting of God in the world of eternity In the same way the punishments of the other world that is to say the torments of the other world consist in being deprived of the special divine blessings and the absolute bounties and falling into the lowest degrees of existence He who is deprived of these divine favors although he continues after death is considered as dead by the people of truth The logical proof of the immortality of the spirit is this that no sign can come from a nonexisting thing that is to say it is impossible that from absolute nonexistence signs should appear for the signs are the consequence of an existence and the consequence depends upon the existence of the principle So from a nonexisting sun no light can radiate from a nonexisting sea no waves appear from a nonexisting cloud no rain falls a nonexisting tree yields no fruit a nonexisting man neither manifests nor produces anything Therefore as long as signs of existence appear they are a proof that the possessor of the sign is existent Consider that today the Kingdom of Christ exists From a nonexisting king how could such a great kingdom be manifested How from a nonexisting sea can the waves mount so high From a nonexisting garden how can such fragrant breezes be wafted Reflect that no effect no trace no influence remains of any being after its members are dispersed and its elements are decomposed whether it be a mineral a vegetable or an animal There is only the human reality and the spirit of man which after the disintegration of the members dispersing of the particles and the destruction of the composition persists and continues to act and to have power This question is extremely subtle consider it attentively This is a rational proof which we are giving so that the wise may weigh it in the balance of reason and justice But if the human spirit will rejoice and be attracted to the Kingdom of God if the inner sight becomes opened and the spiritual hearing strengthened and the spiritual feelings predominant he will see the immortality of the spirit as clearly as he sees the sun and the glad tidings and signs of God will encompass him Tomorrow we will give other proofs sixty one THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SPIRIT two Yesterday we were occupied in discussing the immortality of the spirit Know that the power and the comprehension of the human spirit are of two kinds that is to say they perceive and act in two different modes One way is through instruments and organs thus with this eye it sees with this ear it hears with this tongue it talks Such is the action of the spirit and the perception of the reality of man by means of organs that is to say that the spirit is the seer through the eyes the spirit is the hearer through the ear the spirit is the speaker through the tongue The other manifestation of the powers and actions of the spirit is without instruments and organs For example in the state of sleep without eyes it sees without an ear it hears without a tongue it speaks without feet it runs Briefly these actions are beyond the means of instruments and organs How often it happens that it sees a dream in the world of sleep and its signification becomes apparent two years afterward in corresponding events In the same way how many times it happens that a question which one cannot solve in the world of wakefulness is solved in the world of dreams In wakefulness the eye sees only for a short distance but in dreams he who is in the East sees the West Awake he sees the present in sleep he sees the future In wakefulness by means of rapid transit at the most he can travel only twenty farsakhs one hundred fifty six an hour in sleep in the twinkling of an eye he traverses the East and West For the spirit travels in two different ways without means which is spiritual traveling and with means which is material traveling as birds which fly and those which are carried In the time of sleep this body is as though dead it does not see nor hear it does not feel it has no consciousness no perception that is to say the powers of man have become inactive but the spirit lives and subsists Nay its penetration is increased its flight is higher and its intelligence is greater To consider that after the death of the body the spirit perishes is like imagining that a bird in a cage will be destroyed if the cage is broken though the bird has nothing to fear from the destruction of the cage Our body is like the cage and the spirit is like the bird We see that without the cage this bird flies in the world of sleep therefore if the cage becomes broken the bird will continue and exist Its feelings will be even more powerful its perceptions greater and its happiness increased In truth from hell it reaches a paradise of delights because for the thankful birds there is no paradise greater than freedom from the cage That is why with utmost joy and happiness the martyrs hasten to the plain of sacrifice In wakefulness the eye of man sees at the utmost as far as one hour of distance one hundred fifty seven because through the instrumentality of the body the power of the spirit is thus determined but with the inner sight and the mental eye it sees America and it can perceive that which is there and discover the conditions of things and organize affairs If then the spirit were the same as the body it would be necessary that the power of the inner sight should also be in the same proportion Therefore it is evident that this spirit is different from the body and that the bird is different from the cage and that the power and penetration of the spirit is stronger without the intermediary of the body Now if the instrument is abandoned the possessor of the instrument continues to act For example if the pen is abandoned or broken the writer remains living and present if a house is ruined the owner is alive and existing This is one of the logical evidences for the immortality of the soul There is another this body becomes weak or heavy or sick or it finds health it becomes tired or rested sometimes the hand or leg is amputated or its physical power is crippled it becomes blind or deaf or dumb its limbs may become paralyzed briefly the body may have all the imperfections Nevertheless the spirit in its original state in its own spiritual perception will be eternal and perpetual it neither finds any imperfection nor will it become crippled But when the body is wholly subjected to disease and misfortune it is deprived of the bounty of the spirit like a mirror which when it becomes broken or dirty or dusty cannot reflect the rays of the sun nor any longer show its bounties We have already explained that the spirit of man is not in the body because it is freed and sanctified from entrance and exit which are bodily conditions The connection of the spirit with the body is like that of the sun with the mirror Briefly the human spirit is in one condition It neither becomes ill from the diseases of the body nor cured by its health it does not become sick nor weak nor miserable nor poor nor light nor small that is to say it will not be injured because of the infirmities of the body and no effect will be visible even if the body becomes weak or if the hands and feet and tongue be cut off or if it loses the power of hearing or sight Therefore it is evident and certain that the spirit is different from the body and that its duration is independent of that of the body on the contrary the spirit with the utmost greatness rules in the world of the body and its power and influence like the bounty of the sun in the mirror are apparent and visible But when the mirror becomes dusty or breaks it will cease to reflect the rays of the sun sixty two PERFECTIONS ARE WITHOUT LIMIT Know that the conditions of existence are limited to the conditions of servitude of prophethood and of Deity but the divine and the contingent perfections are unlimited When you reflect deeply you discover that also outwardly the perfections of existence are also unlimited for you cannot find a being so perfect that you cannot imagine a superior one For example you cannot see a ruby in the mineral kingdom a rose in the vegetable kingdom or a nightingale in the animal kingdom without imagining that there might be better specimens As the divine bounties are endless so human perfections are endless If it were possible to reach a limit of perfection then one of the realities of the beings might reach the condition of being independent of God and the contingent might attain to the condition of the absolute But for every being there is a point which it cannot overpass that is to say he who is in the condition of servitude however far he may progress in gaining limitless perfections will never reach the condition of Deity It is the same with the other beings A mineral however far it may progress in the mineral kingdom cannot gain the vegetable power Also in a flower however far it may progress in the vegetable kingdom no power of the senses will appear So this silver mineral cannot gain hearing or sight it can only improve in its own condition and become a perfect mineral but it cannot acquire the power of growth or the power of sensation or attain to life it can only progress in its own condition For example Peter cannot become Christ All that he can do is in the condition of servitude to attain endless perfections for every existing reality is capable of making progress As the spirit of man after putting off this material form has an everlasting life certainly any existing being is capable of making progress therefore it is permitted to ask for advancement forgiveness mercy beneficence and blessings for a man after his death because existence is capable of progression That is why in the prayers of Baha u llah forgiveness and remission of sins are asked for those who have died Moreover as people in this world are in need of God they will also need Him in the other world The creatures are always in need and God is absolutely independent whether in this world or in the world to come The wealth of the other world is nearness to God Consequently it is certain that those who are near the Divine Court are allowed to intercede and this intercession is approved by God But intercession in the other world is not like intercession in this world It is another thing another reality which cannot be expressed in words If a wealthy man at the time of his death bequeaths a gift to the poor and miserable and gives a part of his wealth to be spent for them perhaps this action may be the cause of his pardon and forgiveness and of his progress in the Divine Kingdom Also a father and mother endure the greatest troubles and hardships for their children and often when the children have reached the age of maturity the parents pass on to the other world Rarely does it happen that a father and mother in this world see the reward of the care and trouble they have undergone for their children Therefore children in return for this care and trouble must show forth charity and beneficence and must implore pardon and forgiveness for their parents So you ought in return for the love and kindness shown you by your father to give to the poor for his sake with greatest submission and humility implore pardon and remission of sins and ask for the supreme mercy It is even possible that the condition of those who have died in sin and unbelief may become changed that is to say they may become the object of pardon through the bounty of God not through His justice for bounty is giving without desert and justice is giving what is deserved As we have power to pray for these souls here so likewise we shall possess the same power in the other world which is the Kingdom of God Are not all the people in that world the creatures of God Therefore in that world also they can make progress As here they can receive light by their supplications there also they can plead for forgiveness and receive light through entreaties and supplications Thus as souls in this world through the help of the supplications the entreaties and the prayers of the holy ones can acquire development so is it the same after death Through their own prayers and supplications they can also progress more especially when they are the object of the intercession of the Holy Manifestations sixty three THE PROGRESS OF MAN IN THE OTHER WORLD Know that nothing which exists remains in a state of repose that is to say all things are in motion Everything is either growing or declining all things are either coming from nonexistence into being or going from existence into nonexistence So this flower this hyacinth during a certain period of time was coming from the world of nonexistence into being and now it is going from being into nonexistence This state of motion is said to be essential that is natural it cannot be separated from beings because it is their essential requirement as it is the essential requirement of fire to burn Thus it is established that this movement is necessary to existence which is either growing or declining Now as the spirit continues to exist after death it necessarily progresses or declines and in the other world to cease to progress is the same as to decline but it never leaves its own condition in which it continues to develop For example the reality of the spirit of Peter however far it may progress will not reach to the condition of the Reality of Christ it progresses only in its own environment Look at this mineral However far it may evolve it only evolves in its own condition you cannot bring the crystal to a state where it can attain to sight This is impossible So the moon which is in the heavens however far it might evolve could never become a luminous sun but in its own condition it has apogee and perigee However far the disciples might progress they could never become Christ It is true that coal could become a diamond but both are in the mineral condition and their component elements are the same sixty four THE STATE OF MAN AND HIS PROGRESS AFTER DEATH When we consider beings with the seeing eye we observe that they are limited to three sorts that is to say as a whole they are either mineral vegetable or animal each of these three classes containing species Man is the highest species because he is the possessor of the perfections of all the classes that is he has a body which grows and which feels As well as having the perfections of the mineral of the vegetable and of the animal he also possesses an especial excellence which the other beings are without that is the intellectual perfections Therefore man is the most noble of beings Man is in the highest degree of materiality and at the beginning of spirituality that is to say he is the end of imperfection and the beginning of perfection He is at the last degree of darkness and at the beginning of light that is why it has been said that the condition of man is the end of the night and the beginning of day meaning that he is the sum of all the degrees of imperfection and that he possesses the degrees of perfection He has the animal side as well as the angelic side and the aim of an educator is to so train human souls that their angelic aspect may overcome their animal side Then if the divine power in man which is his essential perfection overcomes the satanic power which is absolute imperfection he becomes the most excellent among the creatures but if the satanic power overcomes the divine power he becomes the lowest of the creatures That is why he is the end of imperfection and the beginning of perfection Not in any other of the species in the world of existence is there such a difference contrast contradiction and opposition as in the species of man Thus the reflection of the Divine Light was in man as in Christ and see how loved and honored He is At the same time we see man worshiping a stone a clod of earth or a tree How vile he is in that his object of worship should be the lowest existence that is a stone or clay without spirit a mountain a forest or a tree What shame is greater for man than to worship the lowest existences In the same way knowledge is a quality of man and so is ignorance truthfulness is a quality of man so is falsehood trustworthiness and treachery justice and injustice are qualities of man and so forth Briefly all the perfections and virtues and all the vices are qualities of man Consider equally the differences between individual men The Christ was in the form of man and Caiaphas was in the form of man Moses and Pharaoh Abel and Cain Baha u llah and Yahya one hundred fifty eight were men Man is said to be the greatest representative of God and he is the Book of Creation because all the mysteries of beings exist in him If he comes under the shadow of the True Educator and is rightly trained he becomes the essence of essences the light of lights the spirit of spirits he becomes the center of the divine appearances the source of spiritual qualities the rising place of heavenly lights and the receptacle of divine inspirations If he is deprived of this education he becomes the manifestation of satanic qualities the sum of animal vices and the source of all dark conditions The reason of the mission of the Prophets is to educate men so that this piece of coal may become a diamond and this fruitless tree may be engrafted and yield the sweetest most delicious fruits When man reaches the noblest state in the world of humanity then he can make further progress in the conditions of perfection but not in state for such states are limited but the divine perfections are endless Both before and after putting off this material form there is progress in perfection but not in state So beings are consummated in perfect man There is no other being higher than a perfect man But man when he has reached this state can still make progress in perfections but not in state because there is no state higher than that of a perfect man to which he can transfer himself He only progresses in the state of humanity for the human perfections are infinite Thus however learned a man may be we can imagine one more learned Hence as the perfections of humanity are endless man can also make progress in perfections after leaving this world sixty five EXPLANATION OF A VERSE IN THE KITAB I AQDAS Question It is said in the Kitab i Aqdas whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray though he be the author of every righteous deed What is the meaning of this verse Answer This blessed verse means that the foundation of success and salvation is the knowledge of God and that the results of the knowledge of God are the good actions which are the fruits of faith If man has not this knowledge he will be separated from God and when this separation exists good actions have not complete effect This verse does not mean that the souls separated from God are equal whether they perform good or bad actions It signifies only that the foundation is to know God and the good actions result from this knowledge Nevertheless it is certain that between the good the sinners and the wicked who are veiled from God there is a difference For the veiled one who has good principles and character deserves the pardon of God while he who is a sinner and has bad qualities and character is deprived of the bounties and blessings of God Herein lies the difference Therefore the blessed verse means that good actions alone without the knowledge of God cannot be the cause of eternal salvation everlasting success and prosperity and entrance into the Kingdom of God sixty six THE EXISTENCE OF THE RATIONAL SOUL AFTER THE DEATH OF THE BODY Question After the body is put aside and the spirit has obtained freedom in what way will the rational soul exist Let us suppose that the souls who are assisted by the bounty of the Holy Spirit attain to true existence and eternal life But what becomes of the rational souls that is to say the veiled spirits one hundred fifty nine Answer Some think that the body is the substance and exists by itself and that the spirit is accidental and depends upon the substance of the body although on the contrary the rational soul is the substance and the body depends upon it If the accident that is to say the body be destroyed the substance the spirit remains Second the rational soul meaning the human spirit does not descend into the body that is to say it does not enter it for descent and entrance are characteristics of bodies and the rational soul is exempt from this The spirit never entered this body so in quitting it it will not be in need of an abiding place no the spirit is connected with the body as this light is with this mirror When the mirror is clear and perfect the light of the lamp will be apparent in it and when the mirror becomes covered with dust or breaks the light will disappear The rational soul that is to say the human spirit has neither entered this body nor existed through it so after the disintegration of the composition of the body how should it be in need of a substance through which it may exist On the contrary the rational soul is the substance through which the body exists The personality of the rational soul is from its beginning it is not due to the instrumentality of the body but the state and the personality of the rational soul may be strengthened in this world it will make progress and will attain to the degrees of perfection or it will remain in the lowest abyss of ignorance veiled and deprived from beholding the signs of God Question Through what means will the spirit of man that is to say the rational soul after departing from this mortal world make progress Answer The progress of man s spirit in the divine world after the severance of its connection with the body of dust is through the bounty and grace of the Lord alone or through the intercession and the sincere prayers of other human souls or through the charities and important good works which are performed in its name THE IMMORTALITY OF CHILDREN Question What is the condition of children who die before attaining the age of discretion or before the appointed time of birth Answer These infants are under the shadow of the favor of God and as they have not committed any sin and are not soiled with the impurities of the world of nature they are the centers of the manifestation of bounty and the Eye of Compassion will be turned upon them sixty seven ETERNAL LIFE AND ENTRANCE INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD You question about eternal life and the entrance into the Kingdom The outer expression used for the Kingdom is heaven but this is a comparison and similitude not a reality or fact for the Kingdom is not a material place it is sanctified from time and place It is a spiritual world a divine world and the center of the Sovereignty of God it is freed from body and that which is corporeal and it is purified and sanctified from the imaginations of the human world To be limited to place is a property of bodies and not of spirits Place and time surround the body not the mind and spirit Observe that the body of man is confined to a small place it covers only two spans of earth But the spirit and mind of man travel to all countries and regions even through the limitless space of the heavens surround all that exists and make discoveries in the exalted spheres and infinite distances This is because the spirit has no place it is placeless and for the spirit the earth and the heaven are as one since it makes discoveries in both But the body is limited to a place and does not know that which is beyond it For life is of two kinds that of the body and that of the spirit The life of the body is material life but the life of the spirit expresses the existence of the Kingdom which consists in receiving the Spirit of God and becoming vivified by the breath of the Holy Spirit Although the material life has existence it is pure nonexistence and absolute death for the holy saints So man exists and this stone also exists but what a difference between the existence of man and that of the stone Though the stone exists in relation to the existence of man it is nonexistent The meaning of eternal life is the gift of the Holy Spirit as the flower receives the gift of the season the air and the breezes of spring Consider this flower had life in the beginning like the life of the mineral but by the coming of the season of spring of the bounty of the clouds of the springtime and of the heat of the glowing sun it attained to another life of the utmost freshness delicacy and fragrance The first life of the flower in comparison to the second life is death The meaning is that the life of the Kingdom is the life of the spirit the eternal life and that it is purified from place like the spirit of man which has no place For if you examine the human body you will not find a special spot or locality for the spirit for it has never had a place it is immaterial It has a connection with the body like that of the sun with this mirror The sun is not within the mirror but it has a connection with the mirror In the same way the world of the Kingdom is sanctified from everything that can be perceived by the eye or by the other senses hearing smell taste or touch The mind which is in man the existence of which is recognized where is it in him If you examine the body with the eye the ear or the other senses you will not find it nevertheless it exists Therefore the mind has no place but it is connected with the brain The Kingdom is also like this In the same way love has no place but it is connected with the heart so the Kingdom has no place but is connected with man Entrance into the Kingdom is through the love of God through detachment through holiness and chastity through truthfulness purity steadfastness faithfulness and the sacrifice of life These explanations show that man is immortal and lives eternally For those who believe in God who have love of God and faith life is excellent that is it is eternal but to those souls who are veiled from God although they have life it is dark and in comparison with the life of believers it is nonexistence For example the eye and the nail are living but the life of the nail in relation to the life of the eye is nonexistent This stone and this man both exist but the stone in relation to the existence of man is nonexistent it has no being for when man dies and his body is destroyed and annihilated it becomes like stone and earth Therefore it is clear that although the mineral exists in relation to man it is nonexistent In the same way the souls who are veiled from God although they exist in this world and in the world after death are in comparison with the holy existence of the children of the Kingdom of God nonexisting and separated from God sixty eight FATE Question Is the predestination which is mentioned in the Holy Books a decreed thing If so is not the effort to avoid it useless Answer Fate is of two kinds one is decreed and the other is conditional or impending The decreed fate is that which cannot change or be altered and conditional fate is that which may occur So for this lamp the decreed fate is that the oil burns and will be consumed therefore its eventual extinction is a decree which it is impossible to alter or to change because it is a decreed fate In the same way in the body of man a power of life has been created and as soon as it is destroyed and ended the body will certainly be decomposed so when the oil in this lamp is burnt and finished the lamp will undoubtedly become extinguished But conditional fate may be likened to this while there is still oil a violent wind blows on the lamp which extinguishes it This is a conditional fate It is wise to avoid it to protect oneself from it to be cautious and circumspect But the decreed fate which is like the finishing of the oil in the lamp cannot be altered changed nor delayed It must happen it is inevitable that the lamp will become extinguished sixty nine THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARS Question Have the stars of the heavens any influence upon the human soul or have they not Answer Some of the celestial stars have a clear and apparent material effect upon the terrestrial globe and the earthly beings which needs no explanation Consider the sun which through the aid and the providence of God develops the earth and all earthly beings Without the light and heat of the sun all the earthly creatures would be entirely nonexistent With regard to the spiritual influence of stars though this influence of stars in the human world may appear strange still if you reflect deeply upon this subject you will not be so much surprised at it My meaning is not however that the decrees which the astrologers of former times inferred from the movements of the stars corresponded to occurrences for the decrees of those former astrologers were forms of imagination which were originated by Egyptian Assyrian and Chaldean priests nay rather they were due to the fancies of Hindus to the myths of the Greeks Romans and other star worshipers But I mean that this limitless universe is like the human body all the members of which are connected and linked with one another with the greatest strength How much the organs the members and the parts of the body of man are intermingled and connected for mutual aid and help and how much they influence one another In the same way the parts of this infinite universe have their members and elements connected with one another and influence one another spiritually and materially For example the eye sees and all the body is affected the ear hears and all the members of the body are moved Of this there is no doubt and the universe is like a living person Moreover the connection which exists between the members of beings must necessarily have an effect and impression whether it be material or spiritual For those who deny spiritual influence upon material things we mention this brief example wonderful sounds and tones melodies and charming voices are accidents which affect the air for sound is the term for vibrations of the air and by these vibrations the nerves of the tympanum of the ear are affected and hearing results Now reflect that the vibration of the air which is an accident of no importance attracts and exhilarates the spirit of man and has great effect upon him it makes him weep or laugh perhaps it will influence him to such a degree that he will throw himself into danger Therefore see the connection which exists between the spirit of man and the atmospheric vibration so that the movement of the air becomes the cause of transporting him from one state to another and of entirely overpowering him it will deprive him of patience and tranquillity Consider how strange this is for nothing comes forth from the singer which enters into the listener nevertheless a great spiritual effect is produced Therefore surely so great a connection between beings must have spiritual effect and influence It has been mentioned that the members and parts of man affect and influence one another For example the eye sees the heart is affected The ear hears and the spirit is influenced The heart is at rest the thoughts become serene and for all the members of man s body a pleasant condition is realized What a connection and what an agreement is this Since this connection this spiritual effect and this influence exists between the members of the body of man who is only one of many finite beings certainly between these universal and infinite beings there will also be a spiritual and material connection Although by existing rules and actual science these connections cannot be discovered nevertheless their existence between all beings is certain and absolute To conclude the beings whether great or small are connected with one another by the perfect wisdom of God and affect and influence one another If it were not so in the universal system and the general arrangement of existence there would be disorder and imperfection But as beings are connected one with another with the greatest strength they are in order in their places and perfect This subject is worthy of examination seventy FREE WILL Question Is man a free agent in all his actions or is he compelled and constrained Answer This question is one of the most important and abstruse of divine problems If God wills another day at the beginning of dinner we will undertake the explanation of this subject in detail now we will explain it briefly in a few words as follows Some things are subject to the free will of man such as justice equity tyranny and injustice in other words good and evil actions it is evident and clear that these actions are for the most part left to the will of man But there are certain things to which man is forced and compelled such as sleep death sickness decline of power injuries and misfortunes these are not subject to the will of man and he is not responsible for them for he is compelled to endure them But in the choice of good and bad actions he is free and he commits them according to his own will For example if he wishes he can pass his time in praising God or he can be occupied with other thoughts He can be an enkindled light through the fire of the love of God and a philanthropist loving the world or he can be a hater of mankind and engrossed with material things He can be just or cruel These actions and these deeds are subject to the control of the will of man himself consequently he is responsible for them Now another question arises Man is absolutely helpless and dependent since might and power belong especially to God Both exaltation and humiliation depend upon the good pleasure and the will of the Most High It is said in the New Testament that God is like a potter who makes one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour one hundred sixty Now the dishonored vessel has no right to find fault with the potter saying Why did you not make me a precious cup which is passed from hand to hand The meaning of this verse is that the states of beings are different That which is in the lowest state of existence like the mineral has no right to complain saying O God why have You not given me the vegetable perfections In the same way the plant has no right to complain that it has been deprived of the perfections of the animal world Also it is not befitting for the animal to complain of the want of the human perfections No all these things are perfect in their own degree and they must strive after the perfections of their own degree The inferior beings as we have said have neither the right to nor the fitness for the states of the superior perfections No their progress must be in their own state Also the inaction or the movement of man depend upon the assistance of God If he is not aided he is not able to do either good or evil But when the help of existence comes from the Generous Lord he is able to do both good and evil but if the help is cut off he remains absolutely helpless This is why in the Holy Books they speak of the help and assistance of God So this condition is like that of a ship which is moved by the power of the wind or steam if this power ceases the ship cannot move at all Nevertheless the rudder of the ship turns it to either side and the power of the steam moves it in the desired direction If it is directed to the east it goes to the east or if it is directed to the west it goes to the west This motion does not come from the ship no it comes from the wind or the steam In the same way in all the action or inaction of man he receives power from the help of God but the choice of good or evil belongs to the man himself So if a king should appoint someone to be the governor of a city and should grant him the power of authority and should show him the paths of justice and injustice according to the laws if then this governor should commit injustice although he should act by the authority and power of the king the latter would be absolved from injustice But if he should act with justice he would do it also through the authority of the king who would be pleased and satisfied That is to say though the choice of good and evil belongs to man under all circumstances he is dependent upon the sustaining help of life which comes from the Omnipotent The Kingdom of God is very great and all are captives in the grasp of His Power The servant cannot do anything by his own will God is powerful omnipotent and the Helper of all beings This question has become clearly explained Salutations seventy one VISIONS AND COMMUNICATION WITH SPIRITS Question Some people believe that they achieve spiritual discoveries that is to say that they converse with spirits What kind of communion is this Answer Spiritual discoveries are of two kinds one kind is of the imagination and is only the assertion of a few people the other kind resembles inspiration and this is real such are the revelations of Isaiah of Jeremiah and of saint John which are real Reflect that man s power of thought consists of two kinds One kind is true when it agrees with a determined truth Such conceptions find realization in the exterior world such are accurate opinions correct theories scientific discoveries and inventions The other kind of conceptions is made up of vain thoughts and useless ideas which yield neither fruit nor result and which have no reality No they surge like the waves of the sea of imaginations and they pass away like idle dreams In the same way there are two sorts of spiritual discoveries One is the revelations of the Prophets and the spiritual discoveries of the elect The visions of the Prophets are not dreams no they are spiritual discoveries and have reality They say for example I saw a person in a certain form and I said such a thing and he gave such an answer This vision is in the world of wakefulness and not in that of sleep Nay it is a spiritual discovery which is expressed as if it were the appearance of a vision The other kind of spiritual discoveries is made up of pure imaginations but these imaginations become embodied in such a way that many simple hearted people believe that they have a reality That which proves it clearly is that from this controlling of spirits no result or fruit has ever been produced No they are but narratives and stories Know that the reality of man embraces the realities of things and discovers the verities properties and secrets of things So all these arts wonders sciences and knowledge have been discovered by the human reality At one time these sciences knowledge wonders and arts were hidden and concealed secrets then gradually the human reality discovered them and brought them from the realm of the invisible to the plane of the visible Therefore it is evident that the reality of man embraces things Thus it is in Europe and discovers America it is on the earth and it makes discoveries in the heavens It is the revealer of the secrets of things and it is the knower of the realities of that which exists These discoveries corresponding to the reality are similar to revelation which is spiritual comprehension divine inspiration and the association of human spirits For instance the Prophet says I saw I said I heard such a thing It is therefore evident that the spirit has great perception without the intermediary of any of the five senses such as the eyes or ears Among spiritual souls there are spiritual understandings discoveries a communion which is purified from imagination and fancy an association which is sanctified from time and place So it is written in the Gospel that on Mount Tabor Moses and Elias came to Christ and it is evident that this was not a material meeting It was a spiritual condition which is expressed as a physical meeting The other sort of converse presence and communications of spirits is but imagination and fancy which only appears to have reality The mind and the thought of man sometimes discover truths and from this thought and discovery signs and results are produced This thought has a foundation But many things come to the mind of man which are like the waves of the sea of imaginations they have no fruit and no result comes from them In the same way man sees in the world of sleep a vision which becomes exactly realized at another time he sees a dream which has absolutely no result What we mean is that this state which we call the converse and communications of spirits is of two kinds one is simply imaginary and the other is like the visions which are mentioned in the Holy Book such as the revelations of saint John and Isaiah and the meeting of Christ with Moses and Elias These are real and produce wonderful effects in the minds and thoughts of men and cause their hearts to be attracted seventy two HEALING BY SPIRITUAL MEANS Question Some people heal the sick by spiritual means that is to say without medicine How is this Answer Know that there are four kinds of curing and healing without medicine Two are due to material causes and two to spiritual causes Of the two kinds of material healing one is due to the fact that in man both health and sickness are contagious The contagion of disease is violent and rapid while that of health is extremely weak and slow If two bodies are brought into contact with each other it is certain that microbic particles will pass from one to the other In the same way that disease is transferred from one body to another with rapid and strong contagion it may be that the strong health of a healthy man will alleviate a very slight malady in a sick person That is to say the contagion of disease is violent and has a rapid effect while that of health is very slow and has a small effect and it is only in very slight diseases that it has even this small effect The strong power of a healthy body can overcome a slight weakness of a sick body and health results This is one kind of healing The other kind of healing without medicine is through the magnetic force which acts from one body on another and becomes the cause of cure This force also has only a slight effect Sometimes one can benefit a sick person by placing one s hand upon his head or upon his heart Why Because of the effect of the magnetism and of the mental impression made upon the sick person which causes the disease to vanish But this effect is also very slight and weak Of the two other kinds of healing which are spiritual that is to say where the means of cure is a spiritual power one results from the entire concentration of the mind of a strong person upon a sick person when the latter expects with all his concentrated faith that a cure will be effected from the spiritual power of the strong person to such an extent that there will be a cordial connection between the strong person and the invalid The strong person makes every effort to cure the sick patient and the sick patient is then sure of receiving a cure From the effect of these mental impressions an excitement of the nerves is produced and this impression and this excitement of the nerves will become the cause of the recovery of the sick person So when a sick person has a strong desire and intense hope for something and hears suddenly the tidings of its realization a nervous excitement is produced which will make the malady entirely disappear In the same way if a cause of terror suddenly occurs perhaps an excitement may be produced in the nerves of a strong person which will immediately cause a malady The cause of the sickness will be no material thing for that person has not eaten anything and nothing harmful has touched him the excitement of the nerves is then the only cause of the illness In the same way the sudden realization of a chief desire will give such joy that the nerves will be excited by it and this excitement may produce health To conclude the complete and perfect connection between the spiritual doctor and the sick person that is a connection of such a kind that the spiritual doctor entirely concentrates himself and all the attention of the sick person is given to the spiritual doctor from whom he expects to realize health causes an excitement of the nerves and health is produced But all this has effect only to a certain extent and that not always For if someone is afflicted with a very violent disease or is wounded these means will not remove the disease nor close and heal the wound that is to say these means have no power in severe maladies unless the constitution helps because a strong constitution often overcomes disease This is the third kind of healing But the fourth kind of healing is produced through the power of the Holy Spirit This does not depend on contact nor on sight nor upon presence it is not dependent upon any condition Whether the disease be light or severe whether there be a contact of bodies or not whether a personal connection be established between the sick person and the healer or not this healing takes place through the power of the Holy Spirit seventy three HEALING BY MATERIAL MEANS Yesterday at table we spoke of curative treatment and spiritual healing which consists in treating maladies through the spiritual powers Now let us speak of material healing The science of medicine is still in a condition of infancy it has not reached maturity But when it has reached this point cures will be performed by things which are not repulsive to the smell and taste of man that is to say by aliments fruits and vegetables which are agreeable to the taste and have an agreeable smell For the provoking cause of disease that is to say the cause of the entrance of disease into the human body is either a physical one or is the effect of excitement of the nerves But the principal causes of disease are physical for the human body is composed of numerous elements but in the measure of an especial equilibrium As long as this equilibrium is maintained man is preserved from disease but if this essential balance which is the pivot of the constitution is disturbed the constitution is disordered and disease will supervene For instance there is a decrease in one of the constituent ingredients of the body of man and in another there is an increase so the proportion of the equilibrium is disturbed and disease occurs For example one ingredient must be one thousand grams in weight and another five grams in order that the equilibrium be maintained The part which is one thousand grams diminishes to seven hundred grams and that which is five grams augments until the measure of the equilibrium is disturbed then disease occurs When by remedies and treatments the equilibrium is reestablished the disease is banished So if the sugar constituent increases the health is impaired and when the doctor forbids sweet and starchy foods the sugar constituent diminishes the equilibrium is reestablished and the disease is driven off Now the readjustment of these constituents of the human body is obtained by two means either by medicines or by aliments and when the constitution has recovered its equilibrium disease is banished All the elements that are combined in man exist also in vegetables therefore if one of the constituents which compose the body of man diminishes and he partakes of foods in which there is much of that diminished constituent then the equilibrium will be established and a cure will be obtained So long as the aim is the readjustment of the constituents of the body it can be effected either by medicine or by food The majority of the diseases which overtake man also overtake the animal but the animal is not cured by drugs In the mountains as in the wilderness the animal s physician is the power of taste and smell The sick animal smells the plants that grow in the wilderness he eats those that are sweet and fragrant to his smell and taste and is cured The cause of his healing is this When the sugar ingredient has become diminished in his constitution he begins to long for sweet things therefore he eats an herb with a sweet taste for nature urges and guides him its smell and taste please him and he eats it The sugar ingredient in his nature will be increased and health will be restored It is therefore evident that it is possible to cure by foods aliments and fruits but as today the science of medicine is imperfect this fact is not yet fully grasped When the science of medicine reaches perfection treatment will be given by foods aliments fragrant fruits and vegetables and by various waters hot and cold in temperature This discourse is brief but if God wills at another time when the occasion is suitable this question will be more fully explained PART FIVE MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS seventy four THE NONEXISTENCE OF EVIL 
7515_220979_000003_000000	train-clean-360	The true explanation of this subject is very difficult 
7515_220979_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Know that beings are of two kinds material and spiritual those perceptible to the senses and those intellectual 
7515_220979_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Things which are sensible are those which are perceived by the five exterior senses thus those outward existences which the eyes see are called sensible 
7515_220979_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Intellectual things are those which have no outward existence but are conceptions of the mind 
7515_220979_000004_000002	train-clean-360	For example mind itself is an intellectual thing which has no outward existence 
7515_220979_000004_000003	train-clean-360	All man s characteristics and qualities form an intellectual existence and are not sensible 
7515_220979_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Briefly the intellectual realities such as all the qualities and admirable perfections of man are purely good and exist 
7515_220979_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Evil is simply their nonexistence 
7515_220979_000005_000002	train-clean-360	So ignorance is the want of knowledge error is the want of guidance forgetfulness is the want of memory stupidity is the want of good sense 
7515_220979_000005_000003	train-clean-360	All these things have no real existence 
7515_220979_000006_000000	train-clean-360	In the same way the sensible realities are absolutely good and evil is due to their nonexistence that is to say blindness is the want of sight deafness is the want of hearing poverty is the want of wealth illness is the want of health death is the want of life and weakness is the want of strength 
7515_220979_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind that is scorpions and serpents are poisonous 
7515_220979_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Are they good or evil for they are existing beings 
7515_220979_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Yes a scorpion is evil in relation to man a serpent is evil in relation to man but in relation to themselves they are not evil for their poison is their weapon and by their sting they defend themselves 
7515_220979_000007_000003	train-clean-360	But as the elements of their poison do not agree with our elements that is to say as there is antagonism between these different elements therefore this antagonism is evil but in reality as regards themselves they are good 
7515_220979_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The epitome of this discourse is that it is possible that one thing in relation to another may be evil and at the same time within the limits of its proper being it may not be evil 
7515_220979_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Then it is proved that there is no evil in existence all that God created He created good 
7515_220979_000008_000002	train-clean-360	This evil is nothingness so death is the absence of life 
7515_220979_000008_000003	train-clean-360	When man no longer receives life he dies 
7515_220979_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Darkness is the absence of light when there is no light there is darkness 
7515_220979_000008_000005	train-clean-360	Light is an existing thing but darkness is nonexistent 
7515_220979_000008_000006	train-clean-360	Wealth is an existing thing but poverty is nonexisting 
7515_220979_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Then it is evident that all evils return to nonexistence 
none	none	Good exists evil is nonexistent seventy five TWO KINDS OF TORMENT Know that there are two kinds of torment subtile and gross 
7515_220979_000011_000001	train-clean-360	For example ignorance itself is a torment but it is a subtile torment indifference to God is itself a torment so also are falsehood cruelty and treachery All the imperfections are torments but they are subtile torments Certainly for an intelligent man death is better than sin and a cut tongue is better than lying or calumny 
7515_220979_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The other kind of torment is gross such as penalties imprisonment beating expulsion and banishment 
7515_220979_000012_000001	train-clean-360	But for the people of God separation from God is the greatest torment of all 
none	none	seventy six THE JUSTICE AND MERCY OF GOD 
7515_220979_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Know that to do justice is to give to everyone according to his deserts For example when a workman labors from morning until evening justice requires that he shall be paid his wages but when he has done no work and taken no trouble he is given a gift this is bounty 
7515_220979_000014_000001	train-clean-360	If you give alms and gifts to a poor man although he has taken no trouble for you nor done anything to deserve it this is bounty 
7515_220979_000014_000002	train-clean-360	So Christ besought forgiveness for his murderers this is called bounty 
7515_220979_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Now the question of the good or evil of things is determined by reason or by law 
7515_220979_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Some believe that it is determined by law such are the Jews who believing all the commandments of the Pentateuch to be absolutely obligatory regard them as matters of law not of reason 
7515_220979_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Thus they say that one of the commandments of the Pentateuch is that it is unlawful to partake of meat and butter together because it is taref and taref in Hebrew means unclean as kosher means clean 
7515_220979_000015_000003	train-clean-360	This they say is a question of law and not of reason 
7515_220979_000016_000000	train-clean-360	But the theologians think that the good and evil of things depend upon both reason and law 
none	none	The chief foundation of the prohibition of murder theft treachery falsehood hypocrisy and cruelty is reason 
7515_220979_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Every intelligent man comprehends that murder theft treachery falsehood hypocrisy and cruelty are evil and reprehensible for if you prick a man with a thorn he will cry out complain and groan so it is evident that he will understand that murder according to reason is evil and reprehensible 
7515_220979_000016_000003	train-clean-360	If he commits a murder he will be responsible whether the renown of the Prophet has reached him or not for it is reason that formulates the reprehensible character of the action 
7515_220979_000016_000004	train-clean-360	When a man commits this bad action he will surely be responsible 
none	none	But in a place where the commands of a Prophet are not known and where the people do not act in conformity with the divine instructions such as the command of Christ to return good for evil but act according to the desires of nature that is if they torment those who torment them from the point of view of religion they are excused because the divine command has not been delivered to them 
7515_220979_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Though they do not deserve mercy and beneficence nevertheless God treats them with mercy and forgives them 
7515_220979_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Now vengeance according to reason is also blameworthy because through vengeance no good result is gained by the avenger 
7515_220979_000018_000001	train-clean-360	So if a man strikes another and he who is struck takes revenge by returning the blow what advantage will he gain 
7515_220979_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Will this be a balm for his wound or a remedy for his pain 
7515_220979_000018_000003	train-clean-360	No God forbid 
7515_220979_000018_000004	train-clean-360	In truth the two actions are the same both are injuries the only difference is that one occurred first and the other afterward 
7515_220979_000018_000005	train-clean-360	Therefore if he who is struck forgives nay if he acts in a manner contrary to that which has been used toward him this is laudable The law of the community will punish the aggressor but will not take revenge 
7515_220979_000018_000006	train-clean-360	This punishment has for its end to warn to protect and to oppose cruelty and transgression so that other men may not be tyrannical 
7515_220979_000019_000000	train-clean-360	But if he who has been struck pardons and forgives he shows the greatest mercy 
7515_220979_000019_000001	train-clean-360	This is worthy of admiration 
none	none	seventy seven THE RIGHT METHOD OF TREATING CRIMINALS Question Should a criminal be punished or forgiven and his crime overlooked 
7515_220980_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Answer There are two sorts of retributory punishments 
7515_220980_000003_000001	train-clean-360	One is vengeance the other chastisement 
7515_220980_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Man has not the right to take vengeance but the community has the right to punish the criminal and this punishment is intended to warn and to prevent so that no other person will dare to commit a like crime 
7515_220980_000003_000003	train-clean-360	This punishment is for the protection of man s rights but it is not vengeance vengeance appeases the anger of the heart by opposing one evil to another 
7515_220980_000003_000004	train-clean-360	This is not allowable for man has not the right to take vengeance 
7515_220980_000003_000005	train-clean-360	But if criminals were entirely forgiven the order of the world would be upset 
7515_220980_000003_000006	train-clean-360	So punishment is one of the essential necessities for the safety of communities but he who is oppressed by a transgressor has not the right to take vengeance 
7515_220980_000003_000007	train-clean-360	On the contrary he should forgive and pardon for this is worthy of the world of man 
7515_220980_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The communities must punish the oppressor the murderer the malefactor so as to warn and restrain others from committing like crimes 
7515_220980_000004_000001	train-clean-360	But the most essential thing is that the people must be educated in such a way that no crimes will be committed for it is possible to educate the masses so effectively that they will avoid and shrink from perpetrating crimes so that the crime itself will appear to them as the greatest chastisement the utmost condemnation and torment 
7515_220980_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore no crimes which require punishment will be committed 
7515_220980_000005_000000	train-clean-360	We must speak of things that are possible of performance in this world There are many theories and high ideas on this subject but they are not practicable consequently we must speak of things that are feasible 
7515_220980_000006_000000	train-clean-360	For example if someone oppresses injures and wrongs another and the wronged man retaliates this is vengeance and is censurable 
none	none	If the son of Amr kills the son of Zayd Zayd has not the right to kill the son of Amr if he does so this is vengeance If Amr dishonors Zayd the latter has not the right to dishonor Amr if he does so this is vengeance and it is very reprehensible 
7515_220980_000006_000003	train-clean-360	No rather he must return good for evil and not only forgive but also if possible be of service to his oppressor 
7515_220980_000006_000004	train-clean-360	This conduct is worthy of man for what advantage does he gain by vengeance The two actions are equivalent if one action is reprehensible both are reprehensible 
7515_220980_000006_000005	train-clean-360	The only difference is that one was committed first the other later 
7515_220980_000007_000000	train-clean-360	But the community has the right of defense and of self protection moreover the community has no hatred nor animosity for the murderer it imprisons or punishes him merely for the protection and security of others 
none	none	It is not for the purpose of taking vengeance upon the murderer but for the purpose of inflicting a punishment by which the community will be protected 
7515_220980_000007_000002	train-clean-360	If the community and the inheritors of the murdered one were to forgive and return good for evil the cruel would be continually ill treating others and assassinations would continually occur 
7515_220980_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Vicious people like wolves would destroy the sheep of God 
7515_220980_000007_000004	train-clean-360	The community has no ill will and rancor in the infliction of punishment and it does not desire to appease the anger of the heart its purpose is by punishment to protect others so that no atrocious actions may be committed 
none	none	Thus when Christ said Whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the left one also one hundred sixty one it was for the purpose of teaching men not to take personal revenge He did not mean that if a wolf should fall upon a flock of sheep and wish to destroy it the wolf should be encouraged to do so 
7515_220980_000008_000002	train-clean-360	No if Christ had known that a wolf had entered the fold and was about to destroy the sheep most certainly He would have prevented it 
7515_220980_000009_000000	train-clean-360	As forgiveness is one of the attributes of the Merciful One so also justice is one of the attributes of the Lord 
7515_220980_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The tent of existence is upheld upon the pillar of justice and not upon forgiveness 
7515_220980_000009_000002	train-clean-360	The continuance of mankind depends upon justice and not upon forgiveness 
7515_220980_000009_000003	train-clean-360	So if at present the law of pardon were practiced in all countries in a short time the world would be disordered and the foundations of human life would crumble 
7515_220980_000009_000004	train-clean-360	For example if the governments of Europe had not withstood the notorious Attila he would not have left a single living man 
7515_220980_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Some people are like bloodthirsty wolves if they see no punishment forthcoming they will kill men merely for pleasure and diversion 
7515_220980_000010_000001	train-clean-360	One of the tyrants of Persia killed his tutor merely for the sake of making merry for mere fun and sport 
none	none	The famous Mutavakkil the Abbasid having summoned his ministers councillors and functionaries to his presence let loose a box full of scorpions in the assembly and forbade anyone to move When the scorpions stung those present he burst forth into boisterous laughter 
7515_220980_000011_000000	train-clean-360	To recapitulate the constitution of the communities depends upon justice not upon forgiveness 
7515_220980_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Then what Christ meant by forgiveness and pardon is not that when nations attack you burn your homes plunder your goods assault your wives children and relatives and violate your honor you should be submissive in the presence of these tyrannical foes and allow them to perform all their cruelties and oppressions 
none	none	No the words of Christ refer to the conduct of two individuals toward each other if one person assaults another the injured one should forgive him 
7515_220980_000011_000003	train-clean-360	But the communities must protect the rights of man 
7515_220980_000011_000004	train-clean-360	So if someone assaults injures oppresses and wounds me I will offer no resistance and I will forgive him 
none	none	But if a person wishes to assault Siyyid Man sh adi one hundred sixty two certainly I will prevent him Although for the malefactor noninterference is apparently a kindness it would be an oppression to Man sh adi 
7515_220980_000011_000007	train-clean-360	If at this moment a wild Arab were to enter this place with a drawn sword wishing to assault wound and kill you most assuredly I would prevent him 
7515_220980_000011_000008	train-clean-360	If I abandoned you to the Arab that would not be justice but injustice 
7515_220980_000011_000009	train-clean-360	But if he injure me personally I would forgive him 
7515_220980_000012_000000	train-clean-360	One thing remains to be said it is that the communities are day and night occupied in making penal laws and in preparing and organizing instruments and means of punishment 
7515_220980_000012_000001	train-clean-360	They build prisons make chains and fetters arrange places of exile and banishment and different kinds of hardships and tortures and think by these means to discipline criminals whereas in reality they are causing destruction of morals and perversion of characters 
7515_220980_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The community on the contrary ought day and night to strive and endeavor with the utmost zeal and effort to accomplish the education of men to cause them day by day to progress and to increase in science and knowledge to acquire virtues to gain good morals and to avoid vices so that crimes may not occur 
7515_220980_000012_000003	train-clean-360	At the present time the contrary prevails the community is always thinking of enforcing the penal laws and of preparing means of punishment instruments of death and chastisement places for imprisonment and banishment and they expect crimes to be committed 
7515_220980_000012_000004	train-clean-360	This has a demoralizing effect 
7515_220980_000013_000000	train-clean-360	But if the community would endeavor to educate the masses day by day knowledge and sciences would increase the understanding would be broadened the sensibilities developed customs would become good and morals normal in one word in all these classes of perfections there would be progress and there would be fewer crimes 
7515_220980_000014_000000	train-clean-360	It has been ascertained that among civilized peoples crime is less frequent than among uncivilized that is to say among those who have acquired the true civilization which is divine civilization the civilization of those who unite all the spiritual and material perfections 
7515_220980_000014_000001	train-clean-360	As ignorance is the cause of crimes the more knowledge and science increases the more crimes will diminish 
7515_220980_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Consider how often murder occurs among the barbarians of Africa they even kill one another in order to eat each other s flesh and blood 
7515_220980_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Why do not such savageries occur in Switzerland 
7515_220980_000014_000004	train-clean-360	The reason is evident it is because education and virtues prevent them 
none	none	Therefore the communities must think of preventing crimes rather than of rigorously punishing them seventy eight STRIKES You have questioned me about strikes This question is and will be for a long time the subject of great difficulties Strikes are due to two causes One is the extreme greed and rapacity of the manufacturers and industrialists the other the excesses the avidity and intransigence of the workmen and artisans It is therefore necessary to remedy these two causes But the principal cause of these difficulties lies in the laws of the present civilization for they lead to a small number of individuals accumulating incomparable fortunes beyond their needs while the greater number remain destitute stripped and in the greatest misery This is contrary to justice to humanity to equity it is the height of iniquity the opposite to what causes divine satisfaction This contrast is peculiar to the world of man with other creatures that is to say with nearly all animals there is a kind of justice and equality Thus equality exists in a shepherd s flock and in a herd of deer in the country Likewise among the birds of the prairie of the plain of the hills or of the orchard and among every kind of animal some kind of equality prevails With them such a difference in the means of existence is not to be found so they live in the most complete peace and joy It is quite otherwise with the human species which persists in the greatest error and in absolute iniquity Consider an individual who has amassed treasures by colonizing a country for his profit he has obtained an incomparable fortune and has secured profits and incomes which flow like a river while a hundred thousand unfortunate people weak and powerless are in need of a mouthful of bread There is neither equality nor benevolence So you see that general peace and joy are destroyed and the welfare of humanity is negated to such an extent as to make fruitless the lives of many For fortune honors commerce industry are in the hands of some industrialists while other people are submitted to quite a series of difficulties and to limitless troubles they have neither advantages nor profits nor comforts nor peace Then rules and laws should be established to regulate the excessive fortunes of certain private individuals and meet the needs of millions of the poor masses thus a certain moderation would be obtained However absolute equality is just as impossible for absolute equality in fortunes honors commerce agriculture industry would end in disorderliness in chaos in disorganization of the means of existence and in universal disappointment the order of the community would be quite destroyed Thus difficulties will also arise when unjustified equality is imposed It is therefore preferable for moderation to be established by means of laws and regulations to hinder the constitution of the excessive fortunes of certain individuals and to protect the essential needs of the masses For instance the manufacturers and the industrialists heap up a treasure each day and the poor artisans do not gain their daily sustenance that is the height of iniquity and no just man can accept it Therefore laws and regulations should be established which would permit the workmen to receive from the factory owner their wages and a share in the fourth or the fifth part of the profits according to the capacity of the factory or in some other way the body of workmen and the manufacturers should share equitably the profits and advantages Indeed the capital and management come from the owner of the factory and the work and labor from the body of the workmen Either the workmen should receive wages which assure them an adequate support and when they cease work becoming feeble or helpless they should have sufficient benefits from the income of the industry or the wages should be high enough to satisfy the workmen with the amount they receive so that they may themselves be able to put a little aside for days of want and helplessness When matters will be thus fixed the owner of the factory will no longer put aside daily a treasure which he has absolutely no need of for if the fortune is disproportionate the capitalist succumbs under a formidable burden and gets into the greatest difficulties and troubles the administration of an excessive fortune is very difficult and exhausts man s natural strength And the workmen and artisans will no longer be in the greatest misery and want they will no longer be submitted to the worst privations at the end of their life It is then clear and evident that the repartition of excessive fortunes among a small number of individuals while the masses are in need is an iniquity and an injustice In the same way absolute equality would be an obstacle to life to welfare to order and to the peace of humanity In such a question moderation is preferable It lies in the capitalists being moderate in the acquisition of their profits and in their having a consideration for the welfare of the poor and needy that is to say that the workmen and artisans receive a fixed and established daily wage and have a share in the general profits of the factory It would be well with regard to the common rights of manufacturers workmen and artisans that laws be established giving moderate profits to manufacturers and to workmen the necessary means of existence and security for the future Thus when they become feeble and cease working get old and helpless or leave behind children under age they and their children will not be annihilated by excess of poverty And it is from the income of the factory itself to which they have a right that they will derive a share however small toward their livelihood In the same way the workmen should no longer make excessive claims and revolt nor demand beyond their rights they should no longer go out on strike they should be obedient and submissive and not ask for exorbitant wages But the mutual and reasonable rights of both associated parties will be legally fixed and established according to custom by just and impartial laws In case one of the two parties should transgress the court of justice should condemn the transgressor and the executive branch should enforce the verdict thus order will be reestablished and the difficulties settled The interference of courts of justice and of the government in difficulties pending between manufacturers and workmen is legal for the reason that current affairs between workmen and manufacturers cannot be compared with ordinary affairs between private persons which do not concern the public and with which the government should not occupy itself In reality although they appear to be private matters these difficulties between the two parties produce a detriment to the public for commerce industry agriculture and the general affairs of the country are all intimately linked together If one of these suffers an abuse the detriment affects the mass Thus the difficulties between workmen and manufacturers become a cause of general detriment The court of justice and the government have therefore the right of interference When a difficulty occurs between two individuals with reference to private rights it is necessary for a third to settle the question This is the part of the government Then the problem of strikes which cause troubles in the country and are often connected with the excessive vexations of the workmen as well as with the rapacity of manufacturers how could it remain neglected Good God Is it possible that seeing one of his fellow creatures starving destitute of everything a man can rest and live comfortably in his luxurious mansion He who meets another in the greatest misery can he enjoy his fortune That is why in the Religion of God it is prescribed and established that wealthy men each year give over a certain part of their fortune for the maintenance of the poor and unfortunate That is the foundation of the Religion of God and is binding upon all And as man in this way is not forced nor obliged by the government but is by the natural tendency of his good heart voluntarily and radiantly showing benevolence toward the poor such a deed is much praised approved and pleasing Such is the meaning of the good works in the Divine Books and Tablets seventy nine THE REALITY OF THE EXTERIOR WORLD Certain sophists think that existence is an illusion that each being is an absolute illusion which has no existence in other words that the existence of beings is like a mirage or like the reflection of an image in water or in a mirror which is only an appearance having in itself no principle foundation or reality This theory is erroneous for though the existence of beings in relation to the existence of God is an illusion nevertheless in the condition of being it has a real and certain existence It is futile to deny this For example the existence of the mineral in comparison with that of man is nonexistence for when man is apparently annihilated his body becomes mineral but the mineral has existence in the mineral world Therefore it is evident that earth in relation to the existence of man is nonexistent and its existence is illusory but in relation to the mineral it exists In the same manner the existence of beings in comparison with the existence of God is but illusion and nothingness it is an appearance like the image reflected in a mirror But though an image which is seen in a mirror is an illusion the source and the reality of that illusory image is the person reflected whose face appears in the mirror Briefly the reflection in relation to the person reflected is an illusion Then it is evident that although beings in relation to the existence of God have no existence but are like the mirage or the reflections in the mirror yet in their own degree they exist That is why those who were heedless and denied God were said by Christ to be dead although they were apparently living in relation to the people of faith they were dead blind deaf and dumb This is what Christ meant when He said Let the dead bury their dead one hundred sixty three eighty REAL PREEXISTENCE Question How many kinds of preexistence and of phenomena are there Answer Some sages and philosophers believe that there are two kinds of preexistence essential preexistence and preexistence of time Phenomena are also of two kinds essential phenomena and that of time Essential preexistence is an existence which is not preceded by a cause but essential phenomena are preceded by causes Preexistence of time is without beginning but the phenomena of time have beginnings and endings for the existence of everything depends upon four causes the efficient cause the matter the form and the final cause For example this chair has a maker who is a carpenter a substance which is wood a form which is that of a chair and a purpose which is that it is to be used as a seat Therefore this chair is essentially phenomenal for it is preceded by a cause and its existence depends upon causes This is called the essential and really phenomenal Now this world of existence in relation to its maker is a real phenomenon As the body is sustained by the spirit it is in relation to the spirit an essential phenomenon The spirit is independent of the body and in relation to it the spirit is an essential preexistence Though the rays are always inseparable from the sun nevertheless the sun is preexistent and the rays are phenomenal for the existence of the rays depends upon that of the sun But the existence of the sun does not depend upon that of the rays for the sun is the giver and the rays are the gift The second proposition is that existence and nonexistence are both relative If it be said that such a thing came into existence from nonexistence this does not refer to absolute nonexistence but means that its former condition in relation to its actual condition was nothingness For absolute nothingness cannot find existence as it has not the capacity of existence Man like the mineral is existing but the existence of the mineral in relation to that of man is nothingness for when the body of man is annihilated it becomes dust and mineral But when dust progresses into the human world and this dead body becomes living man becomes existing Though the dust that is to say the mineral has existence in its own condition in relation to man it is nothingness Both exist but the existence of dust and mineral in relation to man is nonexistence and nothingness for when man becomes nonexistent he returns to dust and mineral Therefore though the world of contingency exists in relation to the existence of God it is nonexistent and nothingness Man and dust both exist but how great the difference between the existence of the mineral and that of man The one in relation to the other is nonexistence In the same way the existence of creation in relation to the existence of God is nonexistence Thus it is evident and clear that although the beings exist in relation to God and to the Word of God they are nonexistent This is the beginning and the end of the Word of God Who says I am Alpha and Omega for He is the beginning and the end of Bounty The Creator always had a creation the rays have always shone and gleamed from the reality of the sun for without the rays the sun would be opaque darkness The names and attributes of God require the existence of beings and the Eternal Bounty does not cease If it were to it would be contrary to the perfections of God eighty one REINCARNATION Question What is the truth of the question of reincarnation which is believed by some people Answer The object of what we are about to say is to explain the reality not to deride the beliefs of other people it is only to explain the facts that is all We do not oppose anyone s ideas nor do we approve of criticism Know then that those who believe in reincarnation are of two classes one class does not believe in the spiritual punishments and rewards of the other world and they suppose that man by reincarnation and return to this world gains rewards and recompenses they consider heaven and hell to be restricted to this world and do not speak of the existence of the other world Among these there are two further divisions One division thinks that man sometimes returns to this world in the form of an animal in order to undergo severe punishment and that after enduring this painful torment he will be released from the animal world and will come again into the human world this is called transmigration The other division thinks that from the human world one again returns to the human world and that by this return rewards and punishments for a former life are obtained this is called reincarnation Neither of these classes speak of any other world besides this one The second sort of believers in reincarnation affirm the existence of the other world and they consider reincarnation the means of becoming perfect that is they think that man by going from and coming again to this world will gradually acquire perfections until he reaches the inmost perfection In other words that men are composed of matter and force matter in the beginning that is to say in the first cycle is imperfect but on coming repeatedly to this world it progresses and acquires refinement and delicacy until it becomes like a polished mirror and force which is no other than spirit is realized in it with all the perfections This is the presentation of the subject by those who believe in reincarnation and transmigration We have condensed it if we entered into the details it would take much time This summary is sufficient No logical arguments and proofs of this question are brought forward they are only suppositions and inferences from conjectures and not conclusive arguments Proofs must be asked for from the believers in reincarnation and not conjectures suppositions and imaginations But you have asked for arguments of the impossibility of reincarnation This is what we must now explain The first argument for its impossibility is that the outward is the expression of the inward the earth is the mirror of the Kingdom the material world corresponds to the spiritual world Now observe that in the sensible world appearances are not repeated for no being in any respect is identical with nor the same as another being The sign of singleness is visible and apparent in all things If all the granaries of the world were full of grain you would not find two grains absolutely alike the same and identical without any distinction It is certain that there will be differences and distinctions between them As the proof of uniqueness exists in all things and the Oneness and Unity of God is apparent in the reality of all things the repetition of the same appearance is absolutely impossible Therefore reincarnation which is the repeated appearance of the same spirit with its former essence and condition in this same world of appearance is impossible and unrealizable As the repetition of the same appearance is impossible and interdicted for each of the material beings so for spiritual beings also a return to the same condition whether in the arc of descent or in the arc of ascent is interdicted and impossible for the material corresponds to the spiritual Nevertheless the return of material beings with regard to species is evident so the trees which during former years brought forth leaves blossoms and fruits in the coming years will bring forth exactly the same leaves blossoms and fruits This is called the repetition of species If anyone makes an objection saying that the leaf the blossom and the fruit have been decomposed and have descended from the vegetable world to the mineral world and again have come back from the mineral world to the vegetable world and therefore there has been a repetition the answer is that the blossom the leaf and the fruit of last year were decomposed and these combined elements were disintegrated and were dispersed in space and that the particles of the leaf and fruit of last year after decomposition have not again become combined and have not returned On the contrary by the composition of new elements the species has returned It is the same with the human body which after decomposition becomes disintegrated and the elements which composed it are dispersed If in like manner this body should again return from the mineral or vegetable world it would not have exactly the same composition of elements as the former man Those elements have been decomposed and dispersed they are dissipated in this vast space Afterward other particles of elements have been combined and a second body has been formed it may be that one of the particles of the former individual has entered into the composition of the succeeding individual but these particles have not been conserved and kept exactly and completely without addition or diminution so that they may be combined again and from that composition and mingling another individual may come into existence So it cannot be proved that this body with all its particles has returned that the former man has become the latter and that consequently there has been repetition that the spirit also like the body has returned and that after death its essence has come back to this world If we say that this reincarnation is for acquiring perfections so that matter may become refined and delicate and that the light of the spirit may be manifest in it with the greatest perfection this also is mere imagination For even supposing we believe in this argument still change of nature is impossible through renewal and return The essence of imperfection by returning does not become the reality of perfection complete darkness by returning does not become the source of light the essence of weakness is not transformed into power and might by returning and an earthly nature does not become a heavenly reality The tree of Zaqqum one hundred sixty four no matter how frequently it may come back will not bring forth sweet fruit and the good tree no matter how often it may return will not bear a bitter fruit Therefore it is evident that returning and coming back to the material world does not become the cause of perfection This theory has no proofs nor evidences it is simply an idea No in reality the cause of acquiring perfections is the bounty of God The Theosophists believe that man on the arc of ascent one hundred sixty five will return many times until he reaches the Supreme Center in that condition matter becomes a clear mirror the light of the spirit will shine upon it with its full power and essential perfection will be acquired Now this is an established and deep theological proposition that the material worlds are terminated at the end of the arc of descent and that the condition of man is at the end of the arc of descent and at the beginning of the arc of ascent which is opposite to the Supreme Center Also from the beginning to the end of the arc of ascent there are numerous spiritual degrees The arc of descent is called beginning one hundred sixty six and that of ascent is called progress one hundred sixty seven The arc of descent ends in materialities and the arc of ascent ends in spiritualities The point of the compass in describing a circle makes no retrograde motion for this would be contrary to the natural movement and the divine order otherwise the symmetry of the circle would be spoiled Moreover this material world has not such value or such excellence that man after having escaped from this cage will desire a second time to fall into this snare No through the Eternal Bounty the worth and true ability of man becomes apparent and visible by traversing the degrees of existence and not by returning When the shell is once opened it will be apparent and evident whether it contains a pearl or worthless matter When once the plant has grown it will bring forth either thorns or flowers there is no need for it to grow up again Besides advancing and moving in the worlds in a direct order according to the natural law is the cause of existence and a movement contrary to the system and law of nature is the cause of nonexistence The return of the soul after death is contrary to the natural movement and opposed to the divine system Therefore by returning it is absolutely impossible to obtain existence it is as if man after being freed from the womb should return to it a second time Consider what a puerile imagination this is which is implied by the belief in reincarnation and transmigration Believers in it consider the body as a vessel in which the spirit is contained as water is contained in a cup this water has been taken from one cup and poured into another This is child s play They do not realize that the spirit is an incorporeal being and does not enter and come forth but is only connected with the body as the sun is with the mirror If it were thus and the spirit by returning to this material world could pass through the degrees and attain to essential perfection it would be better if God prolonged the life of the spirit in the material world until it had acquired perfections and graces it then would not be necessary for it to taste of the cup of death or to acquire a second life The idea that existence is restricted to this perishable world and the denial of the existence of divine worlds originally proceeded from the imaginations of certain believers in reincarnation but the divine worlds are infinite If the divine worlds culminated in this material world creation would be futile nay existence would be pure child s play The result of these endless beings which is the noble existence of man would come and go for a few days in this perishable dwelling and after receiving punishments and rewards at last all would become perfect The divine creation and the infinite existing beings would be perfected and completed and then the Divinity of the Lord and the names and qualities of God on behalf of these spiritual beings would as regards their effect result in laziness and inaction Glory to thy Lord the Lord Who is sanctified from all their descriptions one hundred sixty eight Such were the limited minds of the former philosophers like Ptolemy and the others who believed and imagined that the world life and existence were restricted to this terrestrial globe and that this boundless space was confined within the nine spheres of heaven and that all were empty and void Consider how greatly their thoughts were limited and how weak their minds Those who believe in reincarnation think that the spiritual worlds are restricted to the worlds of human imagination Moreover some of them like the Druzes and the Nusayris think that existence is restricted to this physical world What an ignorant supposition For in this universe of God which appears in the most complete perfection beauty and grandeur the luminous stars of the material universe are innumerable Then we must reflect how limitless and infinite are the spiritual worlds which are the essential foundation Take heed ye who are endued with discernment one hundred sixty nine But let us return to our subject In the Divine Scriptures and Holy Books return is spoken of but the ignorant have not understood the meaning and those who believed in reincarnation have made conjectures on the subject For what the divine Prophets meant by return is not the return of the essence but that of the qualities it is not the return of the Manifestation but that of the perfections In the Gospel it says that John the son of Zacharias is Elias These words do not mean the return of the rational soul and personality of Elias in the body of John but rather that the perfections and qualities of Elias were manifested and appeared in John A lamp shone in this room last night and when tonight another lamp shines we say the light of last night is again shining Water flows from a fountain then it ceases and when it begins to flow a second time we say this water is the same water flowing again or we say this light is identical with the former light It is the same with the spring of last year when blossoms flowers and sweet scented herbs bloomed and delicious fruits were brought forth next year we say that those delicious fruits have come back and those blossoms flowers and blooms have returned and come again This does not mean that exactly the same particles composing the flowers of last year have after decomposition been again combined and have then come back and returned On the contrary the meaning is that the delicacy freshness delicious perfume and wonderful color of the flowers of last year are visible and apparent in exactly the same manner in the flowers of this year Briefly this expression refers only to the resemblance and likeness which exist between the former and latter flowers The return which is mentioned in the Divine Scriptures is this it is fully explained by the Supreme Pen one hundred seventy in the Kitab i Iqan Refer to it so that you may be informed of the truth of the divine mysteries Upon you be greetings and praise eighty two PANTHEISM Question How do the Theosophists and the Sufis understand the question of pantheism one hundred seventy one What does it mean and how nearly does it approximate to the truth Answer Know that the subject of pantheism is ancient It is a belief not restricted to the Theosophists and the Sufis on the contrary some of the sages of Greece believed in it like Aristotle who said The simple truth is all things but it is not any one of them In this case simple is the opposite of composed it is the isolated Reality which is purified and sanctified from composition and division and which resolves Itself into innumerable forms Therefore Real Existence is all things but It is not one of the things Briefly the believers in pantheism think that Real Existence can be compared to the sea and that beings are like the waves of the sea These waves which signify the beings are innumerable forms of that Real Existence therefore the Holy Reality is the Sea of Preexistence one hundred seventy two and the innumerable forms of the creatures are the waves which appear Likewise they compare this theory to real unity and the infinitude of numbers the real unity reflects itself in the degrees of infinite numbers for numbers are the repetition of the real unity So the number two is the repetition of one and it is the same with the other numbers One of their proofs is this all beings are things known of God and knowledge without things known does not exist for knowledge is related to that which exists and not to nothingness Pure nonexistence can have no specification or individualization in the degrees of knowledge Therefore the realities of beings which are the things known of God the Most High have the existence which knowledge has one hundred seventy three since they have the form of the Divine Knowledge and they are preexistent as the Divine Knowledge is preexistent As knowledge is preexistent the things known are equally so and the individualizations and the specifications of beings which are the preexistent knowledges of the Essence of Unity are the Divine Knowledge itself For the realities of the Essence of Unity knowledge and the things known have an absolute unity which is real and established Otherwise the Essence of Unity would become the place of multiple phenomena and the multiplicity of preexistences one hundred seventy four would become necessary which is absurd So it is proved that the things known constitute knowledge itself and knowledge the Essence itself that is to say that the Knower the knowledge and the things known are one single reality And if one imagines anything outside of this it necessitates coming back to the multiplicity of preexistences and to enchainment one hundred seventy five and preexistences end by becoming innumerable As the individualization and the specification of beings in the knowledge of God were the Essence of Unity itself and as there was not any difference between them there was but one veritable Unity and all the things known were diffused and included in the reality of the one Essence that is to say that according to the mode of simplicity and of unity they constitute the knowledge of God the Most High and the Essence of the Reality When God manifested His glory these individualizations and these specifications of beings which had a virtual existence that is to say which were a form of the Divine Knowledge found their existence substantiated in the external world and this Real Existence resolved Itself into infinite forms Such is the foundation of their argument The Theosophists and the Sufis are divided into two branches one comprising the mass who simply in the spirit of imitation believe pantheism without comprehending the meaning of their renowned savants for the mass of the Sufis believe that the signification of Being is general existence taken substantively which is comprehended by the reason and the intelligence that is to say that man comprehends it Instead of that this general existence is one of the accidents which penetrate the reality of beings and the qualities of beings are the essence This accidental existence which is dependent on beings is like other properties of things which depend on them It is an accident among accidents and certainly that which is the essence is superior to that which is the accident For the essence is the origin and the accident is the consequence the essence is dependent on itself and the accident is dependent on something else that is to say it needs an essence upon which to depend In this case God would be the consequence of the creature He would have need of it and it would be independent of Him For example each time that the isolated elements combine conformably to the divine universal system one being among beings comes into the world That is to say that when certain elements combine a vegetable existence is produced when others combine it is an animal again others combine and they produce different creatures In this case the existence of things is the consequence of their reality how could it be that this existence which is an accident among accidents and necessitates another essence upon which it depends should be the Preexistent Essence the Author of all things But the initiated savants of the Theosophists and Sufis who have studied this question think there are two categories of existence One is general existence which is understood by the human intelligence this is a phenomenon an accident among accidents and the reality of the things is the essence But pantheism does not apply to this general and imaginary existence but only to the Veritable Existence freed and sanctified from all other interpretation through It all things exist and It is the Unity through which all things have come into the world such as matter energy and this general existence which is comprehended by the human mind Such is the truth of this question according to the Theosophists and the Sufis Briefly with regard to this theory that all things exist by the Unity all are agreed that is to say the philosophers and the Prophets But there is a difference between them The Prophets say The Knowledge of God has no need of the existence of beings but the knowledge of the creature needs the existence of things known if the Knowledge of God had need of any other thing then it would be the knowledge of the creature and not that of God For the Preexistent is different from the phenomenal and the phenomenal is opposed to the Preexistent that which we attribute to the creature that is the necessities of the contingent beings we deny for God for purification or sanctification from imperfections is one of His necessary properties So in the phenomenal we see ignorance in the Preexistent we recognize knowledge In the phenomenal we see weakness in the Preexistent we recognize power In the phenomenal we see poverty in the Preexistent we recognize wealth So the phenomenal is the source of imperfections and the Preexistent is the sum of perfections The phenomenal knowledge has need of things known the Preexistent Knowledge is independent of their existence So the preexistence of the specification and of the individualization of beings which are the things known of God the Most High does not exist and these divine and perfect attributes are not so understood by the intelligence that we can decide if the Divine Knowledge has need of things known or not Briefly this is the principal argument of the Sufis and if we wished to mention all their proofs and explain their answers it would take a very long time This is their decisive proof and their plain argument at least of the savants of the Sufis and the Theosophists But the question of the Real Existence by which all things exist that is to say the reality of the Essence of Unity through which all creatures have come into the world is admitted by everyone The difference resides in that which the Sufis say The reality of the things is the manifestation of the Real Unity But the Prophets say it emanates from the Real Unity and great is the difference between manifestation and emanation The appearance in manifestation means that a single thing appears in infinite forms For example the seed which is a single thing possessing the vegetative perfections which it manifests in infinite forms resolving itself into branches leaves flowers and fruits this is called appearance in manifestation whereas in the appearance through emanation this Real Unity remains and continues in the exaltation of Its sanctity but the existence of creatures emanates from It and is not manifested by It It can be compared to the sun from which emanates the light which pours forth on all the creatures but the sun remains in the exaltation of its sanctity It does not descend and it does not resolve itself into luminous forms it does not appear in the substance of things through the specification and the individualization of things the Preexistent does not become the phenomenal independent wealth does not become enchained poverty pure perfection does not become absolute imperfection To recapitulate the Sufis admit God and the creature and say that God resolves Himself into the infinite forms of the creatures and manifests like the sea which appears in the infinite forms of the waves These phenomenal and imperfect waves are the same thing as the Preexistent Sea which is the sum of all the divine perfections The Prophets on the contrary believe that there is the world of God the world of the Kingdom and the world of Creation three things The first emanation from God is the bounty of the Kingdom which emanates and is reflected in the reality of the creatures like the light which emanates from the sun and is resplendent in creatures and this bounty which is the light is reflected in infinite forms in the reality of all things and specifies and individualizes itself according to the capacity the worthiness and the intrinsic value of things But the affirmation of the Sufis requires that the Independent Wealth should descend to the degree of poverty that the Preexistent should confine itself to phenomenal forms and that Pure Power should be restricted to the state of weakness according to the limitations of contingent beings And this is an evident error Observe that the reality of man who is the most noble of creatures does not descend to the reality of the animal that the essence of the animal which is endowed with the powers of sensation does not abase itself to the degree of the vegetable and that the reality of the vegetable which is the power of growth does not descend to the reality of the mineral Briefly the superior reality does not descend nor abase itself to inferior states then how could it be that the Universal Reality of God which is freed from all descriptions and qualifications notwithstanding Its absolute sanctity and purity should resolve Itself into the forms of the realities of the creatures which are the source of imperfections This is a pure imagination which one cannot conceive On the contrary this Holy Essence is the sum of the divine perfections and all creatures are favored by the bounty of resplendency through emanation and receive the lights the perfection and the beauty of Its Kingdom in the same way that all earthly creatures obtain the bounty of the light of the rays of the sun but the sun does not descend and does not abase itself to the favored realities of earthly beings After dinner and considering the lateness of the hour there is no time to explain further Salutations eighty three THE FOUR METHODS OF ACQUIRING KNOWLEDGE There are only four accepted methods of comprehension that is to say the realities of things are understood by these four methods The first method is by the senses that is to say all that the eye the ear the taste the smell the touch perceive is understood by this method Today this method is considered the most perfect by all the European philosophers they say that the principal method of gaining knowledge is through the senses they consider it supreme although it is imperfect for it commits errors For example the greatest of the senses is the power of sight The sight sees the mirage as water and it sees images reflected in mirrors as real and existent large bodies which are distant appear to be small and a whirling point appears as a circle The sight believes the earth to be motionless and sees the sun in motion and in many similar cases it makes mistakes Therefore we cannot trust it The second is the method of reason which was that of the ancient philosophers the pillars of wisdom this is the method of the understanding They proved things by reason and held firmly to logical proofs all their arguments are arguments of reason Notwithstanding this they differed greatly and their opinions were contradictory They even changed their views that is to say during twenty years they would prove the existence of a thing by logical arguments and afterward they would deny it by logical arguments so much so that Plato at first logically proved the immobility of the earth and the movement of the sun later by logical arguments he proved that the sun was the stationary center and that the earth was moving Afterward the Ptolemaic theory was spread abroad and the idea of Plato was entirely forgotten until at last a new observer again called it to life Thus all the mathematicians disagreed although they relied upon arguments of reason In the same way by logical arguments they would prove a problem at a certain time then afterward by arguments of the same nature they would deny it So one of the philosophers would firmly uphold a theory for a time with strong arguments and proofs to support it which afterward he would retract and contradict by arguments of reason Therefore it is evident that the method of reason is not perfect for the differences of the ancient philosophers the want of stability and the variations of their opinions prove this For if it were perfect all ought to be united in their ideas and agreed in their opinions The third method of understanding is by tradition that is through the text of the Holy Scriptures for people say In the Old and New Testaments God spoke thus This method equally is not perfect because the traditions are understood by the reason As the reason itself is liable to err how can it be said that in interpreting the meaning of the traditions it will not err for it is possible for it to make mistakes and certainty cannot be attained This is the method of the religious leaders whatever they understand and comprehend from the text of the books is that which their reason understands from the text and not necessarily the real truth for the reason is like a balance and the meanings contained in the text of the Holy Books are like the thing which is weighed If the balance is untrue how can the weight be ascertained Know then that which is in the hands of people that which they believe is liable to error For in proving or disproving a thing if a proof is brought forward which is taken from the evidence of our senses this method as has become evident is not perfect if the proofs are intellectual the same is true or if they are traditional such proofs also are not perfect Therefore there is no standard in the hands of people upon which we can rely But the bounty of the Holy Spirit gives the true method of comprehension which is infallible and indubitable This is through the help of the Holy Spirit which comes to man and this is the condition in which certainty can alone be attained eighty four THE NECESSITY OF FOLLOWING THE TEACHINGS OF THE DIVINE MANIFESTATIONS Question Those who are blessed with good actions and universal benevolence who have praiseworthy characteristics who act with love and kindness toward all creatures who care for the poor and who strive to establish universal peace what need have they of the divine teachings of which they think indeed that they are independent What is the condition of these people Answer Know that such actions such efforts and such words are praiseworthy and approved and are the glory of humanity But these actions alone are not sufficient they are a body of the greatest loveliness but without spirit No that which is the cause of everlasting life eternal honor universal enlightenment real salvation and prosperity is first of all the knowledge of God It is known that the knowledge of God is beyond all knowledge and it is the greatest glory of the human world For in the existing knowledge of the reality of things there is material advantage and through it outward civilization progresses but the knowledge of God is the cause of spiritual progress and attraction and through it the perception of truth the exaltation of humanity divine civilization rightness of morals and illumination are obtained Second comes the love of God the light of which shines in the lamp of the hearts of those who know God its brilliant rays illuminate the horizon and give to man the life of the Kingdom In truth the fruit of human existence is the love of God for this love is the spirit of life and the eternal bounty If the love of God did not exist the contingent world would be in darkness if the love of God did not exist the hearts of men would be dead and deprived of the sensations of existence if the love of God did not exist spiritual union would be lost if the love of God did not exist the light of unity would not illuminate humanity if the love of God did not exist the East and West like two lovers would not embrace each other if the love of God did not exist division and disunion would not be changed into fraternity if the love of God did not exist indifference would not end in affection if the love of God did not exist the stranger would not become the friend The love of the human world has shone forth from the love of God and has appeared by the bounty and grace of God It is clear that the reality of mankind is diverse that opinions are various and sentiments different and this difference of opinions of thoughts of intelligence of sentiments among the human species arises from essential necessity for the differences in the degrees of existence of creatures is one of the necessities of existence which unfolds itself in infinite forms Therefore we have need of a general power which may dominate the sentiments the opinions and the thoughts of all thanks to which these divisions may no longer have effect and all individuals may be brought under the influence of the unity of the world of humanity It is clear and evident that this greatest power in the human world is the love of God It brings the different peoples under the shadow of the tent of affection it gives to the antagonistic and hostile nations and families the greatest love and union See after the time of Christ through the power of the love of God how many nations races families and tribes came under the shadow of the Word of God The divisions and differences of a thousand years were entirely destroyed and annihilated The thoughts of race and of fatherland completely disappeared The union of souls and of existences took place all became true spiritual Christians The third virtue of humanity is the goodwill which is the basis of good actions Certain philosophers have considered intention superior to action for the goodwill is absolute light it is purified and sanctified from the impurities of selfishness of enmity of deception Now it may be that a man performs an action which in appearance is righteous but which is dictated by covetousness For example a butcher rears a sheep and protects it but this righteous action of the butcher is dictated by desire to derive profit and the result of this care is the slaughter of the poor sheep How many righteous actions are dictated by covetousness But the goodwill is sanctified from such impurities Briefly if to the knowledge of God is joined the love of God and attraction ecstasy and goodwill a righteous action is then perfect and complete Otherwise though a good action is praiseworthy yet if it is not sustained by the knowledge of God the love of God and a sincere intention it is imperfect For example the being of man must unite all perfections to be perfect Sight is extremely precious and appreciated but it must be aided by hearing the hearing is much appreciated but it must be aided by the power of speech the faculty of speech is very acceptable but it must be aided by the power of reason and so forth The same is true of the other powers organs and members of man when all these powers these senses these organs these members exist together he is perfect Now today we meet with people in the world who in truth desire the universal good and who according to their power occupy themselves in protecting the oppressed and in aiding the poor they are enthusiastic for peace and the universal well being Although from this point of view they may be perfect if they are deprived of the knowledge and love of God they are imperfect Galen the physician in his book in which he comments on the treatise of Plato on the art of government one hundred seventy six says that the fundamental principles of religion have a great influence upon a perfect civilization because the multitude cannot understand the connection of explanatory words so it has need of symbolical words announcing the rewards and punishments of the other world and that which proves the truth of this affirmation he says is that today we see a people called Christians who believe in rewards and punishments and this sect show forth beautiful actions like those which a true philosopher performs So we all see clearly that they do not fear death that they expect and desire nothing from the multitude but justice and equity and they are considered as true philosophers Now observe what was the degree of the sincerity the zeal the spiritual feeling the obligation of friendship and the good actions of a believer in Christ so that Galen the philosophical physician although he was not of the Christian religion should yet bear witness to the good morals and the perfections of these people to the point of saying that they were true philosophers These virtues these morals were obtained not only through good actions for if virtue were only a matter of obtaining and giving forth good as this lamp is lighted and illuminates the house without doubt this illumination is a benefit then why do we not praise the lamp The sun causes all the beings of the earth to increase and by its heat and light gives growth and development is there a greater benefit than that Nevertheless as this good does not come from goodwill and from the love and knowledge of God it is imperfect When on the contrary a man gives to another a cup of water the latter is grateful and thanks him A man without reflecting will say This sun which gives light to the world this supreme bounty which is apparent in it must be adored and praised Why should we not be grateful and thankful to the sun for its bounty when we praise a man who performs a simple act of kindness But if we look for the truth we see that this insignificant kindness of the man is due to conscious feelings which exist therefore it is worthy of praise whereas the light and heat of the sun are not due to the feelings and consciousness therefore they are not worthy of eulogy or of praise and do not deserve gratitude or thanks In the same way when a person performs a good action although it is praiseworthy if it is not caused by the love and knowledge of God it is imperfect Moreover if you reflect justly you will see that these good actions of other men who do not know God are also fundamentally caused by the teachings of God that is to say that the former Prophets led men to perform these actions explained their beauty to them and declared their splendid effects then these teachings were diffused among men and reached them successively one after the other and turned their hearts toward these perfections When men saw that these actions were considered beautiful and became the cause of joy and happiness for mankind they conformed to them Wherefore these actions also come from the teachings of God But justice is needed to see this and not controversy and discussion Praise be to God you have been to Persia and you have seen how the Persians through the holy breezes of Baha u llah have become benevolent toward humanity Formerly if they met anyone of another race they tormented him and were filled with the utmost enmity hatred and malevolence they went so far as to throw dirt at him They burned the Gospel and the Old Testament and if their hands were polluted by touching these books they washed them Today the greater number of them recite and chant as is suitable the contents of these two Books in their reunions and assemblies and they expound their esoteric teaching They show hospitality to their enemies They treat the bloodthirsty wolves with gentleness like gazelles in the
