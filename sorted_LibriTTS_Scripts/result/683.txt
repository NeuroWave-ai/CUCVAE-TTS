by Tokuya Matsumoto toqyam os rim or jp IZAAK WALTON THE COMPLEAT ANGLER To the Right worshipful John Offley of Madeley Manor in the County of Stafford Esquire My most honoured Friend Sir I have made so ill use of your former favours as by them to be encouraged to entreat that they may be enlarged to the patronage and protection of this Book and I have put on a modest confidence that I shall not be denied because it is a discourse of Fish and Fishing which you know so well and both love and practice so much You are assured though there be ignorant men of another belief that Angling is an Art and you know that Art better than others and that this is truth is demonstrated by the fruits of that pleasant labour which you enjoy when you purpose to give rest to your mind and divest yourself of your more serious business and which is often dedicate a day or two to this recreation At which time if common Anglers should attend you and be eyewitnesses of the success not of your fortune but your skill it would doubtless beget in them an emulation to be like you and that emulation might beget an industrious diligence to be so but I know it is not attain bye by common capacities and there be now many men of great wisdom learning and experience which love and practice this Art that know I speak the truth Sir this pleasant curiosity of Fish and Fishing of which you are so great a master has been thought worthy the pens and practices of divers in other nations that have been reputed men of great learning and wisdom And amongst those of this nation I remember Sir Henry Wotton a dear lover of this Art has told me that his intentions were to write a Discourse of the Art and in praise of Angling and doubtless he had done so if death had not prevented him the remembrance of which had often made me sorry for if he had lived to do it then the unlearned Angler had seen some better treatise of this Art a treatise that might have proved worthy his perusal which though some have undertaken I could never yet see in English But mine may be thought as weak and as unworthy of common view and I do here freely confess that I should rather excuse myself than censure others my own discourse being liable to so many exceptions against which you Sir might make this one that it can contribute nothing to YOUR knowledge And lest a longer epistle may diminish your pleasure I shall make this no longer than to add this following truth that I am really Sir your most affectionate Friend and most humble Servant Iz Wa The epistle to the reader To all Readers of this discourse but especially to the honest Angler I think fit to tell thee these following truths that I did neither undertake nor write nor publish and much less own this Discourse to please myself and having been too easily drawn to do all to please others as I propose not the gaining of credit by this undertaking so I would not willingly lose any part of that to which I had a just title before I began it and do therefore desire and hope if I deserve not commendations yet I may obtain pardon And though this Discourse may be liable to some exceptions yet I cannot doubt but that most Readers may receive so much pleasure or profit by it as may make it worthy the time of their perusal if they be not too grave or too busy men And this is all the confidence that I can put on concerning the merit of what is here offered to their consideration and censure and if the last prove too severe as I have a liberty so I am resolved to use it and neglect all sour censures And I wish the Reader also to take notice that in writing of it I have made myself a recreation of a recreation and that it might prove so to him and not read dull and tediously I have in several places mixed not any scurrility but some innocent harmless mirth of which if thou be a severe sour complexioned man then I here disallow thee to be a competent judge for divines say there are offences given and offences not given but taken And I am the willinger to justify the pleasant part of it because though it is known I can be serious at seasonable times yet the whole Discourse is or rather was a picture of my own disposition especially in such days and times as I have laid aside business and gone a fishing with honest Nat and R Roe but they are gone and with them most of my pleasant hours even as a shadow that passeth away and returns not And next let me add this that he that likes not the book should like the excellent picture of the Trout and some of the other fish which I may take a liberty to commend because they concern not myself Next let me tell the Reader that in that which is the more useful part of this Discourse that is to say the observations of the nature and breeding and seasons and catching of fish I am not so simple as not to know that a captious reader may find exceptions against something said of some of these and therefore I must entreat him to con eider that experience teaches us to know that several countries alter the time and I think almost the manner of fishes breeding but doubtless of their being in season as may appear by three rivers in Monmouthshire namely Severn Wye and Usk where Camden observes that in the river Wye Salmon are in season from September to April and we are certain that in Thames and Trent and in most other rivers they be in season the six hotter months Now for the Art of catching fish that is to say How to make a man that was none to be an Angler by a book he that undertakes it shall undertake a harder task than mister Hales a most valiant and excellent fencer who in a printed book called A Private School of Defence undertook to teach that art or science and was laughed at for his labour Not but that many useful things might be learned by that book but he was laughed at because that art was not to be taught by words but practice and so must Angling And note also that in this Discourse I do not undertake to say all that is known or may be said of it but I undertake to acquaint the Reader with many things that are not usually known to every Angler and I shall leave gleanings and observations enough to be made out of the experience of all that love and practice this recreation to which I shall encourage them For Angling may be said to be so like the Mathematicks that it can never be fully learnt at least not so fully but that there will still be more new experiments left for the trial of other men that succeed us But I think all that love this game may here learn something that may be worth their money if they be not poor and needy men and in case they be I then wish them to forbear to buy it for I write not to get money but for pleasure and this Discourse boasts of no more for I hate to promise much and deceive the Reader And however it proves to him yet I am sure I have found a high content in the search and conference of what is here offered to the Reader s view and censure I wish him as much in the perusal of it and so I might here take my leave but will stay a little and tell him that whereas it is said by many that in fly fishing for a Trout the Angler must observe his twelve several flies for the twelve months of the year I say he that follows that rule shall be as sure to catch fish and be as wise as he that makes hay by the fair days in an Almanack and no surer for those very flies that used to appear about and on the water in one month of the year may the following year come almost a month sooner or later as the same year proves colder or hotter and yet in the following Discourse I have set down the twelve flies that are in reputation with many anglers and they may serve to give him some observations concerning them And he may note that there are in Wales and other countries peculiar flies proper to the particular place or country and doubtless unless a man makes a fly to counterfeit that very fly in that place he is like to lose his labour or much of it but for the generality three or four flies neat and rightly made and not too big serve for a Trout in most rivers all the summer and for winter fly fishing it is as useful as an Almanack out of date And of these because as no man is born an artist so no man is born an Angler I thought fit to give thee this notice When I have told the reader that in this fifth impression there are many enlargements gathered both by my own observation and the communication with friends I shall stay him no longer than to wish him a rainy evening to read this following Discourse and that if he be an honest Angler the east wind may never blow when he goes a fishing I W The first day A Conference betwixt an Angler a Falconer and a Hunter each commending his Recreation Chapter I Piscator Venator Auceps Piscator You are well overtaken Gentlemen A good morning to you both I have stretched my legs up Tottenham Hill to overtake you hoping your business may occasion you towards Ware whither I am going this fine fresh May morning Venator Sir I for my part shall almost answer your hopes for my purpose is to drink my morning s draught at the Thatched House in Hoddesden and I think not to rest till I come thither where I have appointed a friend or two to meet me but for this gentleman that you see with me I know not how far he intends his journey he came so lately into my company that I have scarce had time to ask him the question Auceps Sir I shall by your favour bear you company as far as Theobalds and there leave you for then I turn up to a friend s house who mews a Hawk for me which I now long to see Venator Sir we are all so happy as to have a fine fresh cool morning and I hope we shall each be the happier in the others company And Gentlemen that I may not lose yours I shall either abate or amend my pace to enjoy it knowing that as the Italians say Good company in a journey makes the way to seem the shorter Auceps It may do so Sir with the help of good discourse which methinks we may promise from you that both look and speak so cheerfully and for my part I promise you as an invitation to it that I will be as free and open hearted as discretion will allow me to be with strangers Venator And Sir I promise the like Piscator I am right glad to hear your answers and in confidence you speak the truth I shall put on a boldness to ask you Sir whether business or pleasure caused you to be so early up and walk so fast for this other gentleman hath declared he is going to see a hawk that a friend mews for him Venator Sir mine is a mixture of both a little business and more pleasure for I intend this day to do all my business and then bestow another day or two in hunting the Otter which a friend that I go to meet tells me is much pleasanter than any other chase whatsoever howsoever I mean to try it for to morrow morning we shall meet a pack of Otter dogs of noble mister Sadler s upon Amwell Hill who will be there so early that they intend to prevent the sunrising Piscator Sir my fortune has answered my desires and my purpose is to bestow a day or two in helping to destroy some of those villanous vermin for I hate them perfectly because they love fish so well or rather because they destroy so much indeed so much that in my judgment all men that keep Otter dogs ought to have pensions from the King to encourage them to destroy the very breed of those base Otters they do so much mischief Venator But what say you to the Foxes of the Nation would not you as willingly have them destroyed for doubtless they do as much mischief as Otters do Piscator Oh Sir if they do it is not so much to me and my fraternity as those base vermin the Otters do Auceps Why Sir I pray of what fraternity are you that you are so angry with the poor Otters Piscator I am Sir a Brother of the Angle and therefore an enemy to the Otter for you are to note that we Anglers all love one another and therefore do I hate the Otter both for my own and their sakes who are of my brotherhood Venator And I am a lover of Hounds I have followed many a pack of dogs many a mile and heard many merry Huntsmen make sport and scoff at Anglers Auceps And I profess myself a Falconer and have heard many grave serious men pity them it is such a heavy contemptible dull recreation Piscator You know Gentlemen it is an easy thing to scoff at any art or recreation a little wit mixed with ill nature confidence and malice will do it but though they often venture boldly yet they are often caught even in their own trap according to that of Lucian the father of the family of Scoffers Lucian well skilled in scoffing this hath writ Friend that s your folly which you think your wit This you vent oft void both of wit and fear Meaning another when yourself you jeer If to this you add what Solomon says of Scoffers that they are an abomination to mankind let him that thinks fit scoff on and be a Scoffer still but I account them enemies to me and all that love Virtue and Angling And for you that have heard many grave serious men pity Anglers let me tell you Sir there be many men that are by others taken to be serious and grave men whom we contemn and pity Men that are taken to be grave because nature hath made them of a sour complexion money getting men men that spend all their time first in getting and next in anxious care to keep it men that are condemned to be rich and then always busy or discontented for these poor rich men we Anglers pity them perfectly and stand in no need to borrow their thoughts to think ourselves so happy No no Sir we enjoy a contentedness above the reach of such dispositions and as the learned and ingenuous Montaigne says like himself freely When my Cat and I entertain each other with mutual apish tricks as playing with a garter who knows but that I make my Cat more sport than she makes me Shall I conclude her to be simple that has her time to begin or refuse to play as freely as I myself have Nay who knows but that it is a defect of my not understanding her language for doubtless Cats talk and reason with one another that we agree no better and who knows but that she pities me for being no wiser than to play with her and laughs and censures my folly for making sport for her when we two play together Thus freely speaks Montaigne concerning Cats and I hope I may take as great a liberty to blame any man and laugh at him too let him be never so grave that hath not heard what Anglers can say in the justification of their Art and Recreation which I may again tell you is so full of pleasure that we need not borrow their thoughts to think ourselves happy Venator Sir you have almost amazed me for though I am no Scoffer yet I have I pray let me speak it without offence always looked upon Anglers as more patient and more simple men than I fear I shall find you to be Piscator Sir I hope you will not judge my earnestness to be impatience and for my simplicity if by that you mean a harmlessness or that simplicity which was usually found in the primitive Christians who were as most Anglers are quiet men and followers of peace men that were so simply wise as not to sell their consciences to buy riches and with them vexation and a fear to die if you mean such simple men as lived in those times when there were fewer lawyers when men might have had a lordship safely conveyed to them in a piece of parchment no bigger than your hand though several sheets will not do it safely in this wiser age I say Sir if you take us Anglers to be such simple men as I have spoke of then myself and those of my profession will be glad to be so understood But if by simplicity you meant to express a general defect in those that profess and practice the excellent Art of Angling I hope in time to disabuse you and make the contrary appear so evidently that if you will but have patience to hear me I shall remove all the anticipations that discourse or time or prejudice have possessed you with against that laudable and ancient Art for I know it is worthy the knowledge and practice of a wise man But Gentlemen though I be able to do this I am not so unmannerly as to engross all the discourse to myself and therefore you two having declared yourselves the one to be a lover of Hawks the other of Hounds I shall be most glad to hear what you can say in the commendation of that recreation which each of you love and practice and having heard what you can say I shall be glad to exercise your attention with what I can say concerning my own recreation and Art of Angling and by this means we shall make the way to seem the shorter and if you like my motion I would have mister Falconer to begin Auceps Your motion is consented to with all my heart and to testify it I will begin as you have desired me And first for the Element that I use to trade in which is the Air an element of more worth than weight an element that doubtless exceeds both the Earth and Water for though I sometimes deal in both yet the air is most properly mine I and my Hawks use that most and it yields us most recreation It stops not the high soaring of my noble generous Falcon in it she ascends to such a height as the dull eyes of beasts and fish are not able to reach to their bodies are too gross for such high elevations in the Air my troops of Hawks soar up on high and when they are lost in the sight of men then they attend upon and converse with the Gods therefore I think my Eagle is so justly styled Jove s servant in ordinary and that very Falcon that I am now going to see deserves no meaner a title for she usually in her flight endangers herself like the son of Daedalus to have her wings scorched by the sun s heat she flies so near it but her mettle makes her careless of danger for she then heeds nothing but makes her nimble pinions cut the fluid air and so makes her highway over the steepest mountains and deepest rivers and in her glorious career looks with contempt upon those high steeples and magnificent palaces which we adore and wonder at from which height I can make her to descend by a word from my mouth which she both knows and obeys to accept of meat from my hand to own me for her Master to go home with me and be willing the next day to afford me the like recreation And more this element of air which I profess to trade in the worth of it is such and it is of such necessity that no creature whatsoever not only those numerous creatures that feed on the face of the earth but those various creatures that have their dwelling within the waters every creature that hath life in its nostrils stands in need of my element The waters cannot preserve the Fish without air witness the not breaking of ice in an extreme frost the reason is for that if the inspiring and expiring organ of any animal be stopped it suddenly yields to nature and dies Thus necessary is air to the existence both of Fish and Beasts nay even to Man himself that air or breath of life with which God at first inspired mankind he if he wants it dies presently becomes a sad object to all that loved and beheld him and in an instant turns to putrefaction Nay more the very birds of the air those that be not Hawks are both so many and so useful and pleasant to mankind that I must not let them pass without some observations They both feed and refresh him feed him with their choice bodies and refresh him with their heavenly voices I will not undertake to mention the several kinds of Fowl by which this is done and his curious palate pleased by day and which with their very excrements afford him a soft lodging at night These I will pass by but not those little nimble musicians of the air that warble forth their curious ditties with which nature hath furnished them to the shame of art As first the Lark when she means to rejoice to cheer herself and those that hear her she then quits the earth and sings as she ascends higher into the air and having ended her heavenly employment grows then mute and sad to think she must descend to the dull earth which she would not touch but for necessity How do the Blackbird and Thrassel with their melodious voices bid welcome to the cheerful Spring and in their fixed months warble forth such ditties as no art or instrument can reach to Nay the smaller birds also do the like in their particular seasons as namely the Laverock the Tit lark the little Linnet and the honest Robin that loves mankind both alive and dead But the Nightingale another of my airy creatures breathes such sweet loud musick out of her little instrumental throat that it might make mankind to think miracles are not ceased He that at midnight when the very labourer sleeps securely should hear as I have very often the clear airs the sweet descants the natural rising and falling the doubling and redoubling of her voice might well be lifted above earth and say Lord what musick hast thou provided for the Saints in Heaven when thou affordest bad men such musick on Earth And this makes me the less to wonder at the many Aviaries in Italy or at the great charge of Varro s Aviary the ruins of which are yet to be seen in Rome and is still so famous there that it is reckoned for one of those notables which men of foreign nations either record or lay up in their memories when they return from travel This for the birds of pleasure of which very much more might be said My next shall be of birds of political use I think it is not to be doubted that Swallows have been taught to carry letters between two armies but tis certain that when the Turks besieged Malta or Rhodes I now remember not which it was Pigeons are then related to carry and recarry letters and mister G Sandys in his Travels relates it to be done betwixt Aleppo and Babylon But if that be disbelieved it is not to be doubted that the Dove was sent out of the ark by Noah to give him notice of land when to him all appeared to be sea and the Dove proved a faithful and comfortable messenger And for the sacrifices of the law a pair of Turtle doves or young Pigeons were as well accepted as costly Bulls and Rams and when God would feed the Prophet Elijah after a kind of miraculous manner he did it by Ravens who brought him meat morning and evening Lastly the Holy Ghost when he descended visibly upon our Saviour did it by assuming the shape of a Dove And to conclude this part of my discourse pray remember these wonders were done by birds of air the element in which they and I take so much pleasure There is also a little contemptible winged creature an inhabitant of my aerial element namely the laborious Bee of whose prudence policy and regular government of their own commonwealth I might say much as also of their several kinds and how useful their honey and wax are both for meat and medicines to mankind but I will leave them to their sweet labour without the least disturbance believing them to be all very busy at this very time amongst the herbs and flowers that we see nature puts forth this May morning And now to return to my Hawks from whom I have made too long a digression You are to note that they are usually distinguished into two kinds namely the long winged and the short winged Hawk of the first kind there be chiefly in use amongst us in this nation The Gerfalcon and Jerkin The Falcon and Tassel gentle The Laner and Laneret The Bockerel and Bockeret The Saker and Sacaret The Merlin and Jack Merlin The Hobby and Jack There is the Stelletto of Spain The Blood red Rook from Turkey The Waskite from Virginia And there is of short winged Hawks The Eagle and Iron The Goshawk and Tarcel The Sparhawk and Musket The French Pye of two sorts These are reckoned Hawks of note and worth but we have also of an inferior rank The Stanyel the Ringtail The Raven the Buzzard The Forked Kite the Bald Buzzard The Hen driver and others that I forbear to name Gentlemen if I should enlarge my discourse to the observation of the Eires the Brancher the Ramish Hawk the Haggard and the two sorts of Lentners and then treat of their several Ayries their Mewings rare order of casting and the renovation of their feathers their reclaiming dieting and then come to their rare stories of practice I say if I should enter into these and many other observations that I could make it would be much very much pleasure to me but lest I should break the rules of civility with you by taking up more than the proportion of time allotted to me I will here break off and entreat you mister Venator to say what you are able in the commendation of Hunting to which you are so much affected and if time will serve I will beg your favour for a further enlargement of some of those several heads of which I have spoken But no more at present Venator Well Sir and I will now take my turn and will first begin with a commendation of the Earth as you have done most excellently of the Air the Earth being that element upon which I drive my pleasant wholesome hungry trade The Earth is a solid settled element an element most universally beneficial both to man and beast to men who have their several recreations upon it as horse races hunting sweet smells pleasant walks the earth feeds man and all those several beasts that both feed him and afford him recreation What pleasure doth man take in hunting the stately Stag the generous Buck the wild Boar the cunning Otter the crafty Fox and the fearful Hare And if I may descend to a lower game what pleasure is it sometimes with gins to betray the very vermin of the earth as namely the Fichat the Fulimart the Ferret the Pole cat the Mouldwarp and the like creatures that live upon the face and within the bowels of the Earth How doth the Earth bring forth herbs flowers and fruits both for physick and the pleasure of mankind and above all to me at least the fruitful vine of which when I drink moderately it clears my brain cheers my heart and sharpens my wit How could Cleopatra have feasted Mark Antony with eight wild Boars roasted whole at one supper and other meat suitable if the earth had not been a bountiful mother But to pass by the mighty Elephant which the Earth breeds and nourisheth and descend to the least of creatures how doth the earth afford us a doctrinal example in the little Pismire who in the summer provides and lays up her winter provision and teaches man to do the like The earth feeds and carries those horses that carry us If I would be prodigal of my time and your patience what might not I say in commendations of the earth That puts limits to the proud and raging sea and by that means preserves both man and beast that it destroys them not as we see it daily doth those that venture upon the sea and are there shipwrecked drowned and left to feed Haddocks when we that are so wise as to keep ourselves on earth walk and talk and live and eat and drink and go a hunting of which recreation I will say a little and then leave mister Piscator to the commendation of Angling Hunting is a game for princes and noble persons it hath been highly prized in all ages it was one of the qualifications that Xenophon bestowed on his Cyrus that he was a hunter of wild beasts Hunting trains up the younger nobility to the use of manly exercises in their riper age What more manly exercise than hunting the Wild Boar the Stag the Buck the Fox or the Hare How doth it preserve health and increase strength and activity And for the dogs that we use who can commend their excellency to that height which they deserve How perfect is the hound at smelling who never leaves or forsakes his first scent but follows it through so many changes and varieties of other scents even over and in the water and into the earth What music doth a pack of dogs then make to any man whose heart and ears are so happy as to be set to the tune of such instruments How will a right Greyhound fix his eye on the best Buck in a herd single him out and follow him and him only through a whole herd of rascal game and still know and then kill him For my hounds I know the language of them and they know the language and meaning of one another as perfectly as we know the voices of those with whom we discourse daily I might enlarge myself in the commendation of Hunting and of the noble Hound especially as also of the docibleness of dogs in general and I might make many observations of land creatures that for composition order figure and constitution approach nearest to the completeness and understanding of man especially of those creatures which Moses in the Law permitted to the Jews which have cloven hoofs and chew the cud which I shall forbear to name because I will not be so uncivil to mister Piscator as not to allow him a time for the commendation of Angling which he calls an art but doubtless it is an easy one and mister Auceps I doubt we shall hear a watery discourse of it but I hope it will not be a long one Auceps And I hope so too though I fear it will Piscator Gentlemen let not prejudice prepossess you I confess my discourse is like to prove suitable to my recreation calm and quiet we seldom take the name of God into our mouths but it is either to praise him or pray to him if others use it vainly in the midst of their recreations so vainly as if they meant to conjure I must tell you it is neither our fault nor our custom we protest against it But pray remember I accuse nobody for as I would not make a watery discourse so I would not put too much vinegar into it nor would I raise the reputation of my own art by the diminution or ruin of another s And so much for the prologue to what I mean to say And now for the Water the element that I trade in The water is the eldest daughter of the creation the element upon which the Spirit of God did first move the element which God commanded to bring forth living creatures abundantly and without which those that inhabit the land even all creatures that have breath in their nostrils must suddenly return to putrefaction Moses the great lawgiver and chief philosopher skilled in all the learning of the Egyptians who was called the friend of God and knew the mind of the Almighty names this element the first in the creation this is the element upon which the Spirit of God did first move and is the chief ingredient in the creation many philosophers have made it to comprehend all the other elements and most allow it the chiefest in the mixtion of all living creatures There be that profess to believe that all bodies are made of water and may be reduced back again to water only they endeavour to demonstrate it thus Take a willow or any like speedy growing plant newly rooted in a box or barrel full of earth weigh them all together exactly when the tree begins to grow and then weigh all together after the tree is increased from its first rooting to weigh a hundred pound weight more than when it was first rooted and weighed and you shall find this augment of the tree to be without the diminution of one drachm weight of the earth Hence they infer this increase of wood to be from water of rain or from dew and not to be from any other element and they affirm they can reduce this wood back again to water and they affirm also the same may be done in any animal or vegetable And this I take to be a fair testimony of the excellency of my element of water The water is more productive than the earth Nay the earth hath no fruitfulness without showers or dews for all the herbs and flowers and fruit are produced and thrive by the water and the very minerals are fed by streams that run under ground whose natural course carries them to the tops of many high mountains as we see by several springs breaking forth on the tops of the highest hills and this is also witnessed by the daily trial and testimony of several miners Nay the increase of those creatures that are bred and fed in the water are not only more and more miraculous but more advantageous to man not only for the lengthening of his life but for the preventing of sickness for it is observed by the most learned physicians that the casting off of Lent and other fish days which hath not only given the lie to so many learned pious wise founders of colleges for which we should be ashamed hath doubtless been the chief cause of those many putrid shaking intermitting agues unto which this nation of ours is now more subject than those wiser countries that feed on herbs salads and plenty of fish of which it is observed in story that the greatest part of the world now do And it may be fit to remember that Moses appointed fish to be the chief diet for the best commonwealth that ever yet was And it is observable not only that there are fish as namely the Whale three times as big as the mighty Elephant that is so fierce in battle but that the mightiest feasts have been of fish The Romans in the height of their glory have made fish the mistress of all their entertainments they have had musick to usher in their Sturgeons Lampreys and Mullets which they would purchase at rates rather to be wondered at than believed He that shall view the writings of Macrobius or Varro may be confirmed and informed of this and of the incredible value of their fish and fish ponds But Gentlemen I have almost lost myself which I confess I may easily do in this philosophical discourse I met with most of it very lately and I hope happily in a conference with a most learned physician doctor Wharton a dear friend that loves both me and my art of Angling But however I will wade no deeper into these mysterious arguments but pass to such observations as I can manage with more pleasure and less fear of running into error But I must not yet forsake the waters by whose help we have so many known advantages And first to pass by the miraculous cures of our known baths how advantageous is the sea for our daily traffick without which we could not now subsist How does it not only furnish us with food and physick for the bodies but with such observations for the mind as ingenious persons would not want How ignorant had we been of the beauty of Florence of the monuments urns and rarities that yet remain in and near unto old and new Rome so many as it is said will take up a year s time to view and afford to each of them but a convenient consideration And therefore it is not to be wondered at that so learned and devout a father as saint Jerome after his wish to have seen Christ in the flesh and to have heard saint Paul preach makes his third wish to have seen Rome in her glory and that glory is not yet all lost for what pleasure is it to see the monuments of Livy the choicest of the historians of Tully the best of orators and to see the bay trees that now grow out of the very tomb of Virgil These to any that love learning must be pleasing But what pleasure is it to a devout Christian to see there the humble house in which saint Paul was content to dwell and to view the many rich statues that are made in honour of his memory nay to see the very place in which saint Peter and he lie buried together These are in and near to Rome And how much more doth it please the pious curiosity of a Christian to see that place on which the blessed Saviour of the world was pleased to humble himself and to take our nature upon him and to converse with men to see Mount Sion Jerusalem and the very sepulchre of our Lord Jesus How may it beget and heighten the zeal of a Christian to see the devotions that are daily paid to him at that place Gentlemen lest I forget myself I will stop here and remember you that but for my element of water the inhabitants of this poor island must remain ignorant that such things ever were or that any of them have yet a being Gentlemen I might both enlarge and lose myself in such like arguments I might tell you that Almighty God is said to have spoken to a fish but never to a beast that he hath made a whale a ship to carry and set his prophet Jonah safe on the appointed shore Of these I might speak but I must in manners break off for I see Theobald s House I cry you mercy for being so long and thank you for your patience Auceps Sir my pardon is easily granted you I except against nothing that you have said nevertheless I must part with you at this park wall for which I am very sorry but I assure you mister Piscator I now part with you full of good thoughts not only of yourself but your recreation And so Gentlemen God keep you both Piscator Well now mister Venator you shall neither want time nor my attention to hear you enlarge your discourse concerning hunting Venator Not I Sir I remember you said that Angling itself was of great antiquity and a perfect art and an art not easily attained to and you have so won upon me in your former discourse that I am very desirous to hear what you can say further concerning those particulars Piscator Sir I did say so and I doubt not but if you and I did converse together but a few hours to leave you possessed with the same high and happy thoughts that now possess me of it not only of the antiquity of Angling but that it deserves commendations and that it is an art and an art worthy the knowledge and practice of a wise man Venator Pray Sir speak of them what you think fit for we have yet five miles to the Thatched House during which walk I dare promise you my patience and diligent attention shall not be wanting And if you shall make that to appear which you have undertaken first that it is an art and an art worth the learning I shall beg that I may attend you a day or two a fishing and that I may become your scholar and be instructed in the art itself which you so much magnify Piscator O Sir doubt not but that Angling is an art is it not an art to deceive a Trout with an artificial Fly a Trout that is more sharp sighted than any Hawk you have named and more watchful and timorous than your high mettled Merlin is bold and yet I doubt not to catch a brace or two to morrow for a friend s breakfast doubt not therefore Sir but that angling is an art and an worth your learning The question is rather whether you be capable of learning it angling is somewhat like poetry men are to be born so I mean with inclinations to it though both may be heightened by discourse and practice but he that hopes to be a good angler must not only bring an inquiring searching observing wit but he must bring a large measure of hope and patience and a love and propensity to the art itself but having once got and practiced it then doubt not but angling will prove to be so pleasant that it will prove to be like virtue a reward to itself Venator Sir I am now become so full of expectation that I long much to have you proceed and in the order that you propose Piscator Then first for the antiquity of Angling of which I shall not say much but only this some say it is as ancient as Deucalion s flood others that Belus who was the first inventor of godly and virtuous recreations was the first inventor of Angling and some others say for former times have had their disquisitions about the antiquity of it that Seth one of the sons of Adam taught it to his sons and that by them it was derived to posterity others say that he left it engraver on those pillars which he erected and trusted to preserve the knowledge of the mathematicks musick and the rest of that precious knowledge and those useful arts which by God s appointment or allowance and his noble industry were thereby preserved from perishing in Noah s flood These Sir have been the opinions of several men that have possibly endeavoured to make angling more ancient than is needful or may well be warranted but for my part I shall content myself in telling you that angling is much more ancient than the incarnation of our Saviour for in the Prophet Amos mention is made of fish hooks and in the book of Job which was long before the days of Amos for that book is said to have been written by Moses mention is made also of fish hooks which must imply anglers in those times But my worthy friend as I would rather prove myself a gentleman by being learned and humble valiant and inoffensive virtuous and communicable than by any fond ostentation of riches or wanting those virtues myself boast that these were in my ancestors and yet I grant that where a noble and ancient descent and such merit meet in any man it is a double dignification of that person so if this antiquity of angling which for my part I have not forced shall like an ancient family be either an honour or an ornament to this virtuous art which I profess to love and practice I shall be the gladder that I made an accidental mention of the antiquity of it of which I shall say no more but proceed to that just commendation which I think it deserves And for that I shall tell you that in ancient times a debate hath risen and it remains yet unresolved whether the happiness of man in this world doth consist more in contemplation or action Concerning which some have endeavoured to maintain their opinion of the first by saying that the nearer we mortals come to God by way of imitation the more happy we are And they say that God enjoys himself only by a contemplation of his own infiniteness eternity power and goodness and the like And upon this ground many cloisteral men of great learning and devotion prefer contemplation before action And many of the fathers seem to approve this opinion as may appear in their commentaries upon the words of our Saviour to Martha And on the contrary there want not men of equal authority and credit that prefer action to be the more excellent as namely experiments in physick and the application of it both for the ease and prolongation of man s life by which each man is enabled to act and do good to others either to serve his country or do good to particular persons and they say also that action is doctrinal and teaches both art and virtue and is a maintainer of human society and for these and other like reasons to be preferred before contemplation Concerning which two opinions I shall forbear to add a third by declaring my own and rest myself contented in telling you my very worthy friend that both these meet together and do most properly belong to the most honest ingenuous quiet and harmless art of angling And first I shall tell you what some have observed and I have found it to be a real truth that the very sitting by the river s side is not only the quietest and fittest place for contemplation but will invite an angler to it and this seems to be maintained by the learned Peter du Moulin who in his discourse of the fulfilling of Prophecies observes that when God intended to reveal any future events or high notions to his prophets he then carried them either to the deserts or the sea shore that having so separated them from amidst the press of people and business and the cares of the world he might settle their mind in a quiet repose and there make them fit for revelation And this seems also to be imitated by the children of Israel who having in a sad condition banished all mirth and musick from their pensive hearts and having hung up their then mute harps upon the willow trees growing by the rivers of Babylon sat down upon those banks bemoaning the ruins of Sion and contemplating their own sad condition And an ingenious Spaniard says that rivers and the inhabitants of the watery element were made for wise men to contemplate and fools to pass by without consideration And though I will not rank myself in the number of the first yet give me leave to free myself from the last by offering to you a short contemplation first of rivers and then of fish concerning which I doubt not but to give you many observations that will appear very considerable I am sure they have appeared so to me and made many an hour pass away more pleasantly as I have sat quietly on a flowery bank by a calm river and contemplated what I shall now relate to you And first concerning rivers there be so many wonders reported and written of them and of the several creatures that be bred and live in them and those by authors of so good credit that we need not to deny them an historical faith As namely of a river in Epirus that puts out any lighted torch and kindles any torch that was not lighted Some waters being drunk cause madness some drunkenness and some laughter to death The river Selarus in a few hours turns a rod or wand to stone and our Camden mentions the like in England and the like in Lochmere in Ireland There is also a river in Arabia of which all the sheep that drink thereof have their wool turned into a vermilion colour And one of no less credit than Aristotle tells us of a merry river the river Elusina that dances at the noise of musick for with musick it bubbles dances and grows sandy and so continues till the musick ceases but then it presently returns to its wonted calmness and clearness And Camden tells us of a well near to Kirby in Westmoreland that ebbs and flows several times every day and he tells us of a river in Surrey it is called Mole that after it has run several miles being opposed by hills finds or makes itself a way under ground and breaks out again so far off that the inhabitants thereabout boast as the Spaniards do of their river Anus that they feed divers flocks of sheep upon a bridge And lastly for I would not tire your patience one of no less authority than Josephus that learned Jew tells us of a river in Judea that runs swiftly all the six days of the week and stands still and rests all their sabbath But I will lay aside my discourse of rivers and tell you some things of the monsters or fish call them what you will that they breed and feed in them Pliny the philosopher says in the third chapter of his ninth book that in the Indian Sea the fish called Balaena or Whirlpool is so long and broad as to take up more in length and breadth than two acres of ground and of other fish of two hundred cubits long and that in the river Ganges there be Eels of thirty feet long He says there that these monsters appear in that sea only when the tempestuous winds oppose the torrents of water falling from the rocks into it and so turning what lay at the bottom to be seen on the water s top And he says that the people of Cadara an island near this place make the timber for their houses of those fish bones He there tells us that there are sometimes a thousand of these great Eels found wrapt or interwoven together He tells us there that it appears that dolphins love musick and will come when called for by some men or boys that know and use to feed them and that they can swim as swift as an arrow can be shot out of a bow and much of this is spoken concerning the dolphin and other fish as may be found also in the learned doctor Casaubon s Discourse of Credulity and Incredulity printed by him about the year sixteen seventy I know we Islanders are averse to the belief of these wonders but there be so many strange creatures to be now seen many collected by John Tradescant and others added by my friend Elias Ashmole esquire who now keeps them carefully and methodically at his house near to Lambeth near London as may get some belief of some of the other wonders I mentioned I will tell you some of the wonders that you may now see and not till then believe unless you think fit You may there see the Hog fish the Dog fish the Dolphin the Cony fish the Parrot fish the Shark the Poison fish Sword fish and not only other incredible fish but you may there see the Salamander several sorts of Barnacles of Solan Geese the Bird of Paradise such sorts of Snakes and such Birds nests and of so various forms and so wonderfully made as may beget wonder and amusement in any beholder and so many hundred of other rarities in that collection as will make the other wonders I spake of the less incredible for you may note that the waters are Nature s store house in which she locks up her wonders But Sir lest this discourse may seem tedious I shall give it a sweet conclusion out of that holy poet mister George Herbert his divine Contemplation on God s Providence Lord who hath praise enough nay who hath any None can express thy works but he that knows them And none can know thy works they are so many And so complete but only he that owes them We all acknowledge both thy power and love To be exact transcendant and divine Who cost so strangely and so sweetly move Whilst all things have their end yet none but thine Wherefore most sacred Spirit I here present For me and all my fellows praise to thee And just it is that I should pay the rent Because the benefit accrues to me And as concerning fish in that psalm wherein for height of poetry and wonders the prophet David seems even to exceed himself how doth he there express himself in choice metaphors even to the amazement of a contemplative reader concerning the sea the rivers and the fish therein contained And the great naturalist Pliny says That nature s great and wonderful power is more demonstrated in the sea than on the land And this may appear by the numerous and various creatures inhabiting both in and about that element as to the readers of Gesner Rondeletius Pliny Ausonius Aristotle and others may be demonstrated But I will sweeten this discourse also out of a contemplation in divine Du Bartas who says God quickened in the sea and in the rivers So many fishes of so many features That in the waters we may see all creatures Even all that on the earth are to be found As if the world were in deep waters drown d For seas as well as skies have Sun Moon Stars As well as air Swallows Rooks and Stares As well as earth Vines Roses Nettles Melons Mushrooms Pinks Gilliflowers and many millions Of other plants more rare more strange than these As very fishes living in the seas As also Rams Calves Horses Hares and Hogs Wolves Urchins Lions Elephants and Dogs Yea Men and Maids and which I most admire The mitred Bishop and the cowled Friar Of which examples but a few years since Were strewn the Norway and Polonian prince These seem to be wonders but have had so many confirmations from men of learning and credit that you need not doubt them Nor are the number nor the various shapes of fishes more strange or more fit for contemplation than their different natures inclinations and actions concerning which I shall beg your patient ear a little longer The Cuttle fish will cast a long gut out of her throat which like as an Angler doth his line she sendeth forth and pulleth in again at her pleasure according as she sees some little fish come near to her and the Cuttle fish being then hid in the gravel lets the smaller fish nibble and bite the end of it at which time she by little and little draws the smaller fish so near to her that she may leap upon her and then catches and devours her and for this reason some have called this fish the Sea angler And there is a fish called a Hermit that at a certain age gets into a dead fish s shell and like a hermit dwells there alone studying the wind and weather and so turns her shell that she makes it defend her from the injuries that they would bring upon her There is also a fish called by AElian the Adonis or Darling of the Sea so called because it is a loving and innocent fish a fish that hurts nothing that hath life and is at peace with all the numerous inhabitants of that vast watery element and truly I think most Anglers are so disposed to most of mankind And there are also lustful and chaste fishes of which I shall give you examples And first what Du Bartas says of a fish called the Sargus which because none can express it better than he does I shall give you in his own words supposing it shall not have the less credit for being verse for he hath gathered this and other observations out of authors that have been great and industrious searchers into the secrets of nature The adult rous Sargus doth not only change Wives every day in the deep streams but strange As if the honey of sea love delight Could not suffice his ranging appetite Goes courting she goats on the grassy shore Horning their husbands that had horns before And the same author writes concerning the Cantharus that which you shall also hear in his own words But contrary the constant Cantharus Is ever constant to his faithful spouse In nuptial duties spending his chaste life Never loves any but his own dear wife Sir but a little longer and I have done Venator Sir take what liberty you think fit for your discourse seems to be musick and charms me to an attention Piscator Why then Sir I will take a little liberty to tell or rather to remember you what is said of Turtle doves first that they silently plight their troth and marry and that then the survivor scorns as the Thracian women are said to do to outlive his or her mate and this is taken for a truth and if the survivor shall ever couple with another then not only the living but the dead be it either the he or the she is denied the name and honour of a true Turtle dove And to parallel this land rarity and teach mankind moral faithfulness and to condemn those that talk of religion and yet come short of the moral faith of fish and fowl men that violate the law affirmed by saint Paul to be writ in their hearts and which he says shall at the Last Day condemn and leave them without excuse I pray hearken to what Du Bartas sings for the hearing of such conjugal faithfulness will be musick to all chaste ears and therefore I pray hearken to what Du Bartas sings of the Mullet But for chaste love the Mullet hath no peer For if the fisher hath surpris d her pheer As mad with wo to shore she followeth Prest to consort him both in life and death On the contrary what shall I say of the House Cock which treads any hen and then contrary to the Swan the Partridge and Pigeon takes no care to hatch to feed or cherish his own brood but is senseless though they perish And it is considerable that the Hen which because she also takes any Cock expects it not who is sure the chickens be her own hath by a moral impression her care and affection to her own brood more than doubled even to such a height that our Saviour in expressing his love to Jerusalem quotes her for an example of tender affection as his Father had done Job for a pattern of patience And to parallel this Cock there be divers fishes that cast their spawn on flags or stones and then leave it uncovered and exposed to become a prey and be devoured by vermin or other fishes But other fishes as namely the Barbel take such care for the preservation of their seed that unlike to the Cock or the Cuckoo they mutually labour both the spawner and the melter to cover their spawn with sand or watch it or hide it in some secret place unfrequented by vermin or by any fish but themselves Sir these examples may to you and others seem strange but they are testified some by Aristotle some by Pliny some by Gesner and by many others of credit and are believed and known by divers both of wisdom and experience to be a truth and indeed are as I said at the beginning fit for the contemplation of a most serious and a most pious man And doubtless this made the prophet David say They that occupy themselves in deep waters see the wonderful works of God indeed such wonders and pleasures too as the land affords not And that they be fit for the contemplation of the most prudent and pious and peaceable men seems to be testified by the practice of so many devout and contemplative men as the Patriarchs and Prophets of old and of the Apostles of our Saviour in our latter times of which twelve we are sure he chose four that were simple fishermen whom he inspired and sent to publish his blessed will to the Gentiles and inspired them also with a power to speak all languages and by their powerful eloquence to beget faith in the unbelieving Jews and themselves to suffer for that Saviour whom their forefathers and they had crucified and in their sufferings to preach freedom from the incumbrances of the law and a new way to everlasting life this was the employment of these happy fishermen Concerning which choice some have made these observations First that he never reproved these for their employment or calling as he did the Scribes and the Money changers And secondly he found that the hearts of such men by nature were fitted for contemplation and quietness men of mild and sweet and peaceable spirits as indeed most Anglers are these men our blessed Saviour who is observed to love to plant grace in good natures though indeed nothing be too hard for him yet these men he chose to call from their irreprovable employment of fig an and gave them grace to be his disciples and to follow him and do wonders I say four of twelve And it is observable that it was our Saviour s will that these our four fishermen should have a priority of nomination in the catalogue of his twelve Apostles as namely first saint Peter saint Andrew saint James and saint John and then the rest in their order And it is yet more observable that when our blessed Saviour went up into the mount when he left the rest of his disciples and chose only three to bear him company at his Transfiguration that those three were all fishermen And it is to be believed that all the other Apostles after they betook themselves to follow Christ betook themselves to be fishermen too for it is certain that the greater number of them were found together fishing by Jesus after his resurrection as it is recorded in the twenty first chapter of saint John s gospel And since I have your promise to hear me with patience I will take a liberty to look back upon an observation that hath been made by an ingenious and learned man who observes that God hath been pleased to allow those whom he himself hath appointed to write his holy will in holy writ yet to express his will in such metaphors as their former affections or practice had inclined them to And he brings Solomon for an example who before his conversion was remarkably carnally amorous and after by God s appointment wrote that spiritual dialogue or holy amorous love song the Canticles betwixt God and his church in which he says his beloved had eyes like the fish pools of Heshbon And if this hold in reason as I see none to the contrary then it may be probably concluded that Moses who I told you before writ the book of Job and the Prophet Amos who was a shepherd were both Anglers for you shall in all the Old Testament find fish hooks I think but twice mentioned namely by meek Moses the friend of God and by the humble prophet Amos Concerning which last namely the prophet Amos I shall make but this observation that he that shall read the humble lowly plain style of that prophet and compare it with the high glorious eloquent style of the prophet Isaiah though they be both equally true may easily believe Amos to be not only a shepherd but a good natured plain fisherman Which I do the rather believe by comparing the affectionate loving lowly humble Epistles of saint Peter saint James and saint John whom we know were all fishers with the glorious language and high metaphors of saint Paul who we may believe was not And for the lawfulness of fishing it may very well be maintained by our Saviour s bidding saint Peter cast his hook into the water and catch a fish for money to pay tribute to Caesar And let me tell you that Angling is of high esteem and of much use in other nations He that reads the Voyages of Ferdinand Mendez Pinto shall find that there he declares to have found a king and several priests a fishing And he that reads Plutarch shall find that Angling was not contemptible in the days of Mark Antony and Cleopatra and that they in the midst of their wonderful glory used Angling as a principal recreation And let me tell you that in the Scripture Angling is always taken in the best sense and that though hunting may be sometimes so taken yet it is but seldom to be so understood And let me add this more he that views the ancient Ecclesiastical Canons shall find hunting to be forbidden to Churchmen as being a turbulent toilsome perplexing recreation and shall find Angling allowed to clergymen as being a harmless recreation a recreation that invites them to contemplation and quietness I might here enlarge myself by telling you what commendations our learned Perkins bestows on Angling and how dear a lover and great a practiser of it our learned doctor Whitaker was as indeed many others of great learning have been But I will content myself with two memorable men that lived near to our own time whom I also take to have been ornaments to the art of Angling The first is doctor Nowel sometime dean of the cathedral church of saint Paul in London where his monument stands yet undefaced a man that in the reformation of Queen Elizabeth not that of Henry VIII was so noted for his meek spirit deep learning prudence and piety that the then Parliament and Convocation both chose enjoined and trusted him to be the man to make a Catechism for public use such a one as should stand as a rule for faith and manners to their posterity And the good old man though he was very learned yet knowing that God leads us not to heaven by many nor by hard questions like an honest Angler made that good plain unperplexed Catechism which is printed with our good old Service book I say this good man was a dear lover and constant practiser of Angling as any age can produce and his custom was to spend besides his fixed hours of prayer those hours which by command of the church were enjoined the clergy and voluntarily dedicated to devotion by many primitive Christians I say besides those hours this good man was observed to spend a tenth part of his time in Angling and also for I have conversed with those which have conversed with him to bestow a tenth part of his revenue and usually all his fish amongst the poor that inhabited near to those rivers in which it was caught saying often that charity gave life to religion and at his return to his house would praise God he had spent that day free from worldly trouble both harmlessly and in a recreation that became a churchman And this good man was well content if not desirous that posterity should know he was an Angler as may appear by his picture now to be seen and carefully kept in Brazen nose College to which he was a liberal benefactor In which picture he is drawn leaning on a desk with his Bible before him and on one hand of him his lines hooks and other tackling lying in a round and on his other hand are his Angle rods of several sorts and by them this is written that he died thirteen Feb sixteen oh one being aged ninety five years forty four of which he had been Dean of saint Paul s church and that his age neither impaired his hearing nor dimmed his eyes nor weakened his memory nor made any of the faculties of his mind weak or useless It is said that Angling and temperance were great causes of these blessings and I wish the like to all that imitate him and love the memory of so good a man My next and last example shall be that under valuer of money the late provost of Eton College Sir Henry Wotton a man with whom I have often fished and conversed a man whose foreign employments in the service of this nation and whose experience learning wit and cheerfulness made his company to be esteemed one of the delights of mankind This man whose very approbation of Angling were sufficient to convince any modest censurer of it this man was also a most dear lover and a frequent practiser of the art of Angling of which he would say it was an employment for his idle time which was then not idly spent for Angling was after tedious study a rest to his mind a cheerer of his spirits a diverter of sadness a calmer of unquiet thoughts a moderator of passions a procurer of contentedness and that it begat habits of peace and patience in those that professed and practiced it Indeed my friend you will find Angling to be like the virtue of humility which has a calmness of spirit and a world of other blessings attending upon it Sir this was the saying of that learned man And I do easily believe that peace and patience and a calm content did cohabit in the cheerful heart of Sir Henry Wotton because I know that when he was beyond seventy years of age he made this description of a part of the present pleasure that possessed him as he sat quietly in a summer s evening on a bank a fishing It is a description of the spring which because it glided as soft and sweetly from his pen as that river does at this time by which it was then made I shall repeat it unto you This day dame Nature seem d in love The lusty sap began to move Fresh juice did stir th embracing vines And birds had drawn their valentines The jealous trout that low did lie Rose at a well dissembled fly There stood my Friend with patient skill Attending of his trembling quill Already were the eaves possess d With the swift pilgrim s daubed nest The groves already did rejoice In Philomel s triumphing voice The showers were short the weather mild The morning fresh the evening smil d Joan takes her neat rubb d pail and now She trips to milk the sand red cow Where for some sturdy foot ball swain Joan strokes a syllabub or twain The fields and gardens were beset With tulips crocus violet And now though late the modest rose Did more than half a blush disclose Thus all looks gay and full of cheer To welcome the new livery d year These were the thoughts that then possessed the undisturbed mind of Sir Henry Wotton Will you hear the wish of another Angler and the commendation of his happy life which he also sings in verse viz Jo Davors esquire Let me live harmlessly and near the brink Of Trent or Avon have a dwelling place Where I may see my quill or cork down sink With eager bite of Perch or Bleak or Dace And on the world and my Creator think Whilst some men strive ill gotten goods t embrace And others spend their time in base excess Of wine or worse in war and wantonness Let them that list these pastimes still pursue And on such pleasing fancies feed their fill So I the fields and meadows green may view And daily by fresh rivers walk at will Among the daisies and the violets blue Red hyacinth and yellow daffodil Purple Narcissus like the morning rays Pale gander grass and azure culver keys I count it higher pleasure to behold The stately compass of the lofty sky And in the midst thereof like burning gold The flaming chariot of the world s great eye The watery clouds that in the air up roll d With sundry kinds of painted colours fly And fair Aurora lifting up her head Still blushing rise from old Tithonus bed The hills and mountains raised from the plains The plains extended level with the ground The grounds divided into sundry veins The veins inclos d with rivers running round These rivers making way through nature s chains With headlong course into the sea profound The raging sea beneath the vallies low Where lakes and rills and rivulets do flow The lofty woods the forests wide and long Adorned with leaves and branches fresh and green In whose cool bowers the birds with many a song Do welcome with their quire the summer s Queen The meadows fair where Flora s gifts among Are intermix d with verdant grass between The silver scaled fish that softly swim Within the sweet brook s crystal watery stream All these and many more of his creation That made the heavens the Angler oft doth see Taking therein no little delectation To think how strange how wonderful they be Framing thereof an inward contemplation To set his heart from other fancies free And whilst he looks on these with joyful eye His mind is rapt above the starry sky Sir I am glad my memory has not lost these last verses because they are somewhat more pleasant and more suitable to May day than my harsh discourse And I am glad your patience hath held out so long as to hear them and me for both together have brought us within the sight of the Thatched House And I must be your debtor if you think it worth your attention for the rest of my promised discourse till some other opportunity and a like time of leisure Venator Sir you have angled me on with much pleasure to the Thatched House and I now find your words true that good company makes the way seem short for trust me Sir I thought we had wanted three miles of this house till you showed it to me But now we are at it we ll turn into it and refresh ourselves with a cup of drink and a little rest Piscator Most gladly Sir and we ll drink a civil cup to all the Otter hunters that are to meet you to morrow Venator That we will Sir and to all the lovers of Angling too of which number I am now willing to be one myself for by the help of your good discourse and company I have put on new thoughts both of the art of Angling and of all that profess it and if you will but meet me to morrow at the time and place appointed and bestow one day with me and my friends in hunting the Otter I will dedicate the next two days to wait upon you and we too will for that time do nothing but angle and talk of fish and fishing Piscator It is a match Sir I will not fail you God willing to be at Amwell Hill to morrow morning before sun rising The second day On the Otter and the Chub Chapter II Piscator Venator Huntsman and Hostess Venator My friend Piscator you have kept time with my thoughts for the sun is just rising and I myself just now come to this place and the dogs have just now put down an Otter Look down at the bottom of the hill there in that meadow chequered with water lilies and lady smocks there you may see what work they make look look you may see all busy men and dogs dogs and men all busy Piscator Sir I am right glad to meet you and glad to have so fair an entrance into this day s sport and glad to see so many dogs and more men all in pursuit of the Otter Let us compliment no longer but join unto them Come honest Venator let us be gone let us make haste I long to be doing no reasonable hedge or ditch shall hold me Venator Gentleman Huntsman where found you this Otter Huntsman Marry Sir we found her a mile from this place a fishing She has this morning eaten the greatest part of this Trout she has only left thus much of it as you see and was fishing for more when we came we found her just at it but we were here very early we were here an hour before sunrise and have given her no rest since we came sure she will hardly escape all these dogs and men I am to have the skin if we kill her Venator Why Sir what is the skin worth Huntsman It is worth ten shillings to make gloves the gloves of an Otter are the best fortification for your hands that can be thought on against wet weather Piscator I pray honest Huntsman let me ask you a pleasant question do you hunt a beast or a fish Huntsman Sir it is not in my power to resolve you I leave it to be resolved by the college of Carthusians who have made vows never to eat flesh But I have heard the question hath been debated among many great clerks and they seem to differ about it yet most agree that her tail is fish and if her body be fish too then I may say that a fish will walk upon land for an Otter does so sometimes five or six or ten miles in a night to catch for her young ones or to glut herself with fish And I can tell you that Pigeons will fly forty miles for a breakfast but Sir I am sure the Otter devours much fish and kills and spoils much more than he eats And I can tell you that this dog fisher for so the Latins call him can smell a fish in the water a hundred yards from him Gesner says much farther and that his stones are good against the falling sickness and that there is an herb Benione which being hung in a linen cloth near a fish pond or any haunt that he uses makes him to avoid the place which proves he smells both by water and land And I can tell you there is brave hunting this water dog in Cornwall where there have been so many that our learned Camden says there is a river called Ottersey which was so named by reason of the abundance of Otters that bred and fed in it And thus much for my knowledge of the Otter which you may now see above water at vent and the dogs close with him I now see he will not last long Follow therefore my masters follow for Sweetlips was like to have him at this last vent Venator Oh me all the horse are got over the river what shall we do now shall we follow them over the water Huntsman No Sir no be not so eager stay a little and follow me for both they and the dogs will be suddenly on this side again I warrant you and the Otter too it may be Now have at him with Kilbuck for he vents again Venator Marry so he does for look he vents in that corner Now now Ringwood has him now he is gone again and has bit the poor dog Now Sweetlips has her hold her Sweetlips now all the dogs have her some above and some under water but now now she is tired and past losing Come bring her to me Sweetlips Look it is a Bitch otter and she has lately whelp d Let s go to the place where she was put down and not far from it you will find all her young ones I dare warrant you and kill them all too Huntsman Come Gentlemen come all let s go to the place where we put down the Otter Look you hereabout it was that she kennelled look you here it was indeed for here s her young ones no less than five come let us kill them all Piscator No I pray Sir save me one and I ll try if I can make her tame as I know an ingenious gentleman in Leicestershire mister Nich Segrave has done who hath not only made her tame but to catch fish and do many other things of much pleasure Huntsman Take one with all my heart but let us kill the rest And now let s go to an honest ale house where we may have a cup of good barley wine and sing Old Rose and all of us rejoice together Venator Come my friend Piscator let me invite you along with us I ll bear your charges this night and you shall bear mine to morrow for my intention is to accompany you a day or two in fishing Piscator Sir your request is granted and I shall be right glad both to exchange such a courtesy and also to enjoy your company The third day Venator Well now let s go to your sport of Angling Piscator Let s be going with all my heart God keep you all Gentlemen and send you meet this day with another Bitch otter and kill her merrily and all her young ones too Venator NOW Piscator where will you begin to fish Piscator We are not yet come to a likely place I must walk a mile further yet before I beam Venator Well then I pray as we walk tell me freely how do you like your lodging and mine host and the company Is not mine host a witty man Piscator Sir I will tell you presently what I think of your host but first I will tell you I am glad these Otters were killed and I am sorry there are no more Otter killers for I know that the want of Otter killers and the not keeping the fence months for the preservation of fish will in time prove the destruction of all rivers And those very few that are left that make conscience of the laws of the nation and of keeping days of abstinence will be forced to eat flesh or suffer more inconveniences than are yet foreseen Venator Why Sir what be those that you call the fence months Piscator Sir they be principally three namely March April and May for these be the usual months that Salmon come out of the sea to spawn in most fresh rivers And their fry would about a certain time return back to the salt water if they were not hindered by weirs and unlawful gins which the greedy fishermen set and so destroy them by thousands as they would being so taught by nature change the fresh for salt water He that shall view the wise Statutes made in the thirteenth of Edward the First and the like in Richard the Second may see several provisions made against the destruction of fish and though I profess no knowledge of the law yet I am sure the regulation of these defects might be easily mended But I remember that a wise friend of mine did usually say that which is everybody s business is nobody s business if it were otherwise there could not be so many nets and fish that are under the statute size sold daily amongst us and of which the conservators of the waters should be ashamed But above all the taking fish in spawning time may be said to be against nature it is like taking the dam on the nest when she hatches her young a sin so against nature that Almighty God hath in the Levitical law made a law against it But the poor fish have enemies enough besides such unnatural fishermen as namely the Otters that I spake of the Cormorant the Bittern the Osprey the Sea gull the Hern the King fisher the Gorara the Puet the Swan Goose Duck and the Craber which some call the Water rat against all which any honest man may make a just quarrel but I will not I will leave them to be quarrelled with and killed by others for I am not of a cruel nature I love to kill nothing but fish And now to your question concerning your host To speak truly he is not to me a good companion for most of his conceits were either scripture jests or lascivious jests for which I count no man witty for the devil will help a man that way inclined to the first and his own corrupt nature which he always carries with him to the latter But a companion that feasts the company with wit and mirth and leaves out the sin which is usually mixed with them he is the man and indeed such a companion should have his charges borne and to such company I hope to bring you this night for at Trout hall not far from this place where I purpose to lodge to night there is usually an Angler that proves good company And let me tell you good company and good discourse are the very sinews of virtue But for such discourse as we heard last night it infects others the very boys will learn to talk and swear as they heard mine host and another of the company that shall be nameless I am sorry the other is a gentleman for less religion will not save their souls than a beggar s I think more will be required at the last great day Well you know what example is able to do and I know what the poet says in the like case which is worthy to be noted by all parents and people of civility many a one Owes to his country his religion And in another would as strongly grow Had but his nurse or mother taught him so This is reason put into verse and worthy the consideration of a wise man But of this no more for though I love civility yet I hate severe censures I ll to my own art and I doubt not but at yonder tree I shall catch a Chub and then we ll turn to an honest cleanly hostess that I know right well rest ourselves there and dress it for our dinner Venator Oh Sir a Chub is the worst fish that swims I hoped for a Trout to my dinner Piscator Trust me Sir there is not a likely place for a Trout hereabout and we staid so long to take our leave of your huntsmen this morning that the sun is got so high and shines so clear that I will not undertake the catching of a Trout till evening And though a Chub be by you and many others reckoned the worst of fish yet you shall see I ll make it a good fish by dressing it Venator Why how will you dress him Piscator I ll tell you by and by when I have caught him Look you here Sir do you see but you must stand very close there lie upon the top of the water in this very hole twenty Chubs I ll catch only one and that shall be the biggest of them all and that I will do so I ll hold you twenty to one and you shall see it done Venator Ay marry Sir now you talk like an artist and I ll say you are one when I shall see you perform what you say you can do but I yet doubt it Piscator You shall not doubt it long for you shall see me do it presently Look the biggest of these Chubs has had some bruise upon his tail by a Pike or some other accident and that looks like a white spot That very Chub I mean to put into your hands presently sit you but down in the shade and stay but a little while and I ll warrant you I ll bring him to you Venator I ll sit down and hope well because you seem to be so confident Piscator Look you Sir there is a trial of my skill there he is that very Chub that I showed you with the white spot on his tail And I ll be as certain to make him a good dish of meat as I was to catch him I ll now lead you to an honest ale house where we shall find a cleanly room lavender in the windows and twenty ballads stuck about the wall There my hostess which I may tell you is both cleanly and handsome and civil hath dressed many a one for me and shall now dress it after my fashion and I warrant it good meat Venator Come Sir with all my heart for I begin to be hungry and long to be at it and indeed to rest myself too for though I have walked but four miles this morning yet I begin to be weary yesterday s hunting hangs still upon me Piscator Well Sir and you shall quickly be at rest for yonder is the house I mean to bring you to Come hostess how do you Will you first give us a cup of your best drink and then dress this Chub as you dressed my last when I and my friend were here about eight or ten days ago But you must do me one courtesy it must be done instantly Hostess I will do it mister Piscator and with all the speed I can Piscator NOW Sir has not my hostess made haste and does not the fish look lovely Venator Both upon my word Sir and therefore let s say grace and fall to eating of it Piscator Well Sir how do you like it Venator Trust me tis as good meat as I ever tasted Now let me thank you for it drink to you and beg a courtesy of you but it must not be denied me Piscator What is it I pray Sir You are so modest that methinks I may promise to grant it before it is asked Venator Why Sir it is that from henceforth you would allow me to call you Master and that really I may be your scholar for you are such a companion and have so quickly caught and so excellently cooked this fish as makes me ambitious to be your scholar Piscator Give me your hand from this time forward I will be your Master and teach you as much of this art as I am able and will as you desire me tell you somewhat of the nature of most of the fish that we are to angle for and I am sure I both can and will tell you more than any common angler yet knows The third day continued How to fish for and to dress the Chavender of Chub Chapter III Piscator and Venator Piscator The Chub though he eat well thus dressed yet as he is usually dressed he does not He is objected against not only for being full of small forked bones dispersed through all his body but that he eats waterish and that the flesh of him is not firm but short and tasteless The French esteem him so mean as to call him Un Villain nevertheless he may be so dressed as to make him very good meat as namely if he be a large Chub then dress him thus First scale him and then wash him clean and then take out his guts and to that end make the hole as little and near to his gills as you may conveniently and especially make clean his throat from the grass and weeds that are usually in it for if that be not very clean it will make him to taste very sour Having so done put some sweet herbs into his belly and then tie him with two or three splinters to a spit and roast him basted often with vinegar or rather verjuice and butter with good store of salt mixed with it Being thus dressed you will find him a much better dish of meat than you or most folk even than anglers themselves do imagine for this dries up the fluid watery humour with which all Chubs do abound But take this rule with you That a Chub newly taken and newly dressed is so much better than a Chub of a day s keeping after he is dead that L can compare him to nothing so fitly as to cherries newly gathered from a tree and others that have been bruised and lain a day or two in water But the Chub being thus used and dressed presently and not washed after he is gutted for note that lying long in water and washing the blood out of any fish after they be gutted abates much of their sweetness you will find the Chub being dressed in the blood and quickly to be such meat as will recompense your labour and disabuse your opinion Or you may dress the Chavender or Chub thus When you have scaled him and cut off his tail and fins and washed him very clean then chine or slit him through the middle as a salt fish is usually cut then give him three or four cuts or scotches on the back with your knife and broil him on charcoal or wood coal that are free from smoke and all the time he is a broiling baste him with the best sweet butter and good store of salt mixed with it And to this add a little thyme cut exceedingly small or bruised into the butter The Cheven thus dressed hath the watery taste taken away for which so many except against him Thus was the Cheven dressed that you now liked so well and commended so much But note again that if this Chub that you eat of had been kept till to morrow he had not been worth a rush And remember that his throat be washed very clean I say very clean and his body not washed after he is gutted as indeed no fish should be Well scholar you see what pains I have taken to recover the lost credit of the poor despised Chub And now I will give you some rules how to catch him and I am glad to enter you into the art of fishing by catching a Chub for there is no fish better to enter a young Angler he is so easily caught but then it must be this particular way Go to the same hole in which I caught my Chub where in most hot days you will find a dozen or twenty Chevens floating near the top of the water Get two or three grasshoppers as you go over the meadow and get secretly behind the tree and stand as free from motion as is possible Then put a grasshopper on your hook and let your hook hang a quarter of a yard short of the water to which end you must rest your rod on some bough of the tree But it is likely the Chubs will sink down towards the bottom of the water at the first shadow of your rod for Chub is the fearfullest of fishes and will do so if but a bird flies over him and makes the least shadow on the water but they will presently rise up to the top again and there lie soaring till some shadow affrights them again I say when they lie upon the top of the water look out the best Chub which you setting yourself in a fit place may very easily see and move your rod as softly as a snail moves to that Chub you intend to catch let your bait fall gently upon the water three or four inches before him and he will infallibly take the bait And you will be as sure to catch him for he is one of the leather mouthed fishes of which a hook does scarce ever lose its hold and therefore give him play enough before you offer to take him out of the water Go your way presently take my rod and do as I bid you and I will sit down and mend my tackling till you return back Venator Truly my loving master you have offered me as fair as I could wish I ll go and observe your directions Look you master what I have done that which joys my heart caught just such another Chub as yours was Piscator Marry and I am glad of it I am like to have a towardly scholar of you I now see that with advice and practice you will make an Angler in a short time Have but a love to it and I ll warrant you Venator But master what if I could not have found a grasshopper Piscator Then I may tell you That a black snail with his belly slit to show his white or a piece of soft cheese will usually do as well Nay sometimes a worm or any kind of fly as the ant fly the flesh fly or wall fly or the dor or beetle which you may find under cow dung or a bob which you will find in the same place and in time will be a beetle it is a short white worm like to and bigger than a gentle or a cod worm or a case worm any of these will do very well to fish in such a manner And after this manner you may catch a Trout in a hot evening when as you walk by a brook and shall see or hear him leap at flies then if you get a grasshopper put it on your hook with your line about two yards long standing behind a bush or tree where his hole is and make your bait stir up and down on the top of the water You may if you stand close be sure of a bite but not sure to catch him for he is not a leather mouthed fish And after this manner you may fish for him with almost any kind of live fly but especially with a grasshopper Venator But before you go further I pray good master what mean you by a leather mouthed fish Piscator By a leather mouthed fish I mean such as have their teeth in their throat as the Chub or Cheven and so the Barbel the Gudgeon and Carp and divers others have And the hook being stuck into the leather or skin of the mouth of such fish does very seldom or never lose its hold but on the contrary a Pike a Perch or Trout and so some other fish which have not their teeth in their throats but in their mouths which you shall observe to be very full of bones and the skin very thin and little of it I say of these fish the hook never takes so sure hold but you often lose your fish unless he have gorged it Venator I thank you good master for this observation But now what shall be done with my Chub or Cheven that I have caught Piscator Marry Sir it shall be given away to some poor body for I ll warrant you I ll give you a Trout for your supper and it is a good beginning of your art to offer your first fruits to the poor who will both thank you and God for it which I see by your silence you seem to consent to And for your willingness to part with it so charitably I will also teach more concerning Chub fishing You are to note that in March and April he is usually taken with worms in May June and July he will bite at any fly or at cherries or at beetles with their legs and wings cut off or at any kind of snail or at the black bee that breeds in clay walls And he never refuses a grasshopper on the top of a swift stream nor at the bottom the young humble bee that breeds in long grass and is ordinarily found by the mower of it In August and in the cooler months a yellow paste made of the strongest cheese and pounded in a mortar with a little butter and saffron so much of it as being beaten small will turn it to a lemon colour And some make a paste for the winter months at which time the Chub is accounted best for then it is observed that the forked bones are lost or turned into a kind of gristle especially if he be baked of cheese and turpentine He will bite also at a minnow or peek as a Trout will of which I shall tell you more hereafter and of divers other baits But take this for a rule that in hot weather he is to be fished for towards the mid water or near the top and in colder weather nearer the bottom and if you fish for him on the top with a beetle or any fly then be sure to let your line be very long and to keep out of sight And having told you that his spawn is excellent meat and that the head of a large Cheven the throat being well washed is the best part of him I will say no more of this fish at the present but wish you may catch the next you fish for But lest you may judge me too nice in urging to have the Chub dressed so presently after he is taken I will commend to your consideration how curious former times have been in the like kind You shall read in Seneca his Natural Questions that the ancients were so curious in the newness of their fish that that seemed not new enough that was not put alive into the guest s hand and he says that to that end they did usually keep them living in glass bottles in their dining rooms and they did glory much in their entertaining of friends to have that fish taken from under their table alive that was instantly to be fed upon and he says they took great pleasure to see their Mullets change to several colours when they were dying But enough of this for I doubt I have staid too long from giving you some Observations of the Trout and how to fish for him which shall take up the next of my spare time The third day continued On the Nature and Breeding of the Trout and how to fish for him Chapter IV Piscator Venator Milk woman Maudlin Hostess Piscator The Trout is a fish highly valued both in this and foreign nations He may be justly said as the old poet said of wine and we English say of venison to be a generous fish a fish that is so like the buck that he also has his seasons for it is observed that he comes in and goes out of season with the stag and buck Gesner says his name is of a German offspring and says he is a fish that feeds clean and purely in the swiftest streams and on the hardest gravel and that he may justly contend with all fresh water fish as the Mullet may with all sea fish for precedency and daintiness of taste and that being in right season the most dainty palates have allowed precedency to him And before I go farther in my discourse let me tell you that you are to observe that as there be some barren does that are good in summer so there be some barren Trouts that are good in winter but there are not many that are so for usually they be in their perfection in the month of May and decline with the buck Now you are to take notice that in several countries as in Germany and in other parts compared to ours fish do differ much in their bigness and shape and other ways and so do Trouts It is well known that in the Lake Leman the Lake of Geneva there are Trouts taken of three cubits long as is affirmed by Gesner a writer of good credit and Mercator says the Trouts that are taken in the Lake of Geneva are a great part of the merchandize of that famous city And you are further to know that there be certain waters that breed Trouts remarkable both for their number and smallness I know a little brook in Kent that breeds them to a number incredible and you may take them twenty or forty in an hour but none greater than about the size of a Gudgeon There are also in divers rivers especially that relate to or be near to the sea as Winchester or the Thames about Windsor a little Trout called a Samlet or Skegger Trout in both which places I have caught twenty or forty at a standing that will bite as fast and as freely as Minnows these be by some taken to be young Salmons but in those waters they never grow to be bigger than a Herring There is also in Kent near to Canterbury a Trout called there a Fordidge Trout a Trout that bears the name of the town where it is usually caught that is accounted the rarest of fish many of them near the bigness of a Salmon but known by their different colour and in their best season they cut very white and none of these have been known to be caught with an angle unless it were one that was caught by Sir George Hastings an excellent angler and now with God and he hath told me he thought that Trout bit not for hunger but wantonness and it is the rather to be believed because both he then and many others before him have been curious to search into their bellies what the food was by which they lived and have found out nothing by which they might satisfy their curiosity Concerning which you are to take notice that it is reported by good authors that grasshoppers and some fish have no mouths but are nourished and take breath by the porousness of their gills man knows not how and this may be believed if we consider that when the raven hath hatched her eggs she takes no further care but leaves her young ones to the care of the God of nature who is said in the Psalms to feed the young ravens that call upon him And they be kept alive and fed by a dew or worms that breed in their nests or some other ways that we mortals know not And this may be believed of the Fordidge Trout which as it is said of the stork that he knows his season so he knows his times I think almost his day of coming into that river out of the sea where he lives and it is like feeds nine months of the year and fasts three in the river of Fordidge And you are to note that those townsmen are very punctual in observing the time of beginning to fish for them and boast much that their river affords a Trout that exceeds all others And just so does Sussex boast of several fish as namely a Shelsey Cockle a Chichester Lobster an Arundel Mullet and an Amerly Trout And now for some confirmation of the Fordidge Trout you are to know that this Trout is thought to eat nothing in the fresh water and it may be the better believed because it is well known that swallows and bats and wagtails which are called half year birds and not seen to fly in England for six months in the year but about Michaelmas leave us for a hotter climate yet some of them that have been left behind their fellows have been found many thousands at a time in hollow trees or clay caves where they have been observed to live and sleep out the whole winter without meat And so Albertus observes That there is one kind of frog that hath her mouth naturally shut up about the end of August and that she lives so all the winter and though it be strange to some yet it is known to too many among us to be doubted And so much for these Fordidge Trouts which never afford an angler sport but either live their time of being in the fresh water by their meat formerly gotten in the sea not unlike the swallow or frog or by the virtue of the fresh water only or as the birds of Paradise and the cameleon are said to live by the sun and the air There is also in Northumberland a Trout called a Bull trout of a much greater length and bigness than any in these southern parts and there are in many rivers that relate to the sea Salmon trouts as much different from others both in shape and in their spots as we see sheep in some countries differ one from another in their shape and bigness and in the fineness of the wool and certainly as some pastures breed larger sheep so do some rivers by reason of the ground over which they run breed larger Trouts Now the next thing that I will commend to your consideration is that the Trout is of a more sudden growth than other fish Concerning which you are also to take notice that he lives not so long as the Pearch and divers other fishes do as Sir Francis Bacon hath observed in his History of Life and Death And next you are to take notice that he is not like the Crocodile which if he lives never so long yet always thrives till his death but tis not so with the Trout for after he is come to his full growth he declines in his body and keeps his bigness or thrives only in his head till his death And you are to know that he will about especially before the time of his spawning get almost miraculously through weirs and flood gates against the stream even through such high and swift places as is almost incredible Next that the Trout usually spawns about October or November but in some rivers a little sooner or later which is the more observable because most other fish spawn in the spring or summer when the sun hath warmed both the earth and water and made it fit for generation And you are to note that he continues many months out of season for it may be observed of the Trout that he is like the Buck or the Ox that will not be fat in many months though he go in the very same pastures that horses do which will be fat in one month and so you may observe That most other fishes recover strength and grow sooner fat and in season than the Trout doth And next you are to note That till the sun gets to such a height as to warm the earth and the water the Trout is sick and lean and lousy and unwholesome for you shall in winter find him to have a big head and then to be lank and thin and lean at which time many of them have sticking on them Sugs or Trout lice which is a kind of a worm in shape like a clove or pin with a big head and sticks close to him and sucks his moisture those I think the Trout breeds himself and never thrives till he free himself from them which is when warm weather comes and then as he grows stronger he gets from the dead still water into the sharp streams and the gravel and there rubs off these worms or lice and then as he grows stronger so he gets him into swifter and swifter streams and there lies at the watch for any fly or minnow that comes near to him and he especially loves the May fly which is bred of the cod worm or cadis and these make the Trout bold and lusty and he is usually fatter and better meat at the end of that month than at any time of the year Now you are to know that it is observed that usually the best Trouts are either red or yellow though some as the Fordidge Trout be white and yet good but that is not usual and it is a note observable that the female Trout hath usually a less head and a deeper body than the male Trout and is usually the better meat And note that a hog back and a little head to either Trout Salmon or any other fish is a sign that that fish is in season But yet you are to note that as you see some willows or palm trees bud and blossom sooner than others do so some Trouts be in rivers sooner in season and as some hollies or oaks are longer before they cast their leaves so are some Trouts in rivers longer before they go out of season And you are to note that there are several kinds of Trouts but these several kinds are not considered but by very few men for they go under the general name of Trouts just as pigeons do in most places though it is certain there are tame and wild pigeons and of the tame there be hermits and runts and carriers and cropers and indeed too many to name Nay the Royal Society have found and published lately that there be thirty and three kinds of spiders and yet all for aught I know go under that one general name of spider And it is so with many kinds of fish and of Trouts especially which differ in their bigness and shape and spots and colour The great Kentish hens may be an instance compared to other hens and doubtless there is a kind of small Trout which will never thrive to be big that breeds very many more than others do that be of a larger size which you may rasher believe if you consider that the little wren end titmouse will have twenty young ones at a time when usually the noble hawk or the musical thrassel or blackbird exceed not four or five And now you shall see me try my skill to catch a Trout and at my next walking either this evening or to morrow morning I will give you direction how you yourself shall fish for him Venator Trust me master I see now it is a harder matter to catch a Trout than a Chub for I have put on patience and followed you these two hours and not seen a fish stir neither at your minnow nor your worm Piscator Well scholar you must endure worse luck sometime or you will never make a good angler But what say you now there is a Trout now and a good one too if I can but hold him and two or three turns more will tire him Now you see he lies still and the sleight is to land him reach me that landing net So Sir now he is mine own what say you now is not this worth all my labour and your patience Venator On my word master this is a gallant Trout what shall we do with him Piscator Marry e en eat him to supper we ll go to my hostess from whence we came she told me as I was going out of door that my brother Peter a good angler and a cheerful companion had sent word he would lodge there to night and bring a friend with him My hostess has two beds and I know you and I may have the best we ll rejoice with my brother Peter and his friend tell tales or sing ballads or make a catch or find some harmless sport to content us and pass away a little time without offence to God or man Venator A match good master let s go to that house for the linen looks white and smells of lavender and I long to lie in a pair of sheets that smell so Let s be going good master for I am hungry again with fishing Piscator Nay stay a little good scholar I caught my last Trout with a worm now I will put on a minnow and try a quarter of an hour about yonder trees for another and so walk towards our lodging Look you scholar thereabout we shall have a bite presently or not at all Have with you Sir o my word I have hold of him Oh it is a great logger headed Chub come hang him upon that willow twig and let s be going But turn out of the way a little good scholar toward yonder high honeysuckle hedge there we ll sit and sing whilst this shower falls so gently upon the teeming earth and gives yet a sweeter smell to the lovely flowers that adorn these verdant meadows Look under that broad beech tree I sat down when I was last this way a fishing and the birds in the adjoining grove seemed to have a friendly contention with an echo whose dead voice seemed to live in a hollow tree near to the brow of that primrose hill There I sat viewing the silver streams glide silently towards their centre the tempestuous sea yet sometimes opposed by rugged roots and pebble stones which broke their waves and turned them into foam and sometimes I beguiled time by viewing the harmless lambs some leaping securely in the cool shade whilst others sported themselves in the cheerful sun and saw others craving comfort from the swollen udders of their bleating dams As I thus sat these and other sights had so fully possess my soul with content that I thought as the poet has happily express it I was for that time lifted above earth And possest joys not promis d in my birth As I left this place and entered into the next field a second pleasure entertained me twas a handsome milk maid that had not yet attained so much age and wisdom as to load her mind with any fears of many things that will never be as too many men too often do but she cast away all care and sung like a nightingale Her voice was good and the ditty fitted for it it was that smooth song which was made by Kit Marlow now at least fifty years ago and the milk maid s mother sung an answer to it which was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in his younger days They were old fashioned poetry but choicely good I think much better than the strong lines that are now in fashion in this critical age Look yonder on my word yonder they both be a milking again I will give her the Chub and persuade them to sing those two songs to us God speed you good woman I have been a fishing and am going to Bleak Hall to my bed and having caught more fish than will sup myself and my friend I will bestow this upon you and your daughter for I use to sell none Milk woman Marry God requite you Sir and we ll eat it cheerfully And if you come this way a fishing two months hence a grace of God I ll give you a syllabub of new verjuice in a new made hay cock for it And my Maudlin shall sing you one of her best ballads for she and I both love all anglers they be such honest civil quiet men In the meantime will you drink a draught of red cow s milk you shall have it freely Piscator No I thank you but I pray do us a courtesy that shall stand you and your daughter in nothing and yet we will think ourselves still something in your debt it is but to sing us a song that was sung by your daughter when I last passed over this meadow about eight or nine days since Milk woman What song was it I pray Was it Come Shepherds deck your herds or As at noon Dulcina rested or Phillida flouts me or Chevy Chace or Johnny Armstrong or Troy Town Piscator No it is none of those it is a Song that your daughter sung the first part and you sung the answer to it Milk woman O I know it now I learned the first part in my golden age when I was about the age of my poor daughter and the latter part which indeed fits me best now but two or three years ago when the cares of the world began to take hold of me but you shall God willing hear them both and sung as well as we can for we both love anglers Come Maudlin sing the first part to the gentlemen with a merry heart and I ll sing the second when you have done The Milk maid s song Come live with me and be my love And we will all the pleasures prove That valleys groves or hills or fields Or woods and steepy mountains yields Where we will sit upon the rocks And see the shepherds feed our flocks By shallow rivers to whose falls Melodious birds sing madrigals And I will make thee beds of roses And then a thousand fragrant posies A cap of flowers and a kirtle Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle A gown made of the finest wool Which from our pretty lambs we pull Slippers lin d choicely for the cold With buckles of the purest gold A belt of straw and ivy buds With coral clasps and amber studs And if these pleasures may thee move Come live with me and be my love Thy silver dishes for thy meat As precious as the Gods do eat Shall on an ivory table be Prepared each day for thee and me The shepherd swains shall dance and sing For thy delight each May morning If these delights thy mind may move Then live with me and be my love Venator Trust me master it is a choice song and sweetly sung by honest Maudlin I now see it was not without cause that our good queen Elizabeth did so often wish herself a milk maid all the month of May because they are not troubled with fears and cares but sing sweetly all the day and sleep securely all the night and without doubt honest innocent pretty Maudlin does so I ll bestow Sir Thomas Overbury s milk maid s wish upon her that she may die in the Spring and being dead may have good store of flowers stuck round about her winding sheet The Milk maid s mother s answer If all the world and love were young And truth in every shepherd s tongue These pretty pleasures might me move To live with thee and be thy love But Time drives flocks from field to fold When rivers rage and rocks grow cold Then Philomel becometh dumb And age complains of cares to come The flowers do fade and wanton fields To wayward winter reckoning yields A honey tongue a heart of gall Is fancy s spring but sorrow s fall Thy gowns thy shoes thy beds of roses Thy cap thy kirtle and thy posies Soon break soon wither soon forgotten In folly rise in reason rotten Thy belt of straw and ivy buds Thy coral clasps and amber studs All these in me no means can move To come to thee and be thy love What should we talk of dainties then Of better meat than s fit for men These are but vain that s only good Which God hath blessed and sent for food But could youth last and love still breed Had joys no date nor age no need Then those delights my mind might move To live with thee and be thy love Mother Well I have done my song But stay honest anglers for I will make Maudlin sing you one short song more Maudlin sing that song that you sung last night when young Coridon the shepherd played so purely on his oaten pipe to you and your cousin Betty Maudlin I will mother I married a wife of late The more s my unhappy fate I married her for love As my fancy did me move And not for a worldly estate But oh the green sickness Soon changed her likeness And all her beauty did fail But tis not so With those that go Thro frost and snow As all men know And carry the milking pail Piscator Well sung good woman I thank you I ll give you another dish of fish one of these days and then beg another song of you Come scholar let Maudlin alone do not you offer to spoil her voice Look yonder comes mine hostess to call us to supper How now is my brother Peter come Hostess Yes and a friend with him They are both glad to hear that you are in these parts and long to see you and long to be at supper for they be very hungry The third day continued On the Trout Chapter V Piscator Peter Venator Coridon Piscator Well met brother Peter I heard you and a friend would lodge here to night and that hath made me to bring my friend to lodge here too My friend is one that would fain be a brother of the angle he hath been an angler but this day and I have taught him how to catch a Chub by dapping with a grasshopper and the Chub he caught was a lusty one of nineteen inches long But pray brother Peter who is your companion Peter Brother Piscator my friend is an honest countryman and his name is Coridon and he is a downright witty companion that met me here purposely to be pleasant and eat a Trout and I have not yet wetted my line since we met together but I hope to fit him with a Trout for his breakfast for I ll be early up Piscator Nay brother you shall not stay so long for look you here is a Trout will fill six reasonable bellies Come hostess dress it presently and get us what other meat the house will afford and give us some of your best barley wine the good liquor that our honest forefathers did use to think of the drink which preserved their health and made them live so long and to do so many good deeds Peter On my word this Trout is perfect in season Come I thank you and here is a hearty draught to you and to all the brothers of the angle wheresoever they be and to my young brother s good fortune to morrow I will furnish him with a rod if you will furnish him with the rest of the tackling we will set him up and make him a fisher And I will tell him one thing for his encouragement that his fortune hath made him happy to be scholar to such a master a master that knows as much both of the nature and breeding of fish as any man and can also tell him as well how to catch and cook them from the Minnow to the Salmon as any that I ever met withal Piscator Trust me brother Peter I find my scholar to be so suitable to my own humour which is to be free and pleasant and civilly merry that my resolution is to hide nothing that I know from him Believe me scholar this is my resolution and so here s to you a hearty draught and to all that love us and the honest art of Angling Venator Trust me good master you shall not sow your seed in barren ground for I hope to return you an increase answerable to your hopes but however you shall find me obedient and thankful and serviceable to my best ability Piscator Tis enough honest scholar come let s to supper Come my friend Coridon this Trout looks lovely it was twenty two inches when it was taken and the belly of it looked some part of it as yellow as a marigold and part of it as white as a lily and yet methinks it looks better in this good sauce Coridon Indeed honest friend it looks well and tastes well I thank you for it and so doth my friend Peter or else he is to blame Peter Yes and so I do we all thank you and when we have supped I will get my friend Coridon to sing you a song for requital Coridon I will sing a song if anybody will sing another else to be plain with you I will sing none I am none of those that sing for meat but for company I say Tis merry in hall When men sing all Piscator I ll promise you I ll sing a song that was lately made at my request by mister William Basse one that hath made the choice songs of the Hunter in his Career and of Tom of Bedlam and many others of note and this that I will sing is in praise of Angling Coridon And then mine shall be the praise of a Countryman s life What will the rest sing of Peter I will promise you I will sing another song in praise of Angling to morrow night for we will not part till then but fish to morrow and sup together and the next day every man leave fishing and fall to his business Venator Tis a match and I will provide you a song or a catch against then too which shall give some addition of mirth to the company for we will be civil and as merry as beggars Piscator Tis a match my masters Let s e en say grace and turn to the fire drink the other cup to whet our whistles and so sing away all sad thoughts Come on my masters who begins I think it is best to draw cuts and avoid contention Peter It is a match Look the shortest cut falls to Coridon Coridon Well then I will begin for I hate contention Coridon s song Oh the sweet contentment The countryman doth find Heigh trolollie lollie foe Heigh trolollie lee That quiet contemplation Possesseth all my mind Then care away And wend along with me For Courts are full of flattery As hath too oft been tried Heigh trolollie lollie foe et cetera The city full of wantonness And both are full of pride Then care away et cetera But oh the honest countryman Speaks truly from his heart Heigh trolollie lollie foe et cetera His pride is in his tillage His horses and his cart Then care away et cetera Our cloathing is good sheep skins Grey russet for our wives Heigh trolollie lollie loe et cetera Tis warmth and not gay cloathing That doth prolong our lives Then care away et cetera The ploughman tho he labour hard Yet on the holy day Heigh trolollie lollie foe et cetera No emperor so merrily Does pass his time away Then care away et cetera To recompense our tillage The heavens afford us showers Heigh trolollie lollie foe et cetera And for our sweet refreshment The earth affords us bowers Then care away et cetera The cuckow and the nightingale Full merrily do sing Heigh trolollie lollie foe et cetera And with their pleasant roundelays Bid welcome to the spring Then care away et cetera This is not half the happiness The countryman enjoys Heigh trolollie lollie foe et cetera Though others think they have as much Yet he that says so lies Then come away Turn countrymen with me Jo Chalkhill Piscator Well sung Coridon this song was sung with mettle and it was choicely fitted to the occasion I shall love you for it as long as I know you I would you were a brother of the angle for a companion that is cheerful and free from swearing and scurrilous discourse is worth gold I love such mirth as does not make friends ashamed to look upon one another next morning nor men that cannot well bear it to repent the money they spend when they be warmed with drink And take this for a rule you may pick out such times and such companies that you make yourselves merrier for a little than a great deal of money for Tis the company and not the charge that makes the feast and such a companion you prove I thank you for it But I will not compliment you out of the debt that I owe you and therefore I will begin my song and wish it may be so well liked The Angler s song As inward love breeds outward talk The hound some praise and some the hawk Some better pleas d with private sport Use tennis some a mistress court But these delights I neither wish Nor envy while I freely fish Who hunts doth oft in danger ride Who hawks lures oft both far and wide Who uses games shall often prove A loser but who falls in love Is fetter d in fond Cupid s snare My angle breeds me no such care Of recreation there is none So free as fishing is alone All other pastimes do no less Than mind and body both possess My hand alone my work can do So I can fish and study too I care not I to fish in seas Fresh rivers best my mind do please Whose sweet calm course I contemplate And seek in life to imitate In civil bounds I fain would keep And for my past offences weep And when the timorous Trout I wait To take and he devours my bait How poor a thing sometimes I find Will captivate a greedy mind And when none bite I praise the wise Whom vain allurements ne er surprise But yet though while I fish I fast I make good fortune my repast And thereunto my friend invite In whom I more than that delight Who is more welcome to my dish Than to my angle was my fish As well content no prize to take As use of taken prize to make For so our Lord was pleased when He fishers made fishers of men Where which is in no other game A man may fish and praise his name The first men that our Saviour dear Did choose to wait upon him here Blest fishers were and fish the last Food was that he on earth did taste I therefore strive to follow those Whom he to follow him hath chose W B Coridon Well sung brother you have paid your debt in good coin We anglers are all beholden to the good man that made this song come hostess give us more ale and let s drink to him And now let s every one go to bed that we may rise early but first let s pay our reckoning for I will have nothing to hinder me in the morning for my purpose is to prevent the sun rising Peter A match Come Coridon you are to be my bed fellow I know brother you and your scholar will lie together But where shall we meet to morrow night for my friend Coridon and I will go up the water towards Ware Piscator And my scholar and I will go down towards Waltham Coridon Then let s meet here for here are fresh sheets that smell of lavender and I am sure we cannot expect better meat or better usage in any place Peter Tis a match Good night to everybody Piscator And so say I Venator And so say I The fourth day Piscator Good morrow good hostess I see my brother Peter is still in bed Come give my scholar and me a morning drink and a bit of meat to breakfast and be sure to get a dish of meat or two against supper for we shall come home as hungry as hawks Come scholar let s be going Venator Well now good master as we walk towards the river give me direction according to your promise how I shall fish for a Trout Piscator My honest scholar I will take this very convenient opportunity to do it The Trout is usually caught with a worm or a minnow which some call a peek or with a fly viz either a natural or an artificial fly concerning which three I will give you some observations and directions And first for worms Of these there be very many sorts some breed only in the earth as the earth worm others of or amongst plants as the dug worm and others breed either out of excrements or in the bodies of living creatures as in the horns of sheep or deer or some of dead flesh as the maggot or gentle and others Now these be most of them particularly good for particular fishes But for the Trout the dew worm which some also call the lob worm and the brandling are the chief and especially the first for a great Trout and the latter for a less There be also of lob worms some called squirrel tails a worm that has a red head a streak down the back and a broad tail which are noted to be the best because they are the toughest and most lively and live longest in the water for you are to know that a dead worm is but a dead bait and like to catch nothing compared to a lively quick stirring worm And for a brandling he is usually found in an old dunghill or some very rotten place near to it but most usually in cow dung or hog s dung rather than horse dung which is somewhat too hot and dry for that worm But the best of them are to be found in the bark of the tanners which they cast up in heaps after they have used it about their leather There are also divers other kinds of worms which for colour and shape alter even as the ground out of which they are got as the marsh worm the tag tail the flag worm the dock worm the oak worm the gilt tail the twachel or lob worm which of all others is the most excellent bait for a salmon and too many to name even as many sorts as some think there be of several herbs or shrubs or of several kinds of birds in the air of which I shall say no more but tell you that what worms soever you fish with are the better for being well scoured that is long kept before they be used and in case you have not been so provident then the way to cleanse and scour them quickly is to put them all night in water if they be lob worms and then put them into your bag with fennel But you must not put your brandlings above an hour in water and then put them into fennel for sudden use but if you have time and purpose to keep them long then they be best preserved in an earthen pot with good store of moss which is to be fresh every three or four days in summer and every week or eight days in winter or at least the moss taken from them and clean washed and wrung betwixt your hands till it be dry and then put it to them again And when your worms especially the brandling begins to be sick and lose of his bigness then you may recover him by putting a little milk or cream about a spoonful in a day into them by drops on the moss and if there be added to the cream an egg beaten and boiled in it then it will both fatten and preserve them long And note that when the knot which is near to the middle of the brandling begins to swell then he is sick and if he be not well looked to is near dying And for moss you are to note that there be divers kinds of it which I could name to you but I will only tell you that that which is likest a buck s horn is the best except it be soft white moss which grows on some heaths and is hard to be found And note that in a very dry time when you are put to an extremity for worms walnut tree leaves squeezed into water or salt in water to make it bitter or salt and then that water poured on the ground where you shall see worms are used to rise in the night will make them to appear above ground presently And you may take notice some say that camphire put into your bag with your moss and worms gives them a strong and so tempting a smell that the fish fare the worse and you the better for it And now I shall shew you how to bait your hook with a worm so as shall prevent you from much trouble and the loss of many a hook too when you fish for a Trout with a running line that is to say when you fish for him by hand at the ground I will direct you in this as plainly as I can that you may not mistake Suppose it be a big lob worm put your hook into him somewhat above the middle and out again a little below the middle having so done draw your worm above the arming of your hook but note that at the entering of your hook it must not be at the head end of the worm but at the tail end of him that the point of your hook may come out toward the head end and having drawn him above the arming of your hook then put the point of your hook again into the very head of the worm till it come near to the place where the point of the hook first came out and then draw back that part of the worm that was above the shank or arming of your hook and so fish with it And if you mean to fish with two worms then put the second on before you turn back the hook s head of the first worm You cannot lose above two or three worms before you attain to what I direct you and having attained it you will find it very useful and thank me for it for you will run on the ground without tangling Now for the Minnow or Penk he is not easily found and caught till March or in April for then he appears first in the river nature having taught him to shelter and hide himself in the winter in ditches that be near to the river and there both to hide and keep himself warm in the mud or in the weeds which rot not so soon as in a running river in which place if he were in winter the distempered floods that are usually in that season would suffer him to take no rest but carry him headlong to mills and weirs to his confusion And of these Minnows first you are to know that the biggest size is not the best and next that the middle size and the whitest are the best and then you are to know that your minnow must be so put on your hook that it must turn round when tis drawn against the stream and that it may turn nimbly you must put it on a big sized hook as I shall now direct you which is thus Put your hook in at his mouth and out at his gill then having drawn your hook two or three inches beyond or through his gill put it again into his mouth and the point and beard out at his tail and then tie the hook and his tail about very neatly with a white thread which will make it the apter to turn quick in the water that done pull back that part of your line which was slack when you did put your hook into the minnow the second time I say pull that part of your line back so that it shall fasten the head so that the body of the minnow shall be almost straight on your hook this done try how it will turn by drawing it across the water or against a stream and if it do not turn nimbly then turn the tail a little to the right or left hand and try again till it turn quick for if not you are in danger to catch nothing for know that it is impossible that it should turn too quick And you are yet to know that in case you want a minnow then a small loach or a stickle bag or any other small fish that will turn quick will serve as well And you are yet to know that you may salt them and by that means keep them ready and fit for use three or four days or longer and that of salt bay salt is the best And here let me tell you what many old anglers know right well that at some times and in some waters a minnow is not to be got and therefore let me tell you I have which I will shew to you an artificial minnow that will catch a Trout as well as an artificial fly and it was made by a handsome woman that had a fine hand and a live minnow lying by her the mould or body of the minnow was cloth and wrought upon or over it thus with a needle the back of it with very sad French green silk and paler green silk towards the belly shadowed as perfectly as you can imagine just as you see a minnow the belly was wrought also with a needle and it was a part of it white silk and another part of it with silver thread the tail and fins were of a quill which was shaven thin the eyes were of two little black beads and the head was so shadowed and all of it so curiously wrought and so exactly dissembled that it would beguile any sharp sighted Trout in a swift stream And this minnow I will now shew you look here it is and if you like it lend it you to have two or three made by it for they be easily carried about an angler and be of excellent use for note that a large Trout will come as fiercely at a minnow as the highest mettled hawk doth seize on a partridge or a greyhound on a hare I have been told that one hundred and sixty minnows have been found in a Trout s belly either the Trout had devoured so many or the miller that gave it a friend of mine had forced them down his throat after he had taken him Now for Flies which is the third bait wherewith Trouts are usually taken You are to know that there are so many sorts of flies as there be of fruits I will name you but some of them as the dun fly the stone fly the red fly the moor fly the tawny fly the shell fly the cloudy or blackish fly the flag fly the vine fly there be of flies caterpillars and canker flies and bear flies and indeed too many either for me to name or for you to remember And their breeding is so various and wonderful that I might easily amaze myself and tire you in a relation of them And yet I will exercise your promised patience by saying a little of the caterpillar or the palmer fly or worm that by them you may guess what a work it were in a discourse but to run over those very many flies worms and little living creatures with which the sun and summer adorn and beautify the river banks and meadows both for the recreation and contemplation of us anglers pleasures which I think myself enjoy more than any other man that is not of my profession Pliny holds an opinion that many have their birth or being from a dew that in the spring falls upon the leaves of trees and that some kinds of them are from a dew left upon herbs or flowers and others from a dew left upon coleworts or cabbages all which kinds of dews being thickened and condensed are by the sun s generative heat most of them hatched and in three days made living creatures and these of several shapes and colours some being hard and tough some smooth and soft some are horned in their head some in their tail some have none some have hair some none some have sixteen feet some less and some have none but as our Topsel hath with great diligence observed those which have none move upon the earth or upon broad leaves their motion being not unlike to the waves of the sea Some of them he also observes to be bred of the eggs of other caterpillars and that those in their time turn to be butterflies and again that their eggs turn the following year to be caterpillars And some affirm that every plant has its particular fly or caterpillar which it breeds and feeds I have seen and may therefore affirm it a green caterpillar or worm as big as a small peascod which had fourteen legs eight on the belly four under the neck and two near the tail It was found on a hedge of privet and was taken thence and put into a large box and a little branch or two of privet put to it on which I saw it feed as sharply as a dog gnaws a bone it lived thus five or six days and thrived and changed the colour two or three times but by some neglect in the keeper of it it then died and did not turn to a fly but if it had lived it had doubtless turned to one of those flies that some call Flies of prey which those that walk by the rivers may in summer see fasten on smaller flies and I think make them their food And tis observable that as there be these flies of prey which be very large so there be others very little created I think only to feed them and breed out of I know not what whose life they say nature intended not to exceed an hour and yet that life is thus made shorter by other flies or accident Tis endless to tell you what the curious searchers into nature s productions have observed of these worms and flies but yet I shall tell you what Aldrovandus our Topsel and others say of the Palmer worm or Caterpillar that whereas others content themselves to feed on particular herbs or leaves for most think those very leaves that gave them life and shape give them a particular feeding and nourishment and that upon them they usually abide yet he observes that this is called a pilgrim or palmer worm for his very wandering life and various food not contenting himself as others do with any one certain place for his abode nor any certain kind of herb or flower for his feeding but will boldly and disorderly wander up and down and not endure to be kept to a diet or fixt to a particular place Nay the very colours of caterpillars are as one has observed very elegant and beautiful I shall for a taste of the rest describe one of them which I will some time the next month shew you feeding on a willow tree and you shall find him punctually to answer this very description his lips and mouth somewhat yellow his eyes black as jet his forehead purple his feet and hinder parts green his tail two forked and black the whole body stained with a kind of red spots which run along the neck and shoulder blade not unlike the form of saint Andrew s cross or the letter X made thus crosswise and a white line drawn down his back to his tail all which add much beauty to his whole body And it is to me observable that at a fixed age this caterpillar gives over to eat and towards winter comes to be covered over with a strange shell or crust called an aurelia and so lives a kind of dead life without eating all the winter And as others of several kinds turn to be several kinds of flies and vermin the Spring following so this caterpillar then turns to be a painted butterfly Come come my scholar you see the river stops our morning walk and I will also here stop my discourse only as we sit down under this honeysuckle hedge whilst I look a line to fit the rod that our brother Peter hath lent you I shall for a little confirmation of what I have said repeat the observation of Du Bartas God not contented to each kind to give And to infuse the virtue generative Made by his wisdom many creatures breed Of lifeless bodies without Venus deed So the cold humour breeds the Salamander Who in effect like to her birth s commander With child with hundred winters with her touch Quencheth the fire tho glowing ne er so much So of the fire in burning furnace springs The fly Pyrausta with the flaming wings Without the fire it dies within it joys Living in that which each shine else destroys So slow Bootes underneath him sees In th icy isles those goslings hatch d of trees Whose fruitful leaves falling into the water Are turn d they say to living fowls soon after So rotten sides of broken ships do change To barnacles O transformation strange Twas first a green tree then a gallant hull Lately a mushroom now a flying gull Venator O my good master this morning walk has been spent to my great pleasure and wonder but I pray when shall I have your direction how to make artificial flies like to those that the Trout loves best and also how to use them Piscator My honest scholar it is now past five of the clock we will fish till nine and then go to breakfast Go you to yonder sycamore tree and hide your bottle of drink under the hollow root of it for about that time and in that place we will make a brave breakfast with a piece of powdered beef and a radish or two that I have in my fish bag we shall I warrant you make a good honest wholesome hungry breakfast And I will then give you direction for the making and using of your flies and in the meantime there is your rod and line and my advice is that you fish as you see me do and let s try which can catch the first fish Venator I thank you master I will observe and practice your direction as far as I am able Piscator Look you scholar you see I have hold of a good fish I now see it is a Trout I pray put that net under him and touch not my line for if you do then we break all Well done scholar I thank you Now for another Trust me I have another bite Come scholar come lay down your rod and help me to land this as you did the other So now we shall be sure to have a good dish of fish for supper Venator I am glad of that but I have no fortune sure master yours is a better rod and better tackling Piscator Nay then take mine and I will fish with yours Look you scholar I have another Come do as you did before And now I have a bite at another Oh me he has broke all there s half a line and a good hook lost Venator Ay and a good Trout too Piscator Nay the Trout is not lost for pray take notice no man can lose what he never had Venator Master I can neither catch with the first nor second angle I have no fortune Piscator Look you scholar I have yet another And now having caught three brace of Trouts I will tell you a short tale as we walk towards our breakfast A scholar a preacher I should say that was to preach to procure the approbation of a parish that he might be their lecturer had got from his fellow pupil the copy of a sermon that was first preached with great commendation by him that composed it and though the borrower of it preached it word for word as it was at first yet it was utterly disliked as it was preached by the second to his congregation which the sermon borrower complained of to the lender of it and was thus answered I lent you indeed my fiddle but not my fiddle stick for you are to know that every one cannot make musick with my words which are fitted for my own mouth And so my scholar you are to know that as the ill pronunciation or ill accenting of words in a sermon spoils it so the ill carriage of your line or not fishing even to a foot in a right place makes you lose your labour and you are to know that though you have my fiddle that is my very rod and tacklings with which you see I catch fish yet you have not my fiddle stick that is you yet have not skill to know how to carry your hand and line nor how to guide it to a right place and this must be taught you for you are to remember I told you Angling is an art either by practice or a long observation or both But take this for a rule When you fish for a Trout with a worm let your line have so much and not more lead than will fit the stream in which you fish that is to say more in a great troublesome stream than in a smaller that is quieter as near as may be so much as will sink the bait to the bottom and keep it still in motion and not more But now let s say grace and fall to breakfast What say you scholar to the providence of an old angler Does not this meat taste well and was not this place well chosen to eat it for this sycamore tree will shade us from the sun s heat Venator All excellent good and my stomach excellent good too And now I remember and find that true which devout Lessius says that poor men and those that fast often have much more pleasure in eating than rich men and gluttons that always feed before their stomachs are empty of their last meat and call for more for by that means they rob themselves of that pleasure that hunger brings to poor men And I do seriously approve of that saying of yours that you had rather be a civil well governed well grounded temperate poor angler than a drunken lord but I hope there is none such However I am certain of this that I have been at many very costly dinners that have not afforded me half the content that this has done for which I thank God and you And now good master proceed to your promised direction for making and ordering my artificial fly Piscator My honest scholar I will do it for it is a debt due unto you by my promise And because you shall not think yourself more engaged to me than indeed you really are I will freely give you such directions as were lately given to me by an ingenious brother of the angle an honest man and a most excellent fly fisher You are to note that there are twelve kinds of artificial made Flies to angle with upon the top of the water Note by the way that the fittest season of using these is in a blustering windy day when the waters are so troubled that the natural fly cannot be seen or rest upon them The first is the dun fly in March the body is made of dun wool the wings of the partridge s feathers The second is another dun fly the body of black wool and the wings made of the black drake s feathers and of the feathers under his tail The third is the stone fly in April the body is made of black wool made yellow under the wings and under the tail and so made with wings of the drake The fourth is the ruddy fly in the beginning of May the body made of red wool wrapt about with black silk and the feathers are the wings of the drake with the feathers of a red capon also which hang dangling on his sides next to the tail The fifth is the yellow or greenish fly in May likewise the body made of yellow wool and the wings made of the red cock s hackle or tail The sixth is the black fly in May also the body made of black wool and lapt about with the herle of a peacock s tail the wings are made of the wings of a brown capon with his blue feathers in his head The seventh is the sad yellow fly in June the body is made of black wool with a yellow list on either side and the wings taken off the wings of a buzzard bound with black braked hemp The eighth is the moorish fly made with the body of duskish wool and the wings made of the blackish mail of the drake The ninth is the t fly fly good until the middle of June the body made of tawny wool the wings made contrary one against the other made of the whitish mail of the wild drake The tenth is the wasp fly in July the body made of black wool lapt about with yellow silk the wings made of the feathers of the drake or of the buzzard The eleventh is the shell fly good in mid July the body made of greenish wool lapt about with the herle of a peacock s tail and the wings made of the wings of the buzzard The twelfth is the dark drake fly good in August the body made with black wool lapt about with black silk his wings are made with the mail of the black drake with a black head Thus have you a jury of flies likely to betray and condemn all the Trouts in the river I shall next give you some other directions for fly fishing such as are given by mister Thomas Barker a gentleman that hath spent much time in fishing but I shall do it with a little variation First let your rod be light and very gentle I take the best to be of two pieces And let not your line exceed especially for three or four links next to the hook I say not exceed three or four hairs at the most though you may fish a little stronger above in the upper part of your line but if you can attain to angle with one hair you shall have more rises and catch more fish Now you must be sure not to cumber yourself with too long a line as most do And before you begin to angle cast to have the wind on your back and the sun if it shines to be before you and to fish down the stream and carry the point or top of your rod downward by which means the shadow of yourself and rod too will be the least offensive to the fish for the sight of any shade amazes the fish and spoils your sport of which you must take great care In the middle of March till which time a man should not in honesty catch a Trout or in April it the weather be dark or a little windy or cloudy the best fishing is with the palmer worm of which I last spoke to you but of these there be divers kinds or at least of divers colours these and the May fly are the ground of all fly angling which are to be thus made First you must arm your hook with the line in the inside of it then take your scissors and cut so much of a brown mallard s feather as in your own reason will make the wings of it you having withal regard to the bigness or littleness of your hook then lay the outmost part of your feather next to your hook then the point of your feather next the shank of your hook and having so done whip it three or four times about the hook with the same silk with which your hook was armed and having made the silk fast take the hackle of a cock or capon s neck or a plover s top which is usually better take off the one side of the feather and then take the hackle silk or crewel gold or silver thread make these fast at the bent of the hook that is to say below your arming then you must take the hackle the silver or gold thread and work it up to the wings shifting or still removing your finger as you turn the silk about the hook and still looking at every stop or turn that your gold or what materials soever you make your fly of do lie right and neatly and if you find they do so then when you have made the head make all fast and then work your hackle up to the head and make that fast and then with a needle or pin divide the wing into two and then with the arming silk whip it about cross ways betwixt the wings and then with your thumb you must turn the point of the feather towards the bent of the hook and then work three or four times about the shank of the hook and then view the proportion and if all be neat and to your liking fasten I confess no direction can be given to make a man of a dull capacity able to make a fly well and yet I know this with a little practice will help an ingenious angler in a good degree But to see a fly made by an artist in that kind is the best teaching to make it And then an ingenious angler may walk by the river and mark what flies fall on the water that day and catch one of them if he sees the Trouts leap at a fly of that kind and then having always hooks ready hung with him and having a bag always with him with bear s hair or the hair of a brown or sad coloured heifer hackles of a cock or capon several coloured silk and crewel to make the body of the fly the feathers of a drake s head black or brown sheep s wool or hog s wool or hair thread of gold and of silver silk of several colours especially sad coloured to make the fly s head and there be also other coloured feathers both of little birds and of speckled fowl I say having those with him in a bag and trying to make a fly though he miss at first yet shall he at last hit it better even to such a perfection as none can well teach him And if he hit to make his fly right and have the luck to hit also where there is store of Trouts a dark day and a right wind he will catch such store of them as will encourage him to grow more and more in love with the art of fly making Venator But my loving master if any wind will not serve then I wish I were in Lapland to buy a good wind of one of the honest witches that sell so many winds there and so cheap Piscator Marry scholar but I would not be there nor indeed from under this tree for look how it begins to rain and by the clouds if I mistake not we shall presently have a smoking shower and therefore sit close this sycamore tree will shelter us and I will tell you as they shall come into my mind more observations of fly fishing for a Trout But first for the wind you are to take notice that of the winds the south wind is said to be best One observes that when the wind is south It blows your bait into a fish s mouth Next to that the west wind is believed to be the best and having told you that the east wind is the worst I need not tell you which wind is the best in the third degree and yet as Solomon observes that he that considers the wind shall never sow so he that busies his head too much about them if the weather be not made extreme cold by an east wind shall be a little superstitious for as it is observed by some that there is no good horse of a bad colour so I have observed that if it be a cloudy day and not extreme cold let the wind sit in what corner it will and do its worst I heed it not And yet take this for a rule that I would willingly fish standing on the lee shore and you are to take notice that the fish lies or swims nearer the bottom and in deeper water in winter than in summer and also nearer the bottom in any cold day and then gets nearest the lee side of the water But I promised to tell you more of the Fly fishing for a Trout which I may have time enough to do for you see it rains May butter First for a Mayfly you may make his body with greenish coloured crewel or willowish colour darkening it in most places with waxed silk or ribbed with black hair or some of them ribbed with silver thread and such wings for the colour as you see the fly to have at that season nay at that very day on the water Or you may make the Oak fly with an orange tawny and black ground and the brown of a mallard s feather for the wings And you are to know that these two are most excellent flies that is the May fly and the Oak fly And let me again tell you that you keep as far from the water as you can possibly whether you fish with a fly or worm and fish down the stream And when you fish with a fly if it be possible let no part of your line touch the water but your fly only and be still moving your fly upon the water or casting it into the water you yourself being also always moving down the stream mister Barker commends several sorts of the palmer flies not only those ribbed with silver and gold but others that have their bodies all made of black or some with red and a red hackle You may also make the Hawthorn fly which is all black and not big but very small the smaller the better Or the oak fly the body of which is orange colour and black crewel with a brown wing Or a fly made with a peacock s feather is excellent in a bright day you must be sure you want not in your magazine bag the peacock s feather and grounds of such wool and crewel as will make the grasshopper And note that usually the smallest flies are the best and note also that the light fly does usually make most sport in a dark day and the darkest and least fly in a bright or clear day and lastly note that you are to repair upon any occasion to your magazine bag and upon any occasion vary and make them lighter or sadder according to your fancy or the day And now I shall tell you that the fishing with a natural fly is excellent and affords much pleasure They may be found thus the May fly usually in and about that month near to the river side especially against rain the Oak fly on the butt or body of an oak or ash from the beginning of May to the end of August it is a brownish fly and easy to be so found and stands usually with his head downward that is to say towards the root of the tree the small black fly or Hawthorn fly is to be had on any hawthorn bush after the leaves be come forth With these and a short line as I shewed to angle for a Chub you may cape or cop and also with a grasshopper behind a tree or in any deep hole still making it to move on the top of the water as if it were alive and still keeping yourself out of sight you shall certainly have sport if there be Trouts yea in a hot day but especially in the evening of a hot day you will have sport And now scholar my direction for fly fishing is ended with this shower for it has done raining And now look about you and see how pleasantly that meadow looks nay and the earth smells so sweetly too Come let me tell you what holy mister Herbert says of such days and flowers as these and then we will thank God that we enjoy them and walk to the river and sit down quietly and try to catch the other place of Trouts Sweet day so cool so calm so bright The bridal of the earth and sky Sweet dews shall weep thy fall to night For thou must die Sweet rose whose hue angry and brave Bids the rash gazer wipe his eye Thy root is ever in its grave And thou must die Sweet spring full of sweet days and roses A box where sweets compacted lie My music shews you have your closes And all must die Only a sweet and virtuous soul Like season d timber never gives But when the whole world turns to coal Then chiefly lives Venator I thank you good master for your good direction for fly fishing and for the sweet enjoyment of the pleasant day which is so far spent without offence to God or man and I thank you for the sweet close of your discourse with mister Herbert s verses who I have heard loved angling and I do the rather believe it because he had a spirit suitable to anglers and to those primitive Christians that you love and have so much commended Piscator Well my loving scholar and I am pleased to know that you are so well pleased with my direction and discourse And since you like these verses of mister Herbert s so well let me tell you what a reverend and learned divine that professes to imitate him and has indeed done so most excellently hath writ of our book of Common Prayer which I know you will like the better because he is a friend of mine and I am sure no enemy to angling What Pray r by th book and Common Yes Why not The spirit of grace And supplication Is not left free alone For time and place But manner too to read or speak by rote Is all alike to him that prays In s heart what with his mouth he says They that in private by themselves alone Do pray may take What liberty they please In chusing of the ways Wherein to make Their soul s most intimate affections known To him that sees in secret when Th are most conceal d from other men But he that unto others leads the way In public prayer Should do it so As all that hear may know They need not fear To tune their hearts unto his tongue and say Amen not doubt they were betray d To blaspheme when they meant to have pray d Devotion will add life unto the letter And why should not That which authority Prescribes esteemed be Advantage got If th prayer be good the commoner the better Prayer in the Church s words as well As sense of all prayers bears the bell And now scholar I think it will be time to repair to our angle rods which we left in the water to fish for themselves and you shall choose which shall be yours and it is an even lay one of them catches And let me tell you this kind of fishing with a dead rod and laying night hooks are like putting money to use for they both work for the owners when they do nothing but sleep or eat or rejoice as you know we have done this last hour and sat as quietly and as free from cares under this sycamore as Virgil s Tityrus and his Meliboeus did under their broad beech tree No life my honest scholar no life so happy and so pleasant as the life of a well governed angler for when the lawyer is swallowed up with business and the statesman is preventing or contriving plots then we sit on cowslip banks hear the birds sing and possess ourselves in as much quietness as these silent silver streams which we now see glide so quietly by us Indeed my good scholar we may say of angling as doctor Boteler said of strawberries Doubtless God could have made a better berry but doubtless God never did and so if I might be judge God never did make a more calm quiet innocent recreation than angling I ll tell you scholar when I sat last on this primrose bank and looked down these meadows I thought of them as Charles the emperor did of the city of Florence That they were too pleasant to be looked on but only on holy days As I then sat on this very grass I turned my present thoughts into verse twas a Wish which I ll repeat to you The Angler s wish I in these flowery meads would be These crystal streams should solace me To whose harmonious bubbling noise I with my Angle would rejoice Sit here and see the turtle dove Court his chaste mate to acts of love Or on that bank feel the west wind Breathe health and plenty please my mind To see sweet dew drops kiss these flowers And then washed off by April showers Here hear my Kenna sing a song There see a blackbird feed her young Or a leverock build her nest Here give my weary spirits rest And raise my low pitch d thoughts above Earth or what poor mortals love Thus free from law suits and the noise Of princes courts I would rejoice Or with my Bryan and a book Loiter long days near Shawford brook There sit by him and eat my meat There see the sun both rise and set There bid good morning to next day There meditate my time away And Angle on and beg to have A quiet passage to a welcome grave When I had ended this composure I left this place and saw a brother of the angle sit under that honeysuckle hedge one that will prove worth your acquaintance I sat down by him and presently we met with an accidental piece of merriment which I will relate to you for it rains still On the other side of this very hedge sat a gang of gypsies and near to them sat a gang of beggars The gypsies were then to divide all the money that had been got that week either by stealing linen or poultry or by fortune telling or legerdemain or indeed by any other sleights and secrets belonging to their mysterious government And the sum that was got that week proved to be but twenty and some odd shillings The odd money was agreed to be distributed amongst the poor of their own corporation and for the remaining twenty shillings that was to be divided unto four gentlemen gypsies according to their several degrees in their commonwealth And the first or chiefest gypsy was by consent to have a third part of the twenty shillings which all men know is sixs eightd The second was to have a fourth part of the twentys which all men know to be fives The third was to have a fifth part of the twentys which all men know to be fours The fourth and last gypsy was to have a sixth part of the twentys which all men know to be threes fourd As for example three times sixs eightd are twentys And so is four times fives are twentys And so is five times fours are twentys And so is six times threes fourd are twentys And yet he that divided the money was so very a gypsy that though he gave to every one these said sums yet he kept one shilling of it for himself As for example s d six eight five zero four zero three four make but nineteen zero But now you shall know that when the four gypsies saw that he had got one shilling by dividing the money though not one of them knew any reason to demand more yet like lords and courtiers every gypsy envied him that was the gainer and wrangled with him and every one said the remaining shilling belonged to him and so they fell to so high a contest about it as none that knows the faithfulness of one gypsy to another will easily believe only we that have lived these last twenty years are certain that money has been able to do much mischief However the gypsies were too wise to go to law and did therefore choose their choice friends Rook and Shark and our late English Gusman to be their arbitrators and umpires And so they left this honeysuckle hedge and went to tell fortunes and cheat and get more money and lodging in the next village When these were gone we heard as high a contention amongst the beggars whether it was easiest to rip a cloak or to unrip a cloak One beggar affirmed it was all one but that was denied by asking her If doing and undoing were all one Then another said twas easiest to unrip a cloak for that was to let it alone but she was answered by asking her how she unript it if she let it alone and she confess herself mistaken These and twenty such like questions were proposed and answered with as much beggarly logick and earnestness as was ever heard to proceed from the mouth of the pertinacious schismatick and sometimes all the beggars whose number was neither more nor less than the poets nine muses talked all together about this ripping and unripping and so loud that not one heard what the other said but at last one beggar craved audience and told them that old father Clause whom Ben Jonson in his Beggar s Bush created King of their corporation was to lodge at an ale house called Catch her by the way not far from Waltham Cross and in the high road towards London and he therefore desired them to spend no more time about that and such like questions but refer all to father Clause at night for he was an upright judge and in the meantime draw cuts what song should be next sung and who should sing it They all agreed to the motion and the lot fell to her that was the youngest and veriest virgin of the company And she sung Frank Davison s song which he made forty years ago and all the others of the company joined to sing the burthen with her The ditty was this but first the burthen Bright shines the sun play Beggars play Here s scraps enough to serve to day What noise of viols is so sweet As when our merry clappers ring What mirth doth want where Beggars meet A Beggar s life is for a King Eat drink and play sleep when we list Go where we will so stocks be mist Bright shines the sun play Beggars play Here s scraps enough to serve to day The world is ours and ours alone For we alone have world at will We purchase not all is our own Both fields and streets we Beggars fill Nor care to get nor fear to keep Did ever break a Beggar s sleep Play Beggars play play Beggars play Here s scraps enough to serve to day A hundred head of black and white Upon our gowns securely feed If any dare his master bite He dies therefore as sure as creed Thus Beggars lord it as they please And only Beggars live at ease Bright shines the sun play Beggars play Here s scraps enough to serve to day Venator I thank you good master for this piece of merriment and this song which was well humoured by the maker and well remembered by you Piscator But I pray forget not the catch which you promised to make against night for our countryman honest Coridon will expect your catch and my song which I must be forced to patch up for it is so long since I learnt it that I have forgot a part of it But come now it hath done raining let s stretch our legs a little in a gentle walk to the river and try what interest our angles will pay us for lending them so long to be used by the Trouts lent them indeed like usurers for our profit and their destruction Venator Oh me look you master a fish a fish Oh alas master I have lost her Piscator Ay marry Sir that was a good fish indeed if I had had the luck to have taken up that rod then tis twenty to one he should not have broken my line by running to the rod s end as you suffered him I would have held him within the bent of my rod unless he had been fellow to the great Trout that is near an ell long which was of such a length and depth that he had his picture drawn and now is to be seen at mine host Rickabie s at the George in Ware and it may be by giving that very great Trout the rod that is by casting it to him into the water I might have caught him at the long run for so I use always to do when I meet with an over grown fish and you will learn to do so too hereafter for I tell you scholar fishing is an art or at least it is an art to catch fish Venator But master I have heard that the great Trout you speak of is a Salmon Piscator Trust me scholar I know not what to say to it There are many country people that believe hares change sexes every year and there be very many learned men think so too for in their dissecting them they find many reasons to incline them to that belief And to make the wonder seem yet less that hares change sexes note that doctor Mer Casaubon affirms in his book Of credible and incredible things that Gasper Peucerus a learned physician tells us of a people that once a year turn wolves partly in shape and partly in conditions And so whether this were a Salmon when he came into fresh water and his not returning into the sea hath altered him to another colour or kind I am not able to say but I am certain he hath all the signs of being a Trout both for his shape colour and spots and yet many think he is not Venator But master will this Trout which I had hold of die for it is like he hath the hook in his belly Piscator I will tell you scholar that unless the hook be fast in his very gorge tis more than probable he will live and a little time with the help of the water will rust the hook and it will in time wear away as the gravel doth in the horse hoof which only leaves a false quarter And now scholar let s go to my rod Look you scholar I have a fish too but it proves a logger headed Chub and this is not much amiss for this will pleasure some poor body as we go to our lodging to meet our brother Peter and honest Coridon Come now bait your hook again and lay it into the water for it rains again and we will even retire to the Sycamore tree and there I will give you more directions concerning fishing for I would fain make you an artist Venator Yes good master I pray let it be so Piscator Well scholar now that we are sate down and are at ease I shall tell you a little more of Trout fishing before I speak of the Salmon which I purpose shall be next and then of the Pike or Luce You are to know there is night as well as day fishing for a Trout and that in the night the best Trouts come out of their holes And the manner of taking them is on the top of the water with a great lob or garden worm or rather two which you are to fish with in a stream where the waters run somewhat quietly for in a stream the bait will not be so well discerned I say in a quiet or dead place near to some swift there draw your bait over the top of the water to and fro and if there be a good Trout in the hole he will take it especially if the night be dark for then he is bold and lies near the top of the water watching the motion of any frog or water rat or mouse that swims betwixt him and the sky these he hunts after if he sees the water but wrinkle or move in one of these dead holes where these great old Trouts usually lie near to their holds for you are to note that the great old Trout is both subtle and fearful and lies close all day and does not usually stir out of his hold but lies in it as close in the day as the timorous hare does in her form for the chief feeding of either is seldom in the day but usually in the night and then the great Trout feeds very boldly And you must fish for him with a strong line and not a little hook and let him have time to gorge your hook for he does not usually forsake it as he oft will in the day fishing And if the night be not dark then fish so with an artificial fly of a light colour and at the snap nay he will sometimes rise at a dead mouse or a piece of cloth or anything that seems to swim across the water or to be in motion This is a choice way but I have not oft used it because it is void of the pleasures that such days as these that we two now enjoy afford an angler And you are to know that in Hampshire which I think exceeds all England for swift shallow clear pleasant brooks and store of Trouts they used to catch Trouts in the night by the light of a torch or straw which when they have discovered they strike with a Trout spear or other ways This kind of way they catch very many but I would not believe it till I was an eye witness of it nor do I like it now I have seen it Venator But master do not Trouts see us in the night Piscator Yes and hear and smell too both then and in the day time for Gesner observes the Otter smells a fish forty furlongs off him in the water and that it may be true seems to be affirmed by Sir Francis Bacon in the eighth century of his Natural History who there proves that waters may be the medium of sounds by demonstrating it thus That if you knock two stones together very deep under the water those that stand on a bank near to that place may hear the noise without any diminution of it by the water He also offers the like experiment concerning the letting an anchor fall by a very long cable or rope on a rock or the sand within the sea And this being so well observed and demonstrated as it is by that learned man has made me to believe that Eels unbed themselves and stir at the noise of thunder and not only as some think by the motion or stirring of the earth which is occasioned by that thunder And this reason of Sir Francis Bacon has made me crave pardon of one that I laughed at for affirming that he knew Carps come to a certain place in a pond to be fed at the ringing of a bell or the beating of a drum And however it shall be a rule for me to make as little noise as I can when I am fishing until Sir Francis Bacon be confuted which I shall give any man leave to do And lest you may think him singular in this opinion I will tell you this seems to be believed by our learned Doctor Hakewill who in his Apology of God s power and providence quotes Pliny to report that one of the emperors had particular fish ponds and in them several fish that appeared and came when they were called by their particular names And saint James tells us that all things in the sea have been tamed by mankind And Pliny tells us that Antonia the wife of Drusus had a Lamprey at whose gills she hung jewels or ear rings and that others have been so tender hearted as to shed tears at the death of fishes which they have kept and loved And these observations which will to most hearers seem wonderful seem to have a further confirmation from Martial who writes thus Piscator fuge ne nocens et cetera Angler would saint thou be guiltless then forbear For these are sacred fishes that swim here Who know their sovereign and will lick his hand Than which none s greater in the world s command Nay more they ve names and when they called are Do to their several owner s call repair All the further use that I shall make of this shall be to advise anglers to be patient and forbear swearing lest they be heard and catch no fish And so I shall proceed next to tell you it is certain that certain fields near Leominster a town in Herefordshire are observed to make the sheep that graze upon them more fat than the next and also to bear finer wool that is to say that that year in which they feed in such a particular pasture they shall yield finer wool than they did that year before they came to feed in it and coarser again if they shall return to their former pasture and again return to a finer wool being fed in the fine wool ground which I tell you that you may the better believe that I am certain if I catch a Trout in one meadow he shall be white and faint and very like to be lousy and as certainly it I catch a Trout in the next meadow he shall be strong and red and lusty and much better meat Trust me scholar I have caught many a Trout in a particular meadow that the very shape and the enamelled colour of him hath been such as hath joyed me to look on him and I have then with much pleasure concluded with Solomon Everything is beautiful in his season I should by promise speak next of the Salmon but I will by your favour say a little of the Umber or Grayling which is so like a Trout for his shape and feeding that I desire I may exercise your patience with a short discourse of him and then the next shall be of the Salmon The fourth day continued The Umber or Grayling Chapter VI Piscator The Umber and Grayling are thought by some to differ as the Herring and Pilchard do But though they may do so in other nations I think those in England differ nothing but in their names Aldrovandus says they be of a Trout kind and Gesner says that in his country which is Switzerland he is accounted the choicest of all fish And in Italy he is in the month of May so highly valued that he is sold there at a much higher rate than any other fish The French which call the Chub Un Villain call the Umber of the lake Leman Un Umble Chevalier and they value the Umber or Grayling so highly that they say he feeds on gold and say that many have been caught out of their famous river of Loire out of whose bellies grains of gold have been often taken And some think that he feeds on water thyme and smells of it at his first taking out of the water and they may think so with as good reason as we do that our Smelts smell like violets at their being first caught which I think is a truth Aldrovandus says the Salmon the Grayling and Trout and all fish that live in clear and sharp streams are made by their mother Nature of such exact shape and pleasant colours purposely to invite us to a joy and contentedness in feasting with her Whether this is a truth or not is not my purpose to dispute but tis certain all that write of the Umber declare him to be very medicinable And Gesner says that the fat of an Umber or Grayling being set with a little honey a day or two in the sun in a little glass is very excellent against redness or swarthiness or anything that breeds in the eyes Salvian takes him to be called Umber from his swift swimming or gliding out of sight more like a shadow or a ghost than a fish Much more might be said both of his smell and taste but I shall only tell you that saint Ambrose the glorious bishop of Milan who lived when the church kept fasting days calls him the flower fish or flower of fishes and that he was so far in love with him that he would not let him pass without the honour of a long discourse but I must and pass on to tell you how to take this dainty fish First note that he grows not to the bigness of a Trout for the biggest of them do not usually exceed eighteen inches He lives in such rivers as the Trout does and is usually taken with the same baits as the Trout is and after the same manner for he will bite both at the minnow or worm or fly though he bites not often at the minnow and is very gamesome at the fly and much simpler and therefore bolder than a Trout for he will rise twenty times at a fly if you miss him and yet rise again He has been taken with a fly made of the red feathers of a paroquet a strange outlandish bird and he will rise at a fly not unlike a gnat or a small moth or indeed at most flies that are not too big He is a fish that lurks close all Winter but is very pleasant and jolly after mid April and in May and in the hot months He is of a very fine shape his flesh is white his teeth those little ones that he has are in his throat yet he has so tender a mouth that he is oftener lost after an angler has hooked him than any other fish Though there be many of these fishes in the delicate river Dove and in Trent and some other smaller rivers as that which runs by Salisbury yet he is not so general a fish as the Trout nor to me so good to eat or to angle for And so I shall take my leave of him and now come to some observations of the Salmon and how to catch him The fourth day continued The Salmon Chapter VII Piscator The Salmon is accounted the King of freshwater fish 
6660-97655-0000	train-other-500	and is ever bred in rivers relating to the sea yet so high or far from it as admits of no tincture of salt or brackishness
none	none	 He is said to breed or cast his spawn in most rivers 
6660-97655-0001	train-other-500	in the month of August some say that then they dig a hole or grave in a safe place in the gravel and there place their eggs or spawn after the melter has done his natural office and then hide it most cunningly
6660-97655-0002	train-other-500	and cover it over with gravel and stones and then leave it to their Creator s protection who by a gentle heat which he infuses into that cold element makes it brood and beget life in the spawn and to become Samlets early in the spring next following
6660-97655-0003	train-other-500	The Salmons having spent their appointed time and done this natural duty in the fresh waters they then haste to the sea before winter both the melter and spawner but if they be stops by flood gates or weirs or lost in the fresh waters
6660-97655-0004	train-other-500	then those so left behind by degrees grow sick and lean and unseasonable and kipper that is to say have bony gristles grow out of their lower chaps not unlike a hawk s beak which hinders their feeding and in time such fish so left behind
6660-97655-0005	train-other-500	pine away and die Tis observed that he may live thus one year from the sea but he then grows insipid and tasteless and loses both his blood and strength and pines and dies the second year And tis noted that those little Salmons called Skeggers
6660-97655-0006	train-other-500	which abound in many rivers relating to the sea are bred by such sick Salmons that might not go to the sea and that though they abound yet they never thrive to any considerable bigness But if the old Salmon gets to the sea then that gristle which shews him to be kipper
6660-97655-0007	train-other-500	wears away or is cast off as the eagle is said to cast his bill and he recovers his strength and comes next summer to the same river if it be possible to enjoy the former pleasures that there possess him for as one has wittily observed
6660-97655-0008	train-other-500	he has like some persons of honour and riches which have both their winter and summer houses the fresh rivers for summer and the salt water for winter to spend his life in which is not as Sir Francis Bacon hath observed in his History of Life and Death above ten years
6660-97655-0009	train-other-500	And it is to be observed that though the Salmon does grow big in the sea yet he grows not fat but in fresh rivers and it is observed that the farther they get from the sea they be both the fatter and better
6660-97655-0010	train-other-500	Next I shall tell you that though they make very hard shift to get out of the fresh rivers into the sea yet they will make harder shift to get out of the salt into the fresh rivers to spawn or possess the pleasures that they have formerly found in them
none	none	 to which end they will force themselves through floodgates or over weirs or hedges 
6660-97655-0011	train-other-500	or stops in the water even to a height beyond common belief Gesner speaks of such places as are known to be above eight feet high above water And our Camden mentions in his Britannia the like wonder to be in Pembrokeshire
6660-97655-0012	train-other-500	where the river Tivy falls into the sea and that the fall is so downright and so high that the people stand and wonder at the strength and sleight by which they see the Salmon use to get out of the sea into the said river and the manner and height of the place is so notable
6660-97655-0013	train-other-500	that it is known far by the name of the Salmon leap Concerning which take this also out of Michael Drayton my honest old friend as he tells it you in his Polyolbion And when the Salmon seeks a fresher stream to find
6660-97655-0014	train-other-500	Which hither from the sea comes yearly by his kind As he towards season grows and stems the watry tract Where Tivy falling down makes an high cataract Forc d by the rising rocks that there her course oppose As tho within her bounds they meant her to inclose
6660-97655-0015	train-other-500	Here when the labouring fish does at the foot arrive And finds that by his strength he does but vainly strive His tail takes in his mouth and bending like a bow That s to full compass drawn aloft himself doth throw Then springing at his height
6660-97655-0016	train-other-500	as doth a little wand That bended end to end and started from man s hand Far off itself doth cast so does that Salmon vault And if at first he fail his second summersault He instantly essays and from his nimble ring
none	none	 Still yerking never leaves until himself he fling Above the opposing stream 
6660-97655-0017	train-other-500	This Michael Drayton tells you of this leap or summersault of the Salmon And next I shall tell you that it is observed by Gesner and others that there is no better Salmon than in England and that though some of our northern counties have as fat
none	none	 and as large as the river Thames yet none are of so excellent a taste And as I have told you that Sir Francis Bacon observes the age of a Salmon exceeds not ten years so let me next tell you that his growth is very sudden 
6660-97655-0018	train-other-500	it is said that after he is got into the sea he becomes from a Samlet not so big as a Gudgeon to be a Salmon in as short a time as a gosling becomes to be a goose Much of this has been observed by tying a riband or some known tape or thread
6660-97655-0019	train-other-500	in the tail of some young Salmons which have been taken in weirs as they have swimmed towards the salt water and then by taking a part of them again with the known mark at the same place at their return from the sea which is usually about six months after
6660-97655-0020	train-other-500	and the like experiment hath been tried upon young swallows who have after six months absence been observed to return to the same chimney there to make their nests and habitations for the summer following which has inclined many to think
6660-97655-0021	train-other-500	that every Salmon usually returns to the same river in which it was bred as young pigeons taken out of the same dovecote have also been observed to do And you are yet to observe further that the He salmon is usually bigger than the Spawner and that he is more kipper
6660-97655-0022	train-other-500	and less able to endure a winter in the fresh water than the She is yet she is at that time of looking less kipper and better as watry and as bad meat And yet you are to observe that as there is no general rule without an exception
6660-97655-0023	train-other-500	so there are some few rivers in this nation that have Trouts and Salmon in season in winter as tis certain there be in the river Wye in Monmouthshire where they be in season as Camden observes from September till April
6660-97655-0024	train-other-500	But my scholar the observation of this and many other things I must in manners omit because they will prove too large for our narrow compass of time and therefore
none	none	 T shall next fall upon my directions 
6660-97655-0025	train-other-500	how to fish for this Salmon And for that First you shall observe that usually he stays not long in a place as Trouts will but as I said covets still to go nearer the spring head and that he does not as the Trout and many other fish
none	none	 lie near the water side or bank or roots of trees but swims in the deep and broad parts of the water and usually in the middle and near the ground and that there you are to fish for him and that he is to be caught as the Trout is with a worm a minnow which some call a peek or with a fly And you are to observe that he is very seldom observed to bite at a minnow yet sometimes he will and not usually at a fly but more usually at a worm 
6660-97655-0026	train-other-500	and then most usually at a lob or garden worm which should be well scoured
none	none	 that is to say 
6660-97655-0027	train-other-500	kept seven or eight days in moss before you fish with them and if you double your time of eight into sixteen twenty or more days it is still the better for the worms will still be clearer tougher and more lively
6660-97655-0028	train-other-500	and continue so longer upon your hook And they may be kept longer by keeping them cool and in fresh moss and some advise to put camphire into it Note also that many used to fish for a Salmon with a ring of wire on the top of their rod
none	none	 through which the line may run to as great a length as is needful when he is hooked And to that end some use a wheel about the middle of their rod or near their hand which is to be observed better by seeing one of them than by a large demonstration of words And now I shall tell you that which may be called a secret I have been a fishing with old Oliver Henly 
6660-97655-0029	train-other-500	now with God a noted fisher both for Trout and Salmon and have observed that he would usually take three or four worms out of his bag and put them into a little box in his pocket
none	none	 where he would usually let them continue 
6660-97655-0030	train-other-500	half an hour or more before he would bait his hook with them I have asked him his reason and he has replied He did but pick the best out to be in readiness against he baited his hook the next time but he has been observed both by others and myself
6660-97655-0031	train-other-500	to catch more fish than I or any other body that has ever gone a fishing with him could do and especially Salmons
none	none	 And I have been told lately by one of his most intimate and secret friends 
6660-97655-0032	train-other-500	that the box in which he put those worms was anointed with a drop or two or three of the oil of ivy berries made by expression or infusion and told that by the worms remaining in that box an hour or a like time they had incorporated a kind of smell
6660-97655-0033	train-other-500	that was irresistibly attractive enough to force any fish within the smell of them to bite This I heard not long since from a friend but have not tried it yet I grant it probable and refer my reader to Sir Francis Bacon s Natural history
6660-97655-0034	train-other-500	where he proves fishes may hear and doubtless can more probably smell and I am certain Gesner says the Otter can smell in the water and I know not but that fish may do so too Tis left for a lover of angling
6660-97655-0035	train-other-500	or any that desires to improve that art to try this conclusion I shall also impart two other experiments but not tried by myself which I will deliver in the same words that they were given me by an excellent angler and a very friend in writing
none	none	 he told me the latter was too good to be told but in a learned language lest it should be made common Take the stinking oil drawn out of polypody of the oak by a retort 
6660-97655-0036	train-other-500	mixed with turpentine and hive honey and anoint your bait therewith and it will doubtless draw the fish to it The other is this Vulnera hederae grandissimae inflicta sudant balsamum oleo gelato
none	none	 albicantique persimile odoris vero longe suavissimi 
6660-97655-0037	train-other-500	Tis supremely sweet to any fish and yet assa foetida may do the like But in these I have no great faith yet grant it probable and have had from some chymical men namely from Sir George Hastings and others
6660-97655-0038	train-other-500	an affirmation of them to be very advantageous
none	none	 But no more of these 
6660-97655-0039	train-other-500	especially not in this place I might here before I take my leave of the Salmon tell you that there is more than one sort of them as namely
none	none	 a Tecon 
6660-97655-0040	train-other-500	and another called in some places a Samlet or by some a Skegger but these and others which I forbear to name may be fish of another kind and differ as we know a Herring and a Pilchard do which I think are as different as the rivers in which they breed
6660-97655-0041	train-other-500	and must by me be left to the disquisitions of men of more leisure and of greater abilities than I profess myself to have And lastly I am to borrow so much of your promised patience as to tell you
6660-97655-0042	train-other-500	that the trout or Salmon being in season have at their first taking out of the water which continues during life their bodies adorned
none	none	 the one with such red spots and the other with such black or blackish spots as give them such an addition of natural beauty as I think was never given to any woman by the artificial paint or patches in which they so much pride themselves in this age And so I shall leave them both and proceed to some observations of the Pike The fourth day continued On the Luce or Pike Chapter VIII Piscator and Venator Piscator The mighty Luce or Pike is taken to be the tyrant as the Salmon is the king of the fresh water Tis not to be doubted but that they are bred some by generation and some not as namely of a weed called pickerel weed unless learned Gesner be much mistaken for he says this weed and other glutinous matter with the help of the sun s heat in some particular months and some ponds apted for it by nature do become Pikes But doubtless divers Pikes are bred after this manner or are brought into some ponds some such other ways as is past man s finding out of which we have daily testimonies Sir Francis Bacon in his History of Life and Death observes the Pike to be the longest lived of any fresh water fish and yet he computes it to be not usually above forty years and others think it to be not above ten years and yet Gesner mentions a Pike taken in Swedeland in the year fourteen forty nine with a ring about his neck declaring he was put into that pond by Frederick the Second more than two hundred years before he was last taken as by the inscription in that ring being Greek was interpreted by the then Bishop of Worms But of this no more but that it is observed that the old or very great Pikes have in them more of state than goodness the smaller or middle sized Pikes being by the most and choicest palates observed to be the best meat and contrary the Eel is observed to be the better for age and bigness All Pikes that live long prove chargeable to their keepers because their life is maintained by the death of so many other fish even those of their own kind which has made him by some writers to be called the tyrant of the rivers or the fresh water wolf by reason of his bold greedy devouring disposition which is so keen as Gesner relates A man going to a pond where it seems a Pike had devoured all the fish to water his mule had a Pike bit his mule by the lips to which the Pike hung so fast that the mule drew him out of the water and by that accident the owner of the mule angled out the Pike And the same Gesner observes that a maid in Poland had a Pike bit her by the foot as she was washing clothes in a pond And I have heard the like of a woman in Killingworth pond not far from Coventry But I have been assured by my friend mister Segrave of whom I spake to you formerly that keeps tame Otters that he hath known a Pike in extreme hunger fight with one of his Otters for a Carp that the Otter had caught and was then bringing out of the water I have told you who relate these things and tell you they are persons of credit and shall conclude this observation by telling you what a wise man has observed It is a hard thing to persuade the belly because it has no ears But if these relations be disbelieved it is too evident to be doubted that a Pike will devour a fish of his own kind that shall be bigger than his belly or throat will receive and swallow a part of him and let the other part remain in his mouth till the swallowed part be digested and then swallow that other part that was in his mouth and so put it over by degrees which is not unlike the Ox and some other beasts taking their meat not out of their mouth immediately into their belly but first into some place betwixt and then chew it or digest it by degrees after which is called chewing the cud And doubtless Pikes will bite when they are not hungry but as some think even for very anger when a tempting bait comes near to them And it is observed that the Pike will eat venomous things as some kind of frogs are and yet live without being harmed by them for as some say he has in him a natural balsam or antidote against all poison And he has a strange heat that though it appear to us to be cold can yet digest or put over any fish flesh by degrees without being sick And others observe that he never eats the venomous frog till he have first killed her and then as ducks are observed to do to frogs in spawning time at which time some frogs are observed to be venomous so thoroughly washed her by tumbling her up and down in the water that he may devour her without danger And Gesner affirms that a Polonian gentleman did faithfully assure him he had seen two young geese at one time in the belly of a Pike And doubtless a Pike in his height of hunger will bite at and devour a dog that swims in a pond and there have been examples of it or the like for as I told you The belly has no ears when hunger comes upon it The Pike is also observed to be a solitary melancholy and a bold fish melancholy because he always swims or rests himself alone and never swims in shoals or with company as Roach and Dace and most other fish do and bold because he fears not a shadow or to see or be seen of anybody as the Trout and Chub and all other fish do And it is observed by Gesner that the jaw bones and hearts and galls of Pikes are very medicinable for several diseases or to stop blood to abate fevers to cure agues to oppose or expel the infection of the plague and to be many ways medicinable and useful for the good of mankind but he observes that the biting of a Pike is venomous and hard to be cured And it is observed that the Pike is a fish that breeds but once a year and that other fish as namely Loaches do breed oftener as we are certain tame Pigeons do almost every month and yet the Hawk a bird of prey as the Pike is a fish breeds but once in twelve months And you are to note that his time of breeding or spawning is usually about the end of February or somewhat later in March as the weather proves colder or warmer and to note that his manner of breeding is thus a he and a she Pike will usually go together out of a river into some ditch or creek and that there the spawner casts her eggs and the melter hovers over her all that time that she is casting her spawn but touches her not I might say more of this but it might be thought curiosity or worse and shall therefore forbear it and take up so much of your attention as to tell you that the best of Pikes are noted to be in rivers next those in great ponds or meres and the worst in small ponds But before I proceed further I am to tell you that there is a great antipathy betwixt the Pike and some frogs and this may appear to the reader of Dubravius a bishop in Bohemia who in his book Of Fish and Fish ponds relates what he says he saw with his own eyes and could not forbear to tell the reader Which was As he and the bishop Thurzo were walking by a large pond in Bohemia they saw a frog when the Pike lay very sleepily and quiet by the shore side leap upon his head and the frog having expressed malice or anger by his sworn cheeks and staring eyes did stretch out his legs and embrace the Pike s head and presently reached them to his eyes tearing with them and his teeth those tender parts the Pike moved with anguish moves up and down the water and rubs himself against weeds and whatever he thought might quit him of his enemy but all in vain for the frog did continue to ride triumphantly and to bite and torment the Pike till his strength failed and then the frog sunk with the Pike to the bottom of the water then presently the frog appeared again at the top and croaked and seemed to rejoice like a conqueror after which he presently retired to his secret hole The bishop that had beheld the battle called his fisherman to fetch his nets and by all means to get the Pike that they might declare what had happened and the Pike was drawn forth and both his eyes eaten out at which when they began to wonder the fisherman wished them to forbear and assured them he was certain that Pikes were often so served I told this which is to be read in the sixth chapter of the book of Dubravius unto a friend who replied It was as improbable as to have the mouse scratch out the cat s eyes But he did not consider that there be Fishing frogs which the Dalmatians call the Water devil of which I might tell you as wonderful a story but I shall tell you that tis not to be doubted but that there be some frogs so fearful of the water snake that when they swim in a place in which they fear to meet with him they then get a reed across into their mouths which if they two meet by accident secures the frog from the strength and malice of the snake and note that the frog usually swims the fastest of the two And let me tell you that as there be water and land frogs so there be land and water snakes Concerning which take this observation that the land snake breeds and hatches her eggs which become young snakes in some old dunghill or a like hot place but the water snake which is not venomous and as I have been assured by a great observer of such secrets does not hatch but breed her young alive which she does not then forsake but bides with them and in case of danger will take them all into her mouth and swim away from any apprehended danger and then let them out again when she thinks all danger to be past these be accidents that we Anglers sometimes see and often talk of But whither am I going I had almost lost myself by remembering the discourse of Dubravius I will therefore stop here and tell you according to my promise how to catch this Pike His feeding is usually of fish or frogs and sometimes a weed of his own called pickerel weed of which I told you some think Pikes are bred for they have observed that where none have been put into ponds yet they have there found many and that there has been plenty of that weed in those ponds and that that weed both breeds and feeds them but whether those Pikes so bred will ever breed by generation as the others do I shall leave to the disquisitions of men of more curiosity and leisure than I profess myself to have and shall proceed to tell you that you may fish for a Pike either with a ledger or a walking bait and you are to note that I call that a Ledger bait which is fixed or made to rest in one certain place when you shall be absent from it and I call that a Walking bait which you take with you and have ever in motion Concerning which two I shall give you this direction that your ledger bait is best to be a living bait though a dead one may catch whether it be a fish or a frog and that you may make them live the longer you may or indeed you must take this course First for your LIVE BAIT Of fish a roach or dace is I think best and most tempting and a perch is the longest lived on a hook and having cut off his fin on his back which may be done without hurting him you must take your knife which cannot be too sharp and betwixt the head and the fin on the back cut or make an incision or such a scar as you may put the arming wire of your hook into it with as little bruising or hurting the fish as art and diligence will enable you to do and so carrying your arming wire along his back unto or near the tail of your fish betwixt the skin and the body of it draw out that wire or arming of your hook at another scar near to his the then tie him about it with thread but no harder than of necessity to prevent hurting the fish and the better to avoid hurting the fish some have a kind of probe to open the way for the more easy entrance and passage of your wire or arming but as for these time and a little experience will teach you better than I can by words Therefore I will for the present say no more of this but come next to give you some directions how to bait your hook with a frog Venator But good master did you not say even now that some frogs were venomous and is it not dangerous to touch them Piscator Yes but I will give you some rules or cautions concerning them And first you are to note that there are two kinds of frogs that is to say if I may so express myself a flesh and fish frog By flesh frogs I mean frogs that breed and live on the land and of these there be several sorts also and of several colours some being speckled some greenish some blackish or brown the green frog which is a small one is by Topsel taken to be venomous and so is the paddock or frog paddock which usually keeps or breeds on the land and is very large and bony and big especially the she frog of that kind yet these will sometimes come into the water but it is not often and the land frogs are some of them observed by him to breed by laying eggs and others to breed of the slime and dust of the earth and that in winter they turn to slime again and that the next summer that very slime returns to be a living creature this is the opinion of Pliny And Cardanus undertakes to give a reason for the raining of frogs but if it were in my power it should rain none but water frogs for those I think are not venomous especially the right water frog which about February or March breeds in ditches by slime and blackish eggs in that slime about which time of breeding the he and she frogs are observed to use divers summersaults and to croak and make a noise which the land frog or paddock frog never does Now of these water frogs if you intend to fish with a frog for a Pike you are to choose the yellowest that you can get for that the Pike ever likes best And thus use your frog that he may continue long alive Put your hook into his mouth which you may easily do from the middle of April till August and then the frog s mouth grows up and he continues so for at least six months without eating but is sustained none but He whose name is Wonderful knows how I say put your hook I mean the arming wire through his mouth and out at his gills and then with a fine needle and silk sew the upper part of his leg with only one stitch to the arming wire of your hook or tie the frog s leg above the upper joint to the armed wire and in so doing use him as though you loved him that is harm him as little as you may possibly that he may live the longer And now having given you this direction for the baiting your ledger hook with a live fish or frog my next must be to tell you how your hook thus baited must or may be used and it is thus having fastened your hook to a line which if it be not fourteen yards long should not be less than twelve you are to fasten that line to any bough near to a hole where a Pike is or is likely to lie or to have a haunt and then wind your line on any forked stick all your line except half a yard of it or rather more and split that forked stick with such a nick or notch at one end of it as may keep the line from any more of it ravelling from about the stick than so much of it as you intend And choose your forked stick to be of that bigness as may keep the fish or frog from pulling the forked stick under the water till the Pike bites and then the Pike having pulled the line forth of the cleft or nick of that stick in which it was gently fastened he will have line enough to go to his hold and pouch the bait And if you would have this ledger bait to keep at a fixt place undisturbed by wind or other accidents which may drive it to the shore side for you are to note that it is likeliest to catch a Pike in the midst of the water then hang a small plummet of lead a stone or piece of tile or a turf in a string and cast it into the water with the forked stick to hang upon the ground to be a kind of anchor to keep the forked stick from moving out of your intended place till the Pike come this I take to be a very good way to use so many ledger baits as you intend to make trial of Or if you bait your hooks thus with live fish or frogs and in a windy day fasten them thus to a bough or bundle of straw and by the help of that wind can get them to move across a pond or mere you are like to stand still on the shore and see sport presently if there be any store of Pikes Or these live baits may make sport being tied about the body or wings of a goose or duck and she chased over a pond And the like may be done with turning three or four live baits thus fastened to bladders or boughs or bottles of hay or flags to swim down a river whilst you walk quietly alone on the shore and are still in expectaion of sport The rest must be taught you by practice for time will not allow me to say more of this kind of fishing with live baits And for your DEAD BAIT for a Pike for that you may be taught by one day s going a fishing with me or any other body that fishes for him for the baiting your hook with a dead gudgeon or a roach and moving it up and down the water is too easy a thing to take up any time to direct you to do it And yet because I cut you short in that I will commute for it by telling you that that was told me for a secret it is this Dissolve gum of ivy in oil of spike and therewith anoint your dead bait for a Pike and then cast it into a likely place and when it has lain a short time at the bottom draw it towards the top of the water and so up the stream and it is more than likely that you have a Pike follow with more than common eagerness And some affirm that any bait anointed with the marrow of the thigh bone of a heron is a great temptation to any fish These have not been tried by me but told me by a friend of note that pretended to do me a courtesy But if this direction to catch a Pike thus do you no good yet I am certain this direction how to roast him when he is caught is choicely good for I have tried it and it is somewhat the better for not being common But with my direction you must take this caution that your Pike must not be a small one that is it must be more than half a yard and should be bigger First open your Pike at the gills and if need be cut also a little slit towards the belly Out of these take his guts and keep his liver which you are to shred very small with thyme sweet marjoram and a little winter savoury to these put some pickled oysters and some anchovies two or three both these last whole for the anchovies will melt and the oysters should not to these you must add also a pound of sweet butter which you are to mix with the herbs that are shred and let them all be well salted If the Pike be more than a yard long then you may put into these herbs more than a pound or if he be less then less butter will suffice These being thus mixt with a blade or two of mace must be put into the Pike s belly and then his belly so sewed up as to keep all the butter in his belly if it be possible if not then as much of it as you possibly can But take not off the scales Then you are to thrust the spit through his mouth out at his tail And then take four or five or six split sticks or very thin laths and a convenient quantity of tape or filleting these laths are to be tied round about the Pike s body from his head to his tail and the tape tied somewhat thick to prevent his breaking or falling off from the spit Let him be roasted very leisurely and often basted with claret wine and anchovies and butter mixt together and also with what moisture falls from him into the pan When you have roasted him sufficiently you are to hold under him when you unwind or cut the tape that ties him such a dish as you purpose to eat him out of and let him fall into it with the sauce that is roasted in his belly and by this means the Pike will be kept unbroken and complete Then to the sauce which was within and also that sauce in the pan you are to add a fit quantity of the best butter and to squeeze the juice of three or four oranges Lastly you may either put it into the Pike with the oysters two cloves of garlick and take it whole out when the Pike is cut off the spit or to give the sauce a haut gout let the dish into which you let the Pike fall be rubbed with it The using or not using of this garlick is left to your discretion M B This dish of meat is too good for any but anglers or very honest men and I trust you will prove both and therefore I have trusted you with this secret Let me next tell you that Gesner tells us there are no Pikes in Spain and that the largest are in the lake Thrasymene in Italy and the next if not equal to them are the Pikes of England and that in England Lincolnshire boasteth to have the biggest Just so doth Sussex boast of four sorts of fish namely an Arundel Mullet a Chichester Lobster a Shelsey Cockle and an Amerly Trout But I will take up no more of your time with this relation but proceed to give you some Observations of the Carp and how to angle for him and to dress him but not till he is caught The fourth day continued On the Carp Chapter IX Piscator The Carp is the queen of rivers a stately a good and a very subtil fish that was not at first bred nor hath been long in England but is now naturalised It is said they were brought hither by one mister Mascal a gentleman that then lived at Plumsted in Sussex a county that abounds more with this fish than any in this nation You may remember that I told you Gesner says there are no Pikes in Spain and doubtless there was a time about a hundred or a few more years ago when there were no Carps in England as may seem to be affirmed by Sir Richard Baker in whose Chronicle you may find these verses Hops and turkies carps and beer Came into England all in a year And doubtless as of sea fish the Herring dies soonest out of the water and of fresh water fish the Trout so except the Eel the Carp endures most hardness and lives longest out of its own proper element and therefore the report of the Carp s being brought out of a foreign country into this nation is the more probable Carps and Loaches are observed to breed several months in one year which Pikes and most other fish do not and this is partly proved by tame and wild rabbits as also by some ducks which will lay eggs nine of the twelve months and yet there be other ducks that lay not longer than about one month And it is the rather to be believed because you shall scarce or never take a male Carp without a melt or a female without a roe or spawn and for the most part very much and especially all the summer season and it is observed that they breed more naturally in ponds than in running waters if they breed there at all and that those that live in rivers are taken by men of the best palates to be much the better meat And it is observed that in some ponds Carps will not breed especially in cold ponds but where they will breed they breed innumerably Aristotle and Pliny say six times in a year if there be no Pikes nor Perch to devour their spawn when it is cast upon grass or flags or weeds where it lies ten or twelve days before it be enlivened The Carp if he have water room and good feed will grow to a very great bigness and length I have heard to be much above a yard long It is said by Jovius who hath writ of fishes that in the lake Lurian in Italy Carps have thriven to be more than fifty pounds weight which is the more probable for as the bear is conceived and born suddenly and being born is but short lived so on the contrary the elephant is said to be two years in his dam s belly some think he is ten years in it and being born grows in bigness twenty years and it is observed too that he lives to the age of a hundred years And tis also observed that the crocodile is very long lived and more than that that all that long life he thrives in bigness and so I think some Carps do especially in some places though I never saw one above twenty three inches which was a great and goodly fish but have been assured there are of a far greater size and in England too Now as the increase of Carps is wonderful for their number so there is not a reason found out I think by any why they should breed in some ponds and not in others of the same nature for soil and all other circumstances And as their breeding so are their decays also very mysterious I have both read it and been told by a gentleman of tried honesty that he has known sixty or more large Carps put into several ponds near to a house where by reason of the stakes in the ponds and the owner s constant being near to them it was impossible they should be stole away from him and that when he has after three or four years emptied the pond and expected an increase from them by breeding young ones for that they might do so he had as the rule is put in three melters for one spawner he has I say after three or four years found neither a young nor old Carp remaining And the like I have known of one that had almost watched the pond and at a like distance of time at the fishing of a pond found of seventy or eighty large Carps not above five or six and that he had forborne longer to fish the said pond but that he saw in a hot day in summer a large Carp swim near the top of the water with a frog upon his head and that he upon that occasion caused his pond to be let dry and I say of seventy or eighty Carps only found five or six in the said pond and those very sick and lean and with every one a frog sticking so fast on the head of the said Carps that the frog would not be got off without extreme force or killing And the gentleman that did affirm this to me told me he saw it and did declare his belief to be and I also believe the same that he thought the other Carps that were so strangely lost were so killed by the frogs and then devoured And a person of honour now living in Worcestershire assured me he had seen a necklace or collar of tadpoles hang like a chain or necklace of beads about a Pike s neck and to kill him Whether it were for meat or malice must be to me a question But I am fallen into this discourse by accident of which I might say more but it has proved longer than I intended and possibly may not to you be considerable I shall therefore give you three or four more short observations of the Carp and then fall upon some directions how you shall fish for him The age of Carps is by Sir Francis Bacon in his History of Life and Death observed to be but ten years yet others think they live longer Gesner says a Carp has been known to live in the Palatine above a hundred years But most conclude that contrary to the Pike or Luce all Carps are the better for age and bigness The tongues of Carps are noted to be choice and costly meat especially to them that buy them but Gesner says Carps have no tongue like other fish but a piece of fleshlike fish in their mouth like to a tongue and should be called a palate but it is certain it is choicely good and that the Carp is to be reckoned amongst those leather mouthed fish which I told you have their teeth in their throat and for that reason he is very seldom lost by breaking his hold if your hook be once stuck into his chaps I told you that Sir Francis Bacon thinks that the Carp lives but ten years but Janus Dubravius has writ a book Of fish and fish ponds in which he says that Carps begin to spawn at the age of three years and continue to do so till thirty he says also that in the time of their breeding which is in summer when the sun hath warmed both the earth and water and so apted them also for generation that then three or four male Carps will follow a female and that then she putting on a seeming coyness they force her through weeds and flags where she lets fall her eggs or spawn which sticks fast to the weeds and then they let fall their melt upon it and so it becomes in a short time to be a living fish and as I told you it is thought that the Carp does this several months in the year and most believe that most fish breed after this manner except the Eel And it has been observed that when the spawner has weakened herself by doing that natural office that two or three melters have helped her from off the weeds by bearing her up on both sides and guarding her into the deep And you may note that though this may seem a curiosity not worth observing yet others have judged it worth their time and costs to make glass hives and order them in such a manner as to see how bees have bred and made their honeycombs and how they have obeyed their king and governed their commonwealth But it is thought that all Carps are not bred by generation but that some breed other ways as some Pikes do The physicians make the galls and stones in the heads of Carps to be very medicinable But it is not to be doubted but that in Italy they make great profit of the spawn of Carps by selling it to the Jews who make it into red caviare the Jews not being by their law admitted to eat of caviare made of the Sturgeon that being a fish that wants scales and as may appear in Leviticus xi by them reputed to be unclean Much more might be said out of him and out of Aristotle which Dubravius often quotes in his Discourse of Fishes but it might rather perplex than satisfy you and therefore I shall rather choose to direct you how to catch than spend more time in discoursing either of the nature or the breeding of this Carp or of any more circumstances concerning him But yet I shall remember you of what I told you before that he is a very subtil fish and hard to be caught And my first direction is that if you will fish for a Carp you must put on a very large measure of patience especially to fish for a river Carp I have known a very good fisher angle diligently four or six hours in a day for three or four days together for a river Carp and not have a bite And you are to note that in some ponds it is as hard to catch a Carp as in a river that is to say where they have store of feed and the water is of a clayish colour But you are to remember that I have told you there is no rule without an exception and therefore being possess with that hope and patience which I wish to all fishers especially to the Carp angler I shall tell you with what bait to fish for him But first you are to know that it must be either early or late and let me tell you that in hot weather for he will seldom bite in cold you cannot be too early or too late at it And some have been so curious as to say the tenth of April is a fatal day for Carps The Carp bites either at worms or at paste and of worms I think the bluish marsh or meadow worm is best but possibly another worm not too big may do as well and so may a green gentle and as for pastes there are almost as many sorts as there are medicines for the toothache but doubtless sweet pastes are best I mean pastes made with honey or with sugar which that you may the better beguile this crafty fish should be thrown into the pond or place in which you fish for him some hours or longer before you undertake your trial of skill with the angle rod and doubtless if it be thrown into the water a day or two before at several times and in small pellets you are the likelier when you fish for the Carp to obtain your desired sport Or in a large pond to draw them to any certain place that they may the better and with more hope be fished for you are to throw into it in some certain place either grains or blood mixt with cow dung or with bran or any garbage as chicken s guts or the like and then some of your small sweet pellets with which you propose to angle and these small pellets being a few of them also thrown in as you are angling will be the better And your paste must be thus made take the flesh of a rabbit or cat cut small and bean flour and if that may not be easily got get other flour and then mix these together and put to them either sugar or honey which I think better and then beat these together in a mortar or sometimes work them in your hands your hands being very clean and then make it into a ball or two or three as you like best for your use but you must work or pound it so long in the mortar as to make it so tough as to hang upon your hook without washing from it yet not too hard or that you may the better keep it on your hook you may knead with your paste a little and not too much white or yellowish wool And if you would have this paste keep all the year for any other fish then mix with it virgin wax and clarified honey and work them together with your hands before the fire then make these into balls and they will keep all the year And if you fish for a Carp with gentles then put upon your hook a small piece of scarlet about this bigness it being soaked in or anointed with oil of petre called by some oil of the rock and if your gentles be put two or three days before into a box or horn anointed with honey and so put upon your hook as to preserve them to be living you are as like to kill this crafty fish this way as any other but still as you are fishing chew a little white or brown bread in your mouth and cast it into the pond about the place where your float swims Other baits there be but these with diligence and patient watchfulness will do better than any that I have ever practiced or heard of And yet I shall tell you that the crumbs of white bread and honey made into a paste is a good bait for a Carp and you know it is more easily made And having said thus much of the Carp my next discourse shall be of the Bream which shall not prove so tedious and therefore I desire the continuance of your attention But first I will tell you how to make this Carp that is so curious to be caught so curious a dish of meat as shall make him worth all your labour and patience And though it is not without some trouble and charges yet it will recompense both Take a Carp alive if possible scour him and rub him clean with water and salt but scale him not then open him and put him with his blood and his liver which you must save when you open him into a small pot or kettle then take sweet marjoram thyme and parsley of each half a handful a sprig of rosemary and another of savoury bind them into two or three small bundles and put them in your Carp with four or five whole onions twenty pickled oysters and three anchovies Then pour upon your Carp as much claret wine as will only cover him and season your claret well with salt cloves and mace and the rinds of oranges and lemons That done cover your pot and set it on a quick fire till it be sufficiently boiled Then take out the Carp and lay it with the broth into the dish and pour upon it a quarter of a pound of the best fresh butter melted and beaten with half a dozen spoonfuls of the broth the yolks of two or three eggs and some of the herbs shred garnish your dish with lemons and so serve it up And much good do you doctor T The fourth day continued On the Bream Chapter X Piscator The Bream being at a full growth is a large and stately fish He will breed both in rivers and ponds but loves best to live in ponds and where if he likes the water and air he will grow not only to be very large but as fat as a hog He is by Gesner taken to be more pleasant or sweet than wholesome This fish is long in growing but breeds exceedingly in a water that pleases him yea in many ponds so fast as to overstore them and starve the other fish He is very broad with a forked tail and his scales set in excellent order he hath large eyes and a narrow sucking mouth he hath two sets of teeth and a lozenge like bone a bone to help his grinding The melter is observed to have two large melts and the female two large bags of eggs or spawn Gesner reports that in Poland a certain and a great number of large breams were put into a pond which in the next following winter were frozen up into one entire ice and not one drop of water remaining nor one of these fish to be found though they were diligently searched for and yet the next spring when the ice was thawed and the weather warm and fresh water got into the pond he affirms they all appeared again This Gesner affirms and I quote my author because it seems almost as incredible as the resurrection to an atheist but it may win something in point of believing it to him that considers the breeding or renovation of the silk worm and of many insects And that is considerable which Sir Francis Bacon observes in his History of Life and Death fol twenty that there be some herbs that die and spring every year and some endure longer But though some do not yet the French esteem this fish highly and to that end have this proverb He that hath Breams in his pond is able to bid his friend welcome and it is noted that the best part of a Bream is his belly and head Some say that Breams and Roaches will mix their eggs and melt together and so there is in many places a bastard breed of Breams that never come to be either large or good but very numerous The baits good to catch this Bream are many First paste made of brown bread and honey gentles or the brood of wasps that be young and then not unlike gentles and should be hardened in an oven or dried on a tile before the fire to make them tough Or there is at the root of docks or flags or rushes in watery places a worm not unlike a maggot at which Tench will bite freely Or he will bite at a grasshopper with his legs nipt off in June and July or at several flies under water which may be found on flags that grow near to the water side I doubt not but that there be many other baits that are good but I will turn them all into this most excellent one either for a Carp or Bream in any river or mere it was given to me by a most honest and excellent angler and hoping you will prove both I will impart it to you one Let your bait be as big a red worm as you can find without a knot get a pint or quart of them in an evening in garden walks or chalky commons after a shower of rain and put them with clean moss well washed and picked and the water squeezed out of the moss as dry as you can into an earthen pot or pipkin set dry and change the moss fresh every three or four days for three weeks or a month together then your bait will be at the best for it will be clear and lively two Having thus prepared your baits get your tackling ready and fitted for this sport Take three long angling rods and as many and more silk or silk and hair lines and as many large swan or goose quill floats Then take a piece of lead and fasten them to the low ends of your lines then fasten your link hook also to the lead and let there be about a foot or ten inches between the lead and the hook but be sure the lead be heavy enough to sink the float or quill a little under the water and not the quill to bear up the lead for the lead must lie on the ground Note that your link next the hook may be smaller than the rest of your line if you dare adventure for fear of taking the Pike or Perch who will assuredly visit your hooks till they be taken out as I will show you afterwards before either Carp or Bream will come near to bite Note also that when the worm is well baited it will crawl up and down as far as the lead will give leave which much enticeth the fish to bite without suspicion three Having thus prepared your baits and fitted your tackling repair to the river where you have seen them swim in skulls or shoals in the summer time in a hot afternoon about three or four of the clock and watch their going forth of their deep holes and returning which you may well discern for they return about four of the clock most of them seeking food at the bottom yet one or two will lie on the top of the water rolling and tumbling themselves whilst the rest are under him at the bottom and so you shall perceive him to keep sentinel then mark where he plays most and stays longest which commonly is in the broadest and deepest place of the river and there or near thereabouts at a clear bottom and a convenient landing place take one of your angles ready fitted as aforesaid and sound the bottom which should be about eight or ten feet deep two yards from the bank is best Then consider with yourself whether that water will rise or fall by the next morning by reason of any water mills near and according to your discretion take the depth of the place where you mean after to cast your ground bait and to fish to half an inch that the lead lying on or near the ground bait the top of the float may only appear upright half an inch above the water Thus you having found and fitted for the place and depth thereof then go home and prepare your ground bait which is next to the fruit of your labours to be regarded The GROUND BAIT You shall take a peck or a peck and a half according to the greatness of the stream and deepness of the water where you mean to angle of sweet gross ground barley malt and boil it in a kettle one or two warms is enough then strain it through a bag into a tub the liquor whereof hath often done my horse much good and when the bag and malt is near cold take it down to the water side about eight or nine of the clock in the evening and not before cast in two parts of your ground bait squeezed hard between both your hands it will sink presently to the bottom and be sure it may rest in the very place where you mean to angle if the stream run hard or move a little cast your malt in handfuls a little the higher upwards the stream You may between your hands close the malt so fast in handfuls that the water will hardly part it with the fall Your ground thus baited and tackling fitted leave your bag with the rest of your tackling and ground bait near the sporting place all night and in the morning about three or four of the clock visit the water side but not too near for they have a cunning watchman and are watchful themselves too Then gently take one of your three rods and bait your hook casting it over your ground bait and gently and secretly draw it to you till the lead rests about the middle of the ground bait Then take a second rod and cast in about a yard above and your third a yard below the first rod and stay the rods in the ground but go yourself so far from the water side that you perceive nothing but the top of the floats which you must watch most diligently Then when you have a bite you shall perceive the top of your float to sink suddenly into the water yet nevertheless be not too hasty to run to your rods until you see that the line goes clear away then creep to the water side and give as much line as possibly you can if it be a good Carp or Bream they will go to the farther side of the river then strike gently and hold your rod at a bent a little while but if you both pull together you are sure to lose your game for either your line or hook or hold will break and after you have overcome them they will make noble sport and are very shy to be landed The Carp is far stronger and more mettlesome than the Bream Much more is to be observed in this kind of fish and fishing but it is far fitter for experience and discourse than paper Only thus much is necessary for you to know and to be mindful and careful of that if the Pike or Perch do breed in that river they will be sure to bite first and must first be taken And for the most part they are very large and will repair to your ground bait not that they will eat of it but will feed and sport themselves among the young fry that gather about and hover over the bait The way to discern the Pike and to take him it you mistrust your Bream hook for I have taken a Pike a yard long several times at my Bream hooks and sometimes he hath had the luck to share my line may be thus Take a small Bleak or Roach or Gudgeon and bait it and set it alive among your rods two feet deep from the cork with a little red worm on the point of the hook then take a few crumbs of white bread or some of the ground bait and sprinkle it gently amongst your rods If mister Pike be there then the little fish will skip out of the water at his appearance but the live set bait is sure to be taken Thus continue your sport from four in the morning till eight and if it be a gloomy windy day they will bite all day long but this is too long to stand to your rods at one place and it will spoil your evening sport that day which is this About four of the clock in the afternoon repair to your baited place and as soon as you come to the water side cast in one half of the rest of your ground bait and stand off then whilst the fish are gathering together for there they will most certainly come for their supper you may take a pipe of tobacco and then in with your three rods as in the morning You will find excellent sport that evening till eight of the clock then cast in the residue of your ground bait and next morning by four of the clock visit them again for four hours which is the best sport of all and after that let them rest till you and your friends have a mind to more sport From saint James s tide until Bartholomew tide is the best when they have had all the summer s food they are the fattest Observe lastly that after three or four days fishing together your game will be very shy and wary and you shall hardly get above a bite or two at a baiting then your only way is to desist from your sport about two or three days and in the meantime on the place you late baited and again intend to bait you shall take a turf of green but short grass as big or bigger than a round trencher to the top of this turf on the green side you shall with a needle and green thread fasten one by one as many little red worms as will near cover all the turf then take a round board or trencher make a hole in the middle thereof and through the turf placed on the board or trencher with a string or cord as long as is fitting tied to a pole let it down to the bottom of the water for the fish to feed upon without disturbance about two or three days and after that you have drawn it away you may fall to and enjoy your former recreation B A The fourth day continued On the Tench Chapter XI Piscator The Tench the physician of fishes is observed to love ponds better than rivers and to love pits better than either yet Camden observes there is a river in Dorsetshire that abounds with Tenches but doubtless they retire to the most deep and quiet places in it This fish hath very large fins very small and smooth scales a red circle about his eyes which are big and of a gold colour and from either angle of his mouth there hangs down a little barb In every Tench s head there are two little stones which foreign physicians make great use of but he is not commended for wholesome meat though there be very much use made of them for outward applications Rondeletius says that at his being at Rome he saw a great cure done by applying a Tench to the feet of a very sick man This he says was done after an unusual manner by certain Jews And it is observed that many of those people have many secrets yet unknown to Christians secrets that have never yet been written but have been since the days of their Solomon who knew the nature of all things even from the cedar to the shrub delivered by tradition from the father to the son and so from generation to generation without writing or unless it were casually without the least communicating them to any other nation or tribe for to do that they account a profanation And yet it is thought that they or some spirit worse than they first told us that lice swallowed alive were a certain cure for the yellow jaundice This and many other medicines were discovered by them or by revelation for doubtless we attained them not by study Well this fish besides his eating is very useful both dead and alive for the good of mankind But I will meddle no more with that my honest humble art teaches no such boldness there are too many foolish meddlers in physick and divinity that think themselves fit to meddle with hidden secrets and so bring destruction to their followers But I ll not meddle with them any farther than to wish them wiser and shall tell you next for I hope I may be so bold that the Tench is the physician of fishes for the Pike especially and that the Pike being either sick or hurt is cured by the touch of the Tench And it is observed that the tyrant Pike will not be a wolf to his physician but forbears to devour him though he be never so hungry This fish that carries a natural balsam in him to cure both himself and others loves yet to feed in very foul water and amongst weeds And yet I am sure he eats pleasantly and doubtless you will think so too if you taste him And I shall therefore proceed to give you some few and but a few directions how to catch this Tench of which I have given you these observations He will bite at a paste made of brown bread and honey or at a Marsh worm or a lob worm he inclines very much to any paste with which tar is mixt and he will bite also at a smaller worm with his head nipped off and a cod worm put on the hook before that worm And I doubt not but that he will also in the three hot months for in the nine colder he stirs not much bite at a flag worm or at a green gentle but can positively say no more of the Tench he being a fish I have not often angled for but I wish my honest scholar may and be ever fortunate when he fishes The fourth day continued On the Perch Chapter XII Piscator and Venator Piscator The Perch is a very good and very bold biting fish He is one of the fishes of prey that like the Pike and Trout carries his teeth in his mouth which is very large and he dare venture to kill and devour several other kinds of fish He has a hooked or hog back which is armed with sharp and stiff bristles and all his skin armed or covered over with thick dry hard scales and hash which few other fish have two fins on his back He is so bold that he will invade one of his own kind which the Pike will not do so willingly and you may therefore easily believe him to be a bold biter The Perch is of great esteem in Italy saith Aldrovandus and especially the least are there esteemed a dainty dish And Gesner prefers the Perch and Pike above the Trout or any fresh water fish he says the Germans have this proverb More wholesome than a Perch of Rhine and he says the River Perch is so wholesome that physicians allow him to be eaten by wounded men or by men in fevers or by women in child bed He spawns but once a year and is by physicians held very nutritive yet by many to be hard of digestion They abound more in the river Po and in England says Rondeletius than other parts and have in their brain a stone which is in foreign parts sold by apothecaries being there noted to be very medicinable against the stone in the reins These be a part of the commendations which some philosophical brains have bestowed upon the freshwater Perch yet they commend the Sea Perch which is known by having but one fin on his back of which they say we English see but a few to be a much better fish The Perch grows slowly yet will grow as I have been credibly informed to be almost two feet long for an honest informer told me such a one was not long since taken by Sir Abraham Williams a gentleman of worth and a brother of the angle that yet lives and I wish he may this was a deep bodied fish and doubtless durst have devoured a Pike of half his own length For I have told you he is a bold fish such a one as but for extreme hunger the Pike will not devour For to affright the Pike and save himself the Perch will set up his fins much like as a turkey cock will sometimes set up his tail But my scholar the Perch is not only valiant to defend himself but he is as I said a bold biting fish yet he will not bite at all seasons of the year he is very abstemious in winter yet will bite then in the midst of the day if it be warm and note that all fish bite best about the midst of warm day in winter And he hath been observed by some not usually to bite till the mulberry tree buds that is to say till extreme frosts be past the spring for when the mulberry tree blossoms many gardeners observe their forward fruit to be past the danger of frosts and some have made the like observation of the Perch s biting But bite the Perch will and that very boldly And as one has wittily observed if there be twenty or forty in a hole they may be at one standing all catched one after another they being as he says like the wicked of the world not afraid though their fellows and companions perish in their sight And you may observe that they are not like the solitary Pike but love to accompany one another and march together in troops And the baits for this bold fish are not many I mean he will bite as well at some or at any of these three as at any or all others whatsoever a worm a minnow or a little frog of which you may find many in hay time And of worms the dunghill worm called a brandling I take to be best being well scoured in moss or fennel or he will bite at a worm that lies under cow dung with a bluish head And if you rove for a Perch with a minnow then it is best to be alive you sticking your hook through his back fin or a minnow with the hook in his upper lip and letting him swim up and down about mid water or a little lower and you still keeping him to about that depth by a cork which ought not to be a very little one and the like way you are to fish for the Perch with a small frog your hook being fastened through the skin of his leg towards the upper part of it and lastly I will give you but this advice that you give the Perch time enough when he bites for there was scarce ever any angler that has given him too much And now I think best to rest myself for I have almost spent my spirits with talking so long Venator Nay good master one fish more for you see it rains still and you know our angles are like money put to usury they may thrive though we sit still and do nothing but talk and enjoy one another Come come the other fish good master Piscator But scholar have you nothing to mix with this discourse which now grows both tedious and tiresome Shall I have nothing from you that seem to have both a good memory and a cheerful spirit Venator Yes master I will speak you a copy of verses that were made by Doctor Donne and made to shew the world that he could make soft and smooth verses when he thought smoothness worth his labour and I love them the better because they allude to Rivers and Fish and Fishing They be these Come live with me and be my love And we will some new pleasures prove Of golden sands and crystal brooks With silken lines and silver hooks There will the river whisp ring run Warm d by thy eyes more than the sun And there the enamel d fish will stay Begging themselves they may betray When thou wilt swim in that live bath Each fish which every channel hash Most amorously to thee will swim Gladder to catch thee than thou him If thou to be so seen beest loath By sun or moon thou dark nest both And if mine eyes have leave to see I need not their light having thee Let others freeze with angling reeds And cut their legs with shells and weeds Or treacherously poor fish beset With strangling snares or windowy net Let coarse bold hands from slimy nest The bedded fish in banks outwrest Let curious traitors sleeve silk flies To witch poor wand ring fishes eyes For thee thou need saint no such deceit For thou thyself art shine own bait That fish that is not catcht thereby Is wiser afar alas than I Piscator Well remembered honest scholar I thank you for these choice verses which I have heard formerly but had quite forgot till they were recovered by your happy memory Well being I have now rested myself a little I will make you some requital by telling you some observations of the Eel for it rains still and because as you say our angles are as money put to use that thrives when we play therefore we ll sit still and enjoy ourselves a little longer under this honeysuckle hedge The fourth day continued Of the Eel and other Fish that want Scales Chapter XIII Piscator It is agreed by most men that the Eel is a most dainty fish the Romans have esteemed her the Helena of their feasts and some the queen of palate pleasure But most men differ about their breeding some say they breed by generation as other fish do and others that they breed as some worms do of mud as rats and mice and many other living creatures are bred in Egypt by the sun s heat when it shines upon the overflowing of the river Nilus or out of the putrefaction of the earth and divers other ways Those that deny them to breed by generation as other fish do ask If any man ever saw an Eel to have a spawn or melt And they are answered That they may be as certain of their breeding as if they had seen spawn for they say that they are certain that Eels have all parts fit for generation like other fish but so small as not to be easily discerned by reason of their fatness but that discerned they may be and that the He and the She Eel may be distinguished by their fins And Rondeletius says he has seen Eels cling together like dew worms And others say that Eels growing old breed other Eels out of the corruption of their own age which Sir Francis Bacon says exceeds not ten years And others say that as pearls are made of glutinous dewdrops which are condensed by the sun s heat in those countries so Eels are bred of a particular dew falling in the months of May or June on the banks of some particular ponds or rivers apted by nature for that end which in a few days are by the sun s heat turned into Eels and some of the Ancients have called the Eels that are thus bred the offspring of Jove I have seen in the beginning of July in a river not far from Canterbury some parts of it covered over with young Eels about the thickness of a straw and these Eels did lie on the top of that water as thick as motes are said to be in the sun and I have heard the like of other rivers as namely in Severn where they are called Yelvers and in a pond or mere near unto Staffordshire where about a set time in summer such small Eels abound so much that many of the poorer sort of people that inhabit near to it take such Eels out of this mere with sieves or sheets and make a kind of Eel cake of them and eat it like as bread And Gesner quotes Venerable Bede to say that in England there is an island called Ely by reason of the innumerable number of Eels that breed in it But that Eels may be bred as some worms and some kind of bees and wasps are either of dew or out of the corruption of the earth seems to be made probable by the barnacles and young goslings bred by the sun s heat and the rotten planks of an old ship and hatched of trees both which are related for truths by Du Bartas and Lobel and also by our learned Camden and laborious Gerhard in his Herbal It is said by Rondeletius that those Eels that are bred in rivers that relate to or be nearer to the sea never return to the fresh waters as the Salmon does always desire to do when they have once tasted the salt water and I do the more easily believe this because I am certain that powdered beef is a most excellent bait to catch an Eel And though Sir Francis Bacon will allow the Eel s life to be but ten years yet he in his History of Life and Death mentions a Lamprey belonging to the Roman emperor to be made tame and so kept for almost threescorc years and that such useful and pleasant observations were made of this Lamprey that Crassus the orator who kept her lamented her death and we read in Doctor Hakewill that Hortensius was seen to weep at the death of a Lamprey that he had kept long and loved exceedingly It is granted by all or most men that Eels for about six months that is to say the six cold months of the year stir not up or down neither in the rivers nor in the pools in which they usually are but get into the soft earth or mud and there many of them together bed themselves and live without feeding upon anything as I have told you some swallows have been observed to do in hollow trees for those six cold months And this the Eel and Swallow do as not being able to endure winter weather for Gesner quotes Albertus to say that in the year eleven twenty five that year s winter being more cold than usually Eels did by nature s instinct get out of the water into a stack of hay in a meadow upon dry ground and there bedded themselves but yet at last a frost killed them And our Camden relates that in Lancashire fishes were digged out of the earth with spades where no water was near to the place I shall say little more of the Eel but that as it is observed he is impatient of cold so it hath been observed that in warm weather an Eel has been known to live five days out of the water And lastly let me tell you that some curious searchers into the natures of fish observe that there be several sorts or kinds of Eels as the silver Eel the green or greenish Eel with which the river of Thames abounds and those are called Grigs and a blackish Eel whose head is more flat and bigger than ordinary Eels and also an Eel whose fins are reddish and but seldom taken in this nation and yet taken sometimes These several kind of Eels are say some diversely bred as namely out of the corruption of the earth and some by dew and other ways as I have said to you and yet it is affirmed by some for a certain that the silver Eel is bred by generation but not by spawning as other fish do but that her brood come alive from her being then little live Eels no bigger nor longer than a pin and I have had too many testimonies of this to doubt the truth of it myself and if I thought it needful I might prove it but I think it is needless And this Eel of which I have said so much to you may be caught with divers kinds of baits as namely with powdered beef with a lob or garden worm with a minnow or gut of a hen chicken or the guts of any fish or with almost anything for he is a greedy fish But the Eel may be caught especially with a little a very little Lamprey which some call a Pride and may in the hot months be found many of them in the river Thames and in many mud heaps in other rivers yea almost as usually as one finds worms in a dunghill Next note that the Eel seldom stirs in the day but then hides himself and therefore he is usually caught by night with one of these baits of which I have spoken and may be then caught by laying hooks which you are to fasten to the bank or twigs of a tree or by throwing a string across the stream with many hooks at it and those baited with the aforesaid baits and a clod or plummet or stone thrown into the river with this line that so you may in the morning find it near to some fixed place and then take it up with a drag hook or otherwise But these things are indeed too common to be spoken of and an hour s fishing with any angler will teach you better both for these and many other common things in the practical part of angling than a week s discourse I shall therefore conclude this direction for taking the Eel by telling you that in a warm day in summer I have taken many a good Eel by Snigling and have been much pleased with that sport And because you that are but a young angler know not what Snigling is I will now teach it to you You remember I told you that Eels do not usually stir in the daytime for then they hide themselves under some covert or under boards or planks about flood gates or weirs or mills or in holes on the river banks so that you observing your time in a warm day when the water is lowest may take a strong small hook tied to a strong line or to a string about a yard long and then into one of these holes or between any boards about a mill or under any great stone or plank or any place where you think an Eel may hide or shelter herself you may with the help of a short stick put in y our bait but leisurely and as far as you may conveniently and it is scarce to be doubted but if there be an Eel within the sight of it the Eel will bite instantly and as certainly gorge it and you need not doubt to have him if you pull him not out of the hole too quickly but pull him out by degrees for he lying folded double in his hole will with the help of his tail break all unless you give him time to be wearied with pulling and so get him out by degrees not pulling too hard And to commute for your patient hearing this long direction I shall next tell you How to make this Eel a most excellent dish of meat First wash him in water and salt then pull off his skin below his vent or navel and not much further having done that take out his guts as clean as you can but wash him not then give him three or four scotches with a knife and then put into his belly and those scotches sweet herbs an anchovy and a little nutmeg grated or cut very small and your herbs and anchovies must also be cut very small and mixt with good butter and salt having done this then pull his skin over him all but his head which you are to cut off to the end you may tie his skin about that part where his head grew and it must be so tied as to keep all his moisture within his skin and having done this tie him with tape or packthread to a spit and roast him leisurely and baste him with water and salt till his skin breaks and then with butter and having roasted him enough let what was put into his belly and what he drips be his sauce S F When I go to dress an Eel thus I wish he were as long and as big as that which was caught in Peterborough river in the year sixteen sixty seven which was a yard and three quarters long If you will not believe me then go and see at one of the coffee houses in King Street in Westminster But now let me tell you that though the Eel thus drest be not only excellent good but more harmless than any other way yet it is certain that physicians account the Eel dangerous meat I will advise you therefore as Solomon says of honey Hast thou found it eat no more than is sufficient lest thou surfeit for it is not good to eat much honey And let me add this that the uncharitable Italian bids us give Eels and no wine to our enemies And I will beg a little more of your attention to tell you that Aldrovandus and divers physicians commend the Eel very much for medicine though not for meat But let me tell you one observation that the Eel is never out of season as Trouts and most other fish are at set times at least most Eels are not I might here speak of many other fish whose shape and nature are much like the Eel and frequent both the sea and fresh rivers as namely the Lamprel the Lamprey and the Lamperne as also of the mighty Conger taken often in Severn about Gloucester and might also tell in what high esteem many of them are for the curiosity of their taste But these are not so proper to be talked of by me because they make us anglers no sport therefore I will let them alone as the Jews do to whom they are forbidden by their law And scholar there is also a FLOUNDER a sea fish which will wander very far into fresh rivers and there lose himself and dwell and thrive to a hand s breadth and almost twice so long a fish without scales and most excellent meat and a fish that affords much sport to the angler with any small worm but especially a little bluish worm gotten out of marsh ground or meadows which should be well scoured But this though it be most excellent meat yet it wants scales and is as I told you therefore an abomination to the Jews But scholar there is a fish that they in Lancashire boast very much of called a CHAR taken there and I think there only in a mere called Winander Mere a mere says Camden that is the largest in this nation being ten miles in length and some say as smooth in the bottom as if it were paved with polished marble This fish never exceeds fifteen or sixteen inches in length and is spotted like a Trout and has scarce a bone but on the back But this though I do not know whether it make the angler sport yet I would have you take notice of it because it is a rarity and of so high esteem with persons of great note Nor would I have you ignorant of a rare fish called a GUINIAD of which I shall tell you what Camden and others speak The river Dee which runs by Chester springs in Merionethshire and as it runs toward Chester it runs through Pemble Mere which is a large water and it is observed that though the river Dee abounds with Salmon and Pemble mere with the Guiniad yet there is never any Salmon caught in the mere nor a Guiniad in the river And now my next observation shall be of the Barbel The fourth day continued Of the Barbel Chapter XIV Piscator Venator Milk woman Piscator The Barbel is so called says Gesner by reason of his barb or wattles at his mouth which are under his nose or chaps He is one of those leather mouthed fishes that I told you of that does very seldom break his hold if he be once hooked but he is so strong that he will often break both rod and line if he proves to be a big one But the Barbel though he be of a fine shape and looks big yet he is not accounted the best fish to eat neither for his wholesomeness nor his taste but the male is reputed much better than the female whose spawn is very hurtful as I will presently declare to you They flock together like sheep and are at the worst in April about which time they spawn but quickly grow to be in season He is able to live in the strongest swifts of the water and in summer they love the shallowest and sharpest streams and love to lurk under weeds and to feed on gravel against a rising ground and will root and dig in the sands with his nose like a hog and there nests himself yet sometimes he retires to deep and swift bridges or flood gates or weir where he will nest himself amongst piles or in hollow places and take such hold of moss or weeds that be the water never so swift it is not able to force him from the place that he contends for This is his constant custom in summer when he and most living creatures sport themselves in the sun but at the approach of winter then he forsakes the swift streams and shallow waters and by degrees retires to those parts of the river that are quiet and deeper in which places and I think about that time he spawns and as I have formerly told you with the help of the melter hides his spawn or eggs in holes which they both dig in the gravel and then they mutually labour to cover it with the same sand to prevent it from being devoured by other fish There be such store of this fish in the river Danube that Rondeletius says they may in some places of it and in some months of the year be taken by those who dwell near to the river with their hands eight or ten load at a time He says they begin to be good in May and that they cease to be so in August but it is found to be otherwise in this nation But thus far we agree with him that the spawn of a Barbel if it be not poison as he says yet that it is dangerous meat and especially in the month of May which is so certain that Gesner and Gasius declare it had an ill effect upon them even to the endangering of their lives The fish is of a fine cast and handsome shape with small scales which are placed after a most exact and curious manner and as I told you may be rather said not to be ill than to be good meat The Chub and he have I think both lost part of their credit by ill cookery they being reputed the worst or coarsest of fresh water fish But the Barbel affords an angler choice sport being a lusty and a cunning fish so lusty and cunning as to endanger the breaking of the angler s line by running his head forcibly towards any covert or hole or bank and then striking at the line to break it off with his tail as is observed by Plutarch in his book De Industria Animalium and also so cunning to nibble and suck off your worm close to the hook and yet avoid the letting the hook come into his mouth The Barbel is also curious for his baits that is to say that they be clean and sweet that is to say to have your worms well scoured and not kept in sour and musty moss for he is a curious feeder but at a well scoured lob worm he will bite as boldly as at any bait and specially if the night or two before you fish for him you shall bait the places where you intend to fish for him with big worms cut into pieces And note that none did ever over bait the place nor fish too early or too late for a Barbel And the Barbel will bite also at generals which not being too much scoured but green are a choice bait for him and so is cheese which is not to be too hard but kept a day or two in a wet linen cloth to make it tough with this you may also bait the water a day or two before you fish for the Barbel and be much the likelier to catch store and if the cheese were laid in clarified honey a short time before as namely an hour or two you were still the likelier to catch fish Some have directed to cut the cheese into thin pieces and toast it and then tie it on the hook with fine silk And some advise to fish for the Barbel with sheep s tallow and soft cheese beaten or worked into a paste and that it is choicely good in August and I believe it Rut doubtless the lob worm well scoured and the gentle not too much scoured and cheese ordered as I have directed are baits enough and I think will serve in any month though I shall commend any angler that tries conclusions and is industrious to improve the art And now my honest scholar the long shower and my tedious discourse are both ended together and I shall give you but this observation that when you fish for a Barbel your rod and line be both long and of good strength for as I told you you will find him a heavy and a dogged fish to be dealt withal yet he seldom or never breaks his hold if he be once strucken And if you would know more of fishing for the Umber or Barbel get into favour with doctor Sheldon whose skill is above others and of that the poor that dwell about him have a comfortable experience And now let s go and see what interest the Trouts will pay us for letting our angle rods lie so long and so quietly in the water for their use Come scholar which will you take up Venator Which you think fit master Piscator Why you shall take up that for I am certain by viewing the line it has a fish at it Look you scholar well done Come now take up the other too well now you may tell my brother Peter at night that you have caught a leash of Trouts this day And now let s move towards our lodging and drink a draught of red cow s milk as we go and give pretty Maudlin and her honest mother a brace of Trouts for their supper Venator Master I like your motion very well and I think it is now about milking time and yonder they be at it Piscator God speed you good woman I thank you both for our songs last night I and my companion have had such fortune a fishing this day that we resolve to give you and Maudlin a brace of Trouts for supper and we will now taste a draught of your red cow s milk Milk woman Marry and that you shall with all my heart and I will be still your debtor when you come this way If you will but speak the word I will make you a good syllabub of new verjuice and then you may sit down in a haycock and eat it and Maudlin shall sit by and sing you the good old song of the Hunting in Chevy Chace or some other good ballad for she hath store of them Maudlin my honest Maudlin hath a notable memory and she thinks nothing too good for you because you be such honest men Venator We thank you and intend once in a month to call upon you again and give you a little warning and so good night Good night Maudlin And now good master let s lose no time but tell me somewhat more of fishing and if you please first something of fishing for a Gudgeon Piscator I will honest scholar The fourth day continued Of the Gudgeon the Ruffe and the Bleak Chapter XV Piscator The GUDGEON is reputed a fish of excellent taste and to be very wholesome He is of a fine shape of a silver colour and beautified with black spots both on his body and tail He breeds two or three times in the year and always in summer He is commended for a fish of excellent nourishment The Germans call him Groundling by reason of his feeding on the ground and he there feasts himself in sharp streams and on the gravel He and the Barbel both feed so and do not hunt for flies at any time as most other fishes do He is an excellent fish to enter a young angler being easy to be taken with a small red worm on or very near to the ground He is one of those leather mouthed fish that has his teeth in his throat and will hardly be lost off from the hook if he be once strucken They be usually scattered up and down every river in the shallows in the heat of summer but in autumn when the weeds begin to grow sour and rot and the weather colder then they gather together and get into the deeper parts of the water and are to be fished for there with your hook always touching the ground if you fish for him with a float or with a cork But many will fish for the Gudgeon by hand with a running line upon the ground without a cork as a Trout is fished for and it is an excellent way if you have a gentle rod and as gentle a hand There is also another fish called a POPE and by some a RUFFE a fish that is not known to be in some rivers he is much like the Perch for his shape and taken to be better than the Perch but will not grow to be bigger than a Gudgeon He is an excellent fish no fish that swims is of a pleasanter taste And he is also excellent to enter a young angler for he is a greedy biter and they will usually lie abundance of them together in one reserved place where the water is deep and runs quietly and an easy angler if he has found where they lie may catch forty or fifty or sometimes twice so many at a standing You must fish for him with a small red worm and if you bait the ground with earth it is excellent There is also a BLEAK or fresh water Sprat a fish that is ever in motion and therefore called by some the river swallow for just as you shall observe the swallow to be most evenings in summer ever in motion making short and quick turns when he flies to catch flies in the air by which he lives so does the Bleak at the top of the water Ausonius would have called him Bleak from his whitish colour his back is of a pleasant sad or sea water green his belly white and shining as the mountain snow And doubtless though we have the fortune which virtue has in poor people to be neglected yet the Bleak ought to be much valued though we want Allamot salt and the skill that the Italians have to turn them into anchovies This fish may be caught with a Pater noster line that is six or eight very small hooks tied along the line one half a foot above the other I have seen five caught thus at one time and the bait has been gentles than which none is better Or this fish may be caught with a fine small artificial fly which is to be of a very sad brown colour and very small and the hook answerable There is no better sport than whipping for Bleaks in a boat or on a bank in the swift water in a summer s evening with a hazel top about five or six foot long and a line twice the length of the rod I have heard Sir Henry Wotton say that there be many that in Italy will catch swallows so or especially martins this bird angler standing on the top of a steeple to do it and with the line twice so long as I have spoken of And let me tell you scholar that both Martins and Bleaks be most excellent meat And let me tell you that I have known a Heron that did constantly frequent one place caught with a hook baited with a big minnow or a small gudgeon The line and hook must be strong and tied to some loose staff so big as she cannot fly away with it a line not exceeding two yards The fourth day continued Is of nothing or of nothing worth Chapter XVI Piscator Venator Peter Coridon Piscator My purpose was to give you some directions concerning ROACH and DACE and some other inferior fish which make the angler excellent sport for you know there is more pleasure in hunting the hare than in eating her but I will forbear at this time to say any more because you see yonder come our brother Peter and honest Coridon But I will promise you that as you and I fish and walk to morrow towards London if I have now forgotten anything that I can then remember I will not keep it from you Well met gentlemen this is lucky that we meet so just together at this very door Come hostess where are you is supper ready Come first give us a drink and be as quick as you can for I believe we are all very hungry Well brother Peter and Coridon to you both Come drink and then tell me what luck of fish we two have caught but ten bouts of which my scholar caught three Look here s eight and a brace we gave away We have had a most pleasant day for fishing and talking and are returned home both weary and hungry and now meat and rest will be pleasant Peter And Coridon and I have not had an unpleasant day and yet I have caught but five bouts for indeed we went to a good honest ale house and there we played at shovel board half the day all the time that it rained we were there and as merry as they that fished And I am glad we are now with a dry house over our heads for hark how it rains and blows Come hostess give us more ale and our supper with what haste you may and when we have supped let us have your song Piscator and the catch that your scholar promised us or else Coridon will be dogged Piscator Nay I will not be worse than my word you shall not want my song and I hope I shall be perfect in it Venator And I hope the like for my catch which I have ready too and therefore let s go merrily to supper and then have a gentle touch at singing and drinking but the last with moderation Coridon Come now for your song for we have fed heartily Come hostess lay a few more sticks on the fire And now sing when you will Piscator Well then here s to you Coridon and now for my song O the gallant Fisher s life It is the best of any Tis full of pleasure void of strife And tis beloved of many Other joys Are but toys Only this Lawful is For our skill Breeds no ill But content and pleasure In a morning up we rise Ere Aurora s peeping Drink a cup to wash our eyes Leave the sluggard sleeping Then we go To and fro With our knacks At our backs To such streams As the Thames If we have the leisure When we please to walk abroad For our recreation In the fields is our abode Full of delectation Where in a brook With a hook Or a lake Fish we take There we sit For a bit Till we fish entangle We have gentles in a horn We have paste and worms too We can watch both night and morn Suffer rain and storms too None do here Use to swear Oaths do fray Fish away We sit still And watch our quill Fishers must not wrangle If the sun s excessive heat Make our bodies swelter To an osier hedge we get For a friendly shelter Where in a dike Perch or Pike Roach or Dace We do chase Bleak or Gudgeon Without grudging We are still contented Or we sometimes pass an hour Under a green willow That defends us from a shower Making earth our pillow Where we may Think and pray Before death Stops our breath Other joys Are but toys And to be lamented Jo Chalkhill Venator Well sung master this day s fortune and pleasure and the night s company and song do all make me more and more in love with angling Gentlemen my master left me alone for an hour this day and I verily believe he retired himself from talking with me that he might be so perfect in this song was it not master Piscator Yes indeed for it is many years since I learned it and having forgotten a part of it I was forced to patch it up with the help of mine own invention who am not excellent at poetry as my part of the song may testify but of that I will say no more lest you should think I mean by discommending it to beg your commendations of it And therefore without replications let s hear your catch scholar which I hope will be a good one for you are both musical and have a good fancy to boot Venator Marry and that you shall and as freely as I would have my honest master tell me some more secrets of fish and fishing as we walk and fish towards London to morrow But master first let me tell you that very hour which you were absent from me I sat down under a willow tree by the water side and considered what you had told me of the owner of that pleasant meadow in which you then left me that he had a plentiful estate and not a heart to think so that he had at this time many law suits depending and that they both damped his mirth and took up so much of his time and thoughts that he himself had not leisure to take the sweet content that I who pretended no title to them took in his fields for I could there sit quietly and looking on the water see some fishes sport themselves in the silver streams others leaping at flies of several shapes and colours looking on the hills I could behold them spotted with woods and groves looking down the meadows could see here a boy gathering lilies and lady smocks and there a girl cropping culverkeys and cowslips all to make garlands suitable to this present month of May these and many other field flowers so perfumed the air that I thought that very meadow like that field in Sicily of which Diodorus speaks where the perfumes arising from the place make all dogs that hunt in it to fall off and to lose their hottest scent I say as I thus sat joying in my own happy condition and pitying this poor rich man that owned this and many other pleasant groves and meadows about me I did thankfully remember what my Saviour said that the meek possess the earth or rather they enjoy what the others possess and enjoy not for anglers and meek quiet spirited men are free from those high those restless thoughts which corrode the sweets of life and they and they only can say as the poet has happily express it Hail blest estate of lowliness Happy enjoyments of such minds As rich in self contentedness Can like the reeds in roughest winds By yielding make that blow but small At which proud oaks and cedars fall There came also into my mind at that time certain verses in praise of a mean estate and humble mind they were written by Phineas Fletcher an excellent divine and an excellent angler and the author of excellent Piscatory Eclogues in which you shall see the picture of this good man s mind and I wish mine to be like it No empty hopes no courtly fears him fright No begging wants his middle fortune bite But sweet content exiles both misery and spite His certain life that never can deceive him Is full of thousand sweets and rich content The smooth leav d beeches in the field receive him With coolest shade till noon tide s heat be spent His life is neither tost in boisterous seas Or the vexatious world or lost in slothful ease Please and full blest he lives when he his God can please His bed more safe than soft yields quiet sleeps While by his side his faithful spouse teas place His little son into his bosom creeps The lively picture of his father s face His humble house or poor state ne er torment him Less he could like if less his God had lent him And when he dies green turfs do for a tomb content him Gentlemen these were a part of the thoughts that then possessed me And I there made a conversion of a piece of an old catch and added more to it fitting them to be sung by us anglers Come Master you can sing well you must sing a part of it as it is in this paper Man s life is but vain for tis subject to pain And sorrow and short as a bubble Tis a hodge podge of business and money and care And care and money and trouble But we ll take no care when the weather proves fair Nor will we vex now though it rain We ll banish all sorrow and sing till to morrow And angle and angle again Peter I marry Sir this is musick indeed this has cheer d my heart and made me remember six verses in praise of musick which I will speak to you instantly Musick miraculous rhetorick thou speak saint sense Without a tongue excelling eloquence With what ease might thy errors be excus d Wert thou as truly lov d as th art abus d But though dull souls neglect and some reprove thee I cannot hate thee cause the Angels love thee Venator And the repetition of these last verses of musick has called to my memory what mister Edmund Waller a lover of the angle says of love and musick Whilst I listen to thy voice Chloris I feel my heart decay That powerful voice Calls my fleeting soul away Oh suppress that magic sound Which destroys without a wound Peace Chloris peace or singing die That together you and I To heaven may go For all we know Of what the blessed do above Is that they sing and that they love Piscator Well remembered brother Peter these verses came seasonably and we thank you heartily Come we will all join together my host and all and sing my scholar s catch over again and then each man drink the tother cup and to bed and thank God we have a dry house over our heads Piscator Well now good night to everybody Peter And so say I Venator And so say I Coridon Good night to you all and I thank you The FIFTH day Piscator Good morrow brother Peter and the like to you honest Coridon Come my hostess says there is seven shillings to pay let s each man drink a pot for his morning s draught and lay down his two shillings so that my hostess may not have occasion to repent herself of being so diligent and using us so kindly Peter The motion is liked by everybody and so hostess here s your money we anglers are all beholden to you it will not be long ere I ll see you again and now brother Piscator I wish you and my brother your scholar a fair day and good fortune Come Coridon this is our way The FIFTH day continued Of Roack and Dace Chapter XVII Venator and Piscator Venator Good master as we go now towards London be still so courteous as to give me more instructions for I have several boxes in my memory in which I will keep them all very safe there shall not one of them be lost Piscator Well scholar that I will and I will hide nothing from you that I can remember and can think may help you forward towards a perfection in this art And because we have so much time and I have said so little of Roach and Dace I will give you some directions concerning them Some say the Roach is so called from rutilus which they say signifies red fins He is a fish of no great reputation for his dainty taste and his spawn is accounted much better than any other part of him And you may take notice that as the Carp is accounted the water fox for his cunning so the Roach is accounted the water sheep for his simplicity or foolishness It is noted that the Roach and Dace recover strength and grow in season in a fortnight after spawning the Barbel and Chub in a month the Trout in four months and the Salmon in the like time if he gets into the sea and after into fresh water Roaches be accounted much better in the river than in a pond though ponds usually breed the biggest But there is a kind of bastard small Roach that breeds in ponds with a very forked tail and of a very small size which some say is bred by the Bream and right Roach and some ponds are stored with these beyond belief and knowing men that know their difference call them Ruds they differ from the true Roach as much as a Herring from a Pilchard And these bastard breed of Roach are now scattered in many rivers but I think not in the Thames which I believe affords the largest and fattest in this nation especially below London Bridge The Roach is a leather mouthed fish and has a kind of saw like teeth in his throat And lastly let me tell you the Roach makes an angler excellent sport especially the great Roaches about London where I think there be the best Roach anglers And I think the best Trout anglers be in Derbyshire for the waters there are clear to an extremity Next let me tell you you shall fish for this Roach in Winter with paste or gentles in April with worms or cadis in the very hot months with little white snails or with flies under water for he seldom takes them at the top though the Dace will In many of the hot months Roaches may also be caught thus take a May fly or ant fly sink him with a little lead to the bottom near to the piles or posts of a bridge or near to any posts of a weir I mean any deep place where Roaches lie quietly and then pull your fly up very leisurely and usually a Roach will follow your bait up to the very top of the water and gaze on it there and run at it and take it lest the fly should fly away from him I have seen this done at Windsor and Henley Bridge and great store of Roach taken and sometimes a Dace or Chub And in August you may fish for them with a paste made only of the crumbs of bread which should be of pure fine manchet and that paste must be so tempered betwixt your hands till it be both soft and tough too a very little water and time and labour and clean hands will make it a most excellent paste But when you fish with it you must have a small hook a quick eye and a nimble hand or the bait is lost and the fish too if one may lose that which he never had With this paste you may as I said take both the Roach and the Dace or Dare for they be much of a kind in manner of feeding cunning goodness and usually in size And therefore take this general direction for some other baits which may concern you to take notice of they will bite almost at any fly but especially at ant flies concerning which take this direction for it is very good Take the blackish ant fly out of the mole hill or ant hill in which place you shall find them in the month of June or if that be too early in the year then doubtless you may find them in July August and most of September Gather them alive with both their wings and then put them into a glass that will hold a quart or a pottle but first put into the glass a handful or more of the moist earth out of which you gather them and as much of the roots of the grass of the said hillock and then put in the flies gently that they lose not their wings lay a clod of earth over it and then so many as are put into the glass without bruising will live there a month or more and be always in readiness for you to fish with but if you would have them keep longer then get any great earthen pot or barrel of three or four gallons which is better then wash your barrel with water and honey and having put into it a quantity of earth and grass roots then put in your flies and cover it and they will live a quarter of a year These in any stream and clear water are a deadly bait for Roach or Dace or for a Chub and your rule is to fish not less than a handful from the bottom I shall next tell you a winter bait for a Roach a Dace or Chub and it is choicely good About All hallantide and so till frost comes when you see men ploughing up heath ground or sandy ground or greenswards then follow the plough and you shall find a white worm as big as two maggots and it hath a red head you may observe in what ground most are for there the crows will be very watchful and follow the plough very close it is all soft and full of whitish guts a worm that is in Norfolk and some other counties called a grub and is bred of the spawn or eggs of a beetle which she leaves in holes that she digs in the ground under cow or horse dung and there rests all winter and in March or April comes to be first a red and then a black beetle Gather a thousand or two of these and put them with a peck or two of their own earth into some tub or firkin and cover and keep them so warm that the frost or cold air or winds kill them not these you may keep all winter and kill fish with them at any time and if you put some of them into a little earth and honey a day before you use them you will find them an excellent bait for Bream Carp or indeed for almost any fish And after this manner you may also keep gentles all winter which are a good bait then and much the better for being lively and tough Or you may breed and keep gentles thus take a piece of beast s liver and with a cross stick hang it in some corner over a pot or barrel half full of dry clay and as the gentles grow big they will fall into the barrel and scour themselves and be always ready for use whensoever you incline to fish and these gentles may be thus created till after Michaelmas But if you desire to keep gentles to fish with all the year then get a dead cat or a kite and let it be flyblown and when the gentles begin to be alive and to stir then bury it and them in soft moist earth but as free from frost as you can and these you may dig up at any time when you intend to use them these will last till March and about that time turn to be flies But if you be nice to foul your fingers which good anglers seldom are then take this bait get a handful of well made malt and put it into a dish of water and then wash and rub it betwixt your hands till you make it clean and as free from husks as you can then put that water from it and put a small quantity of fresh water to it and set it in something that is fit for that purpose over the fire where it is not to boil apace but leisurely and very softly until it become somewhat soft which you may try by feeling it betwixt your finger and thumb and when it is soft then put your water from it and then take a sharp knife and turning the sprout end of the corn upward with the point of your knife take the back part of the husk off from it and yet leaving a kind of inward husk on the corn or else it is marr d and then cut off that sprouted end I mean a little of it that the white may appear and so pull off the husk on the cloven side as I directed you and then cutting off a very little of the other end that so your hook may enter and if your hook be small and good you will find this to be a very choice bait either for winter or summer you sometimes casting a little of it into the place where your float swims And to take the Roach and Dace a good bait is the young brood of wasps or bees if you dip their heads in blood especially good for Bream if they be baked or hardened in their husks in an oven after the bread is taken out of it or hardened on a fire shovel and so also is the thick blood of sheep being half dried on a trencher that so you may cut into such pieces as may best fit the size of your hook and a little salt keeps it from growing black and makes it not the worse but better this is taken to be a choice bait if rightly ordered There be several oils of a strong smell that I have been told of and to be excellent to tempt fish to bite of which I could say much But I remember I once carried a small bottle from Sir George Hastings to Sir Henry Wotton they were both chemical men as a great present it was sent and receiv d and us d with great confidence and yet upon inquiry I found it did not answer the expectation of Sir Henry which with the help of this and other circumstances makes me have little belief in such things as many men talk of Not but that I think that fishes both smell and hear as I have express in my former discourse but there is a mysterious knack which though it be much easier than the philosopher s stone yet is not attainable by common capacities or else lies locked up in the brain or breast of some chemical man that like the Rosicrucians will not yet reveal it But let me nevertheless tell you that camphire put with moss into your worm bag with your worms makes them if many anglers be not very much mistaken a tempting bait and the angler more fortunate But I stepped by chance into this discourse of oils and fishes smelling and though there might be more said both of it and of baits for Roach and Dace and other float fish yet I will forbear it at this time and tell you in the next place how you are to prepare your tackling concerning which I will for sport sake give you an old rhyme out of an old fish book which will prove a part and but a part of what you are to provide My rod and my line my float and my lead My hook and my plummet my whetstone and knife My basket my baits both living and dead My net and my meat for that is the chief Then I must have thread and hairs green and small With mine angling purse and so you have all But you must have all these tackling and twice so many more with which if you mean to be a fisher you must store yourself and to that purpose I will go with you either to mister Margrave who dwells amongst the book sellers in saint Paul s Church yard or to mister John Stubs near to the Swan in Goldinglane they be both honest an and will fit an angler with what tackling he lacks Venator Then good master let it be at for he is nearest to my dwelling And I pray let s meet there the ninth of May next about two of the clock and I ll want nothing that a fisher should be furnished with Piscator Well and I ll not fail you God willing at the time and place appointed Venator I thank you good master and I will not fail you And good master tell me what BAITS more you remember for it will not now be long ere we shall be at Tottenham High Cross and when we come thither I will make you some requital of your pains by repeating as choice a copy of Verses as any we have heard since we met together and that is a proud word for we have heard very good ones Piscator Well scholar and I shall be then right glad to hear them And I will as we walk tell you whatsoever comes in my mind that I think may be worth your hearing You may make another choice bait thus take a handful or two of the best and biggest wheat you can get boil it in a little milk like as frumity is boiled boil it so till it be soft and then fry it very leisurely with honey and a little beaten saffron dissolved in milk and you will find this a choice bait and good I think for any fish especially for Roach Dace Chub or Grayling I know not but that it may be as good for a river Carp and especially if the ground be a little baited with it And you may also note that the SPAWN of most fish is a very tempting bait being a little hardened on a warm tile and cut into fit pieces Nay mulberries and those black berries which grow upon briars be good baits for Chubs or Carps with these many have been taken in ponds and in some rivers where such trees have grown near the water and the fruit customarily drops into it And there be a hundred other baits more than can be well named which by constant baiting the water will become a tempting bait for any fish in it You are also to know that there be divers kinds of CADIS or Case worms that are to be found in this nation in several distinct counties in several little brooks that relate to bigger rivers as namely one cadis called a piper whose husk or case is a piece of reed about an inch long or longer and as big about as the compass of a two pence These worms being kept three or four days in a woollen bag with sand at the bottom of it and the bag wet once a day will in three or four days turn to be yellow and these be a choice bait for the Chub or Chavender or indeed for any great fish for it is a large bait There is also a lesser cadis worm called a Cockspur being in fashion like the spur of a cock sharp at one end and the case or house in which this dwells is made of small husks and gravel and slime most curiously made of these even so as to be wondered at but not to be made by man no more than a king fisher s nest can which is made of little fishes bones and have such a geometrical interweaving and connection as the like is not to be done by the art of man This kind of cadis is a choice bait for any float fish it is much less than the piper cadis and to be so ordered and these may be so preserved ten fifteen or twenty days or it may be longer There is also another cadis called by some a Straw worm and by some a Ruff coat whose house or case is made of little pieces of bents and rushes and straws and water weeds and I know not what which are so knit together with condensed slime that they stick about her husk or case not unlike the bristles of a hedge hog These three cadises are commonly taken in the beginning of summer and are good indeed to take any kind of fish with float or otherwise I might tell you of many more which as they do early so those have their time also of turning to be flies in later summer but I might lose myself and tire you by such a discourse I shall therefore but remember you that to know these and their several kinds and to what flies every particular cadis turns and then how to use them first as they be cadis and after as they be flies is an art and an art that every one that professes to be an angler has not leisure to search after and if he had is not capable of learning I ll tell you scholar several countries have several kinds of cadises that indeed differ as much as dogs do that is to say as much as a very cur and a greyhound do These be usually bred in the very little rills or ditches that run into bigger rivers and I think a more proper bait for those very rivers than any other I know not how or of what this cadis receives life or what coloured fly it turns to but doubtless they are the death of many Trouts and this is one killing way Take one or more if need be of these large yellow cadis pull off his head and with it pull out his black gut put the body as little bruised as is possible on a very little hook armed on with a red hair which will shew like the cadis head and a very little thin lead so put upon the shank of the hook that it may sink presently Throw this bait thus ordered which will look very yellow into any great still hole where a Trout is and he will presently venture his life for it it is not to be doubted if you be not espied and that the bait first touch the water before the line And this will do best in the deepest stillest water Next let me tell you I have been much pleased to walk quietly by a brook with a little stick in my hand with which I might easily take these and consider the curiosity of their composure and if you should ever like to do so then note that your stick must be a little hazel or willow cleft or have a nick at one end of it by which means you may with ease take many of them in that nick out of the water before you have any occasion to use them These my honest scholar are some observations told to you as they now come suddenly into my memory of which you may make some use but for the practical part it is that that makes an angler it is diligence and observation and practice and an ambition to be the best in the art that must do it I will tell you scholar I once heard one say I envy not him that eats better meat than I do nor him that is richer or that wears better clothes than I do I envy nobody but him and him only that catches more fish than I do And such a man is like to prove an angler and this noble emulation I wish to you and all young anglers The FIFTH day continued Of the Minnow or Penk Loach Bull Head or Miller s Thumb and the Stickle bag Chapter XVIII Piscator and Venator Piscator There be also three or four other little fish that I had almost forgot that are all without scales and may for excellency of meat be compared to any fish of greatest value and largest size They be usually full of eggs or spawn all the months of summer for they breed often as tis observed mice and many of the smaller four footed creatures of the earth do and as those so these come quickly to their full growth and perfection And it is needful that they breed both often and numerously for they be besides other accidents of ruin both a prey and baits for other fish And first I shall tell you of the Minnow or Penk The MINNOW hath when he is in perfect season and not sick which is only presently after spawning a kind of dappled or waved colour like to a panther on its sides inclining to a greenish or sky colour his belly being milk white and his back almost black or blackish He is a sharp biter at a small worm and in hot weather makes excellent sport for young anglers or boys or women that love that recreation And in the spring they make of them excellent Minnow tansies for being washed well in salt and their heads and tails cut off and their guts taken out and not washed after they prove excellent for that use that is being fried with yolk of eggs the flowers of cowslips and of primroses and a little tansy thus used they make a dainty dish of meat The LOACH is as I told you a most dainty fish he breeds and feeds in little and clear swift brooks or rills and lives there upon the gravel and in the sharpest streams he grows not to be above a finger long and no thicker than is suitable to that length The Loach is not unlike the shape of the Eel he has a beard or wattles like a barbel He has two fins at his sides four at his belly and one et his tail he is dappled with many black or brown spots his mouth is barbel like under his nose This fish is usually full of eggs or spawn and is by Gesner and other learned physicians commended for great nourishment and to be very grateful both to the palate and stomach of sick persons He is to be fished for with a very small worm at the bottom for he very seldom or never rises above the gravel on which I told you he usually gets his living The MILLER S THUMB or BULL HEAD is a fish of no pleasing shape He is by Gesner compared to the Sea toad fish for his similitude and shape It has a head big and flat much greater than suitable to his body a mouth very wide and usually gaping he is without teeth but his lips are very rough much like to a file He hath two fins near to his gills which be roundish or crested two fins also under the belly two on the back one below the vent and the fin of his tail is round Nature hath painted the body of this fish with whitish blackish brownish spots They be usually full of eggs or spawn all the summer I mean the females and those eggs swell their vents almost into the form of a dug They begin to spawn about April and as I told you spawn several months in the summer And in the winter the Minnow and Loach and Bull head dwell in the mud as the Eel doth or we know not where no more than we know where the cuckoo and swallow and other half year birds which first appear to us in April spend their six cold winter melancholy months This BULL HEAD does usually dwell and hide himself in holes or amongst stones in clear water and in very hot days will lie a long time very still and sun himself and will be easy to be seen upon any flat stone or any gravel at which time he will suffer an angler to put a hook baited with a small worm very near unto his very mouth and he never refuses to bite nor indeed to be caught with the worst of anglers Matthiolus commends him much more for his taste and nourishment than for his shape or beauty There is also a little fish called a STICKLEBAG a fish without scales but hath his body fenced with several prickles I know not where he dwells in winter nor what he is good for in summer but only to make sport for boys and women anglers and to feed other fish that be fish of prey as Trouts in particular who will bite at him as at a Penk and better if your hook be rightly baited with him for he may be so baited as his tail turning like the sail of a wind mill will make him turn more quick than any Penk or Minnow can For note that the nimble turning of that or the Minnow is the perfection of Minnow fishing To which end if you put your hook into his mouth and out at his tail and then having first tied him with white thread a little above his tail and placed him after such a manner on your hook as he is like to turn then sew up his mouth to your line and he is like to turn quick and tempt any Trout but if he does not turn quick then turn his tail a little more or less towards the inner part or towards the side of the hook or put the Minnow or Sticklebag a little more crooked or more straight on your hook until it will turn both true and fast and then doubt not but to tempt any great Trout that lies in a swift stream And the Loach that I told you of will do the like no bait is more tempting provided the Loach be not too big And now scholar with the help of this fine morning and your patient attention I have said all that my present memory will afford me concerning most of the several fish that are usually fished for in fresh waters Venator But master you have by your former civility made me hope that you will make good your promise and say something of the several rivers that be of most note in this nation and also of fish ponds and the ordering of them and do it I pray good master for I love any discourse of rivers and fish and fishing the time spent in such discourse passes away very pleasantly The FIFTH day continued Of Rivers and some Observations of Fish Chapter XIX Piscator WELL scholar since the ways and weather do both favour us and that we yet see not Tottenham Cross you shall see my willingness to satisfy your desire And first for the rivers of this nation there be as you may note out of doctor Heylin s Geography and others in number three hundred and twenty five but those of chiefest note he reckons and describes as followeth The chief is THAMISIS compounded of two rivers Thame and Isis whereof the former rising somewhat beyond Thame in Buckinghamshire and the latter near Cirencester in Gloucestershire meet together about Dorchester in Oxfordshire the issue of which happy conjunction is Thamisis or Thames hence it flieth betwixt Berks Buckinghamshire Middlesex Surrey Kent and Essex and so weddeth itself to the Kentish Medway in the very jaws of the ocean This glorious river feeleth the violence and benefit of the sea more than any river in Europe ebbing and flowing twice a day more than sixty miles about whose banks are so many fair towns and princely palaces that a German poet thus truly spake Tot campos c We saw so many woods and princely bowers Sweet fields brave palaces and stately towers So many gardens drest with curious care That Thames with royal Tiber may compare two The second river of note is SABRINA or SEVERN it hath its beginning in Plinilimmon hill in Montgomeryshire and his end seven miles from Bristol washing in the mean space the walls of Shrewsbury Worcester and Gloucester and divers other places and palaces of note three TRENT so called from thirty kind of fishes that are found in it or for that it receiveth thirty lesser rivers who having his fountain in Staffordshire and gliding through the counties of Nottingham Lincoln Leicester and York augmenteth the turbulent current of Humber the most violent stream of all the isle This Humber is not to say truth a distinct river having a spring head of his own but it is rather the mouth or aestuarium of divers rivers here confluent and meeting together namely your Derwent and especially of Ouse and Trent and as the Danow having received into its channel the river Dravus Savus Tibiscus and divers others changeth his name into this of Humberabus as the old geographers call it four MEDWAY a Kentish river famous for harbouring the royal navy five TWEED the north east bound of England on whose northern banks is seated the strong and impregnable town of Berwick six TYNE famous for Newcastle and her inexhaustible coal pits These and the rest of principal note are thus comprehended in one of mister Drayton s Sonnets Our floods queen Thames for ships and swans is crown d And stately Severn for her shore is prais d The crystal Trent for fords and fish renown d And Avon s fame to Albion s cliffs is rais d Carlegion Chester vaunts her holy Dee York many wonders of her Ouse can tell The Peak her Dove whose banks so fertile be And Kent will say her Medway doth excel Cotswold commends her Isis to the Tame Our northern borders boast of Tweed s fair flood Our Western parts extol their Willy s fame And the old Lea brags of the Danish blood These observations are out of learned doctor Heylin and my old deceased friend Michael Drayton and because you say you love such discourses as these of rivers and fish and fishing I love you the better and love the more to impart them to you Nevertheless scholar if I should begin but to name the several sorts of strange fish that are usually taken in many of those rivers that run into the sea I might beget wonder in you or unbelief or both and yet I will venture to tell you a real truth concerning one lately dissected by doctor Wharton a man of great learning and experience and of equal freedom to communicate it one that loves me and my art one to whom I have been beholden for many of the choicest observations that I have imparted to you This good man that dares do anything rather than tell an untruth did I say tell me he had lately dissected one strange fish and he thus described it to me This fish was almost a yard broad and twice that length his mouth wide enough to receive or take into it the head of a man his stomach seven or eight inches broad He is of a slow motion and usually lies or lurks close in the mud and has a moveable string on his head about a span or near unto a quarter of a yard long by the moving of which which is his natural bait when he lies close and unseen in the mud he draws other smaller fish so close to him that he can suck them into his mouth and so devours and digests them And scholar do not wonder at this for besides the credit of the relator you are to note many of these and fishes which are of the like and more unusual shapes are very often taken on the mouths of our sea rivers and on the sea shore And this will be no wonder to any that have travelled Egypt where tis known the famous river Nilus does not only breed fishes that yet want names but by the overflowing of that river and the help of the sun s heat on the fat slime which the river leaves on the banks when it falls back into its natural channel such strange fish and beasts are also bred that no man can give a name to as Grotius in his Sopham and others have observed But whither am I strayed in this discourse I will end it by telling you that at the mouth of some of these rivers of ours Herrings are so plentiful as namely near to Yarmouth in Norfolk and in the west country Pilchers so very plentiful as you will wonder to read what our learned Camden relates of them in his Britannia Well scholar I will stop here and tell you what by reading and conference I have observed concerning fish ponds The FIFTH day continued Of Fish Ponds Chapter XX Piscator DOCTOR LEBAULT the learned Frenchman in his large discourse of Maison Rustique gives this direction for making of fish ponds I shall refer you to him to read it at large but I think I shall contract it and yet make it as useful He adviseth that when you have drained the ground and made the earth firm where the head of the pond must be that you must then in that place drive in two or three rows of oak or elm piles which should be scorched in the fire or half burnt before they be driven into the earth for being thus used it preserves them much longer from rotting And having done so lay faggots or bavins of smaller wood betwixt them and then earth betwixt and above them and then having first very well rammed them and the earth use another pile in like manner as the first were and note that the second pile is to be of or about the height that you intend to make your sluice or floodgate or the vent that you intend shall convey the overflowings of your pond in any flood that shall endanger the breaking of your pond dam Then he advises that you plant willows or owlers about it or both and then cast in bavins in some places not far from the side and in the most sandy places for fish both to spawn upon and to defend them and the young fry from the many fish and also from vermin that lie at watch to destroy them especially the spawn of the Carp and Tench when tis left to the mercy of ducks or vermin He and Dubravius and all others advise that you make choice of such a place for your pond that it may be refreshed with a little rill or with rain water running or falling into it by which fish are more inclined both to breed and are also refreshed and fed the better and do prove to be of a much sweeter and more pleasant taste To which end it is observed that such pools as be large and have most gravel and shallows where fish may sport themselves do afford fish of the purest taste And note that in all pools it is best for fish to have some retiring place as namely hollow banks or shelves or roots of trees to keep them from danger and when they think fit from the extreme heat of summer as also from the extremity of cold in winter And note that if many trees be growing about your pond the leaves thereof falling into the water make it nauseous to the fish and the fish to be so to the eater of it Tis noted that the Tench and Eel love mud and the Carp loves gravelly ground and in the hot months to feed on grass You are to cleanse your pond if you intend either profit or pleasure once every three or four years especially some ponds and then let it dry six or twelve months both to kill the water weeds as water lilies can docks reate and bulrushes that breed there and also that as these die for want of water so grass may grow in the pond s bottom which Carps will eat greedily in all the hot months if the pond be clean The letting your pond dry and sowing oats in the bottom is also good for the fish feed the faster and being sometimes let dry you may observe what kind of fish either increases or thrives best in that water for they differ much both in their breeding and feeding Lebault also advises that if your ponds be not very large and roomy that you often feed your fish by throwing into them chippings of bread curds grains or the entrails of chickens or of any fowl or beast that you kill to feed yourselves for these afford fish a great relief He says that frogs and ducks do much harm and devour both the spawn and the young fry of all fish especially of the Carp and I have besides experience many testimonies of it But Lebault allows water frogs to be good meat especially in some months if they be fat but you are to note that he is a Frenchman and we English will hardly believe him though we know frogs are usually eaten in his country however he advises to destroy them and king fishers out of your ponds And he advises not to suffer much shooting at wild fowl for that he says affrightens and harms and destroys the fish Note that Carps and Tench thrive and breed best when no other fish is put with them into the same pond for all other fish devour their spawn or at least the greatest part of it And note that clods of grass thrown into any pond feed any Carps in summer and that garden earth and parsley thrown into a pond recovers and refreshes the sick fish And note that when you store your pond you are to put into it two or three melters for one spawner if you put them into a breeding pond but if into a nurse pond or feeding pond in which they will not breed then no care is to be taken whether there be most male or female Carps It is observed that the best ponds to breed Carps are those that be stony or sandy and are warm and free from wind and that are not deep but have willow trees and grass on their sides over which the water does sometimes flow and note that Carps do more usually breed in marle pits or pits that have clean clay bottoms or in new ponds or ponds that lie dry a winter season than in old ponds that be full of mud and weeds Well Scholar I have told you the substance of all that either observation or discourse or a diligent survey of Dubravius and Lebault hath told me not that they in their long discourses have not said more but the most of the rest are so common observations as if a man should tell a good arithmetician that twice two is four I will therefore put an end to this discourse and we will here sit down and rest us The FIFTH day continued Chapter XXI Piscator and Venator Piscator Well Scholar I have held you too long about these cadis and smaller fish and rivers and fish ponds and my spirits are almost spent and so I doubt is your patience but being we are now almost at Tottenham where I first met you and where we are to part I will lose no time but give you a little direction how to make and order your lines and to colour the hair of which you make your lines for that is very needful to be known of an angler and also how to paint your rod especially your top for a right grown top is a choice commodity and should be preserved from the water soaking into it which makes it in wet weather to be heavy and fish ill favouredly and not true and also it rots quickly for want of painting and I think a good top is worth preserving or I had not taken care to keep a top above twenty years But first for your Line First note that you are to take care that your hair be round and clear and free from galls or scabs or frets for a well chosen even clear round hair of a kind of glass colour will prove as strong as three uneven scabby hairs that are ill chosen and full of galls or unevenness You shall seldom find a black hair but it is round but many white are flat and uneven therefore if you get a lock of right round clear glass colour hair make much of it And for making your line observe this rule first let your hair be clean washed ere you go about to twist it and then choose not only the clearest hair for it but hairs that be of an equal bigness for such do usually stretch all together and break all together which hairs of an unequal bigness never do but break singly and so deceive the angler that trusts to them When you have twisted your links lay them in water for a quarter of an hour at least and then twist them over again before you tie them into a line for those that do not so shall usually find their line to have a hair or two shrink and be shorter than the rest at the first fishing with it which is so much of the strength of the line lost for want of first watering it and then re twisting it and this is most visible in a seven hair line one of those which hath always a black hair in the middle And for dyeing of your hairs do it thus take a pint of strong ale half a pound of soot and a little quantity of the juice of walnut tree leaves and an equal quantity of alum put these together into a pot pan or pipkin and boil them half an hour and having so done let it cool and being cold put your hair into it and there let it lie it will turn your hair to be a kind of water or glass colour or greenish and the longer you let it lie the deeper coloured it will be You might be taught to make many other colours but it is to little purpose for doubtless the water colour or glass coloured hair is the most choice and most useful for an angler but let it not be too green But if you desire to colour hair greener then do it thus take a quart of small ale half a pound of alum then put these into a pan or pipkin and your hair into it with them then put it upon a fire and let it boil softly for half an hour and then take out your hair and let it dry and having so done then take a pottle of water and put into it two handfuls of marigolds and cover it with a tile or what you think fit and set it again on the fire where it is to boil again softly for half an hour about which time the scum will turn yellow then put into it half a pound of copperas beaten small and with it the hair that you intend to colour then let the hair be boiled softly till half the liquor be wasted and then let it cool three or four hours with your hair in it and you are to observe that the more copperas you put into it the greener it will be but doubtless the pale green is best But if you desire yellow hair which is only good when the weeds rot then put in more marigolds and abate most of the copperas or leave it quite out and take a little verdigris instead of it This for colouring your hair And as for painting your Rod which must be in oil you must first make a size with glue and water boiled together until the glue be dissolved and the size of a lye colour then strike your size upon the wood with a bristle or a brush or pencil whilst it is hot that being quite dry take white lead and a little red lead and a little coal black so much as altogether will make an ash colour grind these altogether with linseed oil let it be thick and lay it thin upon the wood with a brush or pencil this do for the ground of any colour to lie upon wood For a green take pink and verdigris and grind them together in linseed oil as thin as you can well grind it then lay it smoothly on with your brush and drive it thin once doing for the most part will serve if you lay it well and if twice be sure your first colour be thoroughly dry before you lay on a second Well Scholar having now taught you to paint your rod and we having still a mile to Tottenham High Cross I will as we walk towards it in the cool shade of this sweet honeysuckle hedge mention to you some of the thoughts and joys that have possessed my soul since we two met together And these thoughts shall be told you that you also may join with me in thankfulness to the Giver of every good and perfect gift for our happiness And that our present happiness may appear to be the greater and we the more thankful for it I will beg you to consider with me how many do even at this very time lie under the torment of the stone the gout and tooth ache and this we are free from And every misery that I miss is a new mercy and therefore let us be thankful There have been since we met others that have met disasters or broken limbs some have been blasted others thunder strucken and we have been freed from these and all those many other miseries that threaten human nature let us therefore rejoice and be thankful Nay which is a far greater mercy we are free from the insupportable burthen of an accusing tormenting conscience a misery that none can bear and therefore let us praise Him for His preventing grace and say Every misery that I miss is a new mercy Nay let me tell you there be many that have forty times our estates that would give the greatest part of it to be healthful and cheerful like us who with the expense of a little money have eat and drunk and laughed and angled and sung and slept securely and rose next day and cast away care and sung and laughed and angled again which are blessings rich men cannot purchase with all their money Let me tell you Scholar I have a rich neighbour that is always so busy that he has no leisure to laugh the whole business of his life is to get money and more money that he may still get more and more money he is still drudging on and says that Solomon says The diligent hand maketh rich and it is true indeed but he considers not that it is not in the power of riches to make a man happy for it was wisely said by a man of great observation That there be as many miseries beyond riches as on this side of them And yet God deliver us from pinching poverty and grant that having a competency we may be content and thankful Let not us repine or so much as think the gifts of God unequally dealt if we see another abound with riches when as God knows the cares that are the keys that keep those riches hang often so heavily at the rich man s girdle that they clog him with weary days and restless nights even when others sleep quietly We see but the outside of the rich man s happiness few consider him to be like the silk worm that when she seems to play is at the very same time spinning her own bowels and consuming herself and this many rich men do loading themselves with corroding cares to keep what they have probably unconscionably got Let us therefore be thankful for health and a competence and above all for a quiet conscience Let me tell you Scholar that Diogenes walked on a day with his friend to see a country fair where he saw ribbons and looking glasses and nutcrackers and fiddles and hobby horses and many other gimcracks and having observed them and all the other finnimbruns that make a complete country fair he said to his friend Lord how many things are there in this world of which Diogenes hath no need And truly it is so or might be so with very many who vex and toil themselves to get what they have no need of Can any man charge God that He hath not given him enough to make his life happy No doubtless for nature is content with a little And yet you shall hardly meet with a man that complains not of some want though he indeed wants nothing but his will it may be nothing but his will of his poor neighbour for not worshipping or not flattering him and thus when we might be happy and quiet we create trouble to ourselves I have heard of a man that was angry with himself because he was no taller and of a woman that broke her looking glass because it would not shew her face to be as young and handsome as her next neighbour s was And I knew another to whom God had given health and plenty but a wife that nature had made peevish and her husband s riches had made purse proud and must because she was rich and for no other virtue sit in the highest pew in the church which being denied her she engaged her husband into a contention for it and at last into a law suit with a dogged neighbour who was as rich as he and had a wife as peevish and purse proud as the other and this law suit begot higher oppositions and actionable words and more vexations and lawsuits for you must remember that both were rich and must therefore have their wills Well this wilful purse proud law suit lasted during the life of the first husband after which his wife vext and chid and chid and vext till she also chid and vext herself into her grave and so the wealth of these poor rich people was curst into a punishment because they wanted meek and thankful hearts for those only can make us happy I knew a man that had health and riches and several houses all beautiful and ready furnished and would often trouble himself and family to be removing from one house to another and being asked by a friend why he removed so often from one house to another replied It was to find content in some one of them But his friend knowing his temper told him If he would find content in any of his houses he must leave himself behind him for content will never dwell but in a meek and quiet soul And this may appear if we read and consider what our Saviour says in saint Matthew s Gospel for He there says Blessed be the merciful for they shall obtain mercy Blessed be the pure in heart for they shall see God Blessed be the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven And Blessed be the meek for they shall possess the earth Not that the meek shall not also obtain mercy and see God and be comforted and at last come to the kingdom of heaven but in the meantime he and he only possesses the earth as he goes towards that kingdom of heaven by being humble and cheerful and content with what his good God had allotted him He has no turbulent repining vexatious thoughts that he deserves better nor is vext when he see others possess of more honour or more riches than his wise God has allotted for his share but he possesses what he has with a meek and contented quietness such a quietness as makes his very dreams pleasing both to God and himself My honest Scholar all this is told to incline you to thankfulness and to incline you the more let me tell you and though the prophet David was guilty of murder and adultery and many other of the most deadly sins yet he was said to be a man after God s own heart because he abounded more with thankfulness that any other that is mentioned in holy scripture as may appear in his book of Psalms where there is such a commixture of his confessing of his sins and unworthiness and such thankfulness for God s pardon and mercies as did make him to be accounted even by God himself to be a man after his own heart and let us in that labour to be as like him as we can let not the blessings we receive daily from God make us not to value or not praise Him because they be common let us not forget to praise Him for the innocent mirth and pleasure we have met with since we met together What would a blind man give to see the pleasant rivers and meadows and flowers and fountains that we have met with since we met together I have been told that if a man that was born blind could obtain to have his sight for but only one hour during his whole life and should at the first opening of his eyes fix his sight upon the sun when it was in its full glory either at the rising or setting of it he would be so transported and amazed and so admire the glory of it that he would not willingly turn his eyes from that first ravishing object to behold all the other various beauties this world could present to him And this and many other like blessings we enjoy daily And for the most of them because they be so common most men forget to pay their praises but let not us because it is a sacrifice so pleasing to Him that made that sun and us and still protects us and gives us flowers and showers and stomachs and meat and content and leisure to go a fishing Well Scholar I have almost tired myself and I fear more than almost tired you But I now see Tottenham High Cross and our short walk thither shall put a period to my too long discourse in which my meaning was and is to plant that in your mind with which I labour to possess my own soul that is a meek and thankful heart And to that end I have shewed you that riches without them do not make any man happy But let me tell you that riches with them remove many fears and cares And therefore my advice is that you endeavour to be honestly rich or contentedly poor but be sure that your riches be justly got or you spoil all For it is well said by Caussin He that loses his conscience has nothing left that is worth keeping Therefore be sure you look to that And in the next place look to your health and if you have it praise God and value it next to a good conscience for health is the second blessing that we mortals are capable of a blessing that money cannot buy and therefore value it and be thankful for it As for money which may be said to be the third blessing neglect it not but note that there is no necessity of being rich for I told you there be as many miseries beyond riches as on this side them and if you have a competence enjoy it with a meek cheerful thankful heart I will tell you Scholar I have heard a grave Divine say that God has two dwellings one in heaven and the other in a meek and thankful heart which Almighty God grant to me and to my honest Scholar And so you are welcome to Tottenham High Cross Venator Well Master I thank you for all your good directions but for none more than this last of thankfulness which I hope I shall never forget And pray let s now rest ourselves in this sweet shady arbour which nature herself has woven with her own fine fingers tis such a contexture of woodbines sweetbriar jasmine and myrtle and so interwoven as will secure us both from the sun s violent heat and from the approaching shower And being set down I will requite a part of your courtesies with a bottle of sack milk oranges and sugar which all put together make a drink like nectar indeed too good for any but us Anglers And so Master here is a full glass to you of that liquor and when you have pledged me I will repeat the Verses which I promised you it is a Copy printed among some of Sir Henry Wotton s and doubtless made either by him or by a lover of angling Come Master now drink a glass to me and then I will pledge you and fall to my repetition it is a description of such country recreations as I have enjoyed since I had the happiness to fall into your company Quivering fears heart tearing cares Anxious sighs untimely tears Fly fly to courts Fly to fond worldlings sports Where strain d sardonic smiles are glosing still And Grief is forc d to laugh against her will Where mirth s but mummery And sorrows only real be Fly from our country pastimes fly Sad troops of human misery Come serene looks Clear as the crystal brooks Or the pure azur d heaven that smiles to see The rich attendance of our poverty Peace and a secure mind Which all men seek we only find Abused mortals I did you know Where joy heart s ease and comforts grow You d scorn proud towers And seek them in these bowers Where winds sometimes our woods perhaps may shake But blust ring care could never tempest make Nor murmurs e er come nigh us Saving of fountains that glide by us Here s no fantastick mask nor dance But of our kids that frisk and prance Nor wars are seen Unless upon the green Two harmless lambs are butting one the other Which done both bleating run each to his mother And wounds are never found Save what the plough share gives the ground Here are no false entrapping baits To hasten too too hasty Fates Unless it be The fond credulity Of silly fish which worldling like still look Upon the bait but never on the hook Nor envy unless among The birds for prize of their sweet song Go let the diving negro seek For gems hid in some forlorn creek We all pearls scorn Save what the dewy morn Congeals upon each little spire of grass Which careless shepherds beat down as they pass And gold ne er here appears Save what the yellow Ceres bears Blest silent groves oh may ye be For ever mirth s best nursery May pure contents For ever pitch their tents Upon these downs these meads these rocks these mountains And peace still slumber by these purling fountains Which we may every year Meet when we come a fishing here Piscator Trust me Scholar I thank you heartily for these Verses they be choicely good and doubtless made by a lover of angling Come now drink a glass to me and I will requite you with another very good copy it is a farewell to the vanities of the world and some say written by Sir Harry Wotton who I told you was an excellent angler But let them be writ by whom they will he that writ them had a brave soul and must needs be possess with happy thoughts at the time of their composure Farewell ye gilded follies pleasing troubles Farewell ye honour d rags ye glorious bubbles Fame s but a hollow echo Gold pure clay Honour the darling but of one short day Beauty th eye s idol but a damask d skin State but a golden prison to live in And torture free born minds embroider d Trains Merely but pageants for proud swelling veins And Blood allied to greatness is alone Inherited not purchas d nor our own Fame Honour Beauty State Train Blood and Birth Are but the fading blossoms of the earth I would be great but that the sun doth still Level his rays against the rising hill I would be high but see the proudest oak Most subject to the rending thunder stroke I would be rich but see men too unkind Dig in the bowels of the richest mind I would be wise but that I often see The fox suspected whilst the ass goes free I would be fair but see the fair and proud Like the bright sun oft setting in a cloud I would be poor but know the humble grass Still trampled on by each unworthy ass Rich hated wise suspected scorn d if poor Great fear d fair tempted high still envy d more I have wish d all but now I wish for neither Great high rich wise nor fair poor I ll be rather Would the World now adopt me for her heir Would beauty s Queen entitle me the fair Fame speak me fortune s minion could I vie Angels with India with a speaking eye Command bare heads bow d knees strike justice dumb As well as blind and lame or give a tongue To stones by epitaphs be call d great master In the loose rhymes of every poetaster Could I be more than any man that lives Great fair rich wise all in superlatives Yet I more freely would these gifts resign Than ever fortune would have made them mine And hold one minute of this holy leisure Beyond the riches of this empty pleasure Welcome pure thoughts welcome ye silent groves These guests these courts my soul most dearly loves Now the wing d people of the sky shall sing My cheerful anthems to the gladsome spring A pray r book now shall be my looking glass In which I will adore sweet virtue s face Here dwell no hateful looks no palace cares No broken vows dwell here nor pale fac d fears Then here I ll sit and sigh my hot love s folly And learn t affect an holy melancholy And if contentment be a stranger then I ll ne er look for it but in heaven again Venator Well Master these verses be worthy to keep a room in every man s memory I thank you for them and I thank you for your many instructions which God willing I will not forget And as saint Austin in his Confessions commemorates the kindness of his friend Verecundus for lending him and his companion a country house because there they rested and enjoyed themselves free from the troubles of the world so having had the like advantage both by your conversation and the art you have taught me I ought ever to do the like for indeed your company and discourse have been so useful and pleasant that I may truly say I have only lived since I enjoyed them and turned angler and not before Nevertheless here I must part with you here in this now sad place where I was so happy as first to meet you but I shall long for the ninth of May for then I hope again to enjoy your beloved company at the appointed time and place And now I wish for some somniferous potion that might force me to sleep away the intermitted time which will pass away with me as tediously as it does with men in sorrow nevertheless I will make it as short as I can by my hopes and wishes and my good Master I will not forget the doctrine which you told me Socrates taught his scholars that they should not think to be honoured so much for being philosophers as to honour philosophy by their virtuous lives You advised me to the like concerning Angling and I will endeavour to do so and to live like those many worthy men of which you made mention in the former part of your discourse This is my firm resolution And as a pious man advised his friend that to beget mortification he should frequent churches and view monuments and charnel houses and then and there consider how many dead bodies time had piled up at the gates of death so when I would beget content and increase confidence in the power and wisdom and providence of Almighty God I will walk the meadows by some gliding stream and there contemplate the lilies that take no care and those very many other various little living creatures that are not only created but fed man knows not how by the goodness of the God of Nature and therefore trust in him This is my purpose and so let everything that hath breath praise the Lord and let the blessing of saint Peter s Master be with mine Piscator And upon all that are lovers of virtue and dare trust in his providence and be quiet and go a Angling Study to be
