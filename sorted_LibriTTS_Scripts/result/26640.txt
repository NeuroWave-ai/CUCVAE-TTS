PUBLISHER four hundred thirteen BROADWAY eighteen sixty six Entered according to Act of Congress in the year eighteen sixty five by G W CARLETON In the Clerk s Office of the District Court for the Southern District of New York PUBLISHER S NOTE One of mister Barnum s secrets of success is his unique methods of advertising and we can readily understand how he can bear to be denounced as a Humbug because this popular designation though undeserved in the popular acceptation of it brought grist to his mill He has constantly kept himself before the public nay we may say that he has been kept before the public constantly by the stereotyped word in question and what right or what desire could he have to discard or complain of an epithet which was one of the prospering elements of his business as a showman In a narrow sense of the word he is a Humbug in the larger acceptation he is not He has in several chapters of this book elaborated the distinction and we will only say in this place what indeed no one who knows him will doubt that aside from his qualities as a caterer to popular entertainment he is one of the most remarkable men of the age As a business man of far reaching vision and singular executive force he has for years been the life of Bridgeport near which city he has long resided and last winter he achieved high rank in the Legislature of Connecticut as both an effective speaker and a patriot having no axe to grind and seeking only the public welfare We indeed agree with the editor of The New York Independent who in an article drawn out by the burning of the American Museum says mister Barnum s rare talent as a speaker has always been exercised in behalf of good morals and for patriotic objects No man has done better service in the temperance cause by public lectures during the past ten years both in America and Great Britain and during the war he was most efficient in stimulating the spirit which resulted in the preservation of the Union and the destruction of Slavery We cannot forbear quoting two or three additional paragraphs from that article especially as they are so strongly expressive of the merits of the case mister Barnum s whole career has been a very transparent one He has never befooled the public to its injury and though his name has come to be looked upon as a synonym for humbuggery there never was a public man who was less of one The hearty good wishes of many good men and the sympathies of the community in which he has lived go with him and the public he has so long amused but never abused will be ready to sustain him whenever he makes another appeal to them mister Barnum is a very good sort of representative Yankee When crowds of English traders and manufacturers in Liverpool Manchester and London flocked to hear his lectures on the art of making money they expected to hear from him some very smart recipes for knavery but they were as much astonished as they were edified to learn that the only secret he had to tell them was to be honest and not to expect something for nothing We could fill many pages with quotations of corresponding tenor from the leading and most influential men and journals in the land but we will close this publisher s note with the following from the N Y Sun One of the happiest impromptu oratorical efforts that we have heard for some time was that made by Barnum at the benefit performance given for his employes on Friday afternoon If a stranger wanted to satisfy himself how the great showman had managed so to monopolize the ear and eye of the public during his long career he could not have had a better opportunity of doing so than by listening to this address Every word though delivered with apparent carelessness struck a key note in the hearts of his listeners Simple forcible and touching it showed how thoroughly this extraordinary man comprehends the character of his countrymen and how easily he can play upon their feelings Those who look upon Barnum as a mere charlatan have really no knowledge of him It would be easy to demonstrate that the qualities that have placed him in his present position of notoriety and affluence would in another pursuit have raised him to far greater eminence In his breadth of views his profound knowledge of mankind his courage under reverses his indomitable perseverance his ready eloquence and his admirable business tact we recognise the elements that are conducive to success in most other pursuits More than almost any other living man Barnum may be said to be a representative type of the American mind INTRODUCTION In the Autobiography of P T Barnum published in eighteen fifty five I partly promised to write a book which should expose some of the chief humbugs of the world The invitation of my friends Messrs Cauldwell and Whitney of the Weekly Mercury caused me to furnish for that paper a series of articles in which I very naturally took up the subject in question This book is a revision and re arrangement of a portion of those articles If I should find that I have met a popular demand I shall in due time put forth a second volume There is not the least danger of a dearth of materials I once travelled through the Southern States in company with a magician The first day in each town he astonished his auditors with his deceptions He then announced that on the following day he would show how each trick was performed and how every man might thus become his own magician That expose spoiled the legerdemain market on that particular route for several years So if we could have a full exposure of the tricks of trade of all sorts of humbugs and deceivers of past times religious political financial scientific quackish and so forth we might perhaps look for a somewhat wiser generation to follow us I shall be well satisfied if I can do something towards so good a purpose P T BARNUM CONTENTS I PERSONAL REMINISCENCES CHAPTER I GENERAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT HUMBUG UNIVERSAL IN RELIGION IN

I PERSONAL REMINISCENCES CHAPTER I GENERAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT HUMBUG UNIVERSAL IN RELIGION IN POLITICS IN BUSINESS IN SCIENCE IN MEDICINE HOW IS IT TO CEASE THE GREATEST HUMBUG OF ALL A little reflection will show that humbug is an astonishingly wide spread phenomenon in fact almost universal And this is true although we exclude crimes and arrant swindles from the definition of it according to the somewhat careful explanation which is given in the beginning of the chapter succeeding this one I apprehend that there is no sort of object which men seek to attain whether secular moral or religious in which humbug is not very often an instrumentality Religion is and has ever been a chief chapter of human life False religions are the only ones known to two thirds of the human race even now after nineteen centuries of Christianity and false religions are perhaps the most monstrous complicated and thorough going specimens of humbug that can be found And even within the pale of Christianity how unbroken has been the succession of impostors hypocrites and pretenders male and female of every possible variety of age sex doctrine and discipline Politics and government are certainly among the most important of practical human interests Now it was a diplomatist that is a practical manager of one kind of government matters who invented that wonderful phrase a whole world full of humbug in half a dozen words that Language was given to us to conceal our thoughts It was another diplomatist who said An ambassador is a gentleman sent to lie abroad for the good of his country But need I explain to my own beloved countrymen that there is humbug in politics Does anybody go into a political campaign without it are no exaggerations of our candidate s merits to be allowed no depreciations of the other candidate Shall we no longer prove that the success of the party opposed to us will overwhelm the land in ruin Let me see Leaving out the two elections of General Washington eighteen times that very fact has been proved by the party that was beaten and immediately we have not been ruined notwithstanding that the dreadful fatal fellows on the other side got their hands on the offices and their fingers into the treasury Business is the ordinary means of living for nearly all of us And in what business is there not humbug There s cheating in all trades but ours is the prompt reply from the boot maker with his brown paper soles the grocer with his floury sugar and chicoried coffee the butcher with his mysterious sausages and queer veal the dry goods man with his damaged goods wet at the great fire and his selling at a ruinous loss the stock broker with his brazen assurance that your company is bankrupt and your stock not worth a cent if he wants to buy it the horse jockey with his black arts and spavined brutes the milkman with his tin aquaria the land agent with his nice new maps and beautiful descriptions of distant scenery the newspaper man with his immense circulation the publisher with his Great American Novel the city auctioneer with his Pictures by the Old Masters all and every one protest each his own innocence and warn you against the deceits of the rest My inexperienced friend take it for granted that they all tell the truth about each other and then transact your business to the best of your ability on your own judgment Never fear but that you will get experience enough and that you will pay well for it too and towards the time when you shall no longer need earthly goods you will begin to know how to buy Literature is one of the most interesting and significant expressions of humanity Yet books are thickly peppered with humbug Travellers stories have been the scoff of ages from the True Story of witty old Lucian the Syrian down to the gorillarities if I may coin a word of the Frenchman Du Chaillu Ireland s counterfeited Shakspeare plays Chatterton s forged manuscripts George Psalmanazar s forged Formosan language Jo Smith s Mormon Bible it should be noted that this and the Koran sounded two strings of humbug together the literary and the religious the more recent counterfeits of the notorious Greek Simonides such literary humbugs as these are equal in presumption and in ingenuity too to any of a merely business kind though usually destitute of that sort of impiety which makes the great religious humbugs horrible as well as impudent Science is another important field of human effort Science is the pursuit of pure truth and the systematizing of it In such an employment as that one might reasonably hope to find all things done in honesty and sincerity Not at all my ardent and inquiring friends there is a scientific humbug just as large as any other We have all heard of the Moon Hoax Do none of you remember the Hydrarchos Sillimannii that awful Alabama snake It was only a little while ago that a grave account appeared in a newspaper of a whole new business of compressing ice Perpetual motion has been the dream of scientific visionaries and a pretended but cheating realization of it has been exhibited by scamp after scamp I understand that one is at this moment being invented over in Jersey City I have purchased more than one perpetual motion myself Many persons will remember mister Paine The Great Shot at as he was called from his story that people were constantly trying to kill him and his water gas There have been other water gases too which were each going to show us how to set the North River on fire but something or other has always broken down just at the wrong moment Nobody seems to reflect when these water gases come up that if water could really be made to burn the right conditions would surely have happened at some one of the thousands of city fires and that the very stuff with which our stout firemen were extinguishing the flames would have itself caught and exterminated the whole brave wet crowd Medicine is the means by which we poor feeble creatures try to keep from dying or aching In a world so full of pain it would seem as if people could not be so foolish or practitioners so knavish as to sport with men s and women s and children s lives by their professional humbugs Yet there are many grave M D s who if there is nobody to hear and if they speak their minds will tell you plainly that the whole practice of medicine is in one sense a humbug One of its features is certainly a humbug though so innocent and even useful that it seems difficult to think of any objection to it This is the practice of giving a placebo that is a bread pill or a dose of colored water to keep the patient s mind easy while imagination helps nature to perfect a cure As for the quacks patent medicines and universal remedies I need only mention their names Prince Hohenlohe Valentine Greatrakes John saint John Long Doctor Graham and his wonderful bed Mesmer and his tub Perkins metallic tractors these are half a dozen Modern history knows of hundreds of such It would almost seem as if human delusions became more unreasoning and abject in proportion as their subject is of greater importance A machine a story an animal skeleton are not so very important But the humbugs which have prevailed about that wondrous machine the human body its ailments and its cures about the unspeakable mystery of human life and still more about the far greater and more awful mysteries of the life beyond the grave and the endless happiness and misery believed to exist there the humbugs about these have been infinitely more absurd more shocking more unreasonable more inhuman more destructive I can only allude to whole sciences falsely so called which are unmingled humbugs from beginning to end Such was Alchemy such was Magic such was and still is Astrology and above all Fortune telling But there is a more thorough humbug than any of these enterprises or systems The greatest humbug of all is the man who believes or pretends to believe that everything and everybody are humbugs We sometimes meet a person who professes that there is no virtue that every man has his price and every woman hers that any statement from anybody is just as likely to be false as true and that the only way to decide which is to consider whether truth or a lie was likely to have paid best in that particular case Religion he thinks one of the smartest business dodges extant a firstrate investment and by all odds the most respectable disguise that a lying or swindling business man can wear Honor he thinks is a sham Honesty he considers a plausible word to flourish in the eyes of the greener portion of our race as you would hold out a cabbage leaf to coax a donkey What people want he thinks or says he thinks is something good to eat something good to drink fine clothes luxury laziness wealth If you can imagine a hog s mind in a man s body sensual greedy selfish cruel cunning sly coarse yet stupid short sighted unreasoning unable to comprehend anything except what concerns the flesh you have your man He thinks himself philosophic and practical a man of the world he thinks to show knowledge and wisdom penetration deep acquaintance with men and things Poor fellow he has exposed his own nakedness Instead of showing that others are rotten inside he has proved that he is He claims that it is not safe to believe others it is perfectly safe to disbelieve him He claims that every man will get the better of you if possible let him alone Selfishness he says is the universal rule leave nothing to depend on his generosity or honor trust him just as far as you can sling an elephant by the tail A bad world he sneers full of deceit and nastiness it is his own foul breath that he smells only a thoroughly corrupt heart could suggest such vile thoughts He sees only what suits him as a turkey buzzard spies only carrion though amid the loveliest landscape I pronounce him who thus virtually slanders his father and dishonors his mother and defiles the sanctities of home and the glory of patriotism and the merchant s honor and the martyr s grave and the saint s crown who does not even know that every sham shows that there is a reality and that hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue I pronounce him no I do not pronounce him a humbug the word does not apply to him He is a fool Looked at on one side the history of humbug is truly humiliating to intellectual pride yet the long silly story is less absurd during the later ages of history and grows less and less so in proportion to the spread of real Christianity This religion promotes good sense actual knowledge contentment with what we cannot help and the exclusive use of intelligent means for increasing human happiness and decreasing human sorrow And whenever the time shall come when men are kind and just and honest when they only want what is fair and right judge only on real and true evidence and take nothing for granted then there will be no place left for any humbugs either harmless or hurtful CHAPTER II DEFINITION OF THE WORD HUMBUG WARREN OF LONDON GENIN THE HATTER GOSLING S BLACKING Upon a careful consideration of my undertaking to give an account of the Humbugs of the World I find myself somewhat puzzled in regard to the true definition of that word To be sure Webster says that humbug as a noun is an imposition under fair pretences and as a verb it is to deceive to impose on With all due deference to Doctor Webster I submit that according to present usage this is not the only nor even the generally accepted definition of that term We will suppose 
4226_185488_000039_000001	train-clean-360	for instance 
none	none	that a man with fair pretences applies to a wholesale merchant for credit on a large bill of goods His fair pretences comprehend an assertion that he is a moral and religious man a member of the church a man of wealth et cetera et cetera It turns out that he is not worth a dollar but is a base lying wretch an impostor and a cheat He is arrested and imprisoned for obtaining property under false pretences or as Webster says fair pretences He is punished for his villainy The public do not call him a humbug they very properly term him a swindler A man bearing the appearance of a gentleman in dress and manners purchases property from you and with fair pretences obtains your confidence You find when he has left that he paid you with counterfeit bank notes or a forged draft This man is justly called a forger or counterfeiter and if arrested he is punished as such but nobody thinks of calling him a humbug A respectable looking man sits by your side in an omnibus or rail car He converses fluently and is evidently a man of intelligence and reading He attracts your attention by his fair pretences Arriving at your journey s end you miss your watch and your pocket book Your fellow passenger proves to be the thief Everybody calls him a pickpocket and not withstanding his fair pretences not a person in the community calls him a humbug Two actors appear as stars at two rival theatres They are equally talented equally pleasing One advertises himself simply as a tragedian under his proper name the other boasts that he is a prince and wears decorations presented by all the potentates of the world including the King of the Cannibal Islands He is correctly set down as a humbug while this term is never applied to the other actor But if the man who boasts of having received a foreign title is a miserable actor and he gets up gift enterprises and bogus entertainments or pretends to devote the proceeds of his tragic efforts to some charitable object without in fact doing so he is then a humbug in doctor Webster s sense of that word for he is an impostor under fair pretences Two physicians reside in one of our fashionable avenues They were both educated in the best medical colleges each has passed an examination received his diploma and been dubbed an M D They are equally skilled in the healing art One rides quietly about the city in his gig or brougham visiting his patients without noise or clamor the other sallies out in his coach and four preceded by a band of music and his carriage and horses are covered with handbills and placards announcing his wonderful cures This man is properly called a quack and a humbug Why Not because he cheats or imposes upon the public for he does not but because as generally understood humbug consists in putting on glittering appearances outside show novel expedients by which to suddenly arrest public attention and attract the public eye and ear Clergymen lawyers or physicians who should resort to such methods of attracting the public would not for obvious reasons be apt to succeed Bankers insurance agents and others who aspire to become the custodians of the money of their fellow men would require a different species of advertising from this but there are various trades and occupations which need only notoriety to insure success always provided that when customers are once attracted they never fail to get their money s worth An honest man who thus arrests public attention will be called a humbug but he is not a swindler or an impostor If however after attracting crowds of customers by his unique displays a man foolishly fails to give them a full equivalent for their money they never patronize him a second time but they very properly denounce him as a swindler a cheat an impostor they do not however call him a humbug He fails not because he advertises his wares in an outre manner but because after attracting crowds of patrons he stupidly and wickedly cheats them When the great blacking maker of London dispatched his agent to Egypt to write on the pyramids of Ghiza in huge letters Buy Warren s Blacking thirty Strand London he was not cheating travelers upon the Nile His blacking was really a superior article and well worth the price charged for it but he was humbugging the public by this queer way of arresting attention It turned out just as he anticipated that English travelers in that part of Egypt were indignant at this desecration and they wrote back to the London Times every Englishman writes or threatens to write to the Times if anything goes wrong denouncing the Goth who had thus disfigured these ancient pyramids by writing on them in monstrous letters Buy Warren s Blacking thirty Strand London The Times published these letters and backed them up by several of those awful grand and dictatorial editorials peculiar to the great Thunderer in which the blacking maker Warren thirty Strand was stigmatized as a man who had no respect for the ancient patriarchs and it was hinted that he would probably not hesitate to sell his blacking on the sarcophagus of Pharaoh or any other mummy if he could only make money by it In fact to cap the climax Warren was denounced as a humbug These indignant articles were copied into all the Provincial journals and very soon in this manner the columns of every newspaper in Great Britain were teeming with this advice Try Warren s Blacking thirty Strand London The curiosity of the public was thus aroused and they did try it and finding it a superior article they continued to purchase it and recommend it to their friends and Warren made a fortune by it He always attributed his success to his having humbugged the public by this unique method of advertising his blacking in Egypt But Warren did not cheat his customers nor practice an imposition under fair pretences He was a humbug but he was an honest upright man and no one called him an impostor or a cheat When the tickets for Jenny Lind s first concert in America were sold at auction several business men aspiring to notoriety bid high for the first ticket It was finally knocked down to Genin the hatter for two hundred twenty five dollars The journals in Portland Maine and Houston Texas and all other journals throughout the United States between these two cities which were connected with the telegraph announced the fact in their columns the next morning Probably two millions of readers read the announcement and asked Who is Genin the hatter Genin became famous in a day Every man involuntarily examined his hat to see if it was made by Genin and an Iowa editor declared that one of his neighbors discovered the name of Genin in his old hat and immediately announced the fact to his neighbors in front of the Post Office It was suggested that the old hat should be sold at auction It was done then and there and the Genin hat sold for fourteen dollars Gentlemen from city and country rushed to Genin s store to buy their hats many of them willing to pay even an extra dollar if necessary provided they could get a glimpse of Genin himself This singular freak put thousands of dollars into the pocket of Genin the hatter and yet I never heard it charged that he made poor hats or that he would be guilty of an imposition under fair pretences On the contrary he is a gentleman of probity and of the first respectability When the laying of the Atlantic Telegraph was nearly completed I was in Liverpool I offered the company one thousand pounds sterling five thousand dollars for the privilege of sending the first twenty words over the cable to my Museum in New York not that there was any intrinsic merit in the words but that I fancied there was more than five thousand dollars worth of notoriety in the operation But Queen Victoria and Old Buck were ahead of me Their messages had the preference and I was compelled to take a back seat By thus illustrating what I believe the public will concede to be the sense in which the word humbug is generally used and understood at the present time in this country as well as in England I do not propose that my letters on this subject shall be narrowed down to that definition of the word On the contrary I expect to treat of various fallacies delusions and deceptions in ancient and modern times which according to Webster s definition may be called humbugs inasmuch as they were impositions under fair pretences In writing of modern humbugs however I shall sometimes have occasion to give the names of honest and respectable parties now living and I felt it but just that the public should fully comprehend my doctrine that a man may by common usage be termed a humbug without by any means impeaching his integrity Speaking of blacking makers reminds me that one of the first sensationists in advertising whom I remember to have seen was mister Leonard Gosling known as Monsieur Gosling the great French blacking maker He appeared in New York in eighteen thirty He flashed like a meteor across the horizon and before he had been in the city three months nearly everybody had heard of Gosling s Blacking I well remember his magnificent four in hand A splendid team of blood bays with long black tails was managed with such dexterity by Gosling himself who was a great whip that they almost seemed to fly The carriage was emblazoned with the words Gosling s Blacking in large gold letters and the whole turnout was so elaborately ornamented and bedizened that everybody stopped and gazed with wondering admiration A bugle player or a band of music always accompanied the great Gosling and of course helped to attract the public attention to his establishment At the turning of every street corner your eyes rested upon Gosling s Blacking From every show window gilded placards discoursed eloquently of the merits of Gosling s Blacking The newspapers teemed with poems written in its praise and showers of pictorial handbills illustrated almanacs and tinseled souvenirs all lauding the virtues of Gosling s Blacking smothered you at every point The celebrated originator of delineations Jim Crow Rice made his first appearance at Hamblin s Bowery Theatre at about this time The crowds which thronged there were so great that hundreds from the audience were frequently admitted upon the stage In one of his scenes Rice introduced a negro boot blacking establishment Gosling was too wide awake to let such an opportunity pass unimproved and Rice was paid for singing an original black Gosling ditty while a score of placards bearing the inscription Use Gosling s Blacking were suspended at different points in this negro boot polishing hall Everybody tried Gosling s Blacking and as it was a really good article his sales in city and country soon became immense Gosling made a fortune in seven years and retired but as with thousands before him it was easy come easy go He engaged in a lead mining speculation and it was generally understood that his fortune was in a great measure lost as rapidly as it was made Here let me digress in order to observe that one of the most difficult things in life is for men to bear discreetly sudden prosperity Unless considerable time and labor are devoted to earning money it is not appreciated by its possessor and having no practical knowledge of the value of money he generally gets rid of it with the same ease that marked its accumulation mister Astor gave the experience of thousands when he said that he found more difficulty in earning and saving his first thousand dollars than in accumulating all the subsequent millions which finally made up his fortune The very economy perseverance and discipline which he was obliged to practice as he gained his money dollar by dollar gave him a just appreciation of its value and thus led him into those habits of industry prudence temperance and untiring diligence so conducive and necessary to his future success mister Gosling however was not a man to be put down by a single financial reverse He opened a store in Canajoharie N Y which was burned and on which there was no insurance He came again to New York in eighteen thirty nine and established a restaurant where by devoting the services of himself and several members of his family assiduously to the business he soon reveled in his former prosperity and snapped his fingers in glee at what unreflecting persons term the freaks of Dame Fortune He is still living in New York hale and hearty at the age of seventy Although called a French blacking maker mister Gosling is in reality a Dutchman having been born in the city of Amsterdam Holland He is the father of twenty four children twelve of whom are still living to cheer him in his declining years and to repay him in grateful attentions for the valuable lessons of prudence integrity and industry through the adoption of which they are honored as respectable and worthy members of society I cannot however permit this chapter to close without recording a protest in principle against that method of advertising of which Warren s on the Pyramid is an instance Not that it is a crime or even an immorality in the usual sense of the words but it is a violent offence against good taste and a selfish and inexcusable destruction of other people s enjoyments No man ought to advertise in the midst of landscapes or scenery in such a way as to destroy or injure their beauty by introducing totally incongruous and relatively vulgar associations Too many transactions of the sort have been perpetrated in our own country The principle on which the thing is done is to seek out the most attractive spot possible the wildest the most lovely and there in the most staring and brazen manner to paint up advertisements of quack medicines rum or as the case may be in letters of monstrous size in the most obtrusive colors in such a prominent place and in such a lasting way as to destroy the beauty of the scene both thoroughly and permanently Any man with a beautiful wife or daughter would probably feel disagreeably if he should find branded indelibly across her smooth white forehead or on her snowy shoulder in blue and red letters such a phrase as this Try the Jigamaree Bitters Very much like this is the sort of advertising I am speaking of It is not likely that I shall be charged with squeamishness on this question I can readily enough see the selfishness and vulgarity of this particular sort of advertising however It is outrageously selfish to destroy the pleasure of thousands for the sake of a chance of additional gain And it is an atrocious piece of vulgarity to flaunt the names of quack nostrums and of the coarse stimulants of sots among the beautiful scenes of nature The pleasure of such places depends upon their freedom from the associations of every day concerns and troubles and weaknesses A lovely nook of forest scenery or a grand rock like a beautiful woman depends for much of its attractiveness upon the attendant sense of freedom from whatever is low upon a sense of purity and of romance And it is about as nauseous to find Bitters or Worm Syrup daubed upon the landscape as it would be upon the lady s brow Since writing this I observe that two legislatures those of New Hampshire and New York have passed laws to prevent this dirty misdemeanor It is greatly to their credit and it is in good season For it is matter of wonder that some more colossal vulgarian has not stuck up a sign a mile long on the Palisades But it is matter of thankfulness too At the White Mountains many grand and beautiful views have been spoiled by these nostrum and bedbug souled fellows It is worth noticing that the chief haunts of the city of New York the Central Park has thus far remained unviolated by the dirty hands of these vulgar advertisers Without knowing anything about it I have no doubt whatever that the commissioners have been approached often by parties desiring the privilege of advertising within its limits Among the advertising fraternity it would be thought a gigantic opportunity to be able to flaunt the name of some bug poison fly killer bowel rectifier or disguised rum along the walls of the Reservoir upon the delicate stone work of the Terrace or the graceful lines of the Bow Bridge to nail up a tin sign on every other tree to stick one up right in front of every seat to keep a gang of young wretches thrusting pamphlet or handbill into every person s palm that enters the gate to paint a vulgar sign across every gray rock to cut quack words in ditch work in the smooth green turf of the mall or ball ground I have no doubt that it is the peremptory decision and clear good taste of the Commissioners alone which have kept this last retreat of nature within our crowded city from being long ago plastered and daubed with placards handbills sign boards and paint from side to side and from end to end over turf tree rock wall bridge archway building and all CHAPTER III MONSIEUR MANGIN THE FRENCH HUMBUG One of the most original unique and successful humbugs of the present day was the late Monsieur Mangin the blacklead pencil maker of Paris 
4172-185480-0000	train-other-500	Few persons who have visited the French capital within the last ten or twelve years can have failed to have seen him and once seen he was not to be forgotten While passing through the public streets there was nothing in his personal appearance to distinguish him
none	none	 from any ordinary gentlemen 
4172-185480-0001	train-other-500	He drove a pair of bay horses attached to an open carriage with two seats the back one always occupied by his valet
none	none	 Sometimes he would take up his stand in the Champs Elysees 
4172-185480-0002	train-other-500	at other times near the column in the Place Vendome but usually
none	none	 he was seen in the afternoon in the Place de la Bastille 
4172-185480-0003	train-other-500	or the Place de la Madeleine On Sundays his favorite locality was the Place de la Bourse
none	none	 Mangin was a well formed stately looking individual 
4172-185480-0004	train-other-500	with a most self satisfied countenance which seemed to say I am master here
none	none	 and all that my auditors have to do is to listen and obey 
4172-185480-0005	train-other-500	Arriving at his destined stopping place his carriage halted His servant handed him a case from which he took several large portraits of himself which he hung prominently upon the sides of his carriage
4172-185480-0006	train-other-500	and also placed in front of him a vase filled with medals bearing his likeness on one side and a description of his pencils on the other He then leisurely commenced a change of costume
4172-185480-0007	train-other-500	His round hat was displaced by a magnificent burnished helmet mounted with rich plumes of various brilliant colors His overcoat was laid aside and he donned in its stead
4172-185480-0008	train-other-500	a costly velvet tunic with gold fringes He then drew a pair of polished steel gauntlets upon his hands
none	none	 covered his breast with a brilliant cuirass 
4172-185480-0009	train-other-500	and placed a richly mounted sword at his side His servant watched him closely and upon receiving a sign from his master he too put on his official costume which consisted of a velvet robe
4172-185480-0010	train-other-500	and a helmet The servant then struck up a tune on the richly toned organ which always formed a part
none	none	 of Mangin s outfit 
4172-185480-0011	train-other-500	The grotesque appearance of these individuals and the music soon drew together an admiring crowd Then the great charlatan stood upon his feet His manner was calm dignified
4172-185480-0012	train-other-500	imposing indeed almost solemn for his face was as serious as that of the chief mourner at a funeral His sharp intelligent eye scrutinized the throng which was pressing around his carriage until
4172-185480-0013	train-other-500	it rested apparently upon some particular individual when he gave a start then with a dark angry expression as if the sight was repulsive he abruptly dropped the visor of his helmet
4172-185480-0014	train-other-500	and thus covered his face from the gaze of the anxious crowd This bit of coquetry produced the desired effect in whetting the appetite of the multitude who were impatiently waiting to hear him speak
none	none	 When he had carried this kind of by play as far as he thought the audience would bear it 
4172-185480-0015	train-other-500	he raised his hand and his servant understanding the sign stopped the organ
none	none	 Mangin then rang a small bell 
4172-185480-0016	train-other-500	stepped forward to the front of the carriage gave a slight cough indicative of a preparation to speak opened his mouth but instantly giving a more fearful start and assuming a more sudden frown than before he took his seat
4172-185480-0017	train-other-500	as if quite overcome by some unpleasant object which his eyes had rested upon Thus far he had not spoken a word At last the prelude ended and the comedy commenced
4172-185480-0018	train-other-500	Stepping forward again to the front of his carriage where all the gaping crowd could catch every word he exclaimed Gentlemen you look astonished You seem to wonder and ask yourselves
4172-185480-0019	train-other-500	who is this modern Quixote What mean this costume of by gone centuries this golden chariot these richly caparisoned steeds What is the name and purpose of this curious knight errant
4172-185480-0020	train-other-500	Gentlemen I will condescend to answer your queries
none	none	 I am Monsieur Mangin 
4172-185480-0021	train-other-500	the great charlatan of France Yes gentlemen I am a charlatan a mountebank it is my profession not from choice but from necessity You gentlemen created that necessity
4172-185480-0022	train-other-500	You would not patronize true unpretending honest merit but you are attracted by my glittering casque my sweeping crest my waving plumes
4172-185480-0023	train-other-500	You are captivated by din and glitter and therein lies my strength Years ago I hired a modest shop in the Rue Rivoli but I could not sell pencils enough to pay my rent whereas by assuming this disguise
none	none	 it is nothing else 
4172-185480-0024	train-other-500	I have succeeded in attracting general attention and in selling literally millions of my pencils and I assure you there is at this moment scarcely an artist in France or in Great Britain
4172-185480-0025	train-other-500	who don t know that I manufacture by far the best blacklead pencils ever seen And this assertion was indeed true His pencils were everywhere acknowledged to be superior to any other
none	none	 While he was thus addressing his audience 
4172-185480-0026	train-other-500	he would take a blank card and with one of his pencils would pretend to be drawing the portrait of some man standing near him then showing his picture to the crowd it proved to be the head of a donkey
none	none	 which of course produced roars of laughter There do you see what wonderful pencils these are Did you ever behold a more striking likeness 
4172-185480-0027	train-other-500	A hearty laugh would be sure to follow and then he would exclaim Now who will have the first pencil only five sous One would buy and then another a third and a fourth would follow
4172-185480-0028	train-other-500	and with the delivery of each pencil he would rattle off a string of witticisms which kept his patrons in capital good humor and frequently he would sell from two hundred to five hundred pencils in immediate succession
4172-185480-0029	train-other-500	Then he would drop down in his carriage for a few minutes and wipe the perspiration from his face while his servant played another overture on the organ This gave his purchasers a chance to withdraw
4172-185480-0030	train-other-500	and afforded a good opportunity for a fresh audience to congregate Then would follow a repetition of his previous sales and in this way he would continue for hours
4172-185480-0031	train-other-500	To those disposed to have a souvenir of the great humbug he would sell six pencils a medal and a photograph of himself for a franc twenty cents
4172-185480-0032	train-other-500	After taking a rest he would commence a new speech When I was modestly dressed like any of my hearers
none	none	 I was half starved 
4172-185480-0033	train-other-500	Punch and his bells would attract crowds but my good pencils attracted nobody I imitated Punch and his bells and now I have two hundred depots in Paris I dine at the best cafes drink the best wine
4172-185480-0034	train-other-500	live on the best of everything while my defamers get poor and lank as they deserve to be
none	none	 Who are my defamers 
4172-185480-0035	train-other-500	Envious swindlers Men who try to ape me but are too stupid and too dishonest to succeed They endeavor to attract notice as mountebanks
4172-185480-0036	train-other-500	and then foist upon the public worthless trash and hope thus to succeed Ah defamers of mine you are fools as well as knaves Fools to think that any man can succeed by systematically and persistently cheating the public
4172-185480-0037	train-other-500	Knaves for desiring the public s money without giving them an equivalent I am an honest man
none	none	 I have no bad habits and I now declare if any trader inventor manufacturer or philanthropist will show me better pencils than mine I will give him one thousandf no not to him for I abhor betting but to the poor of the Thirty first Arrondissement where I live Mangin s harangues were always accompanied 
4172-185480-0038	train-other-500	by a peculiar play of feature and of voice and with unique and original gestures which seemed to excite and captivate his audience About seven years ago I met him in one of the principal restaurants in the Palais Royale
4172-185480-0039	train-other-500	A mutual friend introduced me
none	none	 Ah said he Monsieur Barnum 
4172-185480-0040	train-other-500	I am delighted to see you I have read your book with infinite satisfaction It has been published here in numerous editions I see you have the right idea of things Your motto is a good one
none	none	 we study to please 
4172-185480-0041	train-other-500	I have much wanted to visit America but I cannot speak English so I must remain in my dear belle France I remarked that I had often seen him in public and bought his pencils Aha you never saw better pencils
4172-185480-0042	train-other-500	You know I could never maintain my reputation if I sold poor pencils But sacre bleu my miserable would be imitators do not know our grand secret First attract the public by din and tinsel
4172-185480-0043	train-other-500	by brilliant sky rockets and Bengola lights then give them as much as possible for their money You are very happy I replied in your manner of attracting the public Your costume is elegant
4172-185480-0044	train-other-500	your chariot is superb and your valet and music are sure to draw Thank you for your compliment mister B but I have not forgotten your Buffalo hunt your Mermaid nor your Woolly Horse They were a good offset to my rich helmet and sword
none	none	 my burnished gauntlets and gaudy cuirass 
4172-185480-0045	train-other-500	Both are intended as advertisements of something genuine and both answer the purpose After comparing notes in this way for an hour we parted and his last words were mister B
4172-185480-0046	train-other-500	I have got a grand humbug in my head which I shall put in practice within a year and it shall double the sale of my pencils Don t ask me what it is but within one year you shall see it for yourself and you shall acknowledge
none	none	 Monsieur Mangin 
4172-185480-0047	train-other-500	knows something of human nature My idea is
none	none	 magnifique 
4172-185480-0048	train-other-500	but it is one grand secret
none	none	 I confess my curiosity was somewhat excited and I hoped that Monsieur Mangin would 
4172-185480-0049	train-other-500	add another wrinkle to my horns But poor fellow within four months after I bade him adieu the Paris newspapers announced his sudden death They added that he had left two hundred thousand francs
4172-185480-0050	train-other-500	which he had given in his will to charitable objects The announcement was copied into nearly all the papers on the Continent and in Great Britain for almost everybody had seen or heard of the eccentric pencil maker
4172-185480-0051	train-other-500	His death caused many an honest sigh and his absence seemed to cast a gloom over several of his favorite halting places The Parisians really loved him and were proud of his genius
none	none	 Well people in Paris would remark Mangin was a clever fellow 
4172-185480-0052	train-other-500	He was shrewd and possessed a thorough knowledge of the world He was a gentleman and a man of intelligence extremely agreeable and witty His habits were good he was charitable He never cheated anybody
4172-185480-0053	train-other-500	He always sold a good article and no person who purchased from him had cause to complain I confess I felt somewhat chagrined that the Monsieur had thus suddenly taken French leave
4172-185480-0054	train-other-500	without imparting to me the grand secret by which he was to double the sales of his pencils But I had not long to mourn on that account
none	none	 for after Monsieur Mangin had been for six months 
4172-185480-0055	train-other-500	as they say of John Brown mouldering in his grave judge of the astonishment and delight of all Paris at his reappearance in his native city in precisely the same costume and carriage as formerly
4172-185480-0056	train-other-500	and heralded by the same servant and organ that had always attended him
none	none	 It now turned out that Monsieur Mangin had lived in the most rigid seclusion for half a year 
4172-185480-0057	train-other-500	and that the extensively circulated announcements of his sudden death had been made by himself merely as an advertising dodge to bring him still more into notice and give the public something to talk about
none	none	 I met Mangin in Paris soon after this event 
4172-185480-0058	train-other-500	Aha Monsieur Barnum he exclaimed did I not tell you I had a new humbug that would double the sales of my pencils I assure you my sales are more than quadrupled
none	none	 and it is sometimes impossible to have them manufactured fast enough to supply the demand 
4172-185480-0059	train-other-500	You Yankees are very clever but by gar none of you have discovered you should live all the better if you would die for six months
none	none	 It took Mangin to teach you that 
4172-185480-0060	train-other-500	The patronizing air with which he made this speech slapping me at the same time familiarly upon the back
none	none	 showed him in his true character of egotist Although good natured and social to a degree he was really one of the most self conceited men I ever met Monsieur Mangin died the present year and it is said that his heirs received more than half a million of francs as the fruit of his eccentric labors CHAPTER IV OLD GRIZZLY ADAMS thirty seven James C Adams or Grizzly Adams as he was generally termed from the fact of his having captured so many grizzly bears and encountered such fearful perils by his unexampled daring was an extraordinary character For many years a hunter and trapper in the Rocky and Sierra Nevada Mountains he acquired a recklessness which added to his natural invincible courage rendered him truly one of the most striking men of the age He was emphatically what the English call a man of pluck In eighteen sixty he arrived in New York with his famous collection of California animals captured by himself consisting of twenty or thirty immense grizzly bears at the head of which stood Old Sampson now in the American Museum wolves half a dozen other species of bear California lions tigers buffalo elk et cetera and Old Neptune the great sea lion from the Pacific Old Adams had trained all these monsters so that with him they were as docile as kittens while many of the most ferocious among them would attack a stranger without hesitation if he came within their grasp In fact the training of these animals was no fool s play as Old Adams learned to his cost for the terrific blows which he received from time to time while teaching them docility finally cost him his life When Adams and his other wild beasts for he was nearly as wild as any of them arrived in New York he called immediately at the Museum He was dressed in his hunter s suit of buckskin trimmed with the skins and bordered with the hanging tails of small Rocky Mountain animals his cap consisting of the skin of a wolf s head and shoulders from which depended several tails as natural as life and under which appeared his stiff bushy gray hair and his long white grizzly beard In fact Old Adams was quite as much of a show as his bears They had come around Cape Horn on the clipper ship Golden Fleece and a sea voyage of three and a half months had probably not added much to the beauty or neat appearance of the old bear hunter During our conversation Grizzly Adams took off his cap and showed me the top of his head His skull was literally broken in It had on various occasions been struck by the fearful paws of his grizzly students and the last blow from the bear called General Fremont had laid open his brain so that its workings were plainly visible I remarked that I thought that was a dangerous wound and might possibly prove fatal Yes replied Adams that will fix me out It had nearly healed but old Fremont opened it for me for the third or fourth time before I left California and he did his business so thoroughly I m a used up man However I reckon I may live six months or a year yet This was spoken as coolly as if he had been talking about the life of a dog The immediate object of Old Adams in calling upon me was this I had purchased one half interest in his California menagerie from a man who had come by way of the Isthmus from California and who claimed to own an equal interest with Adams in the show Adams declared that the man had only advanced him some money and did not possess the right to sell half of the concern However the man held a bill of sale for one half of the California Menagerie and Old Adams finally consented to accept me as an equal partner in the speculation saying that he guessed I could do the managing part and he would show up the animals I obtained a canvas tent and erecting it on the present site of Wallack s Theatre Adams there opened his novel California Menagerie On the morning of opening a band of music preceded a procession of animal cages down Broadway and up the Bowery Old Adams dressed in his hunting costume heading the line with a platform wagon on which were placed three immense grizzly bears two of which he held by chains while he was mounted on the back of the largest grizzly which stood in the centre and was not secured in any manner whatever This was the bear known as General Fremont and so docile had he become that Adams said he had used him as a packbear to carry his cooking and hunting apparatus through the mountains for six months and had ridden him hundreds of miles But apparently docile as were many of these animals there was not one among them that would not occasionally give even Adams a sly blow or a sly bite when a good chance offered hence Old Adams was but a wreck of his former self and expressed pretty nearly the truth when he said mister Barnum I am not the man I was five years ago Then I felt able to stand the hug of any grizzly living and was always glad to encounter single handed any sort of an animal that dared present himself But I have been beaten to a jelly torn almost limb from limb and nearly chawed up and spit out by these treacherous grizzly bears However I am good for a few months yet and by that time I hope we shall gain enough to make my old woman comfortable for I have been absent from her some years His wife came from Massachusetts to New York and nursed him doctor Johns dressed his wounds every day and not only told Adams he could never recover but assured his friends that probably a very few weeks would lay him in his grave But Adams was as firm as adamant and as resolute as a lion Among the thousands who saw him dressed in his grotesque hunter s suit and witnessed the apparent vigor with which he performed the savage monsters beating and whipping them into apparently the most perfect docility probably not one suspected that this rough fierce looking powerful demi savage as he appeared to be was suffering intense pain from his broken skull and fevered system and that nothing kept him from stretching himself on his deathbed but that most indomitable and extraordinary will of his After the exhibition had been open six weeks the Doctor insisted that Adams should sell out his share in the animals and settle up all his worldly affairs for he assured him that he was growing weaker every day and his earthly existence must soon terminate I shall live a good deal longer than you doctors think for replied Adams doggedly and then seeming after all to realize the truth of the Doctor s assertion he turned to me and said Well mister B you must buy me out He named his price for his half of the show and I accepted his offer We had arranged to exhibit the bears in Connecticut and Massachusetts during the summer in connection with a circus and Adams insisted that I should hire him to travel for the summer and exhibit the bears in their curious performances He offered to go for sixty dollars per week and traveling expenses of himself and wife I replied that I would gladly engage him as long as he could stand it but I advised him to give up business and go to his home in Massachusetts for I remarked you are growing weaker every day and at best cannot stand it more than a fortnight What will you give me extra if I will travel and exhibit the bears every day for ten weeks asked old Adams eagerly Five hundred dollars I replied with a laugh Done exclaimed Adams I will do it so draw up an agreement to that effect at once But mind you draw it payable to my wife for I may be too weak to attend to business after the ten weeks are up and if I perform my part of the contract I want her to get the five hundred dollars without any trouble I drew up a contract to pay him sixty dollars per week for his services and if he continued to exhibit the bears for ten consecutive weeks I was then to hand him or his wife five hundred dollars extra You have lost your five hundred dollars exclaimed Adams on taking the contract for I am bound to live and earn it I hope you may with all my heart and a hundred years more if you desire it I replied Call me a fool if I don t earn the five hundred dollars exclaimed Adams with a triumphant laugh The show started off in a few days and at the end of a fortnight I met it at Hartford Connecticut Well says I Adams you seem to stand it pretty well I hope you and your wife are comfortable Yes he replied with a laugh and you may as well try to be comfortable too for your five hundred dollars is a goner All right I replied I hope you will grow better every day But I saw by his pale face and other indications that he was rapidly failing In three weeks more I met him again at New Bedford Mass It seemed to me then that he could not live a week for his eyes were glassy and his hands trembled but his pluck was great as ever This hot weather is pretty bad for me he said but my ten weeks are half expired and I am good for your five hundred dollars and probably a month or two longer This was said with as much bravado as if he was offering to bet upon a horse race I offered to pay him half of the five hundred dollars if he would give up and go home but he peremptorily declined making any compromise whatever I met him the ninth week in Boston He had failed considerably since I last saw him but he still continued to exhibit the bears and chuckled over his almost certain triumph I laughed in return and sincerely congratulated him on his nerve and probable success I remained with him until the tenth week was finished and handed him his five hundred dollars He took it with a leer of satisfaction and remarked that he was sorry I was a teetotaller for he would like to stand treat Just before the menagerie left New York I had paid one hundred fifty dollars for a new hunting suit made of beaver skins similar to the one which Adams had worn This I intended for Herr Driesbach the animal tamer who was engaged by me to take the place of Adams whenever he should be compelled to give up Adams on starting from New York asked me to loan this new dress to him to perform in once in a while in a fair day when we had a large audience for his own costume was considerably soiled I did so and now when I handed him his five hundred dollars he remarked mister B I suppose you are going to give me this new hunting dress Oh no I replied I got that for your successor who will exhibit the bears to morrow besides you have no possible use for it Now don t be mean but lend me the dress if you won t give it to me for I want to wear it home to my native village I could not refuse the poor old man anything and I therefore replied Well Adams I will lend you the dress but you will send it back to me Yes when I have done with it he replied with an evident chuckle of triumph I thought to myself he will soon be done with it and replied That s all right A new idea evidently seized him for with a brightening look of satisfaction he said Now Barnum you have made a good thing out of the California menagerie and so have I but you will make a heap more So if you won t give me this new hunter s dress just draw a little writing and sign it saying that I may wear it until I have done with it Of course I knew that in a few days at longest he would be done with this world altogether and to gratify him I cheerfully drew and signed the paper Come old Yankee I ve got you this time see if I hain t exclaimed Adams with a broad grin as he took the paper I smiled and said All right my dear fellow the longer you live the better I shall like it We parted and he went to Neponset a small town near Boston where his wife and daughter lived He took at once to his bed and never rose from it again The excitement had passed away and his vital energies could accomplish no more The fifth day after arriving home the physician told him he could not live until the next morning He received the announcement in perfect calmness and with the most apparent indifference then turning to his wife with a smile he requested her to have him buried in the new hunting suit For said he Barnum agreed to let me have it until I have done with it and I was determined to fix his flint this time He shall never see that dress again His wife assured him that his request should be complied with He then sent for the clergyman and they spent several hours in communing together Adams told the clergyman he had told some pretty big stories about his bears but he had always endeavored to do the straight thing between man and man I have attended preaching every day Sundays and all said he for the last six years Sometimes an old grizzly gave me the sermon sometimes it was a panther often it was the thunder and lightning the tempest or the hurricane on the peaks of the Sierra Nevada or in the gorges of the Rocky Mountains but whatever preached to me it always taught me the majesty of the Creator and revealed to me the undying and unchanging love of our kind Father in heaven Although I am a pretty rough customer continued the dying man I fancy my heart is in about the right place and look with confidence to the blessed Saviour for that rest which I so much need and which I have never enjoyed upon earth He then desired the clergyman to pray with him after which he grasped him by the hand thanked him for his kindness and bade him farewell In another hour his spirit had taken its flight and it was said by those present that his face lighted up into a smile as the last breath escaped him and that smile he carried into his grave Almost his last words were Won t Barnum open his eyes when he finds I have humbugged him by being buried in his new hunting dress That dress was indeed the shroud in which he was entombed And that was the last on earth of Old Grizzly Adams FOOTNOTES thirty seven Although the subject of the following sketch can hardly be classed under the head of Humbugs he was an original genius and a knowledge of some of his prominent traits seems appropriate in connection with one or two other passages of this book CHAPTER V THE GOLDEN PIGEONS GRIZZLY ADAMS GERMAN CHEMIST HAPPY FAMILY FRENCH NATURALIST Old Grizzly Adams was quite candid when in his last hours he confessed to the clergyman that he had told some pretty large stories about his bears In fact these large stories were Adam s besetting sin To hear him talk one would suppose that he had seen and handled everything ever read or heard of In fact according to his story California contained specimens of all things animate and inanimate to be found in any part of the globe He talked glibly about California lions California tigers California leopards California hyenas California camels and California hippopotami He furthermore declared he had on one occasion seen a California elephant at a great distance but it was very shy and he would not permit himself to doubt that California giraffes existed somewhere in the neighborhood of the tall trees I was anxious to get a chance of exposing to Adams his weak point and of showing him the absurdity of telling such ridiculous stories A fit occasion soon presented itself One day while engaged in my office at the Museum a man with marked Teutonic features and accent approached the door and asked if I would like to buy a pair of living golden pigeons Yes I replied I would like a flock of golden pigeons if I could buy them for their weight in silver for there are no golden pigeons in existence unless they are made from the pure metal You shall see some golden pigeons alive he replied at the same time entering my office and closing the door after him He then removed the lid from a small basket which he carried in his hand and sure enough there were snugly ensconced a pair of beautiful living ruff necked pigeons as yellow as saffron and as bright as a double eagle fresh from the mint I confess I was somewhat staggered at this sight and quickly asked the man where those birds came from A dull lazy smile crawled over the sober face of my German visitor as he replied in a slow guttural tone of voice What you think yourself Catching his meaning I quickly answered I think it is a humbug Of course I know you will say so because you forstha such things better as any man living so I shall not try to humbug you I have color them myself On further inquiry I learned that this German was a chemist and that he possessed the art of coloring birds any hue desired and yet retain a natural gloss on the feathers which gave every shade the appearance of reality I can paint a green pigeon or a blue pigeon a gray pigeon or a black pigeon a brown pigeon or a pigeon half blue and half green said the German and if you prefer it I can paint them pink or purple or give you a little of each color and make you a rainbow pigeon The rainbow pigeon did not strike me as particularly desirable but thinking here was a good chance to catch Grizzly Adams I bought the pair of golden pigeons for ten dollars and sent them up to the Happy Family marked Golden Pigeons from California mister Taylor the great pacificator who has charge of the Happy Family soon came down in a state of perspiration Really mister Barnum said he I could not think of putting those elegant golden pigeons into the Happy Family they are too valuable a bird they might get injured they are by far the most beautiful pigeons I ever saw and as they are so rare I would not jeopardize their lives for anything Well I replied you may put them in a separate cage properly labeled Monsieur Guillaudeu the naturalist and taxidermist of the Museum has been attached to that establishment since the year it was founded eighteen ten He is a Frenchman and has read everything upon Natural History that was ever published in his own or in the English language He is now seventy five years old but is lively as a cricket and takes as much interest in Natural History as he ever did When he saw the golden pigeons from California he was considerably astonished He examined them with great delight for half an hour expatiating upon their beautiful color and the near resemblance which every feature bore to the American ruff neck pigeon He soon came to my office and said mister B these golden pigeons are superb but they cannot be from California Audubon mentions no such bird in his work upon American Ornithology I told him he had better take Audubon home with him that night and perhaps by studying him attentively he would see occasion to change his mind The next day the old naturalist called at my office and remarked mister B those pigeons are a more rare bird than you imagine They are not mentioned by Linnaeus Cuvier Goldsmith or any other writer on Natural History so far as I have been able to discover I expect they must have come from some unexplored portion of Australia Never mind I replied we may get more light on the subject perhaps before long We will continue to label them California Pigeons until we can fix their nativity elsewhere The next morning Old Grizzly Adams whose exhibition of bears was then open in Fourteenth street happened to be passing through the Museum when his eyes fell on the Golden California Pigeons He looked a moment and doubtless admired He soon after came to my office mister B said he you must let me have those California pigeons I can t spare them I replied But you must spare them All the birds and animals from California ought to be together You own half of my California menagerie and you must lend me those pigeons mister Adams they are too rare and valuable a bird to be hawked about in that manner besides I expect they will attract considerable attention here Oh don t be a fool replied Adams Rare bird indeed Why they are just as common in California as any other pigeon I could have brought a hundred of them from San Francisco if I had thought of it But why did you not think of it I asked with a suppressed smile Because they are so common there said Adams I did not think they would be any curiosity here I have eaten them in pigeon pies hundreds of times and shot them by the thousand I was ready to burst with laughter to see how readily Adams swallowed the bait but maintaining the most rigid gravity I replied Oh well mister Adams if they are really so common in California you had probably better take them and you may write over and have half a dozen pairs sent to me for the Museum All right said Adams I will send over to a friend in San Francisco and you shall have them here in a couple of months I told Adams that for certain reasons I would prefer to change the label so as to have it read Golden Pigeons from Australia Well call them what you like replied Adams I suppose they are probably about as plenty in Australia as they are in California I fancied I could discover a sly smile lurking in the eye of the old bear hunter as he made this reply The pigeons were labeled as I suggested and this is how it happened that the Bridgeport non believing lady mentioned in the next chapter was so much attracted as to solicit some of their eggs in order to perpetuate the species in old Connecticut Six or eight weeks after this incident I was in the California Menagerie and noticed that the Golden Pigeons had assumed a frightfully mottled appearance Their feathers had grown out and they were half white Adams had been so busy with his bears that he had not noticed the change I called him up to the pigeon cage and remarked mister Adams I fear you will lose your Golden Pigeons they must be very sick I observe they are turning quite pale Adams looked at them a moment with astonishment then turning to me and seeing that I could not suppress a smile he indignantly exclaimed Blast the Golden Pigeons You had better take them back to the Museum You can t humbug me with your painted pigeons This was too much and I laughed till I cried to witness the mixed look of astonishment and vexation which marked the grizzly features of old Adams These Golden Pigeons I remarked are very common in California I think I heard you say When do you expect my half dozen pairs will arrive You go to thunder you old humbug replied Adams as he marched off indignantly and soon disappeared behind the cages of his grizzly bears From that time Adams seemed to be more careful about telling his large stories Perhaps he was not cured altogether of his habit but he took particular pains when making marvelous statements to have them of such a nature that they could not be disproved so easily as was that regarding the Golden California Pigeons CHAPTER VI THE WHALE THE ANGEL FISH AND THE GOLDEN PIGEON If the fact could be definitely determined I think it would be discovered that in this wide awake country there are more persons humbugged by believing too little than too much Many persons have such a horror of being taken in or such an elevated opinion of their own acuteness that they believe everything to be a sham and in this way are continually humbugging themselves Several years since I purchased a living white whale captured near Labrador and succeeded in placing it in good condition in a large tank fifty feet long and supplied with salt water in the basement of the American Museum I was obliged to light the basement with gas and that frightened the sea monster to such an extent that he kept at the bottom of the tank except when he was compelled to stick his nose above the surface in order to breathe or blow and then down he would go again as quick as possible Visitors would sometimes stand for half an hour watching in vain to get a look at the whale for although he could remain under water only about two minutes at a time he would happen to appear in some unlooked for quarter of the huge tank and before they could all get a chance to see him he would be out of sight again Some impatient and incredulous persons after waiting ten minutes which seemed to them an hour would sometimes exclaim Oh humbug I don t believe there is a whale here at all This incredulity often put me out of patience and I would say Ladies and gentlemen there is a living whale in the tank He is frightened by the gaslight and by visitors but he is obliged to come to the surface every two minutes and if you will watch sharply you will see him I am sorry we can t make him dance a hornpipe and do all sorts of wonderful things at the word of command but if you will exercise your patience a few minutes longer I assure you the whale will be seen at considerably less trouble than it would be to go to Labrador expressly for that purpose This would usually put my patrons in good humor but I was myself often vexed at the persistent stubbornness of the whale in not calmly floating on the surface for the gratification of my visitors One day a sharp Yankee lady and her daughter from Connecticut called at the Museum I knew them well and in answer to their inquiry for the locality of the whale I directed them to the basement Half an hour afterward they called at my office and the acute mother in a half confidential serio comic whisper said mister B it s astonishing to what a number of purposes the ingenuity of us Yankees has applied india rubber I asked her meaning and was soon informed that she was perfectly convinced that it was an india rubber whale worked by steam and machinery by means of which he was made to rise to the surface at short intervals and puff with the regularity of a pair of bellows From her earnest confident manner I saw it would be useless to attempt to disabuse her mind on the subject I therefore very candidly acknowledged that she was quite too sharp for me and I must plead guilty to the imposition but I begged her not to expose me for I assured her that she was the only person who had discovered the trick It was worth more than a dollar to see with what a smile of satisfaction she received the assurance that nobody else was as shrewd as herself and the patronizing manner in which she bade me be perfectly tranquil for the secret should be considered by her as strictly confidential was decidedly rich She evidently received double her money s worth in the happy reflection that she could not be humbugged and that I was terribly humiliated in being detected through her marvelous powers of discrimination I occasionally meet the good lady and always try to look a little sheepish but she invariably assures me that she has never divulged my secret and never will On another occasion a lady equally shrewd who lives neighbor to me in Connecticut after regarding for a few minutes the Golden Angel Fish swimming in one of the Aquaria abruptly addressed me with You can t humbug me mister Barnum that fish is painted Nonsense said I with a laugh the thing is impossible I don t care I know it is painted it is as plain as can be But my dear missus H paint would not adhere to a fish while in the water and if it would it would kill him Besides I added with an extra serious air we never allow humbugging here Oh here is just the place to look for such things she replied with a smile and I must say I more than half believe that Angel Fish is painted She was finally nearly convinced of her error and left In the afternoon of the same day I met her in Old Adams California Menagerie She knew that I was part proprietor of that establishment and seeing me in conversation with Grizzly Adams she came up to me in some haste and with her eyes glistening with excitement she said O mister B I never saw anything so beautiful as those elegant Golden Pigeons from Australia I want you to secure some of their eggs for me and let my pigeons hatch them at home I should prize them beyond all measure Oh you don t want Golden Australian Pigeons I replied they are painted No they are not painted said she with a laugh but I half think the Angel Fish is I could not control myself at the curious coincidence and I roared with laughter while I replied Now missus H I never let a good joke be spoiled even if it serves to expose my own secrets I assure you upon honor that the Golden Australian Pigeons as they are labeled are really painted and that in their natural state they are nothing more nor less than the common ruff necked white American pigeons And it was a fact How they happened to be exhibited under that auriferous disguise was owing to an amusing circumstance explained in another chapter Suffice it at present to say that missus H to this day blushes to her eyebrows whenever an allusion is made to Angel Fish or Golden Pigeons CHAPTER VII PEASE S HOARHOUND CANDY THE DORR REBELLION THE PHILADELPHIA ALDERMEN In the year eighteen forty two a new style of advertising appeared in the newspapers and in handbills which arrested public attention at once on account of its novelty The thing advertised was an article called Pease s Hoarhound Candy a very good specific for coughs and colds It was put up in twenty five cent packages and was eventually sold wholesale and retail in enormous quantities mister Pease s system of advertising was one which I believe originated with him in this country although many have practiced it since but of course with less success for imitations seldom succeed mister Pease s plan was to seize upon the most prominent topic of interest and general conversation and discourse eloquently upon that topic in fifty to a hundred lines of a newspaper column then glide off gradually into a panegyric of Pease s Hoarhound Candy The consequence was every reader was misled by the caption and commencement of his article and thousands of persons had Pease s Hoarhound Candy in their mouths long before they had seen it In fact it was next to impossible to take up a newspaper and attempt to read the legitimate news of the day without stumbling upon a package of Pease s Hoarhound Candy The reader would often feel vexed to find that after reading a quarter of a column of interesting news upon the subject uppermost in his mind he was trapped into the perusal of one of Pease s hoarhound candy advertisements Although inclined sometimes to throw down the newspaper in disgust he would generally laugh at the talent displayed by mister Pease in thus captivating and capturing the reader The result of all this would generally be a trial of the candy on the first premonitory symptoms of a cough or influenza The degree to which this system of advertising has since been carried has rendered it a bore and a nuisance The usual result of almost any great and original achievement is the production of a shoal of brainless imitators who are neither useful nor ornamental In the same year that Pease s hoarhound candy appeared upon the commercial and newspaper horizon the Governor Dorr Rebellion occurred in Rhode Island As many will remember this rebellion caused a great excitement throughout the country Citizens of Rhode Island took up arms against each other and it was feared by some that a bloody civil war would ensue At about this time a municipal election was to come off in the city of Philadelphia The two political parties were pretty equally divided there and there were some special causes why this was regarded as an unusually important election Its near approach caused more excitement in the Quaker City than had been witnessed there since the preceding Presidential election The party leaders began to lay their plans early and the wire pullers on both sides were unusually busy in their vocation At the head of the rabble upon which one of the parties depended for many votes was a drunken and profane fellow whom we will call Tom Simmons Tom was great at electioneering and stump spouting in bar rooms and rum caucuses and his party always looked to him at each election to stir up the subterraneans with a long pole and a whiskey jug at the end of it The exciting election which was now to come off for Mayor and Aldermen of the good city of Brotherly Love soon brought several of the ring to Tom Now Tom said the head wire puller this is going to be a close election and we want you to spare neither talent nor liquor in arousing up and bringing to the polls every voter within your influence Well Squire replied Tom carelessly I ve concluded I won t bother myself with this lection it don t pay Don t pay exclaimed the frightened politician Why Tom are you not a true friend to your party Haven t you always been on hand at the primary meetings knocked down interlopers and squelched every man who talked about conscience or who refused to support regular nominations and vote the entire clean ticket straight through And as for pay haven t you always been supplied with money enough to treat all doubtful voters and in fact to float them up to the polls in an ocean of whiskey I confess Tom I am almost petrified with astonishment at witnessing your present indifference to the alarming crisis in which our country and our party are involved and which nothing on earth can avert except our success at the coming election Oh tell that to the marines said Tom We never yet had an election that there wasn t a crisis and yet whichever party gained we somehow managed to live through it crisis or no crisis In fact my curiosity has got a little excited and I would like to see this crisis that is such a bugaboo at every election so trot out your crisis let us see how it looks Besides talking of pay I acknowledge the whiskey and that is all While I and my companions lifted you and your companions into fat offices that enabled you to roll in your carriages and live on the fat of the land we got nothing or at least next to nothing all we got was well we got drunk Now Squire I will go for the other party this lection if you don t give me an office Give you an office exclaimed the Squire raising his hands and rolling his eyes in utter amazement why Tom what office do you want I want to be Alderman replied Tom and I can control votes enough to turn the lection either way and if our party don t gratefully remember my past services and give me my reward t other party will be glad to run me on their ticket and over I go The gentleman of the ring saw by Tom s firmness and clenched teeth that he was immovable that his principles like those of too many others consisted of loaves and fishes they therefore consented to put Tom s name on the municipal ticket and the worst part of the story is he was elected In a very short time Tom was duly installed into the Aldermanic chair and opening his office on a prominent corner he was soon doing a thriving business He was generally occupied throughout the day in sitting as a judge in cases of book debt and promissory notes which were brought before him for various small sums ranging from two to five six eight and ten dollars He would frequently dispose of thirty or forty of these cases in a day and as imprisonment for debt was permitted at that time the poor defendants would shin around and make any sacrifice almost rather than go to jail The enormous costs went into the capacious pocket of the Alderman and this dignitary as a natural sequence waxed fat and saucy exemplifying the truth of the adage Put a beggar on horseback et cetera As the Alderman grew rich he became overbearing headstrong and dictatorial He began to fancy that he monopolized the concentrated wisdom of his party and that his word should be law Not a party caucus or a political meeting could be held without witnessing the vulgar and profane harangues of the self conceited Alderman Tom Simmons As he was one of the ring his fingers were in all the pickings and stealings he kept his family coach and in his general swagger exhibited all the peculiarities of high life below stairs But after Tom had disgraced his office for two years a State election took place and the other party were successful Among the first laws which they passed after the convening of the Legislature was one declaring that from that date imprisonment for debt should not be permitted in the State of Pennsylvania for any sum less than ten dollars This enactment of course knocked away the chief prop which sustained the Alderman and when the news of its passage reached Philadelphia Tom was the most indignant man that had been seen there for some years Standing in front of his office the next morning surrounded by several of his political chums Tom exclaimed Do you see what them infernal tories have done down there at Harrisburg They have been and passed an outrageous oppressive barbarous and unconstitutional law A pretty idea indeed if a man can t put a debtor in jail for a less sum than ten dollars How am I going to support my family I should like to know if this law is allowed to stand I tell you gentlemen this law is unconstitutional and you will see blood running in our streets if them tory scoundrels try to carry it out His friends laughed for they saw that Tom was reasoning from his pocket instead of his head and as he almost foamed at the mouth in his impotent wrath they could not suppress a smile Oh you may laugh gentlemen you may laugh but you will see it Our party will never disgrace itself a permitting the tories to rob them of their rights by passing unconstitutional laws and I say the sooner we come to blood the better At this moment a gentleman stepped up and addressing the Alderman said Alderman I want to bring a case of book debt before you this morning How much is your claim asked Tom Four dollars replied the rumseller for such he proved to be and his debt was for drinks chalked up against one of his customers You can t have your four dollars Sir replied the excited Alderman You are robbed of your four dollars Sir Them legislative tories at Harrisburg Sir have cheated you out of your four dollars Sir I undertake to say Sir that fifty thousand honest men in Philadelphia have been robbed of their four dollars by these bloody tories and their cursed unconstitutional law Ah gentlemen you will see blood running in our streets before you are a month older A laugh Oh you may laugh but you will see it see if you don t A newsboy was just passing by Here boy give me the Morning Ledger said the Alderman at the same time taking the paper and handing the boy a penny Let us see what them blasted cowboys are doing down at Harrisburg now Ah what is this Reading Blood blood

and indignant Alderman throwing the paper upon the pavement with the most ineffable disgust amid the shouts and hurrahs of a score of men who by this time had gathered around the excited Alderman Tom Simmons As I before remarked the candy was a very good article for the purposes for which it was made and as Pease was an indefatigable man as well as a good advertiser he soon acquired a fortune mister Pease Junior is now living in affluence in Brooklyn and is bringing up a happy family to enjoy the fruits of his industry probity good habits and genius The humbug in this transaction of course consisted solely in the manner of advertising There was no humbug or deception about the article manufactured CHAPTER VIII BRANDRETH S PILLS MAGNIFICENT ADVERTISING POWER OF IMAGINATION In the year eighteen thirty four doctor Benjamin Brandreth commenced advertising in the city of New York Brandreth s Pills specially recommended to purify the blood His office consisted of a room about ten feet square located in what was then known as the Sun building an edifice ten by forty feet situated at the corner of Spruce and Nassau streets where the Tribune is now published His factory was at his residence in Hudson street He put up a large gilt sign over the Sun office five or six feet wide by the length of the building which attracted much attention as at that time it was probably the largest sign in New York doctor Brandreth had great faith in his pills and I believe not without reason for multitudes of persons soon became convinced of the truth of his assertions that all diseases arise from impurity or imperfect circulation of the blood and by purgation with Brandreth s Pills all disease may be cured But great and reasonable as might have been the faith of doctor Brandreth in the efficacy of his pills his faith in the potency of advertising them was equally strong Hence he commenced advertising largely in the Sun newspaper paying at least five thousand dollars to that paper alone for his first year s advertisements That may not seem a large sum in these days when parties have been known to pay more than five thousand dollar for a single day s advertising in the leading journals but at the time Brandreth started his was considered the most liberal newspaper advertising of the day Advertising is to a genuine article what manure is to land it largely increases the product Thousands of persons may be reading your advertisement while you are eating or sleeping or attending to your business hence public attention is attracted new customers come to you and if you render them a satisfactory equivalent for their money they continue to patronize you and recommend you to their friends At the commencement of his career doctor Brandreth was indebted to mister Moses Y Beach proprietor of the New York Sun for encouragement and means of advertising But this very advertising soon caused his receipts to be enormous 
1212_185485_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Although the pills were but twenty five cents per box they were soon sold to such a great extent that tons of huge cases filled with the purely vegetable pill were sent from the new and extensive manufactory every week 
none	none	As his business increased so in the same ratio did he extend his advertising The doctor engaged at one time a literary gentleman to attend under the supervision of himself solely to the advertising department Column upon column of advertisements appeared in the newspapers in the shape of learned and scientific pathological dissertations the very reading of which would tempt a poor mortal to rush for a box of Brandreth s Pills so evident was it according to the advertisement that nobody ever had or ever would have pure blood until from one to a dozen boxes of the pills had been taken as purifiers The ingenuity displayed in concocting these advertisements was superb and was probably hardly equaled by that required to concoct the pills No pain ache twinge or other sensation good bad or indifferent ever experienced by a member of the human family but was a most irrefragable evidence of the impurity of the blood and it would have been blasphemy to have denied the self evident theory that all diseases arise from impurity or imperfect circulation of the blood and that by purgation with Brandreth s Pills all disease may be cured The doctor claims that his grandfather first manufactured the pills in seventeen fifty one I suppose this may be true at all events no living man will be apt to testify to the contrary Here is an extract from one of doctor Brandreth s early advertisements which will give an idea of his style What has been longest known has been most considered and what has been most considered is best understood The life of the flesh is in the blood Lev xxii two Bleeding reduces the vital powers Brandreth s Pills increase them So in sickness never be bled especially in Dizziness and Apoplexy but always use Brandreth s Pills
1212_185485_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 The laws of life are written upon the face of Nature 
none	none	The Tempest Whirlwind and Thunder storm bring health from the Solitudes of God The Tides are the daily agitators and purifiers of the Mighty World of Waters What these Providential means are as purifiers of the Atmosphere or Air Brandreth s Pills are to man This splendid system of advertising and the almost reckless outlay which was required to keep it up challenged the admiration of the business community In the course of a few years his office was enlarged and still being too small he took the store two hundred forty one Broadway and also opened a branch at one hundred eighty seven Hudson street The doctor continued to let his advertising keep pace with his patronage and he was finally in the year eighteen thirty six compelled to remove his manufactory to Sing Sing where such perfectly incredible quantities of Brandreth s Pills have been manufactured and sold that it would hardly be safe to give the statistics Suffice it to say that the only humbug which I suspect in connection with the pills was the very harmless and unobjectionable yet novel method of advertising them and as the doctor amassed a great fortune by their manufacture this very fact is prima facie evidence that the pill was a valuable purgative A funny incident occurred to me in connection with this great pill In the year eighteen thirty six while I was travelling through the States of Alabama Mississippi and Louisiana I became convinced by reading Doctor Brandreth s advertisements that I needed his pills Indeed I there read the proof that every symptom that I experienced either in imagination or in reality rendered their extensive consumption absolutely necessary to preserve my life I purchased a box of Brandreth s Pills in Columbus Miss The effect was miraculous Of course it was just what the advertisement told me it would be In Tuscaloosa Alabama I purchased half a dozen boxes They were all used up before my perambulating show reached Vicksburg Miss and I was a confirmed disciple of the blood theory There I laid in a dozen boxes In Natchez I made a similar purchase In New Orleans where I remained several months I was a profitable customer and had become thoroughly convinced that the only real greenhorns in the world were those who preferred meat or bread to Brandreth s Pills I took them morning noon and night In fact the advertisements announced that one could not take too many for if one box was sufficient to purify the blood eleven extra boxes would have no injurious effect I arrived in New York in June eighteen thirty eight and by that time I had become such a firm believer in the efficacy of Brandreth s Pills that I hardly stopped long enough to speak with my family before I hastened to the principal office of Doctor Brandreth to congratulate him on being the greatest public benefactor of the age I found the doctor at home and introduced myself without ceremony I told him my experiences 
1212_185485_000017_000002	train-clean-360	He was delighted 
none	none	I next heartily indorsed every word stated in his advertisements He was not surprised for he knew the effects of his pills were such as I described Still he was elated in having another witness whose extensive experiments with his pills were so eminently satisfactory The doctor and myself were both happy he in being able to do so much good to mankind I in being the recipient of such untold benefits through his valuable discovery At last the doctor chanced to say that he wondered how I happened to get his pills in Natchez for said he I have no agent there as yet
1212_185485_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I replied I always bought my pills at the drug stores 
none	none	Good Heavens exclaimed the doctor then they are were all counterfeits vile impositions poisonous compounds I never sell a pill to a druggist I never permit an apothecary to handle one of my pills But they counterfeit them by the bushel the unprincipled heartless murderous impostors I need not say I was surprised Was it possible then that my imagination had done all this business and that I had been cured by poisons which I supposed were Brandreth s Pill I confess I laughed heartily and told the doctor that after all it seemed the counterfeits were as good as the real pills provided the patient had sufficient faith The doctor was puzzled as well as vexed but an idea struck him that soon enabled him to recover his usual equanimity I ll tell you what it is said he those Southern druggists have undoubtedly obtained the pills from me under false pretences They have pretended to be planters and have purchased pills from me in large quantities for use on the plantations and then they have retailed the pills from their drug shops I laughed at this shrewd suggestion and remarked This may be so but I guess my imagination did the business The doctor was uneasy but he asked me as a favor to bring him one of the empty pill boxes which I had brought from the South The next day I complied with his request and I will do the doctor justice to say that on comparison it proved as he had suspected the pills were genuine and although he had advertised that no druggist should sell them they were so popular that druggists found it necessary to get them by hook or by crook and the consequence was I had the pleasure of a glorious laugh and Doctor Brandreth experienced a great scare The doctor made his pile long ago although he still devotes his personal attention to the entirely vegetable and innocent pills whose life giving power no pen can describe In eighteen forty nine the doctor was elected President of the Village of Sing Sing N Y where he still resides and was re elected to the same office for seven consecutive years In the same year he was elected to the New York State Senate and in eighteen fifty nine was again elected doctor Brandreth is a liberal man and a pleasant entertaining and edifying companion He deserves all the success he has ever received Long may he wave II THE SPIRITUALISTS CHAPTER IX THE DAVENPORT BROTHERS THEIR RISE AND PROGRESS SPIRITUAL ROPE TYING MUSIC PLAYING CABINET SECRETS THEY CHOOSE DARKNESS RATHER THAN LIGHT et cetera THE SPIRITUAL HAND HOW THE THING IS DONE doctor W F VAN VLECK The Davenport Brothers are natives of Buffalo N Y and in that city commenced their career as mediums about twelve years ago They were then mere lads For some time their operations were confined to their own place where having obtained considerable notoriety through the press they were visited by people from all parts of the country But in eighteen fifty five they were induced by John F Coles a very worthy spiritualist of New York City to visit that metropolis and there exhibit their powers Under the management of mister Coles they held circles afternoon and evening for several days in a small hall at one hundred ninety five Bowery The audience were seated next the walls the principal space being required for the use of the spirits The manifestations mostly consisted in the thrumming and seemingly rapid movement about the hall of several stringed instruments the room having been made entirely dark while the boys were supposed or asserted to be quietly seated at the table in the centre Two guitars with sometimes a banjo were the instruments used and the noise made by the spirits was about equal to the united honking of a large flock of wild geese The manifestations were stunning as well as astonishing for not only was the sense of hearing smitten by the dreadful sounds but sometimes a member of the circle would get a striking demonstration over his head At the request of the controlling spirit made through a horn the hall was lighted at intervals during the entertainment at which times the mediums could be seen seated at the table looking very innocent and demure as if they had never once thought of deceiving anybody On one of these occasions however a policeman suddenly lighted the hall by means of a dark lantern without having been specially called upon to do so and the boys were clearly seen with instruments in their hands They dropped them as soon as they could and resumed their seats at the table Satisfied that the thing was a humbug the audience left in disgust and the policeman was about to march the boys to the station house on the charge of swindling when he was prevailed upon to remain and farther test the matter Left alone with them and the three seated together at the table on which the instruments had been placed he laid at their request a hand on each medium s head they then clasped both his arms with their hands While they remained thus situated as he supposed the room being dark one of the instruments with an infernal twanging of its strings rose from the table and hit the policeman several times on the head then a strange voice through the trumpet advised him not to interfere with the work of the spirits by persecuting the mediums Considerably astonished if not positively scared he took his hat and left fully persuaded that there was something in it The boys produced the manifestations by grasping the neck of the instrument swinging it around and thrusting it into different parts of the open space of the room at the same time vibrating the strings with the fore finger The faster the finger passed over the strings the more rapidly the instrument seemed to move Two hands could thus use as many instruments When sitting with a person at the table as they did with the policeman one hand could be taken off the investigator s arm without his knowing it by gently increasing at the same time the pressure of the other hand It was an easy matter then to raise and thrum the instrument or talk through the horn About a dozen gentlemen several of whom were members of the press had a private seance with the boys one afternoon on which occasion the spirits ventured upon an extra manifestation All took seats at one side of a long high table the position of the mediums being midway of the row This time a little dim ghostly gaslight was allowed in the room What seemed to be a hand soon appeared partly above the edge of the vacant side of the table and opposite the mediums One excited spiritualist present said he could see the finger nails John F Coles who had for several days suspected the innocence of the boys sprang from his seat turned up the gaslight and pounced on the elder boy who was found to have a nicely stuffed glove drawn partly on to the toe of his boot That then was the spirit hand The nails that the imaginative spiritualist thought he saw were not on the fingers The boy alleged that the spirits made him attempt the deception The father of these boys who had accompanied them to New York took them home immediately after that exposure In Buffalo they continued to hold circles hoping to retrieve their lost reputation as good mediums by being not more honest but more cautious To prevent any one getting hold of them while operating they hit upon the plan of passing a rope through a button hole of each gentleman s coat the ends to be held by a trusty person assigning as a reason for that arrangement that it would then be known no one in the circle could assist in producing the manifestations The plan did not always work well however for a skeptic would sometimes cut the rope and then pounce upon the spirit that is if he didn t happen to miss that individual on account of the darkness and while trying to avoid a collision with the instruments To secure greater immunity from detection and to enable them to exhibit in large halls which could not easily be darkened the boys finally fixed upon a cabinet as the best thing in which to work They had some time before made the rope test a feature of their exhibitions and in their cabinet show they depended for success in deceiving entirely upon the presumption of the audience that their hands were so secured with ropes as to prevent their playing upon the musical instruments or doing whatever else the spirits were assumed to do Their cabinet is about six feet high six feet long and two and a half feet deep the front consisting of three doors opening outward In each end is a seat with holes through which the ropes can be passed in securing the mediums In the upper part of the middle door is a lozenge shaped aperture curtained on the inside with black muslin or oilcloth The bolts are on the inside of the doors The mediums are generally first tied by a committee of two gentlemen appointed from the audience The doors of the cabinet are then closed those at the ends first and then the middle one the bolt of which is reached by the manager through the aperture By the time the end doors are closed and bolted the Davenports in many instances have succeeded in loosening the knots next their wrists and in slipping their hands out the latter being then exhibited at the aperture Lest the hands should be recognized as belonging to the mediums they are kept in a constant shaking motion while in view and to make the hands look large or small they spread or press together the fingers With that peculiar rapid motion imparted to them four hands in the aperture will appear to be half a dozen A lady s flesh colored kid glove nicely stuffed with cotton is sometimes exhibited as a female hand a critical observation of it never being allowed It does not take the medium long to draw the knots close to their wrists again They are then ready to be inspected by the Committee who report them tied as they were left Supposing them to have been securely bound all the while those who witness the show are very naturally astonished Sometimes after being tied by a committee the mediums cannot readily extricate their hands and get them back as they were in which case they release themselves entirely from the ropes before the doors are again opened concluding to wait till after the spirits have bound them before showing hands or making music It is a common thing for these impostors to give the rope between their hands a twist while those limbs are being bound and that movement if dexterously made while the attention of the committee men is momentarily diverted is not likely to be detected Reversing that movement will let the hand out The great point with the Davenports in tying themselves is to have a knot next their wrists that looks solid fair and square at the same time that they can slip it and get their hands out in a moment There are several ways of forming such a knot one of which I will attempt to describe In the middle of a rope a square knot is tied loosely at first so that the ends of the rope can be tucked through in opposite directions below the knot and the latter is then drawn tight There are then two loops which should be made small through which the hands are to pass after the rest of the tying is done Just sufficient slack is left to admit of the hands passing through the loops which lastly are drawn close to the wrists the knot coming between the latter No one from the appearance of such a knot would suspect it could be slipped The mediums thus tied can immediately after the committee have inspected the knots and closed the doors show hands or play upon musical instruments and in a few seconds be to all appearance firmly tied again If flour has been placed in their hands it makes no difference as to their getting those members out of or into the ropes but to show hands at the aperture or to make a noise on the musical instruments it is necessary that they should get the flour out of one hand into the other The moisture of the hand and squeezing packs the flour into a lump which can be laid into the other hand and returned without losing any The little flour that adheres to the empty hand can be wiped off in the pantaloons pocket The mediums seldom if ever take flour in their hands while they are in the bonds put upon them by the committee The principal part of the show is after the tying has been done in their own way Wm Fay who accompanies the Davenports is thus fixed when the hypothetical spirits take the coat off his back As I before remarked there are several ways in which the mediums tie themselves They always do it however in such a manner that though the tying looks secure they can immediately get one or both hands out Let committees insist upon untying the knots of the spirits whether the mediums are willing or not A little critical observation will enable them to learn the trick To make this subject of tying clearer I will repeat that the Davenports always untie themselves by using their hands as they are able in ninety nine cases out of a hundred however impossible it may seem to release their hands by loosening the knots next their wrists Sometimes they do this by twisting the rope between their wrists sometimes it is by keeping their muscles as tense as possible during the tying so that when relaxed there shall be some slack Most committees know so little about tying that anybody by a little pulling slipping and wriggling could slip his hands out of their knots A violin bell and tambourine with perhaps a guitar and drum are the instruments used by the Davenports in the cabinet The one who plays the violin holds the bell in his hand with the bow The other chap beats the tambourine on his knee and has a hand for something else The mediums frequently allow a person to remain with them providing he will let his hands be tied to their knees the operators having previously been tied by the spirits The party who ventures upon that experiment is apt to be considerably mussed up as the spirits are not very gentle in their manipulations To expose all the tricks of these impostors would require more space than I can afford at present They have exhibited throughout the Northern States and the Canadas but never succeeded very well pecuniarily until about two years ago when they employed an agent who advertised them in such a way as to attract public attention In September last they went to England where they have since created considerable excitement If the hands of these boys were tied close against the side of their cabinet the ropes passing through holes and fastened on the outside I think the spirits would always fail to work doctor W F Van Vleck of Ohio to whom I am indebted for some of the facts contained in this chapter can beat the Davenport brothers at their own game In order that he might the better learn the various methods pursued by the professed mediums in deceiving the public doctor Van Vleck entered into the medium business himself and by establishing confidential relations with those of the profession whose acquaintance he made he became duly qualified to expose them He was accepted and indorsed by leading spiritualists in different parts of the country as a good medium who performed the most remarkable spiritual wonders As the worthy doctor practiced this innocent deception on the professed mediums solely in order that he might thus be able to expose their blasphemous impositions the public will scarcely dispute that in this case the end justified the means I suppose it is not possible for any professed medium to puzzle or deceive the doctor He is up to all their dodges because he has learned in their school Mediums always insist upon certain conditions and those conditions are just such as will best enable them to deceive the senses and pervert the judgment Anderson the Wizard of the North and other conjurers in England gave the Davenports battle but the prestidigitators did not reap many laurels Conjurers are no more likely to understand the tricks of the mediums than any other person is Before a trick can be exposed it must be learned doctor Van Vleck having learned the ropes is competent to expose them and he is doing it in many interesting public lectures and illustrations If the Davenports were exhibiting simply as jugglers I might admire their dexterity and have nothing to say against them but when they presumptuously pretend to deal in things spiritual I consider it my duty while treating of humbugs to do this much at least in exposing them CHAPTER X THE SPIRIT RAPPING AND MEDIUM HUMBUGS THEIR ORIGIN HOW THE THING IS DONE five hundred dollars REWARD The spirit rapping humbug was started in Hydesville New York about seventeen years ago by several daughters of a mister Fox living in that place These girls discovered that certain exercises of their anatomy would produce mysterious sounds mysterious to those who heard them simply because the means of their production were not apparent Reports of this wonder soon went abroad and the Fox family were daily visited by people from different sections of the country all having a greed for the marvelous Not long after the strange sounds were first heard some one suggested that they were perhaps produced by spirits and a request was made for a certain number of raps if that suggestion was correct The specified number were immediately heard A plan was then proposed by means of which communications might be received from the spirits An investigator would repeat the alphabet writing down whatever letters were designated by the raps Sentences were thus formed the orthography however being decidedly bad What purported to be the spirit of a murdered peddler gave an account of his taking off He said that his body was buried beneath that very house in a corner of the cellar that he had been killed by a former occupant of the premises A peddler really had disappeared somewhat mysteriously from that part of the country some time before and ready credence was given the statements thus spelled out through the raps Digging to the depth of eight feet in the cellar did not disclose any dead corpus or even the remains of one Soon after that the missing peddler reappeared in Hydesville still clothed with mortality and having a new assortment of wares to sell That the raps were produced by disembodied spirits many firmly believed False communications were attributed to evil spirits The answers to questions were as often wrong as right and only right when the answer could be easily guessed or inferred from the nature of the question itself The Fox family moved to Rochester New York soon after the rapping humbug was started and it was there that their first public effort was made A committee was appointed to investigate the matter most of whom reported adversely to the claims of the mediums though all of them were puzzled to know how the thing was done In Buffalo where the Foxes subsequently let their spirits flow a committee of doctors reported that these loosely constructed girls produced the raps by snapping their toe and knee joints That theory though very much ridiculed by the spiritualists then and since was correct as further developments proved missus Culver a relative of the Fox girls made a solemn deposition before a magistrate to the effect that one of the girls had instructed her how to produce the raps on condition that she missus C should not communicate a knowledge of the matter to any one missus Culver was a good Christian woman and she felt it her duty as the deception had been carried so far to expose the matter She actually produced the raps in presence of the magistrate and explained the manner of making them Doctor Von Vleck to whom I referred in connection with my exposition of the Davenport imposture produces very loud raps before his audiences and so modulates them that they will seem to be at any desired point in his vicinity yet not a movement of his body betrays the fact that the sounds are caused by him The Fox family found that the rapping business would be made to pay and so they continued it with varying success for a number of years making New York city their place of residence and principal field of operation I believe that none of them are now in the spiritual line Margaret Fox the youngest of the rappers has for some time been a member of the Roman Catholic Church From the very commencement of spiritualism there has been a constantly increasing demand for spiritual wonders to meet which numerous mediums have been developed Many who otherwise would not be in the least distinguished have become mediums in order to obtain notoriety if nothing more Communicating by raps was a slow process so some of the mediums took to writing spasmodically others talked in a trance all under the influence of spirits Mediumship has come to be a profession steadily pursued by quite a number of persons who get their living by it There are various classes of mediums the operations of each class being confined to a particular department of spiritual humbuggery Some call themselves test mediums and by insisting upon certain formulas they succeed in astonishing if they don t convince most of them who visit them It is by this class that the public is most likely to be deceived There is a person by the name of J V Mansfield who has been called by spiritualists the Great Spirit Postmaster his specialty being the answering of sealed letters addressed to spirits The letters are returned some of them at least to the writers without appearing to have been opened accompanied by answers purporting to be written through Mansfield by the spirits addressed Such of these letters as are sealed with gum arabic merely can be steamed open and the envelopes resealed and reglazed as they were before If sealing wax has been used a sharp thin blade will enable the medium to nicely cut off the seal by splitting the paper under it and then after a knowledge of the contents of the letter is arrived at the seal can be replaced in its original position and made fast with gum arabic Not more than one out of a hundred would be likely to observe that the seal had ever been tampered with The investigator opens the envelope when returned to him at the end preserving the sealed part intact in order to show his friends that the letter was answered without being opened Another method of the medium is to slit open the envelope at the end with a sharp knife and afterward stick it together again with gum rubbing the edge slightly as soon as the gum is dry If the job is nicely done a close observer would hardly perceive it mister Mansfield does not engage to answer all letters those unanswered being too securely sealed for him to open without detection To secure the services of the Great Spirit Postmaster a fee of five dollars must accompany your letter to the spirits and the money is retained whether an answer is returned or not Rather high postage that Several years since a gentleman living in Buffalo N Y addressed some questions to one of his spirit friends and inclosed them together with a single hair and a grain of sand in an envelope which he sealed so closely that no part of the contents could escape while being transmitted by mail The questions were sent to mister Mansfield and answers requested through his mediumship The envelope containing the questions was soon returned with answers to the letter The former did not appear to have been opened Spreading a large sheet of blank paper on a table before him the gentleman opened the envelope and placed its contents on the table The hair and grain of sand were not there Time and again has Mansfield been convicted of imposture yet he still prosecutes his nefarious business The Spirit Postmaster fails to get answers to such questions as these Where did you die When Who attended you in your last illness What were your last words How many were present at your death But if the questions are of such a nature as the following answers are generally obtained Are you happy Are you often near me And can you influence me Have you changed your religious notions since entering the spirit world It is to be observed that the questions which the Spirit Postmaster can answer require no knowledge of facts about the applicant while those which he cannot answer do require it Address for instance your spirit father without mentioning his name and the name will not be given in connection with the reply purporting to come from him unless the medium knows your family I will write a series of questions addressed to one of my spirit friends inclose them in an envelope and if mister Mansfield or any other professed medium will answer those questions pertinently in my presence and without touching the envelope I will give to such party five hundred dollars and think I have got the worth of my money CHAPTER XI THE BALLOT TEST THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS DISEASED RELATIVES A HUNGRY SPIRIT PALMING A BALLOT REVELATIONS ON STRIPS OF PAPER An aptitude for deception is all the capital that a person requires in order to become a spirit medium or at least to gain the reputation of being one Backing up the pretence to mediumship with a show of something mysterious is all sufficient to enlist attention and insure the making of converts One of the most noted of the mediumistic fraternity whose name I do not choose to give at present steadily pursued his business for several years in a room in Broadway in this city and succeeded not only in humbugging a good many people but in what was more important to him acquiring quite an amount of money 
4226_185488_000005_000001	train-clean-360	His mode of operating was the ballot test and was as follows 
none	none	Medium and investigator being seated opposite each other at a table the latter was handed several slips of blank paper with the request that he write the first or Christian names one on each paper of several of his deceased relatives which being done he was desired to touch the folded papers one after the other till one should be designated by three tips of the table as containing the name of the spirit who would communicate The selected paper was laid aside and the others thrown upon the floor the investigator being further requested to write on as many different pieces of paper as contained the names and the relation to himself of the spirits bearing them 
4226_185488_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Supposing the names written were Mary Joseph and Samuel being respectively the investigator s mother father and brother 
none	none	The last named class would be secondly written and one of them designated by three tips of the table as in the first instance The respective ages of the deceased parties at the time of their decease would also be written and one of them selected The first test consisted in having the selected name relationship and age correspond that is refer to the same party to ascertain which the investigator was desired to look at them and state if it was the case If the correspondence was affirmed a communication was soon given with the selected name relationship and age appended Questions written in the presence of the medium were answered relevantly if not pertinently Investigators generally did their part of the writing in a guarded manner interposing their left hand between the paper on which they wrote and the medium s eyes and they were very much astonished when they received a communication couched in affectionate terms with the names of their spirit friends attached By long practice the medium was enabled to determine what the investigator wrote by the motion of his hand in writing Nine out of ten wrote the relationship first that corresponded with the first name they had written Therefore if the medium selected the first that was written of each class they in most cases referred to the same spirit He waited till the investigator had affirmed the coincidence before proceeding for he did not like to write a communication appending to it for instance Your Uncle John when it ought to be Your Father John The reason he did not desire inquirers to write the surnames of their spirit friends was this almost all Christian names are common and he was familiar with the motions which the hand must make in writing them but there are comparatively few people who have the same surnames and to determine them would have been more difficult No fact was communicated that had not been surreptitiously gleaned from the investigator An old gentleman apparently from the country one day entered the room of this medium and expressed a desire for a sperit communication He was told to take a seat at the table and to write the names of his deceased relatives The medium like many others incorrectly pronounced the term deceased the same as diseased sounding the s like z The old gentleman carefully adjusted his specs and did what was required of him A name and relationship having been selected from those written the investigator was desired to examine and state if they referred to one party Wal I declare they do said he
4226_185488_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 But I say Mister what has them papers to do with a sperit communication 
4226_185488_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 You will see directly replied the medium 
none	none	Whereupon the latter spasmodically wrote a communication which read somewhat as follows MY DEAR HUSBAND I am very glad to be able to address you through this channel Keep on investigating and you will soon be convinced of the great fact of spirit intercourse I am happy in my spirit home patiently awaiting the time when you will join me here et cetera 
4226_185488_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Your loving wife BETSEY 
none	none	Good gracious But my old woman can t be dead said the investigator for I left her tu hum Not dead exclaimed the medium Did I not tell you to write the names of deceazed relatives Diseased returned the old man Wal she ain t anything else for she s had the rumatiz orfully for six months Saying which he took his hat and left concluding that it was not worth while to keep on investigating any longer at that time This same medium not long since visited Great Britain for the purpose of practicing his profession there In one of the cities of Scotland some shrewd investigator divined that he was able to nearly guess from the motion of the hand what questions were written Are you happy being a question commonly asked the spirits one of these gentlemen varied it by asking Are you hungry 
4226_185488_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The reply was an emphatic affirmative 
none	none	They tricked the trickster in other ways one of which was to write the names of mortals instead of spirits It made no difference however as to getting a communication To tip the table without apparent muscular exertion this impostor placed his hands on it in such a way that the pisiform bone which may be felt projecting at the lower corner of the palm opposite the thumb pressed against the edge By pushing the table tipped from him it being prevented from sliding by little spikes in the legs of the side opposite the operator There are other ballot test mediums as they are called who have a somewhat different method of cheating They too require investigators to write the names in full however of their spirit friends the slips of paper containing the names to be folded and placed on a table The medium then seizes one of the ballots and asks Is the spirit present whose name is on this 
4226_185488_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Dropping that and taking another 
none	none	On this So he handles all the papers without getting a response During this time however he has dexterously palmed one of the ballots which while telling the investigator to be patient as the spirits would doubtless soon come he opens with his left hand on his knee under the edge of the table A mere glance enables him to read the name Refolding the paper and retaining it in his hand he remarks I will touch the ballots again and perhaps one of them will be designated this time Dropping among the rest the one he had palmed he soon picks it up again whereat three loud raps are heard
4226_185488_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 That paper says he to the investigator probably contains the name of the spirit who rapped please hold it in your hand 
none	none	Then seizing a pencil he writes a name which the investigator finds to be the one contained in the selected paper If the ballots are few in number a blank is put with the pile when the medium palms one else the latter might be missed It seems the spirits can never give their names without being reminded of them by the investigator and then they are so doubtful of their own identity that they have but little to say for themselves One medium to whom I have already alluded after a sojourn of several years in California whither he went from Boston seeking whom he might humbug has now returned to the East and is operating in this city Besides answering sealed letters he furnishes written communications to parties visiting him at his rooms a sitting however being granted to but one person at a time 
4226_185488_000038_000001	train-clean-360	His terms are only five dollars an hour 
none	none	Seated at a table in a part of the room where is the most light he hands the investigator a strip of blank white paper rather thin and light of texture about a yard long and six inches wide requesting him to write across one end of it a single question addressed to a spirit friend then to sign his own name and fold the paper once or twice over what he has written For instance
4226_185488_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 BROTHER SAMUEL Will you communicate with me through this medium WILLIAM FRANKLIN 
none	none	To learn what has been written the medium lays the paper down on the table and repeatedly rubs the fingers of his right hand over the folds made by the inquirer If that does not render the writing visible through the one thickness of paper that covers it he slightly raises the edge of the folds with his left hand while he continues to rub with his right and that admits of the light shining through so that the writing can be read The other party is so situated that the writing is not visible to him through the paper and he is not likely to presume that it is visible to the medium the latter having assigned as a reason for his manipulations that spirits were able to read the questions only by means of the odylic magnetic or some other emanation from the ends of his fingers Having learned the question of course the medium can reply to it giving the name of the spirit addressed but before doing so he doubles the two folds made by the inquirer and for a show of consistency again rubs his fingers over the paper Then more folds and more rubbing all the folding additional to the inquirer s being done to keep the latter from observing when he comes to read the answer that it was possible for the medium to read the question through the two folds of paper The answer is written upon the same strip of paper that accompanies the question The medium requires the investigator to write his questions each on a different strip of paper and before answering he every time manipulates the paper in the way I have described When rubbing his fingers over the question he often shuts the eye which is toward the inquirer which prevents suspicion but the other eye is open wide enough to enable him to read the question through the paper Should a person write a test question the medium could not answer it correctly even if he did see it In his communications he uses many terms of endearment and if possible flatters the recipient out of his common sense and into the belief that after all there may be something in it Should the inquirer smell a rat and take measures to prevent the medium from learning in the way I have stated what question is written he the medium gets nervous and discontinues the sitting alleging that conditions are unfavorable for spirit communication CHAPTER XII SPIRITUAL LETTERS ON THE ARM HOW TO MAKE THEM YOURSELF THE TAMBOURINE AND RING FEATS DEXTER S DANCING HATS PHOSPHORESCENT OIL SOME SPIRITUAL SLANG The mediums produce blood red letters on the arm in a very simple way It is done with a pencil or some blunt pointed instrument it being necessary to bear on hard while the movement of writing is being executed The pressure though not sufficient to abrade the skin forces the blood from the capillary vessels over which the pencil passes and where when the reaction takes place an unusual quantity of blood gathers and becomes plainly visible through the cuticle Gradually as an equilibrium of the circulation is restored the letters pass away This manipulation is generally produced by the medium in connection with the ballot test Having learned the name of an investigator s spirit friend in the manner stated in a previous article the investigator is set to writing some other names While he is thus occupied the medium quickly slips up his sleeve under the table and writes on his arm the name he has learned Try the experiment yourself reader Hold out your left arm clench the fist so as to harden the muscle a little and write your name on the skin with a blunt pencil or any similar point in letters say three quarters of an inch long pressing firmly enough to feel a little pain Rub the place briskly a dozen times this brings out the letters quickly in tolerably distinct red lines On thick tough skins it is difficult to produce letters in this way They might also be outlined more deeply by sharply pricking in dots along the lines of the desired letters Among others who seek to gain money and notoriety by the exercise of their talents for spiritual humbuggery is a certain woman whom I will not further designate but whose name is at the service of any proper person and who exhibited not long since in Brooklyn and New York This woman is accompanied by her husband who is a confederate in the playing of her little game She seats herself at a table which has been placed against the wall of the room The audience is so seated as to form a semicircle at one end of which and near enough to the medium to be able to shake hands with her or nearly so sits her husband with perhaps an accommodating spiritualist next to him Then the medium in an assumed voice engages in a miscellaneous talk ending with a request that some one sit by her and hold her hand A skeptic is permitted to do that When thus placed skeptic is directly between the medium and her husband and with his back to the latter The husband plays spirit and with his right hand which is free the other only being held by the accommodating spiritualist pats the investigator on the head thumps him with a guitar and other instruments and may be pulls his hair The medium assumes all this to be done by a spirit because her hands are held and she could not do it Profound reasoning If any one suggests that the husband had better sit somewhere else the medium will not hear to it he is a part of the battery and the necessary conditions must not be interfered with Sure enough Accommodating spiritualist also says he holds husband fast A tambourine frame without the head and an iron ring large enough to pass over one s arm are exhibited to the audience Medium says the spirits have such power over matter as to be able to put one or both those things on to her arm while some one holds her hands The party who is privileged to hold her hands on such occasion has to grope his way to her in the dark Having reached her she seizes his hands and passes one of them down her neck and along her arm saying Now you know there is no ring already there Soon after he feels the tambourine frame or ring slide over his hand and on to his arm A light is produced in order that he may see it is there When he took her hands he felt the frame or ring or at any rate a frame or ring under his elbow on the table from which place it was pulled by some power just before it went on to his arm Such is his report to the audience But in fact the medium has two frames or else a tambourine and a tambourine frame She allows the investigator to feel one of these She has however previous to his taking her hands put one arm and head through the frame she uses so that of course he does not feel it when she passes his hand down one side of her neck and over one of her arms as it is under that arm Her husband pulls the tambourine from under the investigator s elbow then the medium gets her head back through the frame leaving it on her arm or sliding it on to his and the work is done She has also two iron rings One of them she puts over her arm and the point of her shoulder where it snugly remains covered with a cape which she persists in wearing on these occasions till the investigator takes her hands in the dark and feels the other ring under his elbows then the husband disposes of the ring on the table and the medium works the other one down on to her arm The audience saw but one ring and the person sitting with the medium thought he had that under his elbow till it was pulled away and put on the arm Some years ago a man by the name of Dexter who kept an oyster and liquor saloon on Bleecker street devised a somewhat novel exhibition for the purpose of attracting custom A number of hats placed on the floor of his saloon danced or bobbed up and down in time to music His place was visited by a number of the leading spiritualists of New York several of whom were heard to express a belief that the hats were moved by spirits Dexter however did not claim to be a medium though he talked vaguely of the power of electricity when questioned with regard to his exhibition Besides making the hats dance he would apparently cause a violin placed in a box on the floor to sound by waving his hands over it The hats were moved by a somewhat complicated arrangement of wires worked by a confederate out of sight These wires were attached to levers and finally came up through the floor through small holes hidden from observation by the sawdust strewn there as is common in such places The violin in the box did not sound at all It was another violin under the floor that was heard It is not easy for a person to exactly locate a sound when the cause is not apparent In short mister Dexter s operations may be described as only consisting of a little well managed Dexterity A young man out West claiming to be influenced by spirits astonished people by reading names telling time by watches et cetera in a dark room He sat at a centre table which was covered with a cloth in the middle of the room Investigators sat next the walls The name of a spirit for instance would be written and laid on a table when in a short time he pronounced it To tell the time by a watch he required it to be placed on the table or in his hand With the tablecloth over his head a bottle of phosphorated oil enabled him to see when not the least glimmer of light was visible to others in the room If any of the spiritualist philosophers were to be asked what is the philosophy of these proceedings he would probably reply with a mess of balderdash pretty much like the following There is an infinitesimal influence of sympathy between mind and matter which permeates all beings and pervades all the delicate niches and interstices of human intelligence This sympathetic influence working upon the affined intelligence of an affinity coagulates itself into a corporiety approximating closely to the adumbration of mortality in its highest admensuration at last accuminating in an accumination On these great philosophic principles it will not be difficult to comprehend the following actual quotation from the Spiritual Telegraph In the twelfth hour the holy procedure shall crown the Triune Creator with the most perfect disclosive illumination Then shall the creation in the effulgence above the divine seraphemal arise into the dome of the disclosure in one comprehensive revolving galaxy of supreme created beatitudes That those not surcharged with the divine afflatus may be able to get at the meaning of the above paragraph it is translated thus Then shall all the blockheads in the nincompoopdome of disclosive procedure above the all fired leather fungus of Peter Nephninnygo the gooseberry grinder rise into the dome of the disclosure until coequaled and coexistensive and conglomerate lumuxes in one comprehensive mux shall assimilate into nothing and revolve like a bob tailed pussy cat after the space where the tail was What power there is in spiritualism I shall be glad to receive for publication authentic information from all parts of the world in regard to the doings of pretended spiritualists especially those who perform for money It is high time that the credulous portion of our community should be saved from the deceptions delusions and swindles of these blasphemous mountebanks and impostors CHAPTER XIII DEMONSTRATIONS BY SAMPSON UNDER A TABLE A MEDIUM WHO IS HANDY WITH HER FEET EXPOSE OF ANOTHER OPERATOR IN DARK CIRCLES Considerable excitement has been created in various parts of the West by a young woman whose name need not here be given who pretends to be a medium for physical manifestations She is rather tall and quite muscular her general manner and expression indicating innocence and simplicity The manifestations exhibited by her purport to be produced by Samson the Hebrew champion and anti philistine In preparing for her exhibition she has a table placed sideways against the wall of the room and covered with a thick blanket that reaches to the floor A large tin dishpan with handles or ears a German accordeon and a tea bell are placed under the table at the end of which she seats herself in such a way that her body is against the top and her lower limbs underneath her skirts being so adjusted as to fill the space between the end legs of the table and at the same time allow free play for her pedal extremities The blanket at the end where she sits comes to her waist and hangs down to the floor on each side of her chair The space under the table is thus made dark a necessary condition it is claimed and all therein concealed from view The medium then folds her arms looks careless and the manifestations commence The accordeon is sounded no music being executed upon it and the bell rung at the same time Then the dishpan receives such treatment that it makes a terrible noise Some one is requested to go to the end of the table opposite the medium put his hand under the blanket take hold of the dishpan and pull He does so and finds that some power is opposing him holding the dishpan to one place Not being rude he forbears to jerk with all his force but retires to his seat The table rises several inches and comes down kerslap then it tips forward a number of times then one end jumps up and down in time to music if there is any one present to play loud raps are heard upon it and the hypothetical Samson has quite a lively time generally Some of the mortals present one at a time put their fingers by request against the blankets through which those members are gingerly squeezed by what might be a hand if there was one under the table A person being told to take hold of the top of the table at the ends he does so and finds it so heavy that he can barely lift it Setting it down he is told to raise it again several inches and at the second lifting it is no heavier than one would naturally judge such a piece of furniture to be Another person is asked to lift the end furthest from the medium having done so it suddenly becomes quite weighty and relaxing his hold it comes down with much force upon the floor Thus by the power exercised beneath the table of an assumed spirit that piece of cabinet ware becomes heavy or light and is moved in various ways the medium not appearing to do it In addition to her other fixins this medium has a spirit dial so called on which are letters of the alphabet the numerals and such words as Yes No and Don t know The whole thing is so arranged that the pulling of a string makes an index hand go the circuit of the dial face and it can be made to stop at any of the characters or words thereon This spirit dial is placed on the table near the end furthest from the medium the string passing through a hole and hanging beneath In the end of the string there is a knot While the medium remains in the same position in which she sat when the other manifestations were produced communications are spelled out through the dial the index being moved by some power under the table that pulls the string A coil spring makes the index fly back to the starting point when the power is relaxed at each indication of a character or word The orthography of these spirits is bad if not worse Now for an explanation of the various manifestations that I have enumerated The medium is simply handy with her feet To sound the accordeon and ring the bell at the same time she has to take off one of her shoes or slippers the latter being generally worn by her on these occasions That done she gets the handle of the tea bell between the toes of her right foot through a hole in the stocking then putting the heel of the same foot on the keys of the accordeon and the other foot into the strap on the bellows part of that instrument she easily sounds it the motion necessary to do this also causing the bell to ring She can readily pass her heels over the keys to produce different notes She is thus able to make sounds on the accordeon that approximate to the very simple tune of Bounding Billows and that is the extent of her musical ability when only using her pedals To get a congress gaiter off the foot without using the hands is quite easy but how to get one on again those members not being employed to do it would puzzle most people It is not difficult to do however if a cord has been attached to the strap of the gaiter and tied to the leg above the calf The cord should be slack and that will admit of the gaiter coming off To get it on the toe has to be worked into the top of it and then pulling on the cord with the toe of the other foot will accomplish the rest The racket with the dishpan is made by putting the toe of the foot into one of the handles or ears and beating the pan about By keeping the toe in this handle and putting the other foot into the pan the operator can stand a pull from an investigator who reaches under the blanket and takes hold of the other handle To raise the table the medium puts her knees under and against the frame of it then lifts her heels pressing the toes against the floor at the same time bearing with her arms on the end To make the table tip forward one knee only is pressed against the frame at the back side The raps are made with the toe of the medium s shoe against the leg frame or top of the table What feels like a hand pressing the investigator s fingers when he puts them against the blanket is nothing more than the medium s feet the big toe of one foot doing duty for a thumb and all the toes of the other foot being used to imitate fingers The pressure of these through a thick blanket cannot well be distinguished from that of a hand When this experiment is to be made the medium wears slippers that she can readily get off her feet To make the table heavy the operator presses her knees outwardly against the legs of the table and then presses down in opposition to the party who is lifting or she presses her knees against that surface of the legs of the table that is toward her while her feet are hooked around the lower part of the legs that gives her a leverage by means of which she can make the whole table or the end furthest from her seem quite heavy and if the person lifting it suddenly relaxes his hold it will come down with a forcible bang to the floor To work the spirit dial the medium has only to press the string with the toe of her foot against the top of the table and slide it the string along till the index points at the letter or word she wishes to indicate The frame of the dial is beveled the face declining toward the medium so that she has no difficulty in observing where the index points After concluding her performances under the table this medium sometimes moves her chair about two feet back and sits with her side toward the end of the table with one leg of which however the skirt of her dress comes in contact Under cover of the skirt she then hooks her foot around the leg of the table and draws it toward her This is done without apparent muscular exertion while she is engaged in conversation and parties present are humbugged into the belief that the table was moved without mortal contact so they report to outsiders This medium has a manager and he does his best in managing the matter to prevent Samson being caught in the act of cheating The medium too is vigilant notwithstanding her appearance of carelessness and innocent simplicity A sudden rising of the blanket once exposed to view her pedal extremities in active operation Another of the Dark Circle mediums gets a good deal of sympathy on account of her delicate health Her health is not so delicate however as to prevent her from laboring hard to humbug people with physical demonstrations She operates only in private in presence of a limited number of people A circle being formed the hands of all the members are joined except at one place where a table intervenes Those sitting next to this table place a hand upon it the other hand of each of these parties being joined with the circle The medium takes a position close by the table and during the manifestations is supposed to momentarily touch with her two hands the hands of those parties sitting next to the table Of course she could accomplish little or nothing if she allowed her hands to be constantly held by investigators so she hit upon the plan mentioned above to make the people present believe that the musical instruments are not sounded by her These instruments are within her reach and instead of touching the hands of those next the table with both her hands as supposed she touches alternately their hands with but one of hers the other she expertly uses in sounding the instruments Several years ago at one of the circles of this medium in saint John s Mich a light was suddenly introduced and she was seen in the act of doing what she had asserted to be done by the spirits She has also been exposed as an impostor in other places As I have said before the mediums always insist on having such conditions as will best enable them to deceive the senses and mislead the judgment If there were a few more detectives like Doctor Von Vleck the whole mediumistic fraternity would soon come to grief CHAPTER XIV SPIRITUAL PHOTOGRAPHING COLORADO JEWETT AND THE SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHS OF GENERAL JACKSON HENRY CLAY DANIEL WEBSTER STEPHEN A DOUGLAS NAPOLEON BONAPARTE et cetera A LADY OF DISTINCTION SEEKS AND FINDS A SPIRITUAL PHOTOGRAPH OF HER DECEASED INFANT AND HER DEAD BROTHER WHO WAS YET ALIVE HOW IT WAS DONE In answer to numerous inquiries and several threats of prosecution for libel in consequence of what I have written in regard to impostors who for money perform tricks of legerdemain and attribute them to the spirits of deceased persons I have only to say I have no malice or antipathies to gratify in these expositions In undertaking to show up the Ancient and Modern Humbugs of the World I am determined so far as in me lies to publish nothing but the truth This I shall do with good motives and for justifiable ends and I shall do it fearlessly and conscientiously No threats will intimidate no fawnings will flatter me from publishing everything that is true which I think will contribute to the information or to the amusement of my readers Some correspondents ask me if I believe that all pretensions to intercourse with departed spirits are impositions I reply that if people declare that they privately communicate with or are influenced to write or speak by invisible spirits I cannot prove that they are deceived or are attempting to deceive me although I believe that one or the other of these propositions is true But when they pretend to give me communications from departed spirits to tie or untie ropes to read sealed letters or to answer test questions through spiritual agencies I pronounce all such pretensions ridiculous impositions and I stand ready at any time to prove them so or to forfeit five hundred dollars whenever these pretended mediums will succeed in producing their wonderful manifestations in a room of my selecting and with apparatus of my providing they not being permitted to handle the sealed letters or folded ballots which they are to answer nor to make conditions in regard to the manner of rope tying et cetera If they can answer my test questions relevantly and truly without touching the envelopes in which they are sealed or even when given to them by my word of mouth I will hand over the five hundred dollars If they can cause invisible agencies to perform in open daylight many of the things which they pretend to accomplish by spirits in the dark I will promptly pay five hundred dollars for the sight In the mean time I think I can reasonably account for and explain all pretended spiritual gymnastic performances throwings of hair brushes dancing pianos spirit rapping table tipping playing of musical instruments and flying through the air in the dark and a thousand other wonderful manifestations which like most of the performances of modern magicians are passing strange until explained and then they are as flat as dish water doctor Von Vleck publicly produces all of these pretended manifestations in open daylight without claiming spiritual aid Among the number of humbugs that owe their existence to various combinations of circumstances and the extreme gullibility of the human race the following was related to me by a gentleman whose position and character warrant me in announcing that it may be implicitly relied upon as correct in every particular Some time before the Presidential election a photographer residing in one of our cities an ingenious man and a scientific chemist was engaged in making experiments with his camera hoping to discover some new combination whereby to increase the facility of picturing the human form divine et cetera One morning his apparatus being in excellent order he determined to photograph himself No sooner thought of than he set about making his arrangements All being ready he placed himself in a position remained a second or two and then instantly closing his camera surveyed the result of his operation On bringing the picture out upon the plate he was surprised to find a shadowy representation of a human being so remarkably ghostlike and supernatural that he became amused at the discovery he had made The operation was repeated until he could produce similar pictures by a suitable arrangement of his lenses and reflectors known to no other than himself About this time he became acquainted with one of the most famous spiritualist writers and in conversation with him showed him confidentially one of those photographs with also the shadow of another person with the remark mysteriously whispered I assure you Sir upon my word as a gentleman and by all my hopes of a hereafter that this picture was produced upon the plate as you see it at a time when I had locked myself in my gallery and no other person was in the room It appeared instantly as you see it there and I have long wished to obtain the opinion of some man like yourself who has investigated these mysteries The spiritualist listened attentively looked upon the picture heard other explanations examined other pictures and sagely gave it as his opinion that the inhabitants of the unknown sphere had taken this mode of re appearing to the view of mortal eyes that this operator must be a medium of especial power The New York Herald of Progress a spiritualist paper printed the first article upon this man s spiritual photograph The acquaintance thus begun was continued and the photographer found it very profitable to oblige his spiritual friend by the reproduction of ghost like pictures ad infinitum at the rate of five dollars each Mothers came to the room of the artist and gratefully retired with ghostly representations of departed little ones Widows came to purchase the shades of their departed husbands Husbands visited the photographer and procured the spectral pictures of their dead wives Parents wanted the phantom portraits of their deceased children Friends wished to look upon what they believed to be the lineaments of those who had long since gone to the spirit land All who sought to look on those pictures were satisfied with what had been shown them and by conversation on the subject increased the number of visitors In short every person who heard about this mystery determined to verify the wonderful tales related by looking upon the ghostly lineaments of some person who they believed inhabited another sphere And here I may as well mention that one of the faithful obtained a spirit picture of a deceased brother who had been dead more than five years and said that he recognized also the very pattern of his cravat as the same that he wore in life Can human credulity go further than to suppose that the departed still appear in the old clo of their earthly wardrobe and the fact that the appearance of the shade of a young lady in one of the fashionable cut Zouave jackets of the hour did not disturb the faith of the believers fills us indeed with wonder The fame of the photographer spread throughout the spiritual circles and pilgrims to this spiritual Mecca came from remote parts of the land and before many months caused no little excitement among some persons inclined to believe that the demonstrations were entirely produced by human agency The demand for spirit pictures consequently increased until the operator was forced to raise his price to ten dollars whenever successful in obtaining a true spirit picture or to be overwhelmed with business that now interfered with his regular labors About this time the famous Peace Conference had been concluded by the issue of mister Lincoln s celebrated letter To whom it may concern and William Cornell Jewett with his head full of projects for restoring peace to a suffering country heard about the mysterious photographer and visited the operator Sir said he I must consult with the spirits of distinguished statesmen We need their counsel This cruel war must stop Brethren slaying brethren it is horrible Sir Can you show me John Adams Can you show me Daniel Webster Let me look upon the features of Andrew Jackson I must see that noble glorious wise old statesman Henry Clay whom I knew Could you reproduce Stephen A Douglas with whom to counsel at this crisis in our national affairs I should like to meet the great Napoleon Such here obtained would increase my influence in the political work that I have in hand In his own nervous impetuous excited way Colorado Jewett continued to urge upon the photographer the great importance of receiving such communications or some evidence that the spirits of our deceased statesmen were watching over and counseling those who desire to re unite the two opposing forces fighting against each other on the soil of a common country With much caution the photographer answered the questions presented Arranging the camera he produced some indistinct figures and then concluded that the conditions were not sufficiently favorable to attempt anything more before the next day On the following morning Jewett appeared nervous garrulous and excited at the prospect of being in the presence of those great men whose spirits he desired to invoke The apparatus was prepared utter silence imposed and for some time the heart of the peace seeker could almost be heard thumping within the breast of him who sought supernatural aid in his efforts to end our cruel civil war Then overcome by his own thoughts Jewett disturbed the conditions by changing his position and muttering short invocations addressed to the shades of those he wished to behold The operator finally declared he could not proceed and postponed his performance for that day So excuses were made until the mental condition of mister Jewett had reached that state which permitted the photographer to expect the most complete success Everything being prepared Jewett breathlessly awaited the expected presence Quietly the operator produced the spectral representation of the elder Adams Jewett scrutinized the plate and expressed a silent wonder accompanied no doubt with some mental appeals addressed to the ancient statesman Then writing the name of Webster upon a slip of paper he passed it over to the photographer who gravely placed the scrap of writing upon the camera and presently drew therefrom the ghost like but well remembered features of the Sage of Marshfield Colorado Jewett was now thoroughly impressed with the spiritual power producing these images and in ecstasy breathed a prayer that Andrew Jackson might appear to lend his countenance to the conference he wished to hold with the mighty dead Jackson s well known features came out upon call after due manipulation of the proper instrument Glorious trio of departed statesmen thought Jewett help us by your counsels in this the day of our nation s great distress Next Henry Clay s outline was faintly shown from the tomb and here the sitter remarked that he expected him After him came Stephen A Douglas and the whole affair was so entirely satisfactory to Jewett that after paying fifty dollars for what he had witnessed he the next day implored the presence of George Washington offering fifty dollars more for a spiritual sight of the Father of our Country This request smote upon the ear of the photographer like an invitation to commit sacrilege His reverence for the memory of Washington was not to be disturbed by the tempting offer of so many greenbacks He could not allow the features of that great man to be used in connection with an imposture perpetrated upon so deluded a fanatic as Colorado Jewett In short the conditions were unfavorable for the apparition of General Washington and his visitor must remain satisfied with the council of great men that had been called from the spirit world to instill wisdom into the noddle of a foolish man on this terrestrial planet Having failed to obtain by the agency of the operator a glimpse of Washington Jewett clasped his hands together and sinking upon his knees said looking toward Heaven O spirit of the immortal Washington look down upon the warring elements that convulse our country and kindly let thy form appear to lend its influence toward re uniting a nation convulsed with civil war It is needless to say that this prayer was not answered The spirit would not come forth and although quieted by the explanations and half promises of the photographer the peace messenger departed convinced that he had been in the presence of five great statesmen and saddened by the reflection that the shade of the immortal Washington had turned away its face from those who had refused to follow the counsels he gave while living Soon after this Jewett ordered duplicates of these photographs to the value of twenty dollars more I now have on exhibition in my Museum several of the veritable portraits taken at this time in which the well known form and face of mister Jewett are plainly depicted and on one of which appears the shade of Henry Clay on another that of Napoleon the First and on others ladies supposed to represent deceased feminines of great celebrity It is said that Jewett sent one of the Napoleonic pictures to the Emperor Louis Napoleon Not long after Colorado Jewett had beheld these wonderful pictures and worked himself up into the belief that he was surrounded by the great and good statesmen of a former generation a lady without making herself known called upon the photographer I am informed that she is the wife of a distinguished official She had heard of the success of others and came to verify their experience under her own bereavement Completely satisfied by the apparition exhibited she asked for and obtained a spectral photograph resembling her son who some months previously had gone to the spirit land It is said that the same lady asked for and obtained a spiritual photograph of her brother whom she had recently heard was slain in battle and when she returned home she found him alive and as well as could be expected under the circumstances But this did not shake her faith in the least She simply remarked that some evil spirit had assumed her brother s form in order to deceive her This is a very common method of spiritualists digging out when the impositions of the money operators are detected This same lady has recently given her personal influence in favor of the medium Colchester in Washington One of these impressions bearing the likeness of this distinguished lady was accidentally recognized by a visitor This capped the climax of the imposture and satisfied the photographer that he was committing a grave injury upon society by continuing to produce spiritual pictures and subsequently he refused to lend himself to any more manifestations of this kind He had exhausted the fun I need only explain the modus operandi of effecting this illusion to make apparent to the most ignorant that no supernatural agency was required to produce photographs bearing a resemblance to the persons whose apparition was desired The photographer always took the precaution of inquiring about the deceased his appearance and ordinary mode of wearing the hair Then selecting from countless old negatives the nearest resemblance it was produced for the visitor in dim ghostlike outline differing so much from anything of the kind ever produced that his customers seldom failed to recognize some lineament the dead person possessed when living especially if such relative had deceased long since The spectral illusions of Adams Webster Jackson Clay and Douglas were readily obtained from excellent portraits of the deceased statesmen from which the scientific operator had prepared his illusions for Colorado Jewett In placing before my readers this incident of Spiritual Photography I can assure them that the facts are substantially as related and I am now in correspondence with gentlemen of wealth and position who have signified their willingness to support this statement by affidavits and other documents prepared for the purpose of opening the eyes of the people to the delusions daily practised upon the ignorant and superstitious CHAPTER XV BANNER OF LIGHT MESSAGES FROM THE DEAD SPIRITUAL CIVILITIES SPIRIT HOLLERING HANS VON VLEET THE FEMALE DUTCHMAN missus CONANT S CIRCLES PAINE S TABLE TIPPING HUMBUG EXPOSED The Banner of Light a weekly journal of romance literature and general intelligence published in Boston is the principal organ of spiritualism in this country Its general intelligence is rather questionable though there is no doubt about its being a journal of romance strongly tinctured with humbug and imposture It has a Message Department the proprietors of the paper claiming that each message in this department of the Banner was spoken by the spirit whose name it bears through the instrumentality of missus J H Conant while in an abnormal condition called the trance I give a few specimens of these messages Thus for instance discourseth the Ghost of Lolley How do Don t know me do you Know George Lolley Yes How do you do I m first rate I m dead ain t you afraid of me You know I was familiar with those sort of things so I wasn t frightened to go Well won t you say to the folks that I m all right and happy that I didn t suffer a great deal had a pretty severe wound got over that all right went out from Petersburg I was in the battle before Petersburg got my discharge from there Remember me kindly to mister Lord Well tell em as soon as I get the wheels a little greased up and in running order I ll come back with the good things as I said I would George W Lolley Good bye Immediately after a message from the spirit of John Morgan the guerrilla came one from Charles Talbot who began as follows with a curious apostrophe to his predecessor Hi yah old grisly It s lucky for you I didn t get in ahead of you I am Charlie Talbot of Chambersburg Pa Was wounded in action captured by the Rebels and died on their hands as they say of the horse It seems a little rude for one spirit to term another Old Grisly but such may be the style of compliment prevailing in the spirit world Here is what Brother Klink said John Klink of the Twenty fifth South Carolina I want to open communication with Thomas Lefar Charleston S C I am deucedly ignorant about this coming back dead railroad business It s new business to me as I suppose it will be to some of you when you travel this way Say I will do the best I can to communicate with my friends if they will give me an opportunity I desire mister Lefar to send my letter to my family when he receives it he knows where they are and then report to this office Good night afternoon or morning I don t know which I walked out at Petersburg Here is a message from George W Gage with some of the questions which he answered How do you like your new home First rate I likes heigho I likes to come here for they clears all the truck away before you get round and fix up so you can talk right off Wasn t you a medium No Sir I wasn t afraid though nor my mother ain t either Oh I knew about it I knew before I come to die about it My mother told me about it I knew I d be a woman when I come here too Did you Yes sir my mother told me and said I musn t be afraid Oh I don t likes that but I likes to come I forgot Sir my mother s deaf and always had to holler That gentleman says folks ain t deaf here The observable points are first that he seems to have excused his hollering by the habits consequent upon his mother s deafness The hollering consisted of unusually heavy thumping I suppose But the second point is of far greater interest George intimates that he has changed his sect and become a woman For this important alteration his good mother had prepared his mind This style of thing will not seem so strange if we consider that some men become old women before they die Here is another case of feminification and restitution combined Hans Von Vleet has become a vrow what you may call a female Dutchman It has always been claimed that women are purer and better than men and accordingly we see that as soon as Hans became a woman he insisted on his widow s returning to a Jew two thousand dollars that naughty Hans had Christianed the poor Hebrew out of But let Hans tell his own story I was Hans Von Vleet ven I vas here I vas Von Vleet here I is one vrow now I is one vrow ven I comes back I vas no vrow ven I vas here alluding to the fact that he was temporarily occupying the form of our medium I wish you to know that I first live in Harlem State of New York Ven I vos here I take something I had no right to take something that no belongs to me I takes something I takes two thousand dollars that was no my own that s what I come back to say about I first have some dealings with one Jew that s what you call him He likes to Jew me and I likes to Christian him I belongs to the Dutch Reform Church Do you think you were a good member Vell I vas I believes in the creed I takes the sacrament I lives up to it outside I no lives up to it inside I suppose How do you find yourself now Hans Vell I finds myself vell I don t know I not feel very happy Ven I comes to the spirit land I first meet that Jew s brother and he tells me Hans you mus go back and makes some right with my brother So I comes here I vants my vrow what I left in Harlem to takes that two tousand dollars and gives it back to that Jew s vrow That s what I came for to day Sir Has your vrow got it Vell my vrow has got it in a tin box Ven I first go I takes the money I gives it to my vrow and she takes care of it Now I vants my vrow to give that two tousand dollars to that Jew s vrow How do you spell your name The vrow knows how to spell Hans Von Vleet There s a something you cross in it The vrow spells the rest Ah that s wrong you makes a blunder Its V not F That s like all vrows Do all vrows make blunders Vell I don t know all do sometimes I suppose Didn t you like vrows here Oh vell I likes em sometimes I likes mine own vrow I not likes to be a vrow myself Don t the clothes fit Ah vell I suppose they fits but I not likes to wear what not becomes me It is scarcely necessary to make comments on such horrible nonsense as this I may recur to the subject in future should it appear expedient At present I must drop the subject of female men At the head of the Message Department is a standing advertisement which reads as follows Our free circles are held at No one hundred fifty eight Washington street Room No four up stairs on Monday Tuesday and Thursday afternoons The circle room will be open for visitors at two o clock services commence at precisely three o clock after which time no one will be admitted Donations solicited On the days and at the hour mentioned in the above advertisement quite an audience assembles to hear the messages missus C may have to deliver If a stranger present should request a message from one of his spirit friends he would be told that a large number of spirits were seeking to communicate through that instrument and each must await his turn Having read obituary notices in the files of old newspapers and the published list of those recently killed in battle the medium has data for any number of messages She talks in the style that she imagines the person whom she attempts to personate would use being one of the doctrines of spiritualism that a person s character and feelings are not changed by death To make the humbug more complete she narrates imaginary incidents asserting them to have occurred in the earth experience of the spirit who purports to have possession of her at the same time she is speaking Mediums in various parts of the country furnish her with the names of and facts relative to different deceased people of their acquaintance and those names and facts are used by her in supplying the Message Department of the Banner of Light If the assumed mediumship of this woman was not an imposture some of the many people who have visited her for the purpose of getting communications from their spirit friends would have been gratified In most of the messages published in the Banner the spirits purporting to give them express a great desire to have their mortal friends receive them but those mortals who seek to obtain through missus Conant satisfactory messages from their spirit friends are not gratified the medium not being posted The mediums are as much opposed to new tests as a non committal politician Time and again have leading spiritualists in various parts of the country indorsed as spiritual manifestations what was subsequently proved to be an imposture Several years ago a man by the name of Paine created a great sensation in Worcester Mass by causing a table to move without contact he claiming that it was done by spirits through his mediumship He subsequently came to New York and exhibited the manifestation at the house of a spiritualist where he boarded in the upper part of the city A great many spiritualists and not a few skeptics went to see his performance Paine was a very soft spoken good sort of a fellow and appeared to be quite sincere in his claims to mediumship He received no fee from those who witnessed his exhibition and that fact in connection with others tended to disarm people of suspicion His seances were held in the evening and each visitor was received by him at the door and immediately conducted to a seat next the wall of the room The visitors all in and seated mister Paine took a seat with the rest in the circle In the middle of the room a small table had previously been placed and the gas had been turned partly off leaving just enough light to make objects look ghostly In order to get harmonized singing was indulged in for a short time by members of the circle Soon a number of raps would be heard in the direction of the table and one side of that piece of furniture would be seen to rise about an inch from the floor Some very naturally wanted to rush to the table and investigate the matter more closely but Paine forbade that the necessary conditions must be observed he said or there would be no further manifestation of spirit power As there was no one nearer to the table than six or eight feet the fact of its moving very naturally astonished the skeptics present Several seeing mediums who attended mister Paine s seances were able to see the spirits so they declared who moved the table One was described as a big Injun who cut various capers and appeared to be much delighted with the turn of affairs Believers were wonderfully well pleased to know that at last a medium was developed through whom the inhabitants of another world could manifest their presence to mortals in such a way that no one could gainsay the fact The invisibles freely responded by raps on the table to various questions asked by those in the circle They thumped time to lively tunes and seemed to have a decidedly good time of it in their particular way When the seance was concluded mister Paine freely permitted an examination of his table In the Sunday Spiritual Conferences then held in Clinton Hall leading spiritualists gave an account of the manifestations of the spirits through mister Paine and as believers congratulated themselves upon the existence of such indubitable facts The spiritualist in whose house this exhibition of table moving without contact took place was well known as a man of strict honesty and it was reasonably presumed that no mechanical contrivance could be used without his cognizance in thus moving a piece of his furniture for the table belonged to him and that he would countenance a deception was out of the question There were in the city three gentlemen who had for some time been known as spiritualists but they were at the period of Paine s debut as a medium in New York very skeptical with regard to physical manifestations They had a short time before detected the Davenports and other professed mediums in the practice of imposture and they determined not to accept as true Paine s pretence to mediumship till after a thorough investigation of his manifestations they should fail to find a material cause for them After attending several of his seances these gentlemen concluded that Paine moved the table by means of a mechanical contrivance fixed under the floor One of this trio of investigators was a mechanic and he had conceived a way and it seemed to him the only way in which the manifestation could be produced under the circumstances that apparently attended it Paine was a mechanic and these parties were aware of that fact They made an appointment with him for a private seance The evening fixed upon having arrived they met with him at his room The table was raised and raps were made upon it as had been done on previous occasions One of the three investigators stepped to the door of the room locked it put the key in his pocket took off his coat and told mister Paine that he was determined to search his Paine s person and that if he did not find about him a small short iron rod by means of which through a hole in the floor a lever underneath was worked in moving the table he the speaker would beg his mister Paine s pardon and be forever after a firm believer in the power of disembodied spirits to move ponderable bodies This impressive little speech had a decided and instant effect upon the medium Gentlemen said the latter I might as well own up Please to be quietly seated and I will tell you all about it And he did tell them all about it subsequently repeating his confession before quite a number of disgusted and cheaply sold spiritualists at the New York Spiritual Lyceum The theory formed by one of the three investigators referred to as to Paine s method of moving the table was singularly correct Whilst the family with whom Paine boarded was away one day in attendance at a funeral he took up several of the floor boards of the back parlor and on the under side of them affixed a lever with a cross piece at one end of it and in the ends of the cross piece bits of wire were inserted the wire being just as far apart as the legs of the table to be moved Small holes were made in the floor boards for the wire to come through to reach the table legs The other end of the lever came within an inch or two of the wall When all the arrangements were completed and the table being properly placed in order to move it mister Paine had only to insert one end of a short iron rod in a hole in the heel of his boot put the other end of the rod through a hole in the floor just under the edge of the carpet near the wall and then press the rod down upon the end of the lever The movements necessary in fixing the iron rod to its place were executed while he was picking up his handkerchief that he had purposely dropped The middle of the lever was attached to the floor and the end with the cross piece being the heavier brought the other end close up against the floor the wires in the cross piece having their points just within the bottom of the holes in the floor The room was carpeted and there were little marks on the carpet known only to Paine that enabled him to know just where to place the table Pressing down the end of the lever nearest the wall an inch would bring the wires in the cross piece on the other end of the lever against the legs of the table and slightly raise the latter One of the wires would strike the table leg a very little before the other did and that enabled the medium to very nicely rap time to the tunes that were sung or played Of course no holes that any one could observe would be made in the carpet by the passage of the wires through it For appearance sake Paine before his detection visited by invitation the houses of several different spiritualists for the purpose of holding seances but he never got a table to move without contact in any other than the place where he had properly prepared the conditions CHAPTER XVI

2541-185493-0004	train-other-500	a seance of that celebrated humbug Foster I should see something that I could not explain Now this anonymous letter as I know by a spiritual communication or otherwise
2541-185493-0005	train-other-500	is in a handwriting very wonderfully like that of mister Foster himself And as for the substance of it it is very likely that Foster has now gotten up some new tricks He needs them
2541-185493-0006	train-other-500	The exhibiting mediums must of course contrive new tricks
none	none	 as fast as doctor Von Vleck and men like him 
2541-185493-0007	train-other-500	show up their old ones It is the universal method of all sorts of impostors
none	none	 to adopt new means of fooling people when their old ones are exposed And mister Foster shall have all the attention he wants if I ever find the leisure to bestow on him though my time is fully occupied with worthier objects I have also been complimented with a buzz and an attempt to sting from my old friend 
2541-185493-0008	train-other-500	S B Brittan the ex Universalist minister the very surprisingly efficient man Friday of Andrew Jackson Davis in the production of the Revelations of the said Davis
2541-185493-0009	train-other-500	and also ghost fancier in general who has gently aired part of his vocabulary in a communication to the Banner of Light with the heading Exposed for Two Shillings I can afford very well to expose friend Brittan
2541-185493-0010	train-other-500	and his spiritualist humbugs for two shillings The honester the cheaper It evidently vexes the spiritualists
none	none	 to have their ghosts put with the monkeys in the Museum 
2541-185493-0011	train-other-500	They can t help it though and it is my deliberate opinion that the monkeys are much the most respectable I have no wish to displease any honest person
none	none	 but the more the spiritualists squirm and snarl and scold and call names 
2541-185493-0012	train-other-500	the more they show that I am hurting them Or does my friend Brittan himself want an engagement at the Museum Will he produce some manifestations there
none	none	 and get that five hundred dollars the money is ready 
2541-185493-0013	train-other-500	A valued friend of mine has furnished me a pleasant and true narrative of a fine spiritual humbug which took place in a respectable Massachusetts village not very long ago I give the story in his own graphic words
2541-185493-0014	train-other-500	Two artists of Boston tired of the atmosphere of their studios resolved themselves in joint session into spiritual mediums as a means of raising the wind or the devil and of getting a little fresh air in the rural districts
none	none	 One of them had learned Mansfield s trick of answering communications 
2541-185493-0015	train-other-500	and that of writing on the arms They had large handbills printed announcing that mister W Howard the celebrated test medium
none	none	 would visit the town of and would remain at the Hotel during three days 
2541-185493-0016	train-other-500	One of the artists preceded the other by a few hours engaged rooms and attended to sundry preliminaries mister Howard donned a white choker put his hair behind his ears
2541-185493-0017	train-other-500	and mounted a pair of plain glass spectacles and such was his profoundly spiritual appearance on entering his apartments at the hotel that he had to lock the door
2541-185493-0018	train-other-500	and give his partner opportunity to explode and absolutely roll about on the floor with laughter Well they rigged a clothes horse for a screen and to heighten the effect the assistant who was expert in portraiture
2541-185493-0019	train-other-500	covered this screen and indeed the walls of the room with scraggy outlines of the human countenance upon large sheets of paper These they said were executed by the draftsman whose right hand when under spiritual influence
2541-185493-0020	train-other-500	uncontrollably jerked off these likenesses They added that the spirits had given information that before the mediums left town
none	none	 the people would recognize these pictures as likenesses of persons there deceased within twenty years or so Price two dollars each They absolutely sold quite a large number of these portraits 
2541-185493-0021	train-other-500	as they were from time to time recognized by surviving friends The operation of drawing portraits was also illustrated at certain hours admission fifty cents if not satisfactory the money returned
2541-185493-0022	train-other-500	Other tricks of various kinds were performed with pleasure to all parties and profit to the performers The artists stood it as long as they could and then departed
2541-185493-0023	train-other-500	But there was every indication that the towns people would have stood it until this day Thus far my friend s curious and truthful account A little while ago there was exhibiting at Washington a test medium whose name I would print
2541-185493-0024	train-other-500	were it not that I do not want to advertise him One of his most impressive feats was to cause spiritual hands and other parts of the human frame to appear in the air a la Davenport Brothers
2541-185493-0025	train-other-500	A gentleman whose name I also know very well indeed but have particular reasons for not mentioning went one day to see this test medium along with a friend and asked to see a hand
2541-185493-0026	train-other-500	Certainly the medium said and the room was darkened and the circle made round the table in the usual manner After about five minutes my friend who had contrived to place himself pretty near the medium
2541-185493-0027	train-other-500	saw sure enough a dim glimmering blue light in the air a foot or so before and above the head of the medium In a minute he could see dimly outlined in this blue light the form of a hand
2541-185493-0028	train-other-500	back toward him fingers together and no thumb Why is no thumb visible asked my friend of the medium in a solemn manner The reason is said the medium still more solemnly that the spirits have not power enough
none	none	 to produce a whole hand and so they exhibit as much as they can And do they always show hands without thumbs Yes Here my friend with a sudden jump grabbed for the place where the wrist of the mysterious hand ought to be 
2541-185493-0029	train-other-500	Strange to relate he caught it and held it stoutly to A light was quickly had when still stranger the spirit hand was clearly seen to be the fleshy paw of the medium
2541-185493-0030	train-other-500	and a fat paw it was too mister Medium took the matter with the coolness of a thorough rascal and lighting a cigar merely observed Well gentlemen you needn t trouble yourselves to come here any more
2541-185493-0031	train-other-500	He also insisted on his usual fee of five dollars until threatened with a prosecution for swindling The secret of this worthy gentleman is simple and soon told Holding one hand up in the air
2541-185493-0032	train-other-500	he held up with the other between the thumb and finger a little pinch of phosphorus and bi sulphide of carbon which gave the blue light If inconvenient to hold up the other hand
none	none	 he had a reserve pinch of blue light 
2541-185493-0033	train-other-500	under that invisible thumb It is a curious instance of the thorough credulity of genuine spiritualists
none	none	 that a believer in this wretched rogue on being circumstantially told this whole story not only steadily and firmly refused to credit it and continued his faith in the fellow but absolutely would not go to see the application of any other test That s the sort of follower that is worth having Another case was witnessed as follows by the very same person on whose authority I give the spirit hand story He was present also this time in Washington as it happened 
2541-185493-0034	train-other-500	at an exhibition by a certain pair of spiritual brothers since well known as the Davenport Brothers These chaps after the fashion of their kind caused themselves to be tied up in a rope an old sea captain tying them
2541-185493-0035	train-other-500	This done their shop or cabinet was shut upon them as usual and the bangs throwing of sticks et cetera through a window and the like took place Well this sly and inconvenient old sea captain
2541-185493-0036	train-other-500	now slipped out of the hall a few minutes and came back with some wheat flour Having tied up the brothers again he remarked Now gentlemen please to take each your two hands full of wheat flour
2541-185493-0037	train-other-500	The brothers got mad and flatly refused Then they cooled down and argued saying it wouldn t make any difference and was of no use Well said the ancient mariner if it won t make any difference
2541-185493-0038	train-other-500	you can just as well do it can t you The audience seeing the point were so evidently pleased with the old sailor that the grumbling brothers though with a very bad grace took their fists full of flour and were shut up
2541-185493-0039	train-other-500	There was not the least sign of a manifestation no more than if the wheat flour had shot the brothers dead in their tracks
none	none	 The audience were immensely delighted 
2541-185493-0040	train-other-500	The brothers since that time have learned to perform some tricks with flour in their fists but only when tied by their own friends Since these facts came to my knowledge
2541-185493-0041	train-other-500	the Davenport Brothers have suffered an unpleasant exposure in Liverpool in England
none	none	 the details of which have been kindly forwarded to me by attentive friends there The circumstances in question occurred on the evenings of Tuesday and Wednesday February fourteen and fifteen eighteen sixty five On the first of these evenings a gentleman named Cummins 
2541-185493-0043	train-other-500	selected by the audience as one of the Tying Committee tied one of the Brothers and a mister Hulley the other committee man the other But the Brothers saw instantly that they could not wriggle out of these knots
2541-185493-0044	train-other-500	They therefore refused to let the tying be finished saying that it was brutal although a surgeon present said it was not one tied brother was untied by Ferguson the agent
2541-185493-0045	train-other-500	and then the Brothers went to work and performed their various tricks without the supervision of any committee but amid a constant fire of derision laughter groans shouts and epithets from the audience On the next evening
2541-185493-0046	train-other-500	the audience insisted on having the same committee the Brothers were very reluctant to allow it but had to do so after a long time Ira Davenport refused again however instantly to be tied
2541-185493-0047	train-other-500	as soon as he saw what knot mister Cummins was going to use Cummins however though Ira squirmed most industriously got him tied fast and then Ira called to Ferguson to cut the knot Ferguson did so
2541-185493-0048	train-other-500	and cut Ira s hand Ira now shewed the blood to the audience and the Brothers with an immense pretense of indignation went off the stage Cummins at once explained
2541-185493-0049	train-other-500	the audience became disgusted and enraged at the impudence of the imposture broke over the foot lights knocked Ferguson backward into the cabinet and when the discomfited agent had scrambled out and run away smashed the thing fairly into kindling wood
none	none	 and carried it off all distributed into splinters and chips Early next morning the terrified Davenports ran away out of Liverpool and a number of the audience were at last accounts intending to go to law to get back the money paid for an exhibition 
2541-185493-0050	train-other-500	which they did not see The very thorough exposure of the Davenports thus made is an additional proof if such were needed
none	none	 of the truth of what I have alleged about the impostures perpetrated 
2541-185493-0051	train-other-500	by them and their mysterious brethren of the exhibiting sort Once the spirits were stumped with a shingle a very proper yankee jaw bone of an ass to route such disembodied Philistines
none	none	 One day a certain person was present where some tables were rambling about and other revolutions taking place in the furniture business when he stepped boldly forth like a herald bearing defiance and cast down a common white pine shingle 
2541-185493-0052	train-other-500	upon the floor There said he coolly if you can trot those tables about in that style do it with that shingle
none	none	 Make it go about the room Make it move an inch And lo and behold the shingle lay perfectly still CHAPTER XVII THE DAVENPORT BROTHERS SHOWN UP ONCE MORE doctor NEWTON AT CHICAGO THE SPIRITUALIST BOGUS BABY A LADY BRINGS FORTH A MOTIVE FORCE GUM ARABIC SPIRITUALIST HEBREW THE ALLEN BOY doctor RANDALL PORTLAND EVENING COURIER THE FOOLS NOT ALL DEAD YET Other spiritual facts have come to my hand some of them furnishing additional details about persons to whom I have already alluded and others being important to illustrate some general tendencies of spiritualism And first about the Davenport Brothers they have met with another awful exposure at the hands of a merciless mister Addison This gentleman is a London stockbroker and his cool sharp business habits seem to have stood him in good stead in taking some fun out of the fools who follow the Davenports mister Addison it seems went to work and just to amuse his friends executed all the Davenport tricks Upon this the spiritualist newspapers in England which like the Boston Herald of Progress claim to believe in the Brothers came out and said that Addison was a very wonderful medium indeed On this the cold blooded Addison at once printed a letter in which he not only said he had done all their tricks without spiritual aid but he moreover explained exactly how he caught the Davenports in their impositions He and a long legged friend went to one of the dark seances of the Davenports during which musical instruments were to fly about over the heads of the audience bang their pates thrum twang et cetera Addison and his friend took a front seat as soon as the lights were put out they put out their legs too stretching as far as possible and to use the unfeeling language of mister Addison they soon had the satisfaction of feeling some one falling over them They then caught hold of an arm from which a guitar was forthwith let drop on the floor In order to be certain who the guitar carrier was they waited until the next time the lights were put out took each a mouthful of dry flour and blew it out right among the manifestations When the lamps were lighted lo and behold there was Fay the agent and manager of the Davenports with his back all powdered with flour Addison showed this to an acquaintance who said Yes he saw the flour but he could not understand what made Addison and his friend laugh so excessively at it The spiritualist newspapers don t think Addison is so great a medium as they did Great accounts have recently come eastward from Chicago of a certain Doctor Newton who is said to be working miracles by the hundred in the way of healing diseases This man operates with exactly the weapons all the miracle workers quacks and impostors ancient and modern use All of them have appealed to the imaginations of their patients and no person acquainted with mental philosophy is ignorant that many a sick man has been cured either by medicine and imagination together or by imagination alone Therefore even if this Newton should really be the cause of the recovery of some persons from their ailments it would be no more a miracle than if doctor Mott should do it nor would Newton be any the less a quack and a humbug Newton has operated at the East already He had a career at New Haven and Hartford and in other places before he steered westward in the wake of the Star of Empire What he does is simply to ask what is the matter and where it hurts Then he sticks his thumb into the seat of the difficulty or he pokes or strokes or pats it as the case may be Then he says There you re cured God bless you Take yourself off Chicago must be a credulous place for we are informed of immense crowds besieging this man and undergoing his manipulations One of the Chicago papers having little faith and a good deal of fun which in such cases is much better published some burlesque stories and certificates about Doctor Newton some of them humorous enough There is a certificate from a woman with fourteen children all having the measles at once She says that no sooner had Doctor Newton received one lock of hair of one of them than the measles left them all and she now has said measles corked up in a bottle Another case was that of a merchant who had lost his strength but went and was stroked by Newton and the very next day was able to lift a note in bank which had before been altogether too heavy for him There was also an old lady whose story I fear was imitated from Hood s funny conceit of the deaf woman who bought an ear trumpet which was so effective that The very next day She heard from her husband in Botany Bay The Chicago old lady in like manner after having had Doctor Newton s thumbs jobbed into her ears certifies that she heard next morning from her son in California One would think that this ridicule would put the learned doctor Newton to flight but it will not until he is through with the fools I have already given an account of some of the messages from the other world in the Banner of Light in which some of the spirits explain that they have turned into women since they died This is by no means the first remarkable trick that the spirits have performed upon the human organization Here is what they did at High Rock in Massachusetts a number of years ago It beats Joanna Southcott in funny absurdity if not in blasphemy At High Rock in the year eighteen fifty four or thereabouts certain spiritualist people were building some mysterious machinery While this was in process of erection a female medium of considerable eminence in those parts was informed by certain spirits with great solemnity and pomp that she would become the Mary of a new dispensation that is she was going to be a mother Well this was all proper no doubt and the lady herself so say the spiritualist accounts had for some time experienced indications that she was pregnant These indications continued and became increasingly obvious and also it was observed a little queer in some particulars After a while one Spear a Reverend mister Spear who was mixed up it appears with the machinery part of the business and who was a medium himself transmitted to the lady a request from the spirits that she would visit said Spear at High Rock on a certain day She did so of course and while there was unexpectedly taken with the pains of childbirth which the spiritualist authorities say were internal where should they be pray and of the spirit rather than of the physical nature but were nevertheless quite as uncontrollable as those of the latter and not less severe The labor proceeded It lasted two hours As it went on lo and behold one part and another part of the machinery began to move And when at the end of the two hours the parturition was safely over all the machinery was going The lady had given birth to a Motive Force Does anybody suppose I am manufacturing this story Not a bit of it It is all told at length in a book published by a spiritualist and probably a good many of my readers will remember about it Well the baby had to be nursed fact This superhumanly silly female actually went through the motions of nursing the motive force for some weeks Though how the thing sucked Excuse me ladies I would not discuss such delicate subjects did not the interests of truth require it If I had been the physician at any rate I think I should have recommended to hire a healthy female steam engine for a wet nurse to this young motive force say a locomotive for instance I feel sure the thing would have lived if it could have had a gauge faucet or something of that sort to draw on But the medical folks in charge chose to permit the mother to nurse the child and she not being able to supply proper nutriment the poor little innocent faded if that word be appropriate for what couldn t be seen and finally gin eout and the machinery after some abortive joggles and turns stood hopelessly still This story is true that is it is true that the story was told the pretences were gone through and the birth was actually believed by a good many people Some of them were prodigiously enthusiastic about it and called the invisible brat the New Motive Power the Physical Savior Heaven s Last Best Gift to Man the New Creation the Great Spiritual Revelation of the Age the Philosopher s Stone the Act of all Acts and so on and so forth The great question of all was Who was the daddy I don t know of anybody s asking this question but its importance is extreme and obvious For if things like this are going to happen the ladies will be afraid to sleep alone in the house if so much as a sewing machine or apple corer be about and will not dare take solitary walks along any stream where there is a water power A couple of miscellaneous anecdotes may not inappropriately be appended to this story of monstrous delusion Once a writing medium was producing sentences in various foreign languages One of these was Arabic An enthusiastic youth a half believer after inspecting the wondrous scroll handed it to his seat mate a professor as it happened in one of our oldest colleges and a man of real learning The professor scrutinized the document What was the youth s delight to hear him at last observe gravely It is a kind of Arabic sure enough What kind asked the young man with intense interest Gum arabic said the professor The spirit of the prophet Daniel came one night into the apartment of a medium named Fowler and right before his eyes he said wrote down some marks on a piece of paper These were shown to the Reverend George Bush Professor of Hebrew in the New York University who said that they were a few verses from the last chapter of Daniel and were learnedly written Bush was a spiritualist as well as a professor of Hebrew and he ought to have known better than to indorse spirit Hebrew for shortly there came others who to use a rustic phrase took the rag off the Bush These inconvenient personages were three or four persons of learning one a Jew who proved that the document was an attempt to copy the verses in question by some one so ignorant of Hebrew as not to know that it is written backward that is from right to left During the last few months a boy medium by the name of Henry B Allen thirteen years of age has been astonishing people in various parts of the country by Physical Manifestations in the Light The exhibitions of this precocious youngster have been managed by a doctor Randall who also lectures upon Spiritualism expounding its beautiful philosophy For a number of weeks this couple held forth in Boston sometimes giving several seances during the day not more than thirty being allowed to attend at one time each of whom were required to pay an admission fee of one dollar The Banner of Light fully indorsed this Allen boy and gave lengthy accounts of his manifestations The arrangements for his exhibition were very simple A dulcimer guitar bell and small drum being placed on a sofa or several chairs set against the wall a clothes horse was set in front of them and covered with a blanket which came to the floor To obtain manifestations a person was required to take off his coat and sit with his back to the clothes horse The medium then took a seat close to and facing the investigator s left side and grasped the left arm of the latter on the under side above the elbow with his the medium s right hand and near the wrist with the other hand The manager then covered with a coat the arms and left shoulder of the medium including the left arm of the investigator The medium soon commenced to wriggle and twist the manager said he was always nervous under influence and worked the coat away from the position in which it had been placed Taking his right hand from the investigator s arm he readjusted the coat and availed himself of that opportunity to get the investigator s wrist between his the medium s left arm and knee That brought his left hand in such a position that with it he could grasp the investigator s arm where he had previously grasped it with his right hand With the latter he could then reach around the edge of the clothes horse and make a noise on the instruments With the drumsticks he thumped on the dulcimer Taking the guitar by the neck he could vibrate the strings and show the body of the instrument above the clothes horse without any one seeing his hand All persons present were so seated that they could not see behind the clothes horse or have a view of the medium s right shoulder When asked why people were not allowed to occupy such a position that they could have a fair view of the instruments when sounded the manager replied that he did not exactly know but presumed it was because the magnetic emanations from the eyes of the beholders would prevent the spirits being able to move the instruments at all What was claimed to be a spirit hand was often shown above the clothes horse where it flickered for an instant and was withdrawn but it was invariably a right hand with the wrist toward the medium When the person sitting with the medium was asked if the hands of the latter had constantly hold of his arm he replied in the affirmative Of course he felt what he supposed to be both the medium s hands but as I before explained the pressure on his wrist was from the medium s left arm the left hand of whom by means of a very accommodating crook in the elbow was grasping the investigator s arm where the medium s right hand was supposed to be From Boston the Allen boy went to Portland Maine where he succeeded astonishingly till some gentleman applied the lampblack test to his assumed mediumship whereupon he came to grief The following is copied from the Portland Daily Press of March twenty one EXPOSED The wonderful spiritual manifestations of the boy medium Master Henry B Allen in charge of Doctor J H Randall of Boston were brought to a sad end last evening by the impertinent curiosity and wicked doings of some of the gentlemen present at the seance at Congress Hall As usual one of the company present was selected to sit at the side of the boy and allowed his hand and arm to be held by both hands of the boy while the manifestations were going on The boy seized hold of the gentleman s wrist with his left hand and his shoulder or near it with the right hand The manifestations then began and among them was one trick of pulling the gentleman s hair Immediately after this trick was performed the hand of the boy was discovered to be very black from lamp black of the best quality with which the gentleman had dressed his head on purpose to detect whose was the spirit hand that pulled his hair His shirt sleeve upon which the boy immediately replaced his hand after pulling his hair was also black where the hand had been placed The gentleman stated the facts to the company present and the seance broke up doctor Randall refunded the fifty cents admission fee to those present The spiritualists of the city were somewhat staggered by this expose but soon rallied as one of their number announced a new discovery in spiritual science Here it is as stated by himself Whatever the electrical or spirit hand touches will inevitably be transferred to the hand of the medium in every instance unless something occurs to prevent the full operation of the law by which this result is produced The spirit hand being composed in part of the magnetic elements drawn from the medium when it is dissolved again and the magnetic fluid returns whence it came it must of necessity carry with it whatever material substance it has touched and leave it deposited upon the surface or material hand of the medium This is a scientific question How many innocent mediums have been wronged and the invisible have permitted it until we should discover that it was the natural result of a natural law What a great discovery and how lucidly it is set forth The author who by the way is editor of the Portland Evening Courier of this new discovery was not so modest but that he hastened to announce and claim full credit for it in the columns of the Banner of Light the editor of which journal congratulates him on having done so much for the cause of spiritualism Those skeptics who were present when the lamp black was transferred from the gentleman s hair to the medium s hand rashly concluded that the boy was an impostor It remained for mister Hall that is the philosopher s name to make the electro magnetic transfer discovery The Allen boy ought ever to hold him in grateful remembrance for coming to his rescue at such a critical period when the spirits would not vouchsafe an explanation that would exculpate him from the grievous charge of imposture mister Hall deserves a leather medal now and a soapstone monument when he is dead A person whose initials are the same as the gentleman s named above once lived in Aroostook Maine and was in the habit of attending spiritual circles in which he was sometimes influenced as a personating medium and to represent the symptoms of the disease which caused the controlling spirit s translation to another sphere It having been reported in Aroostook that a certain well known individual living further east had died of cholera a desire was expressed at the next circle to have him manifest himself The medium above referred to got under influence and personated with an exhibition of all the symptoms of cholera the gentleman who was reported to have died of that disease So faithful to the supposed facts was the representation that the medium had to be cared for as if he was himself a veritable cholera patient Several days after the man who was personated appeared in Aroostook alive and well never having been attacked with the cholera The local papers gave a graphic account of the manifestation soon after it occurred But to return to the Allen boy After his exposure by means of the lamp black test and mister Hall of the Portland Evening Courier had announced his new discovery in spiritual science several of the Portland spiritualists had a private sitting with the boy While he sat with his hands upon the arm of one of their number they tied a rope to his wrists and around the person s arm covering his hands in the way I have before described After some wriggling and twisting the usual amount of nervousness the bell was heard to ring behind the clothes horse The boy s right hand was then examined and it was found to be stained with some colored matter that had previously been put upon the handle of the bell As the boy s wrists were still tied and the rope remained upon the man s arm the transfer theory was considered to be established as a fact and the previous exposure shown to be not only no exposure at all but a stepping stone to a grand truth in spiritual science Again and again did these persistent and infatuated spiritualists try what they call the transfer test varying with each experiment the coloring material used and every time the bell was rung the medium s right hand was found out to be stained with what had been put upon the bell handle By having a little slack rope between his wrist and the man s arm it was not a difficult matter for the medium while his nervousness was being manifested to get hold of the bell and ring it and to make sounds upon the strings of the dulcimer or guitar with a drumstick that the manager had placed at a convenient distance from his the boy s hand The Portland Daily Press in noticing a lecture against Spiritualism recently delivered by doctor Von Vleck in that city says He doctor V V performed the principal feats of the Allen boy with his hands tied to the arm of the person with whom he was in communication Horace Greeley says that if a man will be a consummate jackass and fool he is not aware of anything in the Constitution to prevent it I believe mister Greeley is right and I think no one can reasonably be expected to exercise common sense unless he is known to possess it It is quite natural therefore that many of the spiritualists lacking common sense should pretend to have something better III TRADE AND BUSINESS IMPOSITIONS CHAPTER XVIII ADULTERATIONS OF FOOD ADULTERATIONS OF LIQUOR THE COLONEL S WHISKEY THE HUMBUGOMETER It was about eight hundred and fifty years before Christ when the young prophet cried out to his master Elisha over the pottage of wild gourds There is death in the pot It was two thousand six hundred and seventy years afterward in eighteen twenty that Accum the chemist cried out over again There is death in the pot in the title page of a book so named which gave almost everybody a pain in the stomach with its horrid stories of the unhealthful humbugs sold for food and drink This excitement has been stirred up more than once since mister Accum s time with some success yet nothing is more certain than that a very large proportion of the food we eat of the liquid we drink always excepting good well filtered water and the medicines we take not to say a word about the clothes we wear and the miscellaneous merchandise we use is more or less adulterated with cheaper materials Sometimes these are merely harmless as flour starch annatto lard et cetera sometimes they are vigorous destructive poisons as red lead arsenic strychnine oil of vitriol potash et cetera It is not agreeable to find ourselves so thickly beset by humbugs to find that we are not merely called on to see them to hear them to believe them to invest capital in them but to eat and drink them Yet so it is and if my short discussion of this kind of humbug shall make people a little more careful and help them to preserve their health I shall think myself fortunate To begin with bread Alum is very commonly put into it by the bakers to make it white Flour of inferior quality runny flour and even that from wormy wheat ground up worms bugs and all is often mixed in as much as the case will bear Potato flour has been known to be mixed with wheat and so thirty years ago were plaster of Paris bone dust white clay et cetera But these are little used now if at all and the worst thing in bread aside from bad flour which is bad enough is usually the alum It is often put in ready mixed with salt and it accomplishes two things viz to make the bread white and to suck up a good deal of water and make the bread weigh well It has been sometimes found that the alum was put in at the mill instead of the bakery Milk is most commonly adulterated with cold water and many are the jokes on the milkmen about their best cow being choked et cetera by a turnip in the pump spout their cow with the wooden tail i e the pump handle and so on Awful stories are told about the London milkmen who are said to manufacture a fearful kind of medicine to be sold as milk the cream being made of a quantity of calf s brain beaten to a slime Stories are told around New York too of a mysterious powder sold by druggists which with water makes milk but it is milk that must be used quickly or it turns into a curious mess But the worst adulteration of milk is to adulterate the old cow herself as is done in the swill milk establishments which received such an exposure a few years ago in a city paper This milk is still furnished and many a poor little baby is daily suffering convulsions from its effects So difficult is it to find real milk for babies in the city that physicians often prescribe the use of what is called condensed milk instead which though very different from milk not evaporated is at least made of the genuine article A series of careful experiments to develop the milk humbug was made by a competent physician in Boston within a few years but he found the milk there aside from swill milk adulterated with nothing worse than water salt and burnt sugar Tea is bejuggled first by John Chinaman who is a very cunning rascal and second by the seller here Green and black tea are made from the same plant but by different processes the green being most expensive To meet the increased demand for green tea Master John takes immense quantities of black tea and paints it by stirring into it over a fire a fine powder of plaster Paris and Prussian blue at the rate of half a pound to each hundred pounds of tea John also sometimes takes a very cheap kind and puts on a nice gloss by stirring it in gum water with some stove polish in it We may imagine ourselves after drinking this kind of tea with a beautiful black gloss on our insides John moreover manufactures vast quantities of what he plainly calls Lie tea This is dust and refuse of tea leaves and other leaves made up with dust and starch or gum into little lumps and used to adulterate better tea Seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds of this nice stuff were imported into England in one period of eighteen months It seems to be used in New York only for green tea Coffee is adulterated with chicory root which costs only about one third as much dandelion root peas beans mangold wurzel wheat rye acorns carrots parsnips horse chestnuts and sometimes with livers of horses and cattle All these things are roasted or baked to the proper color and consistency and then mixed in No great sympathy need be expended on those who suffer from this particular humbug however for when it is so easy to buy the real berry and roast or at least grind it one s self it is our own fault if our laziness leaves us to eat all those sorts of stuff Cocoa is extended with sugar starch flour iron rust Venetian red grease and various earths But it is believed by pretty good authority that the American made preparations of cocoa are nearly or quite pure Even if they are not the whole bean can be used instead Butter and lard have one tenth and sometimes even one quarter of water mixed up in them It is easy to find this out by melting a sample before the fire and putting it away to cool when the humbug appears by the grease going up and the water perhaps turbid with whey settling below Honey is humbugged with sugar or molasses Sugar is not often sanded as the old stories have it Fine white sugar is sometimes floured pretty well and brown sugar is sometimes made of a portion of good sugar with a cheaper kind mixed in Inferior brown sugars are often full of a certain crab like animalcule or minute bug often visible without a microscope in water where the sugar is dissolved It is believed that this pleasing insect sometimes gets into the skin and produces a kind of itch I do not believe there is much danger of adulteration in good loaf or crushed white sugar or good granulated or brown sugar Pepper is mixed with fine dust dirt linseed meal ground rice or mustard and wheat flour ginger with wheat flour colored by turmeric and reinforced by cayenne Cinnamon is sometimes not present at all in what is so called the stuff being the inferior and cheaper cassia bark sometimes it is only part cassia sometimes the humbug part of it is flour and ochre Cayenne pepper is mixed with corn meal and salt Venetian red mustard brickdust fine sawdust and red lead Mustard with flour and turmeric Confectionery is often poisoned with Prussian blue Antwerp blue gamboge ultramarine chrome yellow red lead white lead vermilion Brunswick green and Scheele s green or arsenite of copper Never buy any confectionery that is colored or painted Vinegar is made of whisky or of oil of vitriol Pickles have verdigris in them to make them a pretty green Pretty green he must be who will eat bought pickles Preserved fruits often have verdigris in them too An awful list Imagine a meal of such bewitched food where the actual articles are named Take some of the alum bread Have a cup of pea soup and chicory coffee I ll trouble you for the oil of vitriol if you please Have some sawdust on your meat or do you prefer this flour and turmeric mustard A piece of this verdigris preserve gooseberry pie Madam Won t you put a few more sugar bugs in your ash leaf tea Do you prefer black tea or Prussian blue tea Do you like your tea with swill milk or without I have not left myself space to speak of the tricks played by the druggists and the liquor dealers but I propose to devote another chapter exclusively to the adulteration of liquors in this country It is a subject so fearful and so important that nothing less than a chapter can do it justice I must now end with a story or two and a suggestion or two Old Colonel P sold much whisky and his manner was to sell by sample out of a pure barrel over night at a marvelous cheap rate and then to rectify before morning under pretence of coopering and marking Certain persons having a grudge against the Colonel once made an arrangement with a carman who executed their plan thus He went to the Colonel and asked to see whisky The jolly old fellow took him down stairs and showed him a great cellar full Carman samples a barrel Fust rate Colonel how d ye sell it Colonel names his price on the rectified basis Well Colonel how much yer got So many barrels two or three hundred Colonel here s your money I ll take the lot All right says Colonel P there s some coopering to be done on it some of the hoops and heads are a very little loose You shall have it all in the morning No colonel we ll roll it right out this minnit My trucks are up there all ready And sure enough he had a string of a dozen or more brigaded in the street The Colonel was sadly dumbfounded he turned several colors red mostly stammered made excuses It was no go the whisky was the customer s and the game was up The humbugged old humbug finally came down and bought his man off by paying him several hundred dollars There is a much older and better known story about a grocer who was a deacon and who was heard to call down stairs before breakfast to his clerk John have you watered the rum Yes Sir And sanded the sugar Yes Sir And dusted the pepper Yes Sir And chicoried the coffee Yes Sir Then come up to prayers Let us hope that the grocers of the present day while they adulterate less do not pray less Between eighteen fifty one and eighteen fifty four mister Wakley of the London Lancet gave an awful roasting to the adulteration interest in London He employed an able analyzer who began by going about without telling what he was at and buying a great number of samples of all kinds of food drugs et cetera at a great number of shops Then he analyzed them and when he found humbug in any sample he published the facts and the seller s name and place of business It may be imagined what a terrible row this kicked up Very numerous and violent threats were made but the Lancet was never once sued by any of the aggrieved for it had told the truth Perhaps some discouraged reader may ask What can I eat Well I don t pretend to direct people s diet Ask your doctor if you can t find out But I will suggest that there are a few things that can t be adulterated You can t adulterate an egg nor an oyster nor an apple nor a potato nor a salt codfish and if they are spoiled they will notify you themselves and when good they are all good healthy food In short one good safeguard is to use as far as you can things with their life in them when you buy them whether vegetable or animal The next best rule against these adulteration humbugs is to buy goods crude instead of manufactured coffee and pepper and spices et cetera whole instead of ground for instance Thus though you give more work you buy purity with it And lastly there are various chemical processes and the microscope to detect adulterations and milk in particular may always be tested by a lactometer a simple little instrument which the milkmen use which costs a few shillings and which tells the story in an instant It is a glass bulb with a stem above and a scale on it and a weight below In good average milk at sixty degrees of heat the lactometer floats at twenty on its scale and in poorer milk at from that figure down If it floats at fifteen the milk is one fourth water if at ten one half It would be a wonderful thing for mankind if some philosophic Yankee would contrive some kind of ometer that would measure the infusion of humbug in anything A Humbugometer he might call it I would warrant him a good sale CHAPTER XIX ADULTERATIONS IN DRINKS RIDING HOME ON YOUR WINE BARREL LIST OF THINGS TO MAKE RUM THINGS TO COLOR IT WITH CANAL BOAT HASH ENGLISH ADULTERATION LAW EFFECTS OF DRUGS USED HOW TO USE THEM BUYING LIQUORS UNDER THE CUSTOM HOUSE LOCK A HOMOEOPATHIC DOSE As long as the people of the United States tipple down rum and other liquors at the rate of a good deal more than one hundred million gallons a year besides what is imported and what is called imported as long as they pay for their tippling a good deal more than fifty millions and probably over a hundred millions of dollars a year so long it will be a great object to manufacture false liquors and sell them at the price of true ones When liquor of good quality costs from four to fifteen dollars a gallon and an imitation can be had that tastes just as good and has just as much jizm in it and probably a good deal more for from twenty five cents to one dollar a gallon somebody will surely make and sell that imitation Adulterating and imitating liquors is a very large business and I don t know of anybody who will deny that this particular humbug is very extensively cultivated There are a great many people however who will talk about it as they do in Western towns about fever and ague We don t do anything of the kind here but those other people over there do There is very little pure liquor either malt or spirituous to be obtained in any way The more you pay for it as a rule the more the publican gains but what you drink is none the purer Importing don t help you Port is or used to be for very little is now made comparatively imitated in immense quantities at Oporto and in the log wood trade the European wine makers competed with the dyers It is a London proverb that if you want genuine port wine you have got to go to Oporto and make your own wine and then ride on the barrel all the way home It is perhaps possible to get pure wine in France by buying it at the vineyard but if any dealer has had it give up the idea As for what is done this side of the water now for it I do not rely upon the old work of mister Death in the pot Accum printed some thirty years ago in England My statements come mostly from a New York book put forth within a few years by a New York man whose name is now in the Directory and whose business is said to consist to a great extent in furnishing one kind or another of the queer stuff he talks about to brewers or distillers or wine and brandy merchants This gentleman in a sweet alphabetical miscellany of drugs herbs minerals and groceries commonly used in manufacturing our best Old Bourbon whisky Swan gin Madeira wine pale ale London brown stout Heidsieck Clicquot Lafitte and other nice drinks names the chief of such ingredients as follows Aloes alum calamus flag root capsicum cocculus indicus copperas coriander seed gentian root ginger grains of paradise honey liquorice logwood molasses onions opium orange peel quassia salt stramonium seed deadly nightshade sugar of lead sulphite of soda sulphuric acid tobacco turpentine vitriol yarrow I have left strychnine out of the list as some persons have doubts about this poison ever being used in adulterating liquors A wholesale liquor dealer in New York city however assures me that more than one half the so called whisky is poisoned with it Besides these twenty seven kinds of rum here come twenty three more articles used to put the right color to it when it is made by making a soup of one or another and stirring it in at the right time I alphabet these too alkanet root annatto barwood blackberry blue vitriol brazil wood burnt sugar cochineal elderberry garancine an extract of madder indigo Nicaragua wood orchil pokeberry potash quercitron red beet red cabbage red carrots saffron sanders wood turmeric whortleberry In all in both lists just fifty There are more however But that s enough Now then my friend what did you drink this morning You called it Bourbon or Cognac or Old Otard very likely but what was it The glorious uncertainty of drinking liquor under these circumstances is enough to make a man s head swim without his getting drunk at all There might perhaps be found a consolation like that of the Western traveller about the hash When I travel in a canal boat or steam boat quoth this brave and stout stomached man I always eat the hash because then I know what I ve got It was a good many years ago that the Parliament of England found it necessary to make a law to prevent sophisticating malt liquors Here is the list of things they forbid to put into beer molasses honey liquorice vitriol quassia cocculus indicus grains of paradise Guinea pepper opium The penalty was one thousand dollars fine on the brewer and two thousand five hundred dollars on the druggist who supplied him I know of no such law in this country The theory of our government leaves people to take care of themselves as much as possible But now let us see what some of these fifty ingredients will do Beets and carrots honey and liquorice orange peel and molasses will not do much harm though I should think tipplers would prefer them as the customer at the eating house preferred his flies on a separate plate But the case is different with cocculus indicus and stramonium and sulphuric acid and sugar of lead and the like I take the following accounts so far as they are medical from a standard work by doctor Dunglison Aloes is a cathartic Cocculus indicus contains picrotoxin which is an acrid narcotic poison from five to ten grains will kill a strong dog The boys often call it cockle cinders they pound it and mix it in dough and throw it into the water to catch fish The poor fish eat it soon become delirious whirling and dancing furiously about on the top of the water and then die Copperas tends to produce nausea vomiting griping and purging Grains of paradise a large kind of cardamom is strongly heating and carminative i e anti flatulent and anti spasmodic Opium is known well enough Stramonium seed would seem to have been made on purpose for the liquor business In moderate doses it is a powerful narcotic producing vertigo headache dimness or perversion of vision i e seeing double and confusion of thought N B What else does liquor do In larger doses still like liquor you obtain these symptoms aggravated and then a delirium sometimes whimsical snakes in your boots and sometimes furious a stupor convulsions and death A fine drink this stramonium Sugar of lead is what is called a cumulative poison having the quality of remaining in the system when taken in small quantities and piling itself up as it were until there is enough to accomplish something when it causes debility paralysis and other things Sulphuric acid is strongly corrosive a powerful caustic attacking the teeth even when very dilute eating up flesh and bones alike when strong enough and if taken in a large enough dose an awfully tearing and agonizing fatal poison The way to use these delectable nutriments is in part as follows Stir a little sulphuric acid into your beer This will give you a fine old ale in about a quarter of a minute Take a mixture of alum salt and copperas ground fine and stir into your beer and this will make it froth handsomely Cocculus indicus tobacco leaves and stramonium cooked in the beer et cetera give it force Potash is sometimes stirred into wine to correct acidity Sulphite of soda is now very commonly stirred into cider to keep it from fermenting further Sugar of lead is stirred into wines to make them clear and to keep them sweet And so on through the whole long list It is a curious instance of people s quiet acknowledgment of their own foolishness that a popular form of the invitation to take a drink is Come and h ist in some pizen I know of no plan by which anybody can be sure of obtaining pure liquor of any description Some persons always purchase their wines and liquors while they are under the custom house lock and consequently before they have reached the hands of the importer Yet there are scores of men in New York and Philadelphia who have made large fortunes by sending whisky to France there refining coloring flavoring and doctoring it then re shipping it to New York as French brandy paying the duty and selling it before it has left the custom house There is a locality in France where a certain brand of wine is made It is adulterated with red lead and every year more or less of the inhabitants of that locality are attacked with lead colic caused by drinking this poisoned wine right at the fountain head where it is made There is more bogus champagne drank in any one year in the city of Paris alone than there is genuine champagne made in any one year in the world America ordinarily consumes more so called champagne annually than is made in the world and yet nearly all the genuine champagne in the world is taken by the courts of Europe The genuine Hock wine made at Johannisberg on the Rhine is worth three dollars per bottle by the large quantity and nearly all of it is shipped to Russia yet at any of the hotels in the village of Johannisberg within half a mile from the wine presses of the pure article you can be supplied for a dollar per bottle with what purports to be the genuine Hock wine Since chemistry has enabled liquor dealers to manufacture any description of wine or liquor for twenty five cents to a dollar a gallon there are annually made and sold thousands of gallons of wine and brandy that never smelt a grape Suppose a wholesale liquor merchant imports genuine brandy He usually rectifies and adulterates it by adding eighty five gallons of pure spirits refined whisky to fifteen gallons of brandy to give it a flavor then colors and doctors it and it is ready for sale Suppose an Albany wholesale dealer purchases for pure brandy ten pipes of this adulterated brandy from a New York importer The Albany man immediately doubles his stock by adding an equal quantity of pure spirits There are then seven and a half gallons of brandy in a hundred A Buffalo liquor dealer buys from the Albany man and he in turn adds one half pure spirits The Chicago dealer buys from the Buffalo dealer and as nearly all spirit dealers keep large quantities of pure spirits on hand and know how to use it he again doubles the quantity of his brandy by adding pure spirits and the Milwaukee liquor dealer does the same after purchasing from the Chicago man So in the ordinary course of liquor transactions by the time a hundred gallon pipe of pure brandy reaches Wisconsin at a cost of five or perhaps ten dollars per gallon ninety nine gallons and one pint of it is the identical whisky that was shipped from Wisconsin the same year at fifty cents per gallon Truly a homoeopathic dose of genuine brandy And even that whisky when it left Wisconsin was only half whisky for there are men in the whisky making States who make it a business to take whisky direct from the distillery add to it an equal quantity of water and then bring it up to a bead and the power of intoxication by mixing in a variety of the villainous drugs and deadly poisons enumerated in this chapter The annual loss of strength health and life caused by the adulteration of liquor is truly appalling Those who have not examined the subject can form no just estimate of the atrocious and extensive effects of this murderous humbug CHAPTER XX THE PETER FUNKS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS THE RURAL DIVINE AND THE WATCH RISE AND PROGRESS OF MOCK AUCTIONS THEIR DECLINE AND FALL Not many years ago a dignified and reverend man whose name is well known to me was walking sedately down Broadway He was dressed in clerical garb of black garments and white neckcloth He was a man of great learning profound thought long experience unaffected piety and pure and high reputation All at once a kind of chattering shout smote him fair in the left ear Narfnarfnarf Three shall I have Narfnarfnarfnarfnarf Going at two and a half Gone And the grave divine pausing beheld a doorway over which waved a little red flag Within a company of eager bidders thronged around an auctioneer s stand and the auctioneer himself a well dressed man with a highly respectable look was just handing over to the delighted purchaser a gold watch It would be cheap at one hundred dollars said he in a despondent tone It s mere robbery to sell it for that price I d buy it myself if twas legal And while the others with exclamations of surprise and congratulation crowded to see this famous purchase and the buyer exhibited it with a joyful countenance close by the door the divine just out of curiosity stepped in He owned no watch he was a country clergyman and poor in this world s goods so poor that to use a familiar phrase if steamboats were selling at a dime a piece he would hardly be able to buy a gang plank But what if he could by good luck buy a good gold watch for two dollars and a half in this wonderful city Somehow that watch was snapped open and closed again right under his ministerial nose about six times The auctioneer held up another of exactly the same kind and began to chatter again Now gentlemen what moffered f this first class M I Tobias gold English lever watch full jeweled compensation balance anchor escapement hunting case One did I hear Say two cents wont yer Two and a half narfnarfnarfnarfnarf and a half Two and a half and three quarters Thank you Sir to a sailor like man in the corner Three said a tall and well dressed young gentleman with short hair near the clergyman adding in an undertone I can sell it for fifty this afternoon Three I am offered says mister Auctioneer and chattered on as before And a half did you say Sir Thank you Sir And a halfnarfnarf The reverend divine had said And a half The Peter Funks had got him But he didn t find it out quite yet The bidding was run up to four dollars the clergyman took the watch opened and examined it was convinced handed it back ventured another half and the watch was knocked down to him The auctioneer fumbled in some papers and in a moment handed him his bargain neatly done up This way to the clerk s office if you please Sir he added with a civil bow The clergyman passed a little further in and while the sales proceeded behind him the clerk made out a bill and proffered it Fifty four dollars and a half read the country divine astounded Four and a half is what I bid Four and a half exclaimed the clerk with sarcastic indignation Four dollars and a half A pretty story A minister to have the face to say he could buy an M I Tobias gold watch full jeweled for four dollars and a half Ill thank you for the money Sir Fifty four fifty if you please The auctioneer as if interrupted by the loud tones of the indignant clerk stopped the sale to see what was the matter On hearing the statement of the two parties he cast a glance of angry contempt upon the poor clergyman who by this time was uneasy enough at their scowling faces Then as if relenting he said half sneeringly I don t think you look very well in this business Sir But you are evidently a clergyman and we wish everybody to have fair treatment in this office We won t be imposed upon Sir by any man Here his face darkened and his fists could be seen to clench with much meaning Pay that money Sir This establishment is not to be humbugged But you needn t be afraid of losing anything You may let me take the watch and sell it for you again on the spot Very likely you can get more for it You can t lose The clergyman hesitated The tall and well dressed young man with short hair pushed up and said Don t want it Put her up again G I d like another chance myself A heavily built fellow with one eye observed over the auctioneer s shoulder with an evil look at the divine D d if I don t believe that cuss is a gambler come in here to fool us country folks They allus wears white neckcloths I say search him and boot him out of the shop Hold your tongue answered the auctioneer with dignity I will see you safe Sir to the clergyman But you bid that money and you must pay it We can t do this business on any other principles You will sell it for me again at once asked the poor minister Certainly said the mollified auctioneer And the humbugged divine with an indistinct sense of something wrong but not able to tell what took out forty dollars from his lean wallet and handed it to the clerk It s all I have to get home with he said simply Never fear old gentleman said the clerk affably You ll be all right in two minutes The watch was put up again The clergyman scarce able to believe his ears heard it rapidly run up to sixty dollars and knocked down at that price The cash was handed to the clerk and another bill made out ten per cent deducted commission on sales Usual terms Sir observed the clerk handing over the notes just received for the watch And the divine very thankful to get off for half a dollar hurried off as fast as he could I need not say that his fifty four dollars was all counterfeit money When he went next morning after endeavoring in vain to part with his new funds to find the place where he had been humbugged it was close shut and he could hardly identify even the doorway He went to the police and the shrewd captain told him that it was a difficult business but sent an officer with him to look up the rascals Officer found one demanded redress clergyman did the same Rascal asked clergyman s name got it told him he could prosecute if he liked Clergyman looked at officer officer with indifference observed Means to stick your name in the papers Clergyman said he would take further advice did take it thought he wouldn t be shown up as a greeny in the police reports borrowed money enough to get home with and if he has a gold watch now which I really hope he has got it either for its real value or as a testimonial There that with many variations is the whole story of Peter Funk These mock auctioneers sometimes as in the case I have mentioned take advantage of the respectability of their victims sometimes of their haste to leave the city on business When they could not possibly avoid it they disgorged their prey No instance is known to me of any legal penalty being inflicted on them by a magistrate but they were always until eighteen sixty two treated by police by magistrate and by mayor just as thieves would be who should always be let off on returning their stealings so that they could not lose by thieving and might gain These rascally mock auctioneers thus protected by the authorities used to fleece the public out of not less than sixty thousand dollars a year One of them cleared twelve thousand dollars during the year eighteen sixty one alone And this totally shameless and brazen faced humbug flourished in New York for twenty five years About the first day of June eighteen sixty two the Peter Funks had eleven dens or traps in operation in New York five in Broadway below Fulton street and the others in Park row and Courtlandt Greenwich and Chatham streets The name Peter Funk is said to have been that of the founder of their system but I know nothing more of his career At this date in eighteen sixty two the system was in a high state of organization and success and included the following constituents one Eight chief Funks or capitalists and managers whose names are well enough known I have them on record two About as many more salesmen who took turns with the chiefs in selling and clerking three Seventy or eighty rank and file or ropers in These acted the part of buyers like the purchaser whose delight over his watch helped to deceive the minister and the other bidders on that occasion These fellows dressed up as countrymen sailors and persons of miscellaneous respectability They bid and talked when that was sufficient or helped the managers thrash any troublesome person if necessary Once in a long time they met their match as for instance when the mate of a ship brought up a squad of his crew burst into one of their dens and beat and battered up the whole gang within an inch of their lives But in most cases the reckless infamy of these dregs of city vice gave them an immense advantage over a decent citizen for they could not be defiled nor made ridiculous and he could four Two or three traders in cheap jewelry and fancy goods supplied the Funks with their wares One of these fellows used to sell them fifty or a hundred dollars worth of this trash a day and he lamented as much over their untimely end as the Ephesian silversmiths did over the loss of their trade in shrines five A lawyer received a regular salary of twelve hundred dollars a year to defend all the Funk cases six The city politicians in office and out of it who were wont to receive the aid of the Funks a very energetic cohort at elections and who in return unscrupulously used both power and influence to keep them from punishment All this cunning machinery was brought to naught and New York relieved of a shame and a pest by the courage energy perseverance and good sense of one Yankee officer Russell Wells a policeman mister Wells took about six months to finish up his work He began it of his own accord finding that the spirit of the police regulations required it prosecuted the undertaking without fear or favor finding not very much support from the judicial authorities and sometimes actual and direct discouragement His method was to mount guard over one auction shop at a time and warn all whom he saw going in and to follow up all complaints to the utmost until that shop was closed when he laid siege to another Various offers of money direct and indirect were made him One fellow offered him five hundred dollars to walk on the other side of the street Another offered him one thousand dollars to drop the undertaking Another hinted at a regular salary of hush money saying he had now got these fellows where he could make as much out of them as he wanted to right along Sometimes they threatened him with murder and sudden death Several times they got out an injunction upon him and several times sued him for slander One of their complaints charged with ludicrous hypocrisy that the defendant with malicious intent stood round the door uttering slanderous charges against the good name fame and credit of the defendant just as foolish old lawyers used to argue that the greater the truth the greater the libel Sometimes they argued and indignantly denounced One of them told him he was a thief and a murderer driving men out of employment whose wives and children depended on their business for support Another contended that their business was just as fair as that of the stock operators in Wall street I fear that wasn t making out much of a case But their threats were idle their suits and prosecutions and injunctions never came to a head their bribes did not operate The officer imperturbably good natured but horribly diligent watched and warned and hunted and complained and squeezed back their money at the rate of five hundred dollars or one thousand dollars every month until they were perfectly sickened One by one they shut up shop One went to his farm another to his merchandise another to emigrant running another known by the elegant surname of Blur eye Thompson to raising recruits several into the bounty jumping business Such was the life and death of an outrageous humbug and nuisance whose like was not to be found in any other city on earth and would not have been endured in any except this careless money getting misgoverned one of New York CHAPTER XXI LOTTERY SHARKS BOULT AND HIS BROTHERS KENNETH KIMBALL AND COMPANY A MORE CENTRAL LOCATION WANTED FOR BUSINESS TWO SEVENTEENTHLIES STRANGE COINCIDENCE I have before me a mass of letters printed and lithographed circulars and the like which illustrate well two or three of the most foolish and vicious swindles it is wrong to call them humbugs now extant They also prove that there are a good many more fools alive in our Great Republic than some of us would like to admit These letters and papers are signed respectively by the following names Alexander Van Dusen Thomas Boult company E F Mayo Geo P Harper Browne Sherman company Hammett company Charles A Herbert Geo C Kenneth T Seymour company C W White Purchasing Agency C J Darlington B H Robb company James Conway S B Goodrich Egerton Brothers C F Miner E J Kimball E A Wilson and J T Small All these productions with one or two exceptions are dated during the last three months of eighteen sixty four and January eighteen sixty five They are mailed from a good many different places and addressed to respectable people in all directions In particular should be noticed however two lots of them The first lot are signed either by Thomas Boult company Hammett company Egerton Brothers or T Seymour company When these four documents are placed together each with its inclosure a story is told that seems clear enough to explain itself to the greenest fool in the world These fellows Boult and the rest of them I mean are lottery sharks Now those who buy lottery tickets are very silly and credulous or very lazy or both They want to get money without earning it This foolish and vicious wish however betrays them into the hands of these lottery sharks I wish that each of these poor foolish greedy creatures could study on this set of letters awhile Look at them You see that the lithographed handwriting in all four is in the same hand You observe that each of them incloses a printed hand bill with scheme all looking as like as so many peas They refer you see to the same Havana scheme the same Shelby College Lottery the same managers and the same place of drawing Now see what they say Each knave tells his fool his only object is to put said fool in possession of a handsome prize so that fool may run round and show the money and rope in more fools What an ingenious way to make the fool think he will return value for the prize Each knave further says to his fool I copy the words of the knave from his lithograph letter We are so certain that we know how to select a lucky certificate that if the one we select for you does not at the very least draw a five thousand dollars prize we will what Pay the money ourselves Oh no Knave does not offer to pay half of it Will send you another package in one of our extra lotteries for nothing Observe how particularly every knave is to tell his fool to give us the name of the nearest bank so that the draft for the prize money can be forwarded instantly And in return for all this kindness what do Messrs Boult and so forth want Why almost nothing The ridiculously small sum as mister Montague Tigg observed to mister Pecksniff of ten dollars You observe that Hammett company in one circular demand twenty dollars for the same five thousand dollars prize But the amount they would say is too trifling to be so particular about I will suggest a form for answering these gentlemen Let every one of my readers who receives one of their circulars just copy and date and sign and send them the following GENTLEMEN I thank you for your great kindness in wishing to make me the possessor of a five thousand dollars prize in your truly rich and splendid Royal Havana Lottery I fully believe that you know as you say all about how to get these prizes and that you can make it a big thing But I cannot think of taking all that money from such kind of people as you I must insist upon your having half of it and I will not hear of any refusal I therefore hereby authorize you to invest for me the trifle of ten dollars which you mention and when the prize is drawn to put half of it and ten dollars over right into your own benevolent pantaloons pocket and to remit the other half to me addressed as follows Here give the name of the nearest bank I have not the least fear that you will cheat me out of my half and as you see I thus place myself confidently in your hands With many thanks for your great and undeserved kindness I remain your obliged and obedient servant et cetera et cetera My readers will observe that this mode of replying affords full swing to the expansive charities of Boult and his brethren and is a sure method of saving the expenditure of ten dollars although Boult is to get that amount back when the prize is drawn I charge nothing for these suggestions but will not be so discourteous as to refuse a moderate percentage on all amounts received in pursuance of them from Brother Boult company Here is the second special lot of letters I spoke of I lay them out on my desk as before There are six letters signed respectively by Kimball Goodrich Darlington Kenneth Harper and Herbert Now notice first the form and next the substance As to form they are all written not lithographed they are on paper of the same make and size and out of the same lot as you observe by the manufacturer s stamp a representation of the Capitol in the upper corner They are in the same hand an easy legible business hand though three of them are written with a backward slope Those who sent them have not sent me the envelopes with them except in one case so that I cannot tell where they were mailed Neither is any one of them dated inside at any town or post office But by a wonderful coincidence every one of them is dated at No seventeen Merchants Exchange A busy mart that No seventeen must be And it is a still more curious coincidence that every one of these six industrious chaps has been unable to find a sufficiently central location for transacting his business Every letter you see contains a printed slip advising of a removal as follows REMOVAL Desiring a more central location for transacting my business I have removed my office to No seventeen Merchants Exchange Where One says to West Troy New York another to Patterson New Jersey another to Bronxville New York another to Salem New York and so on It is a new thing to find how central all those places are Undeveloped metropolises seem to exist in every corner Well the slip ends with a notice that in future letters must be directed to the new place Next as to substance The six letters all tell the same story They are each the second letter the first one having been sent to the same person and having contained a lottery ticket as a gift of love or free charity This second letter is the one which is expected to fetch It says in substance Your ticket has drawn a prize of two hundred dollars the letters all name the same amount but you didn t pay for it and therefore are not entitled to it Now send me ten dollars and I will cheat the lottery man by altering the post mark of your letter so that the money shall seem to have been sent before the lottery was drawn This forgery will enable me to get the two hundred dollars which I will send you How cunning that is It is exactly calculated to hit the notions of a vulgar ignorant lazy greedy and unprincipled bumpkin Such a fellow would see just far enough into the millstone to be tickled at the idea of cheating those lottery fellows And the knave ends his letter with one more touch most delicately adapted to make Master Bumpkin feel certain that his cash is coming He says Be sure to show your prize to all your friends so as to make them buy tickets at my office Moreover these letters inclose each a report of the seventeenth monthly drawing of the Cosmopolitan Art Union Association You may observe that one of these seventeenth drawings took place November seven eighteen sixty four and another December five eighteen sixty four so that seventeenthly came twice What is a far more remarkable coincidence is this that in each of these reports is a list of a hundred and thirty or forty numbers that drew prizes and it is exactly the same list each time and the same prize to each number There is a third coincidence that one of these two drawings is said to have been at London New York and the other at London New Jersey And lastly there is a fourth coincidence viz that neither of these places exists Now what a transparent swindle this is how plain how impudent how rascally And all done entirely by the use of the Post Office privileges of the United States Try to catch this fellow You can find where he mailed his circular but he probably stopped there over night to do so and nobody knew it In each circular he wrote to his dupes to address him at that new more central location that he struggles after so hard and how is the pursuer to find it Would anybody naturally go and watch the Post Office at Bronxville New York for instance as a particularly central location for business Besides no one person is cheated out of enough to make him follow up the affair and probably nobody who sends the cash wants to say much about it afterward He wants to wait and show the prize These dirty sharking traps will always be set and will always catch silly people as long as there are any to catch The only means of stopping such trickery is to diffuse the conviction that the best way to get a living is to go to work like a man and earn it honestly CHAPTER XXII ANOTHER LOTTERY HUMBUG TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY RECIPES VILE BOOKS ADVANTAGE CARDS A PACKAGE FOR YOU PLEASE SEND THE MONEY PEDDLING IN WESTERN NEW YORK 
3318-185499-0001	train-other-500	The readiness with which people will send off their money to a swindler is perfectly astounding It does really seem as if an independent fortune could be made simply by putting forth circulars and advertisements
3318-185499-0002	train-other-500	requesting the receiver to send five dollars to the advertiser and saying that it will be all right I have already given an account of the way in which lottery dealers operate From among the same pile of documents which I used then
3318-185499-0003	train-other-500	I have selected a few others as instances in part of a class of humbugs sometimes of a kind even far more noxious
none	none	 and which show that their devisers and patrons are not only sharpers or fools 
3318-185499-0004	train-other-500	but often also very cold blooded villains or very nasty ones Some of them are managed by printed circulars and written letters such as those before me some of them by newspaper advertisements Some are only to cheat you out of money
3318-185499-0005	train-other-500	and others offer in return for money some base gratification But whatever means are used and whatever purpose is sought they are all alike in one thing they depend entirely on the monstrous number of simpletons who will send money to people they know nothing about
3318-185499-0006	train-other-500	Of the nasty ones I can give no details Vile books pictures et cetera are from time to time advertised sold and forwarded by circular and through the mails and for large prices
3318-185499-0007	train-other-500	There have been some cases where a funny sort of swindle has been effected by these peddlers of pruriency by selling some dirty minded dupe a cheap good book at the extravagant price of a dear bad one
3318-185499-0008	train-other-500	More than one foolish youth has received instead of the vile thing that he sent five dollars for a nice little New Testament It is obvious that no very loud complaints are likely to be made about such cheating as that
none	none	 It is perhaps 
3318-185499-0009	train-other-500	one of the safest swindles ever contrived The first document which I take from my pile is the announcement of a fellow who operates lottery wise His scheme appeals at once to benevolence and to greediness He says
none	none	 The profits of the distribution are to be given to the Sanitary Commission and secondly Every ticket brings a prize of at least its full value and some of them five thousand dollars If therefore you won t buy tickets for filthy lucre s sake 
3318-185499-0010	train-other-500	buy for the sake of our soldiers But somebody says how can you afford this arrangement which is a direct loss of the whole cost of working your lottery and moreover of the whole value of all prizes costing more than a ticket
none	none	 Oh replies our benevolent friend 
3318-185499-0011	train-other-500	a number of manufacturers in New England have asked me to do this and the prizes are given by them as friends of the soldier
none	none	 One observation will sufficiently show what an impudent mess of lies this story is 
3318-185499-0012	train-other-500	namely If the manufacturers of New England wanted to give money to the Sanitary Commission they would give money if goods they would give goods They certainly would not put their gifts through the additional roundabout useless nonsense of a lottery
3318-185499-0013	train-other-500	which is to turn over only the same amount of funds to the Commission The next document is a circular sent from a Western town by a fellow who claims also to be a master of arts doctor of medicines and doctor of laws
3318-185499-0014	train-other-500	but whose handwriting and language are those of a stable boy This chap sends round a list of two hundred and fifty recipes at various prices from twenty five cents to a dollar each
3318-185499-0015	train-other-500	Send him the money for any you wish and he promises to return you the directions for making the stuff You are then to go about and peddle it and swiftly become independently rich You can begin with a dollar he says in two days make fifty dollars
none	none	 and then sweep on in a grand career of affluence making from seventy five dollars to two hundred dollars a day 
3318-185499-0016	train-other-500	if you are industrious What is petroleum to this It is a mercy that we don t all turn to and peddle to each other we should all get too rich to speak The fellow out of pure kindness and desire for your good
3318-185499-0017	train-other-500	recommends you to buy all his recipes as then you will be sure to sell something to everybody Most of these recipes are for sufficiently harmless purposes shaving soap cement inks
3318-185499-0018	train-other-500	five gallons of good ink for fifteen cents tooth powders et cetera
none	none	 Some of them are arrant nonsense 
3318-185499-0019	train-other-500	such as tea better than the Chinese

3318-185499-0025	train-other-500	for he has recipes for curing baldness and removing wrinkles And last but not least quietly inserted among all these fooleries and harmless humbugs are two or three recipes which promise the safe gratification of the basest vices
3318-185499-0026	train-other-500	Those are what he really hoped to get money for I have carefully refrained from giving any names or information which would enable anybody to address any of these folks I do not propose to cooperate with them if I know it
none	none	 The next is a circular only to be very briefly alluded to 
3318-185499-0027	train-other-500	it promises to furnish on receipt of the price and by mail or express with perfect safety so as to defy detection any of twenty two wholly infamous books and various other cards and commodities
3318-185499-0028	train-other-500	well suited to the public of Sodom and Gomorrah et cetera The most honest and decent things advertised in this unclean list are advantage cards which enable the player to swindle his adversary by reading off his hand by the backs of the cards
3318-185499-0029	train-other-500	The next paper I can copy verbatim except some names et cetera is a letter as follows Dear Sir There is a Package in My care for a missus preston New Griswold

3318-185499-0031	train-other-500	It is some little comfort to know that this gentleman who is so much opposed to the present prevailing methods of spelling lost the three cents which he invested in seeking fratage
3318-185499-0032	train-other-500	But a good many sensible people have carelessly sent away the small amounts demanded by letters like the above and have wondered why their prepaid parcels never came
none	none	 Next is an account by a half amused and half indignant eye witness of what happened in a well known town in Western New York on Friday January six eighteen sixty five 
3318-185499-0034	train-other-500	A personage described as dressed in Yankee style drove into the principal street of the place with a horse and buggy and began to sell what is called in some parts of New England Attleboro
none	none	 that is imitation jewelry

none	none	 then sold some half dollar bills for twenty five cents each 
3318-185499-0037	train-other-500	then flung out among the crowd what a fisherman would call ground bait in the shape of a handful of currency Everybody scrambled for the money This liberal trader now drove slowly a little way along and the crowd pressed after him He now began without any further promises
none	none	 to sell a lot of bogus lockets at five dollars each 
3318-185499-0038	train-other-500	and in a few minutes had disposed of about forty Having therefore about two hundred dollars in his pocket and trade slackening he coolly observes with a terseness and clearness of oratory that would not discredit General Sherman

none	none	 That same cunning chap has actually made a small fortune in this way 
3318-185499-0040	train-other-500	He really is licensed as a peddler and though arrested more than once has consequently not been found legally punishable I will specify only one more of my collection of yet another kind
3318-185499-0041	train-other-500	This is a printed circular appealing to a class of fools if possible even shallower sillier and more credulous than any I have named yet It is headed The Gypsies Seven Secret Charms These charms consist of a kind of hellbroth or decoction

SUBTERRANEAN CANAL ON THE ISTHMUS Some twelve years ago or so in the early days of Californian immigration a curious little business humbug came off about six miles from Monterey A United States officer about the year eighteen fifty was on his way into the interior on a surveying expedition with a party of men a portable forge a load of coal and sundry other articles At the place in question six miles inland the Lieutenant s coal wagon stalled in a tule swamp With true military decision the greater part of the coal was thrown out to extricate the team and not picked up again The expedition went on and so did time and the latter in his progress had some years afterward dried up the tule swamp Some enterprising prospectors with eyes wide open to the nature of things now espied one fine morning the lumps of coal sticking their black noses up out of the mud It was a clear case there was a coal mine there The happy discoverers rushed into town A company was at once organized under the mining laws of the state of California The corporators at first kept the whole matter totally secret except from a few particular friends who were as a very great favor allowed to buy stock for cash A compromise was made with the owner of the land largely to his advantage When things had thus been set properly at work specimens of coal were publicly exhibited at Monterey There was a gigantic excitement shares went up almost out of sight Twelve hundred dollars in coin for one share par one hundred dollars was laughed at About this time a quiet honest Dutchman of the vicinity passing along by the mine one evening with his cart innocently and unconsciously picked up the whole at one single load and carried it home Prompt was the discovery of the sell by the stockholders and voluble and intense it is said their profane expressions of dissatisfaction But the original discoverers of the mine vigorously protested that they were sold themselves and that it was only a case of common misfortune It is however reported that a number of persons in Monterey after the explosion of the speculation remembered all about the coal wagon part of the business which they said the excitement of the company had put entirely out of their heads An equally unfounded but not quite so barefaced humbug came off a good many years ago in the good old city of Hartford in Connecticut according to the account given me by an old gentleman now deceased who was one of the parties interested This was a coal mine in the State House yard It sounds like talking about getting sunbeams out of cucumbers but something of the sort certainly took place Coal is found among rocks of certain kinds and not elsewhere Among strata of granite or basalt for instance nobody expects to find coal But along with a certain kind of sandstone it may reasonably be expected Now the Hartford wiseacres found that tremendously far down under their city there was a sort of sandstone and they were sure that it was the sort So they gathered together some money there is a vast deal of that in Hartford coal or no coal organized a company employed a Mining Superintendent set up a boring apparatus and down went their hole into the ground an orifice some four or six inches across Through the surface stratum of earth it went and bang it came against the sandstone They pounded away with good courage and got some fifties or hundreds of feet further Indefinable sensations were aroused in their minds at one time by the coming up among the products of boring of some chips of wood Now wood shortly coal they thought They might I imagine have brought up some pieces of boiled potato or even of fresh shad provided it had fallen down first They dug on until they got tired and then they stopped If they had gone down ten thousand feet they would have found no coal Coal is found in the new red sandstone but theirs was the old red sandstone which is a very fine old stone itself but in which no coal was ever found except what might have been put there on purpose or possibly some faint indications The hole they made however as my informant gravely observed was left sticking in the ground and if he is right is to this day a sort of appendix or tail to the well north west corner of the State House Square So I suppose any one who chooses can go and poke down there after it and satisfy himself about the accuracy of this account Such an inquirer ought to find satisfaction for truth lies in the bottom of a well says the proverb Yet some ill natured skeptics have construed this to mean that all will tell lies sometimes for as they accent it even Truth lies at the bottom of a well Still a different sort of business humbug again was a wonderful story which went the rounds about fifteen years ago and which was cooked up to help some one or other of the various enterprises for new routes by Central America to California This story started I believe in the New Orleans Courier It was that a French Doctor of Vera Paz in Guatemala while making a canal from his estate to the sea discovered away up at the very furthest extremity of the Gulf of Honduras a vast ancient canal two hundred and forty feet wide seventy feet deep and walled in on both sides with gigantic masses of rough cut stone The Doctor at once gave up his own trifling modern excavation and plunged into an explanation of this vast ancient one as zealously as if he were probing after some uncertain bullet in a poor fellow s leg The monstrous canal carried him in a straight line up the country to the south westward Some twenty miles or so inland it plunged under a volcano But see what a French doctor is made of Cutting down the great old trees that obstructed the entrance and procuring a canoe with a crew of Indians in he went The canal became a prodigious tunnel of the same width and depth of water and vaulted three hundred and thirty five feet high in the living rock Nothing is said about the bowels of the volcano so that we must conclude either that such affairs are not planted so deep as is supposed or that the fire pot of the concern was shoved one side or bridged over by the canallers or that the Frenchman had some remarkably good style of Fire Annihilator or else that there is some mistake Eighteen hours of incessant travel brought our intrepid M D safe through to the Pacific Ocean during which time if the maps of that country are of any authority he passed under quite a number of mountains and rivers The trip was not dark at all as shafts were sunk every little way which lighted up the interior quite well and then the volcano gave or ought to have given some light inside Indeed if the doctor had only thought of it I presume he would have noticed double rows of street gas lamps on each side of the canal The exclusive right to use this excellent transit route has not to my knowledge been secured to anybody yet It will be observed that ships as large as the Great Eastern could easily pass each other in this canal which renders it a sure thing for any other vessel unless that shrewd and grasping fellow the Emperor Louis Napoleon has got hold of this canal and is keeping it dark for some still darker purposes of his own as for instance to run his puppet Maximilian into for refuge when he is run out of Mexico it is therefore still in the market And my publication of the facts effectually disposes of the Emperor s plan of secrecy of course IV MONEY MANIAS CHAPTER XXIV THE PETROLEUM HUMBUG THE NEW YORK AND RANGOON PETROLEUM COMPANY Every sham as has often been said proves some reality Petroleum exists no doubt and is an important addition to our national wealth But the Petroleum humbug or mania or superstition or whatever you choose to call it is a humbug just as truly and a big one whether we use the word in its milder or its bitterer sense There are more than six hundred petroleum companies The capital they call for is certainly not less than five hundred million dollars The money invested in the notorious South Sea Bubble was less than two fifths as much only about one hundred ninety million dollars Now this petroleum business very much of it is just as thorough a gambling business as any faro bank ever set up in Broadway or any other stock speculation ever conjured up in Wall Street as much so for instance as the well known Parker Vein coal company I shall here tell exactly how those well known and enterprising financiers Messrs Peter Rolleum and Diddle Digwell proceeded in organizing the New York and Rangoon Petroleum Company of which all my readers have seen the advertisements everywhere and of which the former is the Vice President and managing officer and the latter Secretary In June eighteen sixty four neither of these worthy gentleman was worth a cent Rolleum shinned up and down in some commission agency or other and Digwell had a small salary as clerk in some insurance or money concern They barely earned a living Now Rolleum says he is worth two hundred thousand dollars and mister Secretary Digwell besides about ten thousand dollars worth of stock in the New York and Rangoon has his comfortable salary and his highly respectable posish to use a little bit of business slang mister Rolleum was the originator of the scheme and let Digwell into it and together they went to work They had a few hundred dollars in cash no particular credit an entirely unlimited fund of lies a good deal of industry plausibility talk and cheek considerable acquaintance with business and an instinctive appreciation of some of the more selfish motives commonly influential among men First of all Rolleum made a trip into the oil country Here while picking up some of his ordinary agency business he looked around among the wells and oil lands talking and examining and inquiring of everybody about everything with a busy solemn face and the air of one who does not wish it to be supposed that he has important interests in his care Then he talked with some men at we will say Titusville and thereabouts told all about his valuable business connections in New York City and after getting a little acquainted he laid before each of half a dozen or so of them this proposition You can have a good many shares of a first class new oil company about to be formed just for permitting your name to be used in its interest and for being a trustee A thousand shares apiece he said to be valued at five dollars each the par value however being ten dollars Five thousand dollars each man and to be made ten thousand as soon as the proposed puffing should enable them to sell out After a little hesitation a sufficient number consented There was nothing to pay something handsome to get and all they were asked for it was to let a man talk about them What if he did lie That was his business This fixed four out of the nine intended trustees Rolleum also obtained memoranda or printed circulars showing the amounts for which a number of oil land owners would sell their holes in the ground or the room for making others and describing the premises He now flew back to New York and went to sundry persons of some means and some position but of no great nobility and thus he said Here are these wealthy and distinguished oil men right there on the ground who are going to be trustees of my new company You serve too won t you One thousand shares for your trouble five thousand dollars No money to pay I will see to all that Here are the lands we can buy and he showed his lists The bribe and the names of those already bribed influenced them and this secured three more trustees Two more were needed namely the President and Vice President Rolleum himself was to be the latter his next move was to secure the former This the most critical part of the scheme was cunningly delayed until this time Rolleum went to the Honorable A Bee a gentleman of a good deal of ability pretty widely known not very rich believed perhaps for that reason to be honest no longer young and of a reverend yet agreeable presence Him the plausible Rolleum told all about the new Company what a respectable board of trustees there was going to be and he showed the names all either experienced and substantial men of the oil country or reputable business men of New York City And they have agreed to serve in part because they know what a very honest company this is and still more because they hope that the Honorable A Bee will become President My dear Sir urged Rolleum sweetly this legitimate business enterprise must succeed and must secure wealth reputation and influence to all connected with it We know that you are above pecuniary considerations and that you do not need our influence or anybody s We need yours And you need not do any work I will do that We only need your name And merely as a matter of form because the officers are expected to be interested in their own company I have set apart two thousand shares being at half par or five dollars a share ten thousand dollars of stock to stand in your name See how respectable all these Trustees are And he showed the list and preached upon the items of it This man is worth so many millions that man is such an influential editor Could I have obtained such names if this were not a perfectly square thing Ten thousand dollars will go some ways towards squaring almost anything with many people even if it is a mere matter of form and so the old gentleman consented This fixed the whole official slate Now to set up the machine In a few days of sharp running and talking Rolleum and Digwell accomplished this as follows First they hired and furnished handsomely paying cash whenever they couldn t help it a couple of pleasant first floor rooms close to Wall Street No dingy desk room up in some dark corner or attic for them Respectability is the thing for Rolleum Second they hired a lawyer to draft the proper papers and had the New York and Rangoon Petroleum Company Duly incorporated under the mining and statute laws of the State of New York with charter by laws seal officers names and everything fine new grand magnificent impressive formal respectable and business like Third they now had every requisite of a powerful enterprising and highly successful corporation except the small trifles of money land and oil But what are these to such geniuses as Rolleum and Digwell Singular if having invented and set the trap they could not catch the birds They bought about three pints of oil for one dollar and that settled one part of the question They bought it ready sorted and vialled and labelled some crude and green some yellowish some limpid as water half a dozen or so of different specimens These in their tall vials of most respectable appearance they placed casually on the mantel piece of the outer office They were specimens of the oils which the company s wells are confidently expected to yield when they get em Last of all land and money Subscriptions to capital stock are to furnish money money will buy land And saying we ve got land will procure subscriptions It s not much of a lie after all said Rolleum confidentially to brother Digwell When we ve said we ve got it for awhile we shall get it It s not a lie at all It s only discounting the truth at sixty days So he and Digwell went to work and made a splendid prospectus and advertisement the latter an abridged edition of the former This prospectus was a great triumph of business lying mixed with plums and spices of truth and all set forth with taking display lines It began with a stately row of names New York and Rangoon Petroleum Company Honorable Abraham Bee President Peter Rolleum esquire Vice President Diddle Digwell esquire Secretary and so on With cool impudence it then gave a list headed Lands and Property not saying of the Company for fear of a prosecution for swindling But the list below began with the words the oil lands to be conveyed to the Company are as follows that s exactly it quoth Rolleum no lie there at any rate They are to to be conveyed to us if we choose just as soon as we can pay for them And then the list went on from No one to No forty three giving in a row all those memoranda which Rolleum had obtained in Venango County and the region round about of the descriptions of the real estate which the landsharks up there would be glad to sell for what they asked for it The Prospectus said the capital of the company was one million dollars in one hundred thousand shares at ten dollars each But in order to obtain a WORKING CAPITAL twenty thousand shares are offered for a limited period at five dollars each not subject to further assessment And it added though with more phrases something to the following effect Hurry Pay quick Or you will lose your chance In conclusion the whole was wound up with many wise and moral observations about legitimate business interests of stockholders heavy capitalists economical management and other such things and it bestowed some rather fat compliments upon the honorable Abraham Bee and the Trustees Having concocted this choice morsel of bait they set it in the great stream of newspapers there to catch fish In plain terms with some cash and some credit for their means would not even reach to pay in advance the whole of their first advertising bill they managed to have their advertisement published during several weeks in a carefully chosen group of about thirty of the principal newspapers of the United States The whole web was now woven and Rolleum and Digwell like two hungry spiders squatted in their den every nerve thrilling to feel the first buzz of the first fly It was natural that the scamps should feel a good deal excited it was life or death with them If a confiding public in answer to their impassioned appeal should generously remit they were made men for life If not instead of being rich and respected gentlemen they were ridiculous detected swindlers Well they succeeded So truthful is our Great American Nation so confiding so sure of the truth of what is said in print even if only in the advertising columns of a newspaper so certain of the good faith of people who have their names printed in large capitals and with a handle at one end that actually these fellows had a hundred thousand dollars in bank within ten weeks before they owned one foot of land or one inch of well or one drop of oil except those three pints in the vials on the office shelf And remember this is no imaginary case I am giving point by point the exact transactions of a real Petroleum Company Everything I have told was done only if possible with a more false and baseless impudence than I have described And scores and scores of other Petroleum Companies have been organized in ways exactly as unprincipled Some of them may perhaps have proceeded as real business concerns Some have stopped and disappeared as soon as the managers could get a handsome sum of money into their pockets for stock What the result will be in the present case I don t know The New York and Rangoon Petroleum Company when I last knew about it still lived They had or said they had bought some land I have not heard of their receiving any oil raised from their own wells They have sent off a monstrous quantity of circulars prospectuses and advertisements They caused a portrait and biography of the Honorable A Bee to be printed in a very respectable periodical and paid five hundred dollars for it They had themselves systematically puffed up to the seventh heaven in a long series of articles in another periodical and paid the owner of it two thousand dollars or so in stock They talk very big about a dividend But although they have received a great deal of money and paid out a great deal I do not know of their paying their stockholders any yet If they should it would not prove much For it is sometimes considered a good dodge to declare and pay a large dividend before any real profits have been earned as this is calculated to enhance the price of shares and to make them go off like hot cakes I shall not make any moral about this story It teaches its own It is a very mild statement of what was done to establish an actual specimen and far from being of the worst description of a great part of the Petroleum Company enterprises of the day It is whispered that somehow or other the trustees and officers of the New York and Rangoon do not own so much stock of their company as they did having managed to have their stock sold to subscribers as if it were company stock If this is so those gentlemen have made their reward sure and mister Peter Rolleum having the cash in hand for that very liberal allotment of stock which he gave himself for his trouble in getting up the New York and Rangoon Petroleum Company is very likely half or a quarter as rich as he says CHAPTER XXV THE TULIPOMANIA Alboni the singer had an exquisitely sweet voice but was a very big fat woman Somebody accordingly remarked that she was an elephant that had swallowed a nightingale About as incongruous is the idea of a nation of damp foggy fat full figured broad sterned gin drinking tobacco smoking Dutchmen in Holland going crazy over a flower But they did so for three or four years together Their craze is known in history as the Tulipomania because it was a mania about tulips Just a word about the Dutchmen first These stout old fellows were not only hardy navigators keen discoverers ingenious engineers laborious workmen able financiers shrewd and rich merchants enthusiastic patriots and tremendous fighters but they were eminently distinguished as they still are to a considerable extent by a love of elegant literature poetry painting music and other fine arts including horticulture It was a Fleming that invented painting in oils Before him white of egg was used or gum water or some such imperfect material for spreading the color Erasmus one of the most learned ready minded acute graceful and witty scholars that ever lived was a Dutchman All Holland and Flanders in days when they were richer and stronger compared with the rest of the world than they are now were full of singing societies and musical societies and poetry making societies The universities of Leyden and Utrecht and Louvain are of highly an ancient European fame And as for flowers and bulbs in particular Holland is a principal home and market of them now more than two hundred years after the time I am going to tell of Tulips grow wild in Southern Russia the Crimea and Asia Minor as potatoes do in Peru The first tulip in Christian Europe was raised in Augsburg in the garden of a flower loving lawyer one Counsellor Herwart in the year fifteen fifty nine thirteen years after Luther died This tulip bulb was sent to Herwart from Constantinople For about eighty years after this the flower continually increased in repute and became more and more known and cultivated until the fantastic eagerness of the demand for fine ones and the great prices that they brought resulted in a real mania like that about the morus multicaulis or the petroleum mania of to day but much more intense It began in the year sixteen thirty five and went out with an explosion in the year eighteen thirty seven This tulip business is I believe the only speculative excitement in history whose subject matter did not even claim to have any real value Petroleum is worth some shillings a gallon for actual use for many purposes Stocks always claim to represent some real trade or business The morus multicaulis was to be as permanent a source of wealth as corn and was expected to produce the well known mercantile substance of silk But nobody ever pretended that tulips could be eaten or manufactured or consumed in any way of practical usefulness They have not one single quality of the kind termed useful They have nothing desirable except the beauty of a peculiarly short lived blossom You can do absolutely nothing with them except to look at them A speculation in them is exactly as reasonable as one in butterflies would be In the course of about one year sixteen thirty four five the tulip frenzy after having increased for fifteen or twenty years with considerable speed came to a climax and poisoned the whole Dutch nation Prices had at the end of this short period risen from high to extravagant and from extravagant to insane High and low counts burgomasters merchants shop keepers servants shoe blacks all were buying and selling tulips like mad In order to make the commodity of the day accessible to all a new weight was invented called a perit so small that there were about eight thousand of them in one pound avoirdupois and a single tulip root weighing from half an ounce to an ounce would contain from two hundred to four hundred of these perits Thus anybody unable to buy a whole tulip could buy a perit or two and have what the lawyers call an undivided interest in a root This way of owning shows how utterly unreal was the pretended value For imagine a small owner attempting to take his own perits and put them in his pocket He would make a little hole in the tulip root would probably kill it and would certainly obtain a little bit of utterly worthless pulp for himself and no value at all There was a whole code of business regulations made to meet the peculiar needs of the tulip business besides and in every town were to be found tulip notaries to conduct the legal part of the business take acknowledgments of deeds note protests c To say that the tulips were worth their weight in gold would be a very small story It would not be a very great exaggeration to say that they were worth their size in diamonds The most valuable species of all was named Semper Augustus and a bulb of it which weighed two hundred perits or less than half an ounce avoirdupois was thought cheap at five thousand five hundred florins A florin may be called about forty cents so that the little brown root was worth twenty two hundred dollars or two hundred twenty gold eagles which would weigh by a rough estimate eight pounds four ounces or one hundred thirty two ounces avoirdupois Thus this half ounce Semper Augustus was worth I mean he would bring two hundred and sixty four times his weight in gold There were many cases where people invested whole fortunes equal to forty thousand dollars or fifty thousand dollars in collections of forty or fifty tulip roots Once there happened to be only two Semper Augustuses in all Holland one in Haarlem and one in Amsterdam The Haarlem one was sold for twelve acres of building lots and the Amsterdam one for a sum equal to one hundred eighty four thousand dollars together with a new carriage span of grey horses and double harness complete Here is the list of merchandise and estimated prices given for one root of the Viceroy tulip It is interesting as showing what real merchandise was worth in those days by a cash standard aside from its exhibition of tremendous speculative bedlamism one hundred sixty bushels wheat seventeen thousand nine hundred twenty dollars three hundred twenty bushels rye twenty two thousand three hundred twenty Four fat oxen nineteen thousand two hundred Eight fat hogs nine thousand six hundred Twelve fat sheep four thousand eight hundred Two hogsheads wine twenty eight hundred Four tuns beer twelve eighty Two tuns butter seven thousand six hundred eighty one thousand lbs cheese four thousand eight hundred A bed all complete four thousand One suit clothes three thousand two hundred A silver drinking cup twenty four hundred Total exactly one hundred thousand dollars In sixteen thirty six regular tulip exchanges were established in the nine Dutch towns where the largest tulip business was done and while the gambling was at its intensest the matter was managed exactly as stock gambling is managed in Wall street to day You went out into the street without owning a tulip or a perit of a tulip in the world and met another fellow with just as many tulips as yourself You talk and banter with him and finally we will suppose you sell short ten Semper Augustuses seller three for two thousand dollars each in all twenty thousand dollars This means in ordinary English that without having any tulips i e short you promise to deliver the ten roots as above in three days from date Now when the three days are up if Semper Augustuses are worth in the market only fifteen hundred dollars you could if this were a real transaction buy ten of them for fifteen thousand dollars and deliver them to the other gambler for twenty thousand dollars thus winning from him the difference of five thousand dollars But if the roots have risen and are worth twenty five hundred dollars each then if the transactions were real you would have to pay twenty five thousand dollars for the ten roots and could only get twenty thousand dollars from the other gambler and he turning round and selling them at the market price would win from you this difference of five thousand dollars But in fact the transaction was not real it was a stock gambling one neither party owned tulips or meant to or expected the other to and the whole was a pure game of chance or skill to see which should win and which should lose that five thousand dollars at the end of three days When the time came the affair was settled still without any tulips by the loser paying the difference to the winner exactly as one loses what the other wins at a game of poker or faro Of course if you can set afloat a smart lie after making your bargain such as will send prices up or down as your profit requires you make money by it just as stock gamblers do every day in New York London Paris and other Christian commercial cities While this monstrous Dutch gambling fury lasted money was plenty everybody felt rich and Holland was in a whiz of windy delight After about three years of fool s paradise people began to reflect that the shuttlecock could not be knocked about in the air forever and that when it came down somebody would be hurt So first one and then another began quietly to sell out and quit the game without buying in again This cautious infection quickly spread like a pestilence as it always does in such cases and became a perfect panic or fright All at once as it were rich people all over Holland found themselves with nothing in the world except a pocket full or a garden bed full of flower roots that nobody would buy and that were not good to eat and would not have made more than one tureen of soup if they were Of course this state of things caused innumerable bankruptcies quarrels and refusals to complete bargains everywhere The government and the courts were appealed to but with Dutch good sense they refused to enforce gambling transactions and though the cure was very severe because very sudden they preferred to let the bottom drop out of the whole affair at once So it did Almost everybody was either ruined or impoverished The very few who had kept any or all of their gains by selling out in season remained so far rich And the vast actual business interests of Holland received a damaging check from which it took many years to recover There were some curious incidents in the course of the tulipomania They have been told before but they are worth telling again as the poet says To point the moral or adorn the tale A sailor brought to a rich Dutch merchant news of the safe arrival of a very valuable cargo from the Levant The old hunks rewarded the mariner for his good tidings with one red herring for breakfast Now Ben Bolt if that was his name perhaps as he was a Dutchman it was something like Benje Boltje was very fond of onions and spying one on the counter as he went out of the store he slipped it into his pocket and strolling back to the wharf sat down to an odoriferous breakfast of onions and herring He munched away without finding anything unusual in the flavor until just as he was through down came mister Merchant tearing along like a madman at the head of an excited procession of clerks and flying upon the luckless son of Neptune demanded what he had carried off besides his herring An onion that I found on the counter Where is it Give it back instantly Just ate it up with my herring mynheer Wretched merchant In a fury of useless grief he apprised the sailor that his sacrilegious back teeth had demolished a Semper Augustus valuable enough explained the unhappy old fellow to have feasted the Prince of Orange and the Stadtholder s whole court Thieves he cried out Seize the rascal So they did seize him and he was actually tried condemned and imprisoned for some months all of which however did not bring back the tulip root It is a question after all in my mind whether that sailor was really as green as he pretended and whether he did not know very well what he was taking It would have been just like a reckless seaman s trick to eat up the old miser s twelve hundred dollar root to teach him not to give such stingy gifts next time An English traveller very fond of botany was one day in the conservatory of a rich Dutchman when he saw a strange bulb lying on a shelf With that extreme coolness and selfishness which too many travellers have exercised what does he do but take out his penknife and carefully dissect it peeling off the outer coats and quartering the innermost part making all the time a great many wise observations on the phenomena of the strange new root In came the Dutchman all at once and seeing what was going on he asked the Englishman with rage in his eyes but with a low bow and that sort of restrained formal civility which sometimes covers the most furious anger if he knew what he was about Peeling a very curious onion answered mister Traveller as calmly as if one had a perfect right to destroy other people s property to gratify his own curiosity One hundred thousand devils burst out the Dutchman expressing the extent of his anger by the number of evil spirits he invoked It is an Admiral van der Eyck Indeed remarked the scientific traveller thank you Are there a good many of these admirals in your country and he drew forth his note book to write down the little fact Death and the devil swore the enraged Dutchman again come before the Syndic and you shall find out all about it So he collared the astounded onion peeler and despite all he could say dragged him straightway before the magistrate where his scientific zeal suffered a dreadful quencher in the shape of an affidavit that the onion was worth four thousand florins about sixteen hundred dollars and in the immediate judgment of the Court which considered that the prisoner be forthwith clapt into jail until he should give security for the amount He had to do so accordingly and doubtless all his life retained a distaste for Dutchmen and Dutch onions These stories about such monstrous valuations of flower roots recall to my mind another anecdote which I shall tell not because it has anything to do with tulips but because it is about a Dutchman and shows in striking contrast an equally low valuation of human life It is this Once in time of peace an English and a Dutch Admiral met at sea each in his flag ship and for some reason or other exchanged complimentary salutes By accident one of the Englishman s guns was shotted and misdirected and killed one of the Dutch crew On hearing the fact the Englishman at once manned a boat and went to apologize to inquire about the poor fellow s family and to send them some money provide for the funeral et cetera et cetera as a kind hearted man would naturally do But the Dutch commander on meeting him at the quarter deck and learning his errand at once put all his kindly intentions completely one side saying in imperfect English It sh no matter it sh no matter dere s blaanty more Tutchmen in Holland CHAPTER XXVI JOHN BULL S GREAT MONEY HUMBUG THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE IN seventeen twenty The South Sea Bubble is one of the most startling lessons which history gives us of the ease with which the most monstrous and absurd and wicked humbugs can be crammed down the throat of poor human nature It ought also to be a useful warning of the folly of mere speculation as compared with real business undertakings The history of the South Sea Bubble has been told before but it is too prominent a case to be entirely passed over It occupied a period of about eight months from February one seventeen twenty to the end of the following September It was an unreasonable expansion of the value of the stock of the South Sea Company This Company was formed in seventeen eleven its stock was at first about thirty million dollars subscribed by the public and handed over by the corporators to Government to meet certain troublesome public debts In return Government guaranteed the stockholders a dividend of six per cent and gave the Company sundry permanent important duties and a monopoly of all trade to the South Pacific or South Sea This matter went on with fair success as a money enterprise until the birth of the Bubble which was as follows In the end of January seventeen twenty probably in consequence of catching infection from Law s Mississippi Scheme in France the South Sea Company and the Bank of England made competing propositions to the English Government to repeat the original South Sea Company financiering plan on a larger scale The proposition of the Company which was accepted by Government was to assume as before the whole public debt now amounting to over one hundred and fifty millions of dollars and to be guaranteed at first a five per cent dividend and afterward a four per cent one to the stockholders by Government For this privilege the Company agreed to pay outright a bonus of more than seventeen million dollars This plan is said to have been originated and principally carried through by Sir John Blunt one of the Company s directors Parliament adopted it after two months discussion the Bubble having however been swelling monstrously all the time It must be remembered that the wonderful profits expected from the Company were to come from their monopoly of the South Sea trade Tremendous stories were told by Blunt and his friends who can hardly have believed more than one half of their own talk about a free trade with all the Spanish Pacific colonies the importation of silver and gold from Peru and Mexico in return for dry goods et cetera et cetera all which fine things were going to produce two or three times the amount of the Company s stock every year When the bill authorizing the arrangement passed South Sea stock had already reached a price of four hundred per cent The bill was stoutly opposed in Parliament by mister afterwards Sir Robert Walpole and a few others but in vain Under the operation of the beautiful stories of the speculative Blunt and his friends South Sea stock after a short lull in April began to rise again and the bubble swelled and swelled to a size so monstrous and with colors so gay that it filled the whole horizon of poor foolish John Bull perfectly turned his bull headed brain and made him for the time absolutely crazy The directors opened books on April twelfth for Lfive million new stock charging however Lthree hundred for each share of Lone hundred or three hundred per cent to begin with Double the amount was subscribed in a few days that is John Bull subscribed thirty million dollars for ten millions of stock where only five millions were to be had In a few days more these subscribers were selling at double what they paid April twenty first a ten per cent dividend was voted for midsummer In a day or two another five million subscription was opened at four hundred per cent to begin with The whole and half as much more was taken in a few hours In the end of May South Sea stock was worth five hundred to one On the twenty eighth it was five hundred and fifty In four days more for some reason or other it jumped up to eight hundred and ninety The speculating Blunt kept all this time blowing and blowing at his bubble All summer he and his friends blew and blew and all summer the bubble swelled and floated and shone and high and low men and women lords and ladies clergymen princesses and duchesses merchants gamblers tradesmen dressmakers footmen bought and sold In the beginning of August South Sea stock stood at one thousand per cent It was really worth about twenty five per cent The crowding in Exchange Alley the Wall street of the day was tremendous So noisy and unmanageable and excited was this mob of greedy fools that the very same stock was sometimes selling ten per cent higher at one end of the Alley than at the other The growth of this monstrous noxious bubble hatched out a multitude of young cockatrices Not only was the stock of the India Company the Bank of England and other sound concerns much increased in price by sympathy with this fury of speculation but a great number of utterly ridiculous schemes and barefaced swindles were advertised and successfully imposed on the public Any piece of paper purporting to be stock could be sold for money Not the least thought of investigating the solvency of advertisers seems to have occurred to anybody Nor was any rank free from the poison Almost a hundred projects were before the public at once some of them incredibly brazen humbugs There were schemes for a wheel for perpetual motion capital five million dollars for trading in hair for wigs in those days a big thing for furnishing funerals to any part of Britain for improving the art of making soap for importing walnut trees from Virginia capital ten million dollars for insuring against losses by servants capital fifteen million dollars for making quicksilver malleable Puckle s Machine Company for discharging cannon balls and bullets both round and square and so on One colossal genius in humbugging actually advertised in these words A company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage but nobody to know what it is The capital he called for was two million five hundred thousand dollars in shares of five hundred dollars each deposit on subscribing ten dollars per share Each subscriber was promised five hundred dollars per share per annum and full particulars were to be given in a month when the rest of the subscription was to be paid This great financier having put forth his prospectus opened his office in Cornhill next morning at nine o clock Crowds pressed upon him At three P M John Bull had paid this immense humbug ten thousand dollars being deposits on a thousand shares subscribed for That night the financier a shrewd man modestly retired to an unknown place upon the Continent and was never heard of again Another humbug almost as preposterous was that of the Globe Permits These were square pieces of playing cards with a seal on them having the picture of the Globe Tavern and with the words Sailcloth Permits What they permitted was a subscription at some future period to a sailcloth factory projected by a certain capitalist These permits sold at one time for three hundred dollars each But the more sensible members of Government soon exerted their influence against these lesser and more palpable humbugs Some accounts say that the South Sea Company itself grew jealous for it was reckoned that these side shows called for a total amount of one billion five hundred million dollars and itself took legal means against them At any rate an order in council was published peremptorily dismissing and dissolving them all During August it leaked out that Sir John Blunt and some other insiders had sold out their South Sea stock There was also some charges of unfairness in managing subscriptions After so long and so intense an excitement the time for reaction and collapse was come The price of stock began to fall in spite of all that the directors could do September two it was down to seven hundred A general meeting of the company was held to try to whitewash matters but in vain The stock fell fell fell The great humbug had received its death blow Thousands of families saw beggary staring them in the face grasping them with its iron hand The consternation was inexpressible Out of it a great popular rage began to flame up just as fires often break out among the prostrate houses of a city ruined by an earthquake Efforts were meanwhile vainly made to stay the ruin by help from the Bank of England Bankers and goldsmiths then often doing a banking business absconded daily Business corporations failed Credit was almost paralyzed In the end of September the stock fell to one hundred seventy five one hundred fifty one hundred thirty five Meanwhile violent riots were feared South Sea directors could not be seen in the streets without being insulted The King then in Hanover was imperatively sent for home and had to come So extensive was the misfortune and the wrath of the people so numerous the public meetings and petitions from all over the kingdom that Parliament found it necessary to grant the public demand and to initiate a formal inquiry into the whole enterprise This was done and the foolish swindled disappointed angry nation through this proceeding vented all the wrath it could upon the persons and estates of the managers and officers of the South Sea Company They were forbidden to leave the kingdom their property was sequestrated they were placed in custody and examined Those of them in Parliament were insulted there to their faces several of them expelled the most violent charges made against them all A secret investigating committee was set to rip up the whole affair Knight the treasurer who possessed all the dangerous secrets of the concern ran away to Calais and the Continent and so escaped The books were found to have been either destroyed secreted or mutilated and garbled Stock bribes of two hundred fifty thousand dollars one hundred fifty thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars had been paid to the Earl of Sunderland the Duchess of Kendal the King s favorite mister Craggs one of the Secretaries of State and others mister Aislabie the Chancellor of the Exchequer had accumulated four million two hundred fifty thousand dollars and more out of the business Many other noblemen gentlemen and reputable merchants were disgracefully involved The trials that were had resulted in the imprisonment expulsion or degradation of Aislabie Craggs Sir George Caswell a banker and member of the House and others Blunt a mister Stanhope and a number more of the chief criminals were stripped of their wealth amounting to from one hundred thirty five thousand dollars to one million two hundred thousand dollars each and the proceeds used for the partial relief of the ruined except amounts left to the culprits to begin the world anew Blunt the chief of all the swindlers was stripped of about nine hundred twenty five thousand dollars and allowed only five thousand dollars By this means and by the use of such actual property as the Company did possess about one third of the money lost by its means was ultimately paid to the losers It was a long time however before the tone of public credit was thoroughly restored The history of the South Sea bubble should always stand as a beacon to warn us that reckless speculation is the bane of commerce and that the only sure method of gaining a fortune and certainly of enjoying it is to diligently prosecute some legitimate calling which like the quality of mercy is twice blessed Every man s occupation should be beneficial to his fellow man as well as profitable to himself All else is vanity and folly CHAPTER XXVII BUSINESS HUMBUGS JOHN LAW THE MISSISSIPPI SCHEME JOHNNY CRAPAUD AS GREEDY AS JOHNNY BULL In the good old times people were just as eager after money as they are now and a great deal more vulgar unscrupulous and foolish in their endeavors to get it During about two hundred years after the discovery of America that continent was a constant source of great and little money humbugs The Spaniards and Portuguese and French and English all insisted upon thinking that America was chiefly made of gold perhaps believing as the man said about Colorado that the hardship of the place was that you have to dig through three or four feet of solid silver before the gold could be reached This curious delusion is shown by the fact that the early charters of lands in America so uniformly reserved to the King his proportion of all gold and silver that should be found And if gold were not to be had these lazy Europeans were equally crazy about the rich merchandise which they made sure of finding in the vast and solitary American mountains and forests In a previous letter I have shown how one of those delusions about the unbounded wealth to be obtained from the countries on the South Sea caused the English South Sea bubble A similar belief at the same time in the neighboring country of France formed the airy basis of a similar business humbug even more gigantic noxious and destructive This was John Law s Mississippi scheme of which I shall give an account in this chapter It was I think the greatest business humbug of history Law was a Scotchman shrewd and able a really good financier for those days but vicious a gambler unprincipled and liable to wild schemes He had possessed a good deal of property had traveled and gambled all over Europe was witty entertaining and capital company and had become a favorite with the Duke of Orleans and other French nobles When the Duke became Regent of France at the death of Louis XIV in seventeen fifteen that country was horribly in debt and its people in much misery owing to the costly wars and flaying taxations of the late King When therefore Law came to Paris with a promising scheme of finance in his hand the Regent was particularly glad to see him both as financier and as friend The Regent quickly fell in with Law s plans and in the spring of seventeen sixteen the first step not however so intended at the time toward the Mississippi Scheme was taken This was the establishment by royal authority of the banking firm of Law company consisting of Law and his brother This bank by a judicious organization and issue of paper money quickly began to help the distressed finances of the kingdom and to invigorate trade and commerce This success which seems to have been an entirely sound and legitimate business success made one sadly mistaken but very deep impression upon the ignorant and shallow mind of the Regent of France which was the foundation of all the subsequent trouble The Regent became firmly convinced that if a certain quantity of bank bills could do so much good a hundred thousand times as many bills would surely do a hundred thousand times as much That is he thought printing and issuing the bills was creating money He paid no regard to the need of providing specie for them on demand but thought he had an unlimited money factory in the city of Paris So far so good Next Law planned and with the ever ready consent of the Regent effected an enlargement of the business of his bank based on that delusion I spoke of about America This enlargement was the formation of the Mississippi Company and this was the contrivance which swelled into so tremendous a humbug The company was closely connected with the banks and received to begin with the monopoly of all trade to the Mississippi River and all the country west of it It was expected to obtain vast quantities of gold and silver from that region and thus to make immense dividends on its stock At home it was to have the sole charge of collecting all the taxes and coining all the money Stock was issued to the amount of one hundred thousand shares at two hundred dollars five hundred livres each And Law s help to the Government funds was continued by permitting this stock to be paid for in those funds at their par value though worth in market only about a third of it Subscriptions came in rapidly for the French community was far more ignorant about commercial affairs finances and the real resources of distant regions than we can easily conceive of now a days and not only the Regent but every man woman and child in France except a very few tough and hard headed old skeptics believed every word Law said and would have believed him if he had told stories a hundred times as incredible Well pretty soon the Regent gave the associates the bank and the company two other monopolies that of tobacco always monstrously profitable and that of refining gold and silver Pretty soon again he created the bank a state institution by the magnificent name of The Royal Bank of France Having done this the Regent could control the bank in spite of Law or order either for in those days the kings of France were almost perfectly despotic and the Regent was acting king I have mentioned the Regent s terrible delusion about paper money No sooner had he the bank in his power than he added to the reasonable and useful total of twelve million dollars of notes already out a monstrous issue of two hundred million dollars worth in one vast batch with the firm conviction that he was thus adding so much to the par currency of France The Parliament of France a body mostly of lawyers originating in the Middle Ages a steady conservative wise and brave assembly was always hostile to Law and his schemes When this great expansion of paper currency began the Parliament made a resolute fight against it petitioning ordaining threatening to hang Law and frightening him well too for the thorough enmity of an assembly of old lawyers may well frighten anybody At last the Regent by the use of the despotic power of which the Kings of France had so much reduced these old fellows to silence by sticking a few of them in jail The cross grained Parliament thus disposed of everything was quickly made to look lovely In the beginning of seventeen nineteen more grants were made to Law s associated concerns The Mississippi Company was granted the monopoly of all trade to the East Indies China the South Seas and all the territories of the French India Company and of the Senegal Company It took a new and imposing name The Company of the Indies They had already by the way also obtained the monopoly of the Canada beaver trade Of this colossal corporation monopolizing the whole foreign commerce of France with two thirds or more of the world its whole home finances and other important interests besides fifty thousand new shares were issued as before at one hundred dollars each These might be bought as before with Government securities at par Law was so bold as to promise annual dividends of twenty dollars per share which as the Government funds stood was one hundred and twenty per cent per annum Everybody believed him More than three hundred thousand applications were made for the new shares Law was besieged in his house by more than twice as many people as General Grant had to help him take Richmond The Great Humbug was at last in full buzz The street where the wonderful Scotchman lived was busy filled crowded jammed choked Dangerous accidents happened in it every day from the excessive pressure From the princes of the blood down to cobblers and lackeys all men and all women crowded and crowded to subscribe their money and to pay their money and to know how many shares they had gotten Law moved to a roomier street and the crazy mob crowded harder than ever so that the Chancellor who held his court of law hard by could not hear his lawyers A tremendous uproar surely that could drown the voices of those gentlemen And so he moved again to the great Hotel de Soissons a vast palace with a garden of some acres Fantastic circumstances variegated the wild rush of speculation The haughtiest of the nobility rented mean rooms near Law s abode to be able to get at him Rents in his neighborhood rose to twelve and sixteen times their usual amount A cobbler whose lines had fallen in those pleasant places made forty dollars a day by letting his stall and furnishing writing materials to speculators Thieves and disreputable characters of all sorts flocked to this concourse There were riots and quarrels all the time They often had to send a troop of cavalry to clear the street at night Gamblers posted themselves with their implements among the speculators who gambled harder than the gamblers and took an occasional turn at roulette by way of slackening the excitement as people go to sleep or go into the country A hunchback fellow made a good deal of money by letting people write on his back When Law had moved into the Hotel de Soissons the former owner the Prince de Carignan reserved the gardens procured an edict confining all stock dealings to that place put up five hundred tents there leased them at five hundred livres a month each and thus made money at the rate of fifty thousand dollars a month There were just two of the aristocracy who were sensible and resolute enough not to speculate in the stock the Duke de saint Simon and the old Marshal Villars Law became infinitely the most important person in the kingdom Great and small male and female high and low haunted his offices and ante chambers hunted him down plagued his very life out to get a moment s speech with him and get him to enter their names as buyers of stock The highest nobles would wait half a day for the chance His servants received great sums to announce some visitor s name Ladies of the highest rank gave him anything he would ask of them for leave to buy stock One of them made her coachmen upset her out of her carriage as Law came by to get a word with him He helped her up she got the word and bought some stock Another lady ran into the house where he was at dinner and raised a cry of fire The rest ran out but she ran further in to reach Law who saw what she was at and like a pecuniary Joseph ran away as fast as he could As the frenzy rose toward its height and the Regent took advantage of it to issue stock enough to pay the whole national debt namely three hundred thousand new shares at one thousand dollars each or a thousand per cent in the par value They were instantly taken Three times as many would have been instantly taken So violent were the changes of the market that shares rose or fell twenty per cent within a few hours A servant was sent to sell two hundred and fifty shares of stock found on reaching the gardens of the Hotel de Soissons that since he left his master s house the price had risen from sixteen hundred dollars par value one hundred dollars remember to two thousand dollars The servant sold gave his master the proceeds at sixteen hundred dollars a share put the remaining one hundred thousand dollars in his own pocket and left France that evening Law s coachman became so rich that he left service and set up his own coach and when his master asked him to find a successor he brought two candidates and told Law to choose and he would take the other himself There were many absurd cases of vulgarians made rich There were also many robberies and murders That committed by the Count de Horn one of the higher nobility and two accomplices is a famous case The Count a dissipated rascal poniarded a broker in a tavern for the money the broker carried with him But he was taken and in spite of the utmost and most determined exertions of the nobility the Regent had him broken on the wheel in public like any other murderer The stock of the Company of the Indies though it dashed up and down ten and twenty per cent from day to day was from the first immensely inflated In August seventeen nineteen it sold at six hundred ten per cent in a few weeks more it arose to twelve hundred per cent All winter it still went up until in April seventeen twenty it stood at twenty fifty per cent That is one one hundred dollar share would sell for two thousand and fifty dollars At this extreme point of inflation the bubble stood a little shining splendidly as bubbles do when they are nearest bursting and then it received two or three quiet pricks The Prince de Conti enraged because Law would not send him some shares on his own terms sent three wagon loads of bills to Law s bank demanding specie Law paid it and complained to the Regent who made him put two thirds of it back again A shrewd stock gambler drew specie by small sums until he had about two hundred thousand dollars in coin and lest he should be forced to return it he packed it in a cart covered it with manure put on a peasant s disguise and carted his fortune over the frontiers into Belgium Some others quietly realized their means in like manner by driblets and funded them abroad By such means coin gradually grew very scarce and signs of a panic appeared The Regent tried to adjust matters by a decree that coin should be five per cent less than paper as much as to say It is hereby enacted that there is a great deal more coin than there is This did not serve and the Regent decreed again that coin should be worth ten per cent less than paper Then he decreed that the bank must not pay more than twenty two dollars at once in specie and finally by a bold stretch of his authority he issued an edict that no person should have over one hundred dollars in coin on pain of fine and confiscation These odious laws made a great deal of trouble spying and distress and rapidly aggravated the difficulty they were meant to cure The price of shares in the great company began to fall steadily and rapidly Law and the Regent began to be universally hated cursed and threatened Various foolish and vain attempts were made to stay the coming ruin by renewing the stories about Louisiana sending out a lot of conscripted laborers ordering that all payments must be made in paper and printing a new batch of notes to the amount of another three hundred million dollars Law s two corporations were also doctored in several ways The distress and fright grew worse An edict was issued that Law s notes and shares should depreciate gradually by law for a year and then be worth but half their face This made such a tumult and outcry that the Regent had to retract it in seven days On this seventh day Law s bank stopped paying specie Law was turned out of his public employments but still well treated by the Regent in private He was however mobbed and stoned in his coach in the street had to have a company of Swiss Guards in his house and at last had to flee to the Regent s own palace I have not space to describe in detail the ruin misery tumults loss and confusion which attended the speedy descent of Law s paper and shares to entire worthlessness Thousands of families were made paupers and trade and commerce destroyed by the painful process Law himself escaped out of France poor and after another obscure and disreputable career of gambling died in poverty at Venice in seventeen twenty nine Thus this enormous business humbug first raised a whole nation into a fool s paradise of imaginary wealth and then exploded leaving its projector and many thousands of victims ruined the country disturbed and distressed long enduring consequences in vicious and lawless and unsteady habits contracted while the delusion lasted and no single benefit except one more most dearly bought lesson of the wicked folly of mere speculation without a real business basis and a real business method Let not this lesson be lost on the rampant and half crazed speculators of the present day Those who buy gold or flour leather butter dry goods groceries hardware or anything else on speculation when prices are inflated far beyond the ordinary standard are taking upon themselves great risks for the bubble must eventually be pricked and whoever is the holder when that time comes must necessarily be the loser V MEDICINE AND QUACKS CHAPTER XXVIII DOCTORS AND IMAGINATION FIRING A JOKE OUT OF A CANNON THE PARIS EYE WATER MAJENDIE ON MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE OLD SANDS OF LIFE Medical humbugs constitute a very critical subject indeed because I shall be almost certain to offend some of three parties concerned namely physicians quacks and patients But it will never do to neglect so important a division of my whole theme as this To begin with it is necessary to suggest in the most delicate manner in the world that there is a small infusion of humbug among the very best of the regular practitioners These gentlemen for whose learning kind heartedness self devotion and skill I entertain a profound respect make use of what I may call the gaseous element of their practice not for the lucre of gain but in order to enlist the imaginations of their patients in aid of nature and great remedies The stories are infinite in number which illustrate the force of imagination ranging through all the grades of mental action from the lofty visions of good men who dream of seeing heaven opened to them and all its ineffable glories and delights down to the low comedy conceit of the fellow who put a smoked herring into the tail of his coat and imagined himself a mermaid Probably however imagination displays its real power more wonderfully in the operations of the mind on the body that holds it than anywhere else It is true that there are some people even so utterly without imagination that they cannot take a joke such as that grave man of Scotland who was at last plainly told by a funny friend quite out of patience Why you wouldn t take a joke if it were fired at you out of a cannon Sir replied the Scot with sound reasoning and grave thought Sir you are absurd You cannot fire a joke out of a cannon But to return It is certainly the case that frequently the doctor takes great care not to let the patient know what is the matter and even not to let him know what he is swallowing This is because a good many people if at a critical point of disease may be made to turn toward health if made to believe that they are doing so but would be frightened in the literal sense of the words to death if told what a dangerous state they are in One sort of regular practice humbug is rendered necessary by the demands of the patients This is giving good big doses of something with a horrid smell and taste There are plenty of people who don t believe the doctor does anything to earn his money if he does not pour down some dirty brown or black stuff very nasty in flavor Some still more exacting wish for that sort of testimony which depends on internal convulsions and will not be satisfied unless they suffer torments and expel stuff enough to quiet the inside of Mount Vesuvius or Popocatepetl He s a good doctor was the verdict of one of this class of leather boweled fellows he ll work your innards for you It is a milder form of this same method to give what the learned faculty term a placebo This is a thing in the outward form of medicine but quite harmless in itself Such is a bread pill for instance or a draught of colored water with a little disagreeable taste in it These will often keep the patient s imagination headed in the right direction while good old Dame Nature is quietly mending up the damages in the soul s dark cottage One might almost fancy that in proportion as the physician is more skillful by so much he gives less medicine and relies more on imagination nature and above all regimen and nursing Here is a story in point There was an old gentleman in Paris who sold a famous eye water and made much gain thereby He died however one fine day and unfortunately forgot to leave the recipe on record His disconsolate widow continued the business at the old stand however to quote another characteristic French anecdote and being a woman of ready and decisive mind she very quietly filled the vials with water from the river Seine and lived respectably on the proceeds finding to her great relief that the eye water was just as good as ever At last however she found herself about to die and under the stings of an accusing conscience she confessed her trick to her physician an eminent member of the profession Be entirely easy Madam said the wise man don t be troubled at all You are the most innocent physician in the world you have done nobody any harm It is an old and illiberal joke to compare medicine to war on the ground that the votaries of both seek to destroy life It is however not far from the truth to say that they are alike in this that they are both preeminently liable to mistakes and that in both he is most successful who makes the fewest How can it be otherwise until we know more than we do at present of the great mysteries of life and death It seems risky enough to permit the wisest and most experienced physician to touch those springs of life which God only understands And it is enough to make the most stupid stare to see how people will let the most disgusting quack jangle their very heartstrings with his poisonous messes about as soon as if he were the best doctor in the world A true physician indeed does not hasten to drug The great French surgeon Majendie is even said to have commenced his official course of lectures on one occasion by coolly saying to his students Gentlemen the curing of disease is a subject that physicians know nothing about This was doubtless an extreme way of putting the case Yet it was in a certain sense exactly true There is one of the geysers in Iceland into which visitors throw pebbles or turfs with the invariable result of causing the disgusted geyser in a few minutes to vomit the dose out again along with a great quantity of hot water steam and stuff Now the doctor does know that some of his doses are pretty sure to work as the traveler knows that his dose will work on the geyser It is only the exact how and why that is not understood But however mysterious is nature however ignorant the doctor however imperfect the present state of physical science the patronage and the success of quacks and quackeries are infinitely more wonderful than those of honest and laborious men of science and their careful experiments I have come about to the end of my tether for this time and quackery is something too monstrous in dimensions as well as character to be dealt with in a paragraph But I may with propriety put one quack at the tail of this letter it is but just that he should let decent people go before him I mean Old Sands of Life Everybody has seen his advertisement beginning A retired Physician whose sands of life have nearly run out et cetera And everybody almost knows how kind the fellow is in sending gratis his recipe All that is necessary is as you find out when you get the recipe to buy at a high price from him one ingredient which he says you can get nowhere else This swindling scamp is in fact a smart brisk fellow of about thirty five years of age notwithstanding the length of time during which to use a funny phrase which somebody got up for him he has been afflicted with a loose tail board to his mortal sand cart Some benevolent friend was so much distressed about the feebleness of Old Sands of Life as to send him one day a large parcel by express marked C O D and costing quite a figure Old Sands paid and opening the parcel found half a bushel of excellent sand CHAPTER XXIX THE CONSUMPTIVE REMEDY E ANDREWS M D BORN WITHOUT BIRTHRIGHTS HASHEESH CANDY ROBACK THE GREAT A CONJURER OPPOSED TO LYING There is a fellow in Williamsburg who calls himself a clergyman and sells a consumptive remedy by which I suppose he means a remedy for consumption It is a mere slop corked in a vial but there are a good many people who are silly enough to buy it of him A certain gentleman during last November earnestly sought an interview with this reverend brother in the interests of humanity but he was as inaccessible as a chipmunk in a stone fence The gentleman wrote a polite note to the knave asking about prices and received a printed circular in return stating in an affecting manner the good man s grief at having to raise his price in consequence of the cost of gold with which I am obliged to buy my medicines saith he in Paris This was both sad and unsatisfactory and the gentleman went over to Williamsburg to seek an interview and find out all about the prices He reached the abode of the man of piety but strange to relate he wasn t at home Gentleman waited Reverend brother kept on not being at home When gentleman had waited to his entire satisfaction he came back It is understood it is practically out of the question to see the reverend brother Perhaps he is so modest and shy that he will not encounter the clamorous gratitude which would obstruct his progress through the streets from the millions saved by his consumptive remedy It is a pity that the reverend man cannot enjoy the still more complete seclusion by which the state of New York testifies its appreciation of unobtrusive and retiring virtues like his in the salubrious and quiet town of Sing Sing A quack in an inland city who calls himself E Andrews M D prints a semi occasional document in the form of a periodical of which a copy is lying before me It is an awful hodgepodge of perfect nonsense and vulgar rascality He calls it The Good Samaritan and Domestic Physician and this number is called volume twenty Only think what a great man we have among us unless the Doctor himself is mistaken He says I will here state that I have been favored by nature and Providence in gaining access to stores of information that has fell to the lot of but very few persons heretofore during the past history of mankind Evidently these stores were so vast that the great doctor s brain was stuffed too full to have room left for English Grammar Shortly the Doctor thus bursts forth again with some views having their own merits but not such as concern the healing art very directly The automaton powers of machinery there s a new style of machinery you observe must be made to WORK FOR instead of as now against mankind the Land of all nations must be made FREE to Actual Settlers in LIMITED quantities No one must be born without his birthright being born with him The italics et cetera are the Doctor s What an awful thought is this of being born without any birthright or as the Doctor leaves us to suppose possible having one s birthright born first and dodging about the world like a stray canary bird while the unhappy and belated owner tries in vain to put salt on its tail and catch it Well this wiseacre after his portentous introduction fills the rest of his sixteen loosely printed double columned octavo pages with a farrago of the most indescribable character made up of brags lies promises forged recommendations and letters boasts of systematic charity funny scraps of stuff in the form of little disquisitions advertisements of remedies hair oils cosmetics liquors groceries thistle killers anti bug mixtures recipes for soap ink honey and the Old Harry only knows what The fellow gives a list of seventy one specific diseases for which his Hasheesh Candy is a sure cure and he adds that it is also a sure cure for all diseases of the liver brain throat stomach ear and other internal disorders also for all long standing diseases whatever that means and for insanity In this monstrous list are jumbled together the most incongruous troubles Bleeding at the nose and abortions worms fits poisons and cramps And the impudent liar quotes General Grant General Mitchell the Rebel General Lee General McClellan and Doctor Mott of this city all shouting in chorus the praises of the Hasheesh Candy Next comes the Secret of Beauty a preparation of Turkish Roses then a lot of forged references and an assertion that the Doctor gives to the poor five thousand pounds of bread every winter then some fearful denunciations of the regular doctors But as the auctioneers say I can t dwell I will only add that the real villainy of this fellow only appears here and there where he advertises the means of ruining innocence or of indulging with impunity in the foulest vices He will sell for three dollars thirty cents the Mystic Weird Ring In a chapter of infamous blatherumskite about this ring he says The wearer can drive from or draw to him any one and for any purpose whatever I need not explain what this scoundrel means He also will sell the professed means of robbery and swindling saying that he is prepared to show how to remove papers wills titles notes et cetera from one place to another by invisible means It is a wonder that the Bank of Commerce can keep any securities in its vaults of course But enough of this degraded panderer to crime and folly He is beneath notice so far as he himself concerned I devote the space to him because it is well worth while to understand how base an imposture can draw a steady revenue from a nation boasting so much culture and intelligence as ours It is also worth considering whether the authorities must not be remiss who permit such odious deceptions to be constantly perpetrated upon the public I ought here to give a paragraph to the great C W Roback one of whose Astrological Almanacs is before me This erudite production is embellished in front with a picture of the doctor and his six brothers for he is the seventh son of a seventh son The six elder brethren nice enough boys stand submissively around their gigantic and bearded junior reaching only to his waist and gazing up at him with reverence as the sheaves of Joseph s brethren worshipped his sheaf in his dream At the end is a picture of Magnus Roback the grandfather of C W a bull headed ugly old Dutchman with a globe and compasses This picture by the way is in fact a cheap likeness of the old discoverers or geographers Within the book we find Gustavus Roback the father of C W for whom is used a cut of Jupiter or some other heathen god half naked a straddle of an eagle with a hook in one hand and a quadrant in the other which is very much like the picture by one of the Old Masters of Abraham about to offer up Isaac and taking a long aim at the poor boy with a flint lock horse pistol Doctor Roback is good enough to tell us where his brothers are One a high officer in the Empire of China another a Catholic Bishop in the city of Rome and so on There is also a cut of his sister whom he cured of consumption She is represented talking to her bird after the fashion of her country when a maiden is unexpectedly rescued from the jaws of death Roback cures all sorts of diseases discovers stolen property insures children a marriage and so on all by means of conjurations He also casts nativities and foretells future events and he shows in full how Bernadotte Louis Philippe and Napoleon Bonaparte either did well or would have done well by following his advice The chief peculiarity of this impostor is that he really avoids direct pandering to vice and crime and even makes it a specialty to cure drunkenness and of all things in the world lying On this point Roback gives in full the certificate of missus Abigail Morgan whose daughter Amanda was sorely given to fibbing in so much that she would rather lie than speak the truth And the delighted mother certifies that our friend and wizard so changed the nature of the girl that to the best of our knowledge and belief she has never spoken anything but the truth since There is a conjurer as is a conjurer What an uproar the incantation of the great Roback would make if set fairly to work among the politicians for instance But after all on second thoughts what a horrible mass of abominations would they lay bare in telling the truth about each other all round No no it won t do to have the truth coming out in politics at any rate Away with Roback I will not give him another word not a single chance not even to explain his great power over what he calls Fits Fits Fits Fits Fits CHAPTER XXX MONSIGNORE CRISTOFORO RISCHIO OR IL CRESO THE NOSTRUM VENDER OF FLORENCE A MODEL FOR OUR QUACK DOCTORS Every visitor to Florence during the last twenty years must have noticed on the grand piazza before the Ducal Palace the strange genius known as Monsignore Creso or in plain English mister Croesus He is so called because of his reputed great wealth but his real name is Christoforo Rischio which I may again translate as Christopher Risk missus Browning refers to him in one of her poems the Casa Guidi Windows I think and he has also been the staple of a tale by one of the Trollope brothers Twice every week he comes into the city in a strange vehicle drawn by two fine Lombardy ponies and unharnesses them in the very centre of the square His assistant a capital vocalist begins to sing immediately and a crowd soon collects around the wagon Then Monsignore takes from the box beneath his seat a splendidly jointed human skeleton which he suspends from a tall rod and hook and also a number of human skulls The latter are carefully arranged on an adjustable shelf and Creso takes his place behind them while in his rear a perfect chemist s shop of flasks bottles and pillboxes is disclosed Very soon his singer ceases and in the purest Tuscan dialect the very utterance of which is music the Florentine quack doctor proceeds to address the assemblage Not being conversant with the Italian I am only able to give the substance of his harangue and pronounce indifferently upon the merit of his elocution I am assured however that not only the common people who are his chief patrons but numbers of the most intelligent citizens are always entertained by what he has to say and certainly his gestures and style of expressions seem to betray great excellence of oratory Having turned the skeleton round and round on its pivot and minutely explained the various anatomical parts in order to show his proficiency in the basis of medical science he next lifts the skulls one by one and descants upon their relative perfection throwing in a shrewd anecdote now and then as to the life of the original owner of each cranium One skull for example he asserts to have belonged to a lunatic who wandered for half a lifetime in the Val d Ema subsisting precariously upon entirely vegetable food roots herbs and the like another is the superior part of a convict hung in Arezzo for numerous offences a third is that of a very old man who lived a celibate from his youth up and by his abstinence and goodness exercised an almost priestly influence upon the borghesa When by this miscellaneous lecture he has both amused and edified his hearers he ingeniously turns the discourse upon his own life and finally introduces the subject of the marvellous cures he has effected The story of his medical preparations alone their components and method of distillation is a fine piece of popularized art and he gives a practical exemplification of his skill and their virtues by calling from the crowd successively a number of invalid people whom he examines and prescribes for on the spot Whether these subjects are provided by himself or not I am unable to decide but it is very possible that by long experience Christoforo who has no regular diploma has mastered the simpler elements of Materia Medica and does in reality effect cures I class him among what are popularly known as humbugs however for he is a pretender to more wisdom than he possesses It was to me a strange and suggestive scene the bald beak nosed coal eyed charlatan standing in the market place so celebrated in history peering through his gold spectacles at the upturned faces below him while the bony skeleton at his side swayed in the wind and the grinning skulls below made grotesque faces as if laughing at the gullibility of the people Behind him loomed up the massive Palazzo Vecchio with its high tower sharply cut and set with deep machicolations to the left the splendid Loggia of Orgagna filled with rare marbles and the long picture gallery of the Uffizi heaped with the rarest art treasures of the world to his right the Giant Fountain of Ammanato throwing jets of pure water one drop of which outvalues all the nostrums in the world and in front the Post Office built centuries before by Pisan captives If any of these things moved the imperturbable Creso he showed no feeling of the sort but for three long hours two days in the week held his hideous clinic in the open daylight Seeing the man so often and interested always in his manner as much so indeed as the peasants or contadini who bought his vials and pillboxes without stint I became interested to know the main features of his life and by the aid of a friend got some clues which I think reliable enough to publish I do so the more willingly because his career is illustrative after an odd fashion of contemporary Italian life He was the son of a small farmer not far from Sienna and grew up in daily contact with vine dressers and olive gatherers living upon the hard Tuscan fare of macaroni and maroon nuts with a cutlet of lean mutton once a day and a pint of sour Tuscan wine Being tolerably well educated for a peasant boy he imbibed a desire for the profession of an actor and studied Alfieri closely Some little notoriety that he gained by recitations led him in an evil hour to venture an appearance en grand role in Florence at a third rate theatre His father had meanwhile deceased and left him the property but to make the debut referred to he sold almost his entire inheritance As may be supposed his failure was signal However easy he had found it to amuse the rough untutored peasantry of his neighborhood the test of a large and polished city was beyond his merit So poor and abashed he sank to the lower walks of dramatic art singing in choruses at the opera playing minor parts in show pieces and all the while feeling the sting of disappointed ambition and half deserved penury One day found him at the beginning of winter without work and without a soldo in his pocket Passing a druggist s shop he saw a placard asking for men to sell a certain new preparation The druggist advanced him a small sum for travelling expenses and he took to peripatetic lectures at once going into the country and haranguing at all the villages Here he found his dramatic education available Though not good enough for an actor he was sufficiently clever for a nomadic eulogizer of a patent medicine His vocal abilities were also of service to him in gathering the people together The great secret of success in anything is to get a hearing Half the object is gained when the audience is assembled Well poor vagabond peddling Christopher Risk selling so much for another party conceived the idea of becoming his own capitalist He resolved to prepare a medicine of his own and profiting by the assistance of a young medical student obtained bona fide prescriptions for the commonest maladies These he had made up in gross originated labels for them and concealing the real essences thereof by certain harmless adulterations began to advertise himself as the discoverer of a panacea To gain no ill will among the priests whose influence is paramount with the peasantry he dexterously threw in a reverent word for them in his nomadic harangues and now and then made a sounding present to the Church He profited also by the superstitions abroad and to the skill of Hippocrates added the roguery of Simon Magus By report he was both a magician and physician and a knack that he had of slight of hand was not the least influential of his virtues His bodily prowess was as great as his suppleness One day at Fiesole a foreign doctor presumed to challenge Monsignore to a debate and the offer was accepted While the two stood together in Cristoforo s wagon and the intruder was haranguing the people the quack without a movement of his face or a twitch of his body jerked his foot against his rival s leg and threw him to the ground He had the effrontery to proclaim the feat as magnetic entirely accomplished without bodily means and by virtue of his black art acquirements An awe fell upon the listeners and they refused to hear the checkmated disputant further As soon as Cristoforo began to thrive he indulged his dramatic taste by purchasing a superb wagon team and equipments and hired a servant Such a turnout had never been seen in Tuscany since the Medician days It gained for him the name of Creso straightway and enabling him to travel more rapidly enlarged his business sphere and so vastly increased his profits He arranged regular days and hours for each place in Tuscany and soon became as widely known as the Grand Duke himself When it was known that he had bought an old castle at Pontassieve on the banks of the Arno his reputation still further increased He was now so prosperous that he set the faculty at defiance He proclaimed that they were jealous of his profounder learning and threatened to expose the banefulness of their systems At the same time his talk to the common people began to savor of patronage and this also enhanced his reputation It is much better as a rule to call attention up to you rather than charity down to you The shrewd impostor became also more absolute now It was known that the Grand Duke had once asked him to dine and that Monsignore had the hardihood to refuse Indeed he sympathized too greatly with the aroused Italian spirit of unity and progress to compromise himself with the house of Austria When at last the revolution came Cristoforo was one of its best champions in Tuscany His cantante sang only the march of Garibaldi and the victories of Savoy His own speeches teemed with the gospel of Italy regenerated and for a whole month he wasted no time in the sale of his bottighias and pillolas but threw all his vehement persuasive and dramatic eloquence into the popular cause The end we know Tuscany is a dukedom no longer but a component part of a great peninsular kingdom with Florence the Beautiful for its capital And still before the ducal palace where the deputies of Italy are to assemble poor vain Cristoforo Rischio makes his harangue every Tuesday and Saturday He is now or was four years ago upward of sixty years of age but spirited and athletic as ever and so rich that it would be superfluous for him to continue his peripatetic career His life is to me noteworthy as showing what may be gained by concentrating even humble energies upon a paltry thing Had Creso persevered as well upon the stage I do not doubt that he would have made a splendid actor If he did so well with a mere nostrum why should he not have gained riches and a less grotesque fame by the sale of a better article He understood human nature its credulities and incredulities its superstitions tastes changefulness and love of display and excitement He has done no harm and given as much amusement as he has been paid for Indeed I consider him more an ornamental and useful character than otherwise He has brightened many a traveler s recollections relieved the tedium of many a weary hour in a foreign city and with all his deception has never severed himself from the popular faith nor sold out the popular cause I dare say his death when it occurs will cause more sensation and evoke more tears than that of any better physician in Tuscany VI HOAXES CHAPTER XXXI THE TWENTY SEVENTH STREET GHOST SPIRITS ON THE RAMPAGE In classing the ghost excitement that agitated our good people to such an extent some two years ago among the humbugs of the age I must at the outset remind my readers that there was no little accumulation of what is termed respectable testimony as to the reality of his ghostship in Twenty seventh street One fine Sunday morning in the early part of eighteen sixty three my friends of the Sunday Mercury astonished their many thousands of patrons with an account that had been brought to them of a fearful spectre that had made its appearance in one of the best houses in Twenty seventh Street The narrative was detailed with circumstantial accuracy and yet with an apparent discreet reserve that gave the finishing touch of delightful mystery to the story The circumstances as set forth in the opening letter for many others followed were briefly these A highly respectable family residing on Twenty seventh Street one of our handsome up town thoroughfares became aware toward the close of the year eighteen sixty two that something extraordinary was taking place in their house then one of the best in the neighborhood Sundry mutterings and whisperings began to be heard among the servants employed about the domicile and after a little while it became almost impossible to induce them to remain there for love or money The visitors of the family soon began to notice that their calls which formerly were so welcome particularly among the young people of the establishment seemed to give embarrassment and that the smiles that greeted them as early as seven in the evening gradually gave place to uneasy gestures and finally to positive hints at the lateness of the hour or the fatigue of their host by nine o clock The head of the family was a plain matter of fact old gentleman by no means likely to give way to any superstitious terrors one of your hard headed business men who pooh poohed demons hobgoblins and all other kinds of spirits except the purest Santa Cruz and genuine old Otard and he fell into a great rage when upon his repeated gruff demands for an explanation he was delicately informed that his parlor was haunted He vowed that somebody wanted to drive him from the house that there was a conspiracy afoot among the women to get him still higher up town and into a bigger brown stone front and refused to believe one word of the ghost story At length one day while sitting in his growlery as the ladies called it in the lower story his attention was aroused by a clatter on the stairs and looking out into the entry he saw a party of carpenters and painters who had been employed upon the parlor floor beating a precipitate retreat toward the front door Stop stop you infernal fools What s all this hullabaloo about shouted the old gentleman No reply no halt upon the part of the mechanics but away they went down the steps and along the street as though Satan himself or Moseby the guerrilla was at their heels They were pursued and ordered back but absolutely refused to come swearing that they had seen the Evil One in propria persona and threats persuasions and bribes alike proved vain to induce them to return This made the matter look serious and a family council was held forthwith It wouldn t do to let matters go on in this way and something must be thought of as a remedy It was in this half solemn and half tragic conclave that the pater familias was at last put in possession of the mysterious occurrences that had been disturbing the peace of his domestic hearth A ghost had been repeatedly seen in his best drawing room a genuine undeniable unmitigated ghost The spectre was described by the female members of the family as making his appearance at all hours chiefly however in the evening of course Now the good old orthodox idea of a ghost is of a very long cadaverous ghastly personage of either sex appearing in white draperies with uplifted finger and attended or preceded by sepulchral sounds whist hush and sometimes the rattling of casements and the jingling of chains A bluish glare and a strong smell of brimstone seldom failed to enhance the horror of the scene This ghost however came it seems in more ordinary guise but none the less terrible for his natural style of approach and costume He was usually seen in the front parlor which was on the second story and faced the street There he would be found seated in a chair near the fire place his attire the garb of a carman or carter and hence the name Carter s Ghost afterward frequently applied to him There he would sit entirely unmoved by the approach of living denizens of the house who at first would suppose that he was some drunken or insane intruder and only discover their mistake as they drew near and saw the fire light shining through him and notice the glare of his frightful eyes which threatened all comers in a most unearthly way Such was the purport of the first sketch that appeared in the Sunday Mercury stated so distinctly and impressively that the effect could not fail to be tremendous among our sensational public To help the matter another brief notice to the same effect appeared in the Sunday issue of a leading journal on the same morning The news dealers and street carriers caught up the novelty instanter and before noon not a copy of the Sunday Mercury could be bought in any direction The country issue of the Sunday Mercury had still a larger sale On Sunday morning every sheet in town made some allusion to the Ghost and many even went so far as to give the very supposed number of the house favored with his visitations The result of this enterprising guess was ludicrous enough bordering a little too upon the serious Indignant house holders rushed down to the Sunday Mercury office with the most amusing wrath threatening and denouncing the astonished publishers with all sorts of legal action for their presumed trespass when in reality their paper had designated no place or person at all But the grandest demonstration of popular excitement was revealed in Twenty seventh street itself Before noon a considerable portion of the thoroughfare below Sixth Avenue was blocked up with a dense mass of people of all ages sizes sexes and nationalities who had come to see the Ghost A liquor store or two near by drove a splendid spiritual business and by evening the fun grew so fast and furious that a whole squad of police had to be employed to keep the side walks and even the carriage way clear The Ghost was shouted for to make a speech like any other new celebrity and old ladies and gentlemen peering out of upper story windows were saluted with playful tokens of regard such as turnips eggs of ancient date and other things too numerous to mention from the crowd Nor was the throng composed entirely of Gothamites The surrounding country sent in its contingent They came on foot on horseback in wagons and arrayed in all the costumes known about these parts since the days of Rip Van Winkle Cruikshanks would have made a fortune from his easy sketches of only a few figures in the scene And thus the concourse continued for days together arriving at early morn and staying there in the street until dewy eve As a matter of course there were various explanations of the story propounded by various people all wondrously wise in their own conceit Some would have it that the Ghost was got up by some of the neighbors who wished in this manner to drive away disreputable occupants others insisted that it was the revenge of an ousted tenant et cetera et cetera Everybody offered his own theory and as is usual in such cases nobody was exactly right Meanwhile the Sunday Mercury continued its publications of the further progress of the mystery from week to week for a space of nearly two months until the whole country seemed to have gone ghost mad Apparitions and goblins dire were seen in Washington Rochester Albany Montreal and other cities The spiritualists took it up and began to discuss the Carter Ghost with the utmost zeal One startling individual a physician and a philosopher emerged from his professional shell into full fledged glory as the greatest canard of all and published revelations of his own intermediate intercourse with the terrific Carter In every nook and corner of the land tremendous posters in white and yellow broke out upon the walls and windows of news depots with capitals a foot long and exclamation points like drumsticks announcing fresh installments of the Ghost story and it was a regular fight between go ahead vendors who should get the next batch of horrors in advance of his rivals Nor was the effect abroad the least feature of this stupendous sell The English French and German press translated some of the articles in epitome and wrote grave commentaries thereon The stage soon caught the blaze and Professor Pepper at the Royal Polytechnic Institute in London invented a most ingenious device for producing ghosts which should walk about upon the stage in such a perfectly astounding manner as to throw poor Hamlet s father and the evil genius of Brutus quite into the shade Pepper s Ghost soon crossed the Atlantic and all our theatres were speedily alive with nocturnal apparitions The only real ghosts however four in number came out at the Museum in an appropriate drama which had an immense run all for twenty five cents or only six and a quarter cents per ghost But I must not forget to say that really the details given in the Sunday Mercury were well calculated to lead captive a large class of minds prone to luxuriate in the marvelous when well mixed with plausible reasoning The most circumstantial accounts were given of sundry gifted young ladies grave and learned professors reliable gentlemen where are those not found lonely watchers and others who had sought interviews with the ghost to their own great enlightenment indeed but likewise complete discomfiture Pistols were fired at him pianos played and songs sung for him and finally his daguerreotype taken on prepared metallic plates set upright in the haunted room One shrewd artist brought out an exact photographic likeness of the distinguished stranger on cartes de visite and made immense sales The apparitions too multiplied An old man a woman and a child made their appearance in the house of wonders and at last a gory head with distended eyeballs swimming in a sea of blood upon a platter like that of Holofernes capped the climax Certain wiseacres here began to see political allusions in the Ghost and many actually took the whole affair to be a cunningly devised political satire upon this or that party according as their sympathies swayed them It would have been a remarkable portion of this strange eventful history of course if Barnum could have escaped the accusation of being its progenitor I was continually beset and frequently when more than usually busy thoroughly annoyed by the innuendoes of my visitors that I was the father of the Ghost Come now mister Barnum this is going a little too far some good old dame or grandfather would say to me You oughtn t to scare people in this way These ghosts are ugly customers My dear Sir or Madam I would say as the case might be I do assure you I know nothing whatever about the Ghost and as for spirits you know I never touch them and have been preaching against them nearly all my life Well well you will have the last turn they d retort as they edged away but you needn t tell us We guess we ve found the ghost Now all I can add about this strange hallucination is that those who came to me to see the original Carter really saw the Elephant The wonderful apparition disappeared at length as suddenly as he had come The Bull s Eye Brigade as the squad of police put on duty to watch the neighborhood for various reasons was termed hung to their work and flashed the light of their lanterns into the faces of lonely couples for some time afterward but quiet at length settled down over all and it has been it seems reserved for my pen to record briefly the history of The Twenty seventh street Ghost CHAPTER XXXII THE MOON HOAX The most stupendous scientific imposition upon the public that the generation with which we are numbered has known was the so called Moon Hoax published in the columns of the New York Sun in the months of August and September eighteen thirty five The sensation created by this immense imposture not only throughout the United States but in every part of the civilized world and the consummate ability with which it was written will render it interesting so long as our language shall endure and indeed astronomical science has actually been indebted to it for many most valuable hints a circumstance that gives the production a still higher claim to immortality At the period when the wonderful yarn to which I allude first appeared the science of astronomy was engaging particular attention and all works on the subject were eagerly bought up and studied by immense masses of people The real discoveries of the younger Herschel whose fame seemed destined to eclipse that of the elder sage of the same name and the eloquent startling works of doctor Dick which the Harpers were republishing in popular form from the English edition did much to increase and keep up this peculiar mania of the time until the whole community at last were literally occupied with but little else than star gazing Dick s works on The Sidereal Heavens Celestial Scenery The improvement of Society et cetera were read with the utmost avidity by rich and poor old and young in season and out of season They were quoted in the parlor at the table on the promenade at church and even in the bedroom until it absolutely seemed as though the whole community had Dick upon the brain To the highly educated and imaginative portion of our good Gothamite population the Doctor s glowing periods full of the grandest speculations as to the starry worlds around us their wondrous magnificence and ever varying aspects of beauty and happiness were inexpressibly fascinating The author s well reasoned conjectures as to the majesty and beauty of their landscapes the fertility and diversity of their soil and the exalted intelligence and comeliness of their inhabitants found hosts of believers and nothing else formed the staple of conversation until the beaux and belles and dealers in small talk generally began to grumble and openly express their wishes that the Dickens had Doctor Dick and all his works It was at the very height of the furor above mentioned that one morning the readers of the Sun at that time only twenty five hundred in number were thrilled with the announcement in its columns of certain Great Astronomical Discoveries Lately Made by Sir John Herschel LL D F R S et cetera at the Cape of Good Hope purporting to be a republication from a Supplement to the Edinburgh Journal of Science The heading of the article was striking enough yet was far from conveying any adequate idea of its contents When the latter became known the excitement went beyond all bounds and grew until the Sun office was positively besieged with crowds of people of the very first class vehemently applying for copies of the issue containing the wonderful details As the pamphlet form in which the narrative was subsequently published is now out of print and a copy can hardly be had in the country I will recall a few passages from a rare edition for the gratification of my friends who have never seen the original Indeed the whole story is altogether too good to be lost and it is a great pity that we can not have a handsome reprint of it given to the world from time to time It is constantly in demand and during the year eighteen fifty nine a single copy of sixty pages sold at the auction of mister Haswell s library brought the sum of three hundred seventy five dollars In that same year a correspondent in Wisconsin writing to the Sunday Times of this city inquired where the book could be procured and was answered that he could find it at the old bookstore No eighty five Centre Street if anywhere Thus after a search of many weeks the Western bibliopole succeeded in obtaining a well thumbed specimen of the precious work Acting upon this chance suggestion mister William Gowans of this city during the same year brought out a very neat edition in paper covers illustrated with a view of the moon as seen through Lord Rosse s grand telescope in eighteen fifty six But this too has all been sold and the most indefatigable book collector might find it difficult to purchase a single copy at the present time I therefore render the inquiring reader no slight service in culling for him some of the flowers from this curious astronomical garden The opening of the narrative was in the highest Review style and the majestic yet subdued dignity of its periods at once claimed respectful attention while its perfect candor and its wealth of accurate scientific detail exacted the homage of belief from all but cross grained and inexorable skeptics It commences thus In this unusual addition to our Journal we have the happiness to make known to the British public and thence to the whole civilized world recent discoveries in Astronomy which will build an imperishable monument to the age in which we live and confer upon the present generation of the human race a proud distinction through all future time It has been poetically said that the stars of heaven are the hereditary regalia of man as the intellectual sovereign of the animal creation He may now fold the Zodiac around him with a loftier consciousness of his mental superiority et cetera et cetera The writer then eloquently descanted upon the sublime achievement by which man pierced the bounds that hemmed him in and with sensations of awe approached the revelations of his own genius in the far off heavens and with intense dramatic effect described the younger Herschel surpassing all that his father had ever attained and by some stupendous apparatus about to unvail the remotest mysteries of the sidereal space pausing for many hours ere the excess of his emotions would allow him to lift the vail from his own overwhelming success I must quote a line or two of this passage for it capped the climax of public curiosity Well might he pause He was about to become the sole depository of wondrous secrets which had been hid from the eyes of all men that had lived since the birth of time He was about to crown himself with a diadem of knowledge which would give him a conscious preeminence above every individual of his species who then lived or who had lived in the generations that are passed away He paused ere he broke the seal of the casket that contained it Was not this introduction enough to stimulate the wonder bump of all the star gazers until Each particular hair did stand on end Like quills upon the fretful porcupine At all events such was the effect and it was impossible at first to supply the frantic demand even of the city not to mention the country readers I may very briefly sum up the outline of the discoveries alleged to have been made in a few paragraphs so as not to protract the suspense of my readers too long It was claimed that the Edinburgh Journal was indebted for its information to Doctor Andrew Grant a savant of celebrity who had for very many years been the scientific companion first of the elder and subsequently of the younger Herschel and had gone with the latter in September eighteen thirty four to the Cape of Good Hope whither he had been sent by the British Government acting in conjunction with the Governments of France and Austria to observe the transit of Mercury over the disc of the sun an astronomical point of great importance to the lunar observations of longitude and consequently to the navigation of the world This transit was not calculated to occur before the seventh of November eighteen thirty five the year in which the hoax was printed but Sir John Herschel set out nearly a year in advance for the purpose of thoroughly testing a new and stupendous telescope devised by himself under this peculiar inspiration and infinitely surpassing anything of the kind ever before attempted by mortal man It has been discovered by previous astronomers and among others by Herschel s illustrious father that the sidereal object becomes dim in proportion as it is magnified and that beyond a certain limit the magnifying power is consequently rendered almost useless Thus an impassable barrier seemed to lie in the way of future close observation unless some means could be devised to illuminate the object to the eye By intense research and the application of all recent improvements in optics Sir John had succeeded in securing a beautiful and perfectly lighted image of the moon with a magnifying power that increased its apparent size in the heavens six thousand times Dividing the distance of the moon from the earth viz two hundred forty thousand miles by six thousand we we have forty miles as the distance at which she would then seem to be seen and as the elder Herschel with a magnifying power only one thousand had calculated that he could distinguish an object on the moon s surface not more than one hundred twenty two yards in diameter it was clear that his son with six times the power could see an object there only twenty two yards in diameter But for any further advance in power and light the way seemed insuperably closed until a profound conversation with the great savant and optician Sir David Brewster led Herschel to suggest to the latter the idea of the readoption of the old fashioned telescopes without tubes which threw their images upon reflectors in a dark apartment and then the illumination of these images by the intense hydro oxygen light used in the ordinary illuminated microscope At this suggestion Brewster is represented by the veracious chronicler as leaping with enthusiasm from his chair exclaiming in rapture to Herschel Thou art the man The suggestion thus happily approved was immediately acted upon and a subscription headed by that liberal patron of science the Duke of Sussex with Lten thousand was backed by the reigning King of England with his royal word for any sum that might be needed to make up Lseventy thousand the amount required No time was lost and after one or two failures in January eighteen thirty three the house of Hartley Grant at Dumbarton succeeded in casting the huge object glass of the new apparatus measuring twenty four feet or six times that of the elder Herschel s glass in diameter weighing fourteen thousand eight hundred twenty six pounds or nearly seven tons after being polished and possessing a magnifying power of forty two thousand times a perfectly pure spotless achromatic lens without a material bubble or flaw Of course after so elaborate a description of so astounding a result as this the Edinburg Scientific Journal i e the writer in the New York Sun could not avoid being equally precise in reference to subsequent details and he proceeded to explain that Sir John Herschel and his amazing apparatus having been selected by the Board of Longitude to observe the transit of Mercury the Cape of Good Hope was chosen because upon the former expedition to Peru acting in conjunction with one to Lapland which was sent out for the same purpose in the eighteenth century it had been noticed that the attraction of the mountainous regions deflected the plumb line of the large instruments seven or eight seconds from the perpendicular and consequently greatly impaired the enterprise At the Cape on the contrary there was a magnificent table land of vast expanse where this difficulty could not occur Accordingly on the fourth of September eighteen thirty four with a design to become perfectly familiar with the working of his new gigantic apparatus and with the Southern Constellations before the period of his observations of Mercury Sir John Herschel sailed from London accompanied by Doctor Grant the supposed informant Lieutenant Drummond of the Royal Engineers F R A S and a large party of the best English workmen On their arrival at the Cape the apparatus was conveyed in four days time to the great elevated plain thirty five miles to the N E of Cape Town on trains drawn by two relief teams of oxen eighteen to a team the ascent aided by gangs of Dutch boors For the details of the huge fabric in which the lens and its reflectors were set up I must refer the curious reader to the pamphlet itself not that the presence of the Dutch boors alarms me at all since we have plenty of boors at home and one gets used to them in the course of time but because the elaborate scientific description of the structure would make most readers see stars in broad daylight before they get through I shall only go on to say that by the tenth of January everything was complete even to the two pillars one hundred and fifty feet high that sustained the lens Operations then commenced forthwith and so too did the special wonder of the readers It is a matter of congratulation to mankind that the writer of the hoax with an apology Heaven save the mark spared us Herschel s notes of the Moon s tropical sidereal and synodic revolutions and the phenomena of the syzygies and proceeded at once to the pith of the subject Here came in his grand stroke informing the world of complete success in obtaining a distinct view of objects in the moon fully equal to that which the unaided eye commands of terrestrial objects at the distance of a hundred yards affirmatively settling the question whether the satellite be inhabited and by what order of beings firmly establishing a new theory of cometary phenomena et cetera et cetera This announcement alone was enough to take one s breath away but when the green marble shores of the Mare Nubium the mountains shaped like pyramids and of the purest and most dazzling crystalized wine colored amethyst dotting green valleys skirted by round breasted hills summits of the purest vermilion fringed with arching cascades and buttresses of white marble glistening in the sun when these began to be revealed the delight of our Luna tics knew no bounds and the whole town went moon mad But even these immense pictures were surpassed by the lunatic animals discovered First came the herds of brown quadrupeds very like a no not a whale but a bison and with a tail resembling that of the bos grunniens the reader probably understands what kind of a bos that is if he s apprenticed to a theatre in midsummer with musicians on a strike then a creature which the hoax man naively declared would be classed on earth as a monster I rather think it would of a bluish lead color about the size of a goat with a head and a beard like him and a single horn slightly inclined forward from the perpendicular it is clear that if this goat was cut down to a single horn other people were not I could not but fully appreciate the exquisite distinction accorded by the writer to the female of this lunar animal for she while deprived of horn and beard he explicitly tells us had a much larger tail When the astronomers put their fingers on the beard of this beautiful little creature on the reflector mind you it would skip away in high dudgeon which considering that two hundred forty thousand miles intervened was something to show its delicacy of feeling Next in the procession of discovery among other animals of less note was presented a quadruped with an amazingly long neck head like a sheep bearing two long spiral horns white as polished ivory and standing in perpendiculars parallel to each other Its body was like that of a deer but its forelegs were most disproportionately long and its tail which was very bushy and of a snowy whiteness curled high over its rump and hung two or three feet by its side Its colors were bright bay and white brindled in patches but of no regular form This is probably the animal known to us on earth and particularly along the Mississippi River as the guyascutus to which I may particularly refer in a future article But all these beings faded into insignificance compared with the first sight of the genuine Lunatics or men in the moon four feet high covered except in the face with short glossy copper colored hair and with wings composed of a thin membrane without hair lying snugly upon their backs from the top of their shoulders to the calves of their legs with faces of a yellowish flesh color a slight improvement on the large ourang outang Complimentary for the Lunatics But says the chronicler Lieutenant Drummond declared that but for their long wings they would look as well on a parade ground as some of the cockney militia A little rough my friend the reader will exclaim for the aforesaid militia Of course it is impossible in a sketch like the present to do more than give a glimpse of this rare combination of astronomical realities and the vagaries of mere fancy and I must omit the Golden fringed Mountains the Vale of the Triads with their splendid triangular temples et cetera but I positively cannot pass by the glowing mention of the inhabitants of this wonderful valley a superior race of Lunatics as beautiful and as happy as angels spread like eagles on the grass eating yellow gourds and red cucumbers and played with by snow white stags with jet black horns The description here is positively delightful and I even now remember my poignant sigh of regret when at the conclusion I read that these innocent and happy beings although evidently creatures of order and subordination and very polite were seen indulging in amusements which would not be deemed within the bounds of strict propriety on this degenerate ball The story wound up rather abruptly by referring the reader to an extended work on the subject by Herschel which has not yet appeared One can laugh very heartily now at all this but nearly everybody the gravest and the wisest too was completely taken in at the time and the Sun then established at the corner of Spruce street where the Tribune office now stands reaped an increase of more than fifty thousand to its circulation in fact there gained the foundation of its subsequent prolonged success Its proprietors sold no less than twenty five thousand dollars worth of the Moon Hoax over the counter even exhausting an edition of sixty thousand in pamphlet form And who was the author A literary gentleman who has devoted very many years of his life to mathematical and astronomical studies and was at the time connected as an editor with the Sun one whose name has since been widely known in literature and politics Richard Adams Locke esquire then in his youth and now in the decline of years mister Locke who still survives is a native of the British Isles and at the time of his first connection with the New York press was the only short hand reporter in this city where he laid the basis of a competency he now enjoys mister Locke declares that his original object in writing the Moon story was to satirize some of the extravagances of Doctor Dick and to make some astronomical suggestions which he felt diffident about offering seriously Whatever may have been his object his hit was unrivaled and for months the press of Christendom but far more in Europe than here teemed with it until Sir John Herschel was actually compelled to come out with a denial over his own signature In the meantime it was printed and published in many languages with superb illustrations mister Endicott the celebrated lithographer some years ago had in his possession a splendid series of engravings of extra folio size got up in Italy in the highest style of art and illustrating the Moon Hoax Here in New York the public were for a long time divided on the subject the vast majority believing and a few grumpy customers rejecting the story One day mister Locke was introduced by a mutual friend at the door of the Sun office to a very grave old orthodox Quaker who in the calmest manner went on to tell him all about the embarkation of Herschel s apparatus at London where he had seen it with his own eyes Of course Locke s optics expanded somewhat while he listened to this remarkable statement but he wisely kept his own counsel The discussions of the press were very rich the Sun of course defending the affair as genuine and others doubting it The Mercantile Advertiser the Albany Daily Advertiser the New York Commercial Advertiser the New York Times the New Yorker the New York Spirit of seventy six the Sunday News the United States Gazette the Philadelphia Inquirer and hosts of other papers came out with the most solemn acceptance and admiration of these wonderful discoveries and were eclipsed in their approval only by the scientific journals abroad The Evening Post however was decidedly skeptical and took up the matter in this irreverent way It is quite proper that the Sun should be the means of shedding so much light on the Moon That there should be winged people in the moon does not strike us as more wonderful than the existence of such a race of beings on the earth and that there does still exist such a race rests on the evidence of that most veracious of voyagers and circumstantial of chroniclers Peter Wilkins whose celebrated work not only gives an account of the general appearance and habits of a most interesting tribe of flying Indians but also of all those more delicate and engaging traits which the author was enabled to discover by reason of the conjugal relations he entered into with one of the females of the winged tribe The moon hoax had its day and some of its glory still survives mister Locke its author is now quietly residing in the beautiful little home of a friend on the Clove Road Staten Island and no doubt as he gazes up at the evening luminary often fancies that he sees a broad grin on the countenance of its only well authenticated tenant the hoary solitary whom the criminal code of the nursery has banished thither for collecting fuel on the Sabbath day CHAPTER XXXIII THE MISCEGENATION HOAX A GREAT LITERARY SELL POLITICAL HUMBUGGING TRICKS OF THE WIRE PULLERS MACHINERY EMPLOYED TO RENDER THE PAMPHLET NOTORIOUS WHO WERE SOLD AND HOW IT WAS DONE Some persons say that all is fair in politics Without agreeing with this doctrine I nevertheless feel that the history of Ancient and Modern Humbugs would not be complete without a record of the last and one of the most successful of known literary hoaxes This is the pamphlet entitled Miscegenation which advocates the blending of the white and black races upon this continent as a result not only inevitable from the freeing of the negro but desirable as a means of creating a more perfect race of men than any now existing This pamphlet is a clever political quiz and was written by three young gentlemen of the World newspaper namely D G Croly George Wakeman and E C Howell The design of Miscegenation was exceedingly ambitious and the machinery employed was probably among the most ingenious and audacious ever put into operation to procure the indorsement of absurd theories and give the subject the widest notoriety The object was to so make use of the prevailing ideas of the extremists of the Anti Slavery party as to induce them to accept doctrines which would be obnoxious to the great mass of the community and which would of course be used in the political canvass which was to ensue It was equally important that the Democrats should be made to believe that the pamphlet in question emanated from a Republican source The idea was suggested by a discourse delivered by mister Theodore Tilton at the Cooper Institute before the American Anti Slavery Society in May eighteen sixty three on the negro in which that distinguished orator argued that in some future time the blood of the negro would form one of the mingled bloods of the great regenerated American nation The scheme once conceived it began immediately to be put into execution The first stumbling block was the name amalgamation by which this fraternizing of the races had been always known It was evident that a book advocating amalgamation would fall still born and hence some new and novel word had to be discovered with the same meaning but not so objectionable Such a word was coined by the combination of the Latin miscere to mix and genus race from these miscegenation a mingling of the races The word is as euphonious as amalgamation and much more correct in meaning It has passed into the language and no future dictionary will be complete without it Next it was necessary to give the book an erudite appearance and arguments from ethnology must form no unimportant part of this matter Neither of the authors being versed in this science they were compelled to depend entirely on encyclopedias and books of reference This obstacle to a New York editor or reporter was not so great as it might seem The public are often favored in our journals with dissertations upon various abstruse matters by men who are entirely ignorant of what they are writing about It was said of Cuvier that he could restore the skeleton of an extinct animal if he were only given one of its teeth and so a competent editor or reporter of a city journal can get up an article of any length on any given subject if he is only furnished one word or name to start with There was but one writer on ethnology distinctly known to the authors which was Prichard but that being secured all the rest came easily enough The authors went to the Astor Library and secured a volume of Prichard s works the perusal of which of course gave them the names of many other authorities which were also consulted and thus a very respectable array of scientific arguments in favor of Miscegenation were soon compiled The sentimental and argumentative portions were quickly suggested from the knowledge of the authors of current politics of the vagaries of some of the more visionary reformers and from their own native wit The book was at first written in a most cursory manner the chapters got up without any order or reference to each other and afterward arranged As the impression sought to be conveyed was a serious one it would clearly not do to commence with the extravagant and absurd theories to which it was intended that the reader should gradually be led The scientific portion of the work was therefore given first and was made as grave and terse and unobjectionable as possible and merely urged by arguments drawn from science and history that the blending of the different races of men resulted in a better progeny As the work progressed they continued to pile on the agony until at the close the very fact that the statue of the Goddess of Liberty on the Capitol is of a bronze tint is looked upon as an omen of the color of the future American When the traveler approaches the City of Magnificent Distances it says the seat of what is destined to be the greatest and most beneficent power on earth the first object that will strike his eye will be the figure of Liberty surmounting the Capitol not white symbolizing but one race nor black typifying another but a statue representing the composite race whose sway will extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean from the Equator to the North Pole the Miscegens of the Future The Book once written plans were laid to obtain the indorsement of the people who were to be humbugged It was not only necessary to humbug the members of the Reform and Progressive party but to present as I have before said such serious arguments that Democrats should be led to believe it as a bona fide revelation of the infernal designs of their antagonists In both respects there was complete success Although of course the mass of the Republican leaders entirely ignored the book yet a considerable number of Anti Slavery men with more transcendental ideas were decidedly sold The machinery employed was exceedingly ingenious Before the book was published proof copies were furnished to every prominent abolitionist in the country and also to prominent spiritual mediums to ladies known to wear Bloomers and to all that portion of our population who are supposed to be a little soft on the subject of reform A circular was also enclosed requesting them before the publication of the book to give the author the benefit of their opinions as to the value of the arguments presented and the desirability of the immediate publication of the work to be inclosed to the American News Company one hundred twenty one Nassau street New York the agents for the publishers The bait took Letters came pouring in from all sides and among the names of prominent persons who gave their indorsements were Albert Brisbane Parker Pillsbury Lucretia Mott Sarah M Grimke Angelina G Weld doctor J McCune Smith Wm Wells Brown mister Pillsbury was quite excited over the book saying Your work has cheered and gladdened a winter morning which I began in cloud and sorrow You are on the right track Pursue it and the good God speed you mister Theodore Tilton upon receiving the pamphlet wrote a note promising to read it and to write the author a long and candid letter as soon as he had time and saying that the subject was one to which he had given much thought The promised letter I believe however was never received probably because on a careful perusal of the book mister Tilton smelt a rat He might also have been influenced by an ironical paragraph relating to himself and arguing that as he was a pure specimen of the blonde and when a young man was noted for his angelic type of feature his sympathy for the colored race was accounted for by the natural love of opposites Says the author with much gravity The sympathy mister Greeley mister Phillips and mister Tilton feel for the negro is the love which the blonde bears for the black it is the love of race a sympathy stronger to them than the love they bear to woman It is founded upon natural law We love our opposites It is the nature of things that we should do so and where Nature has free course men like those we have indicated whether Anti Slavery or Pro Slavery Conservative or Radical Democrat or Republican will marry and be given in marriage to the most perfect specimens of the colored race So far things worked favorably and having thus bagged a goodly number of prominent reformers the next effort was to get the ear of the public Here new machinery was brought into play A statement was published in the Philadelphia Inquirer a paper which ever since the war commenced has been notorious for its sensation news that a charming and accomplished young mulatto girl was about to publish a book on the subject of the blending of the races in which she took the affirmative view Of course so piquant a paragraph was immediately copied by almost every paper in the country Various other stories equally ingenious and equally groundless were set afloat and public expectation was riveted on the forthcoming work Some time in February last the book was published Copies of course were sent to all the leading journals The Anglo African the organ of the colored population of New York warmly and at great length indorsed the doctrine The Anti Slavery Standard edited by mister Oliver Johnson gave over a column of serious argument and endorsement to the work mister Tilton of the Independent was not to be caught napping In that journal under date of February twenty five eighteen sixty four he devoted a two column leader to the subject of Miscegenation and the little pamphlet in question mister Tilton was the first to announce a belief that the book was a hoax I quote from his article Remaining a while on our table unread our attention was specially called to it by noticing how savagely certain newspapers were abusing it The authorship of the pamphlet is a well kept secret at least it is unknown to us Nor after a somewhat careful reading are we convinced that the writer is in earnest Our first impression was and remains that the work was meant as a piece of pleasantry a burlesque upon what are popularly called the extreme and fanatical notions of certain radical men named therein Certainly the essay is not such a one as any of these gentlemen would have written on the subject though some of their speeches are conspicuously quoted and commended in it If written in earnest the work is not thorough enough to be satisfactory if in jest we prefer Sydney Smith or McClellan s Report Still to be frank we agree with a large portion of these pages but disagree heartily with another portion The idea of scientifically undertaking to intermingle existing populations according to a predetermined plan for reconstructing the human race for flattening out its present varieties into one final unvarious dead level of humanity is so absurd that we are more than ever convinced such a statement was not written in earnest mister Tilton however hints that the colored race is finally in some degree to form a component part of the future American and that in time the negro of the South growing paler with every generation will at last completely hide his face under the snow One of the editorial writers for the Tribune was so impressed with the book that he wrote an article on the subject arguing about it with apparent seriousness and in a manner with some readers supposed to be rather favorable than otherwise to the doctrine mister Greeley and the publishers it is understood were displeased at the publication of the article The next morning nearly all the city journals had editorial articles upon the subject The next point was to get the miscegenation controversy into Congress The book with its indorsements was brought to the notice of mister Cox of Ohio commonly called Sunset Cox and he made an earnest speech on the subject mister Washburne replied wittily reading and commenting on extracts from a work by Cox in which the latter deplored the existence of the prejudice against the Africans A few days after mister Kelly of Pennsylvania replied very elaborately to mister Cox bringing all his learning and historical research to bear on the topic It was the subject of a deal of talk in Washington afterward mister Cox was charged by some of the more shrewd members of Congress with writing it It was said that mister Sumner on reading it immediately pronounced it a hoax Through the influence of the authors a person visited James Gordon Bennett of the Herald and spoke to him about Miscegenation mister Bennett thought the idea too monstrous and absurd to waste an article upon But said the gentleman the Democratic papers are all noticing it The Democratic editors are asses said Bennett Senator Cox has just made a speech in Congress on it Cox is an ass responded Bennett Greeley had an article about it the other day Well Greeley s a donkey The Independent yesterday had a leader of a column and a half about it Well Beecher is no better said Bennett They re all asses But what did he say about it Oh he rather indorsed it Well I ll read the article said Bennett And perhaps I ll have an article written ridiculing Beecher It will make a very good handle against the radicals said the other Oh I don t know said Bennett Let them marry together if they want to with all my heart For some days the Herald said nothing about it but the occasion of the departure of a colored regiment from New York City having called forth a flattering address to them from the ladies of the Loyal League the Herald saw a chance to make a point against mister Charles King and others and the next day it contained a terrific article introducing miscegenation in the most violent and offensive manner and saying that the ladies of the Loyal League had offered to marry the colored soldiers on their return After that the Herald kept up a regular fusillade against the supposed miscegenic proclivities of the Republicans And thus after all Bennett swallowed the critter horns hoofs tail and all The authors even had the impudence to attempt to entrap mister Lincoln into an indorsement of the work and asked permission to dedicate a new work on a kindred subject Melaleukation to him Honest Old Abe however who can see a joke was not to be taken in so easily About the time the book was first published Miss Anne E Dickinson happened to lecture in New York The authors here exhibited a great degree of acuteness and tact as well as sublime impudence in seizing the opportunity to have some small hand bills with the endorsement of the book printed and distributed by boys among the audience Before Miss Dickinson appeared therefore the audience were gravely reading the miscegenation handbill and the reporters noticing it coupled the facts in their reports From this it went forth and was widely circulated that Miss Dickinson was the author doctor Mackay the correspondent of the London Times in New York was very decidedly sold and hurled all manner of big words against the doctrine in his letters to The Thunderer and thus the leading paper of Europe was for the hundredth time during the American Rebellion decidedly taken in and done for The Saturday Review perhaps the cleverest and certainly the sauciest of the English hebdomadals also berated the book and its authors in the most pompous language at its command Indeed the Westminster Review seriously refers to the arguments of the book in connection with doctor Broca s pamphlet on Human Hybridity a most profound work Miscegenation was republished in England by Truebner company and very extensive translations from it are still passing the rounds of the French and German papers Thus passes into history one of the most impudent as well as ingenious literary hoaxes of the present day There is probably not a newspaper in the country but has printed much about it and enough of extracts might be collected from various journals upon the subject to fill my whale tank It is needless to say that the book passed through several editions Of course the mass of the intelligent American people rejected the doctrines of the work and looked upon it either as a political dodge or as the ravings of some crazy man but the authors have the satisfaction of knowing that it achieved a notoriety which has hardly been equalled by any mere pamphlet ever published in this country VII GHOSTS AND WITCHCRAFTS CHAPTER XXXIV HAUNTED HOUSES A NIGHT SPENT ALONE WITH A GHOST KIRBY THE ACTOR COLT S PISTOLS VERSUS HOBGOBLINS THE MYSTERY EXPLAINED A great many persons believe more or less in haunted houses In almost every community there is some building that has had a mysterious history This is true in all countries and among all races and nations Indeed it is to this very fact that the ingenious author of the Twenty seventh street Ghost may attribute his success in creating such an excitement In fact I will say under the rose he predicted his hopes of success entirely upon this weakness in human nature Even in this day and age of the world there are hundreds of deserted buildings which are looked upon with awe or terror or superstitious interest They have frightened their former inhabitants away and left the buildings in the almost undisputed possession of real moles bats and owls and imaginary goblins and sprites In the course of my travels in both hemispheres I have been amazed at the great number of such cases that have come under my personal observation But for the present I will give a brief account of a haunted house in Yorkshire England in which some twenty years ago Kirby the actor who formerly played at the Chatham Theatre passed a pretty strange night I met mister Kirby in London in eighteen forty four and I will give in nearly his own language a history of his lone night in this haunted house as he gave it to me within a week after its occurrence I will add that I saw no reason to doubt mister Kirby s veracity and he assured me upon his honor that the statement was literally true to the letter Having myself been through several similar places in the daytime I felt a peculiar interest in the subject and hence I have a vivid recollection of nearly the exact words in which he related his singular nocturnal adventure One thing is certain Kirby was not the man to be afraid of trying such an experiment I had heard wonderful stories about this house said mister Kirby to me and I was very glad to get a chance to enter it although I confess the next morning I was about as glad to get out of it It was an old country seat a solid stone mansion which had long borne the reputation of a haunted house It was watched only by one man He was the old gardener an ancient servant of the family that once lived there and a person in whom the family reposed implicit confidence Having had some inkling of this wonderful place and having a few days to spare before going to London to fulfil an engagement at the Surry Theatre I thought I would probe this haunted house story to the bottom I therefore called on the old gardener who had charge of the place and introduced myself as an American traveller desirous of spending a night with his ghosts The old man seemed to be about seventy five or eighty years of age I met him at the gate of the estate where he kept guard He told me when I applied that it was a dangerous spot to enter but I could pass it if I pleased I should however have to return by the same door if I ever came back again Wishing to make sure of the job I gave him a sovereign and asked him to give me all the privileges of the establishment and if his bill amounted to more I would settle it when I returned He looked at me with an expression of doubt and apprehension as much as to say that he neither understood what I was going to do nor what was likely to happen He merely remarked You can go in Will you go with me and show me the road I will Go ahead We entered The gate closed I suddenly turned on my man the old gardener and custodian of the place and said to him Now my patriarchal friend I am going to sift this humbug to the bottom even if I stay here forty nights in succession and I am prepared to lay all spirits that present themselves but if you will save me all trouble in the matter and frankly explain to me the whole affair I will never mention it to your injury and I will present you with ten golden sovereigns The old fellow looked astonished but he smirked and whimpered and trembled and said I am afraid to do that but I will warn you against going too far When we had crossed a courtyard he rang a bell and several strange noises were distinctly heard I was introduced to the establishment through a well constructed archway which led to a large stairway from which we proceeded to a great door which opened into a very large room It was a library The old custodian had carried a torch and I was prepared with a box of matches He was acting evidently on the square and I sat myself down in the library where he told me that I should soon see positive evidence that this was a haunted house Not being a very firm believer in the doctrine of houses really haunted I proposed to keep a pretty good hold of my match box and lest there should be any doubt about it I had also provided myself with two sperm candles which I kept in my pocket so I should not be left too suddenly and too long in the dark Now Sir said he I wish you to hold all your nerves steady and keep your courage up because I intend to stand by you as well as I can but I never come into this house alone Well what is the matter with the house Oh everything Sir What Well when I was much younger than I am now the master of this estate got frightened here by some mysterious appearances noises sounds et cetera and he preferred to leave the place Why He had a tradition from his grandfather and pretty well kept alive in the family that it was a haunted house and he let out the estate to the smaller farmers of the neighborhood and quit the premises and never returned again except one night and after that one night he left We suppose he is dead Now Sir if you wish to spend the night here as you have requested what may happen to you I don t know but I tell you it is a haunted house and I would not sleep here to night for all the wealth of the Bank of England This did not deter me in the least and having the means of self protection around me and plenty of lucifer matches et cetera I thought I would explore this mystery and see whether a humbug which had terrified the proprietors of that magnificent house in the midst of a magnificent estate for upward of sixty years could not be explored and exploded That it was a humbug I had no doubt that I would find it out I was not so certain I sat down in the library fully determined to spend the night in the establishment A door was opened into an adjoining room where there was a dust covered lounge and every thing promised as much comfort as could be expected under the circumstances However before the old keeper of the house left I asked him to show me over the building and let me explore for myself the different rooms and apartments To all this he readily consented and as he had some prospect before him of making a good job out of it he displayed a great deal of alacrity and moved along very quick and smart for a man apparently eighty years of age I went from room to room and story to story Everything seemed to be well arranged but somewhat dusty and time worn I kept a pretty sharp lookout but I could see no sort of machinery for producing a grand effect We finally descended to the library when I closed the door and bolting and locking it took the key and put it in my pocket Now Sir I said to the keeper where is the humbug There is no humbug here he answered Well why don t you show me some evidence of the haunted house You wait said he till twelve o clock to night and you will see haunting enough for you I will not stay till then He left I staid Everything was quiet for some time Not a mouse was heard not a rat was visible and I thought I would go to sleep I lay down for this purpose but I soon heard certain extraordinary sounds that disturbed my repose Chains were clanked noises were made and shrieks and groans were heard from various parts of the mansion All of these I had expected They did not frighten me much A little while after just as I was going to sleep again a curious string of light burned around the room It ran along on the walls in a zigzag line about six feet high entirely through the apartment I did not smell anything bituminous or like sulphur It flashed quicker than powder and it did not smell like it Thinks I This looks pretty well we will have some amusement now Then the jangling of bells and clanking of chains and flashes of light then thumpings and knockings of all sorts came along interspersed with shrieks and groans I sat very quiet I had two of Colt s best pistols in my pocket and I thought I could shoot anything spiritual or material with these machines made in Connecticut I took them out and laid them on the table One of them suddenly disappeared I did not like that still my nerves were firm for I knew it was all gammon I took the other pistol in my hand and surveyed the room Nobody was there and finally half suspicious that I had gone to sleep and had a dream I woke up with a grasp on my hand which was holding the other pistol This soon made me fully awake I tried to recover my balance and at this moment the candle went out I lit it with one of my lucifers No person was visible but the noises began again and they were infernal I then took one of my sperm candles out and went to unlock the door I attempted to take the key out of my pocket It was not there Suddenly the door opened I saw a man or a somebody about the size of a man standing straight in front of me I pointed one of Colt s revolvers at his head for I thought I saw something human about him and I told him that whether he was ghost or spirit goblin or robber he had better stand steady or I would blow his brains out if he had any And to make sure that he should not escape I got hold of his arm and told him that if he was a ghost he would have a tolerably hard time of it and that if he was a humbug I would let him off if he would tell me the whole story about the trick He saw that he was caught and he earnestly begged me not to fire that American pistol at him I did not but I did not let go of him I brought him into the library and with pistol in hand I put him through a pretty close examination He was clad in mailed armor with breastplate and helmet and a great sword in the style of the Crusaders He promised on condition of saving his life to give me an honest account of the facts In substance they were that he an old family servant and ultimately a gardener in charge of the place had been employed by an enemy of the gentleman who owned the property to render it so uncomfortable that the estate should be sold for much less than its value and that he had got an ingenious machinist and chemist to assist him in arranging such contrivances as would make the house so intolerable that they could not live there A galvanic battery with wires were provided and every device of chemistry and mechanism was resorted to in order to effect this purpose One by one the family left and they had remained away for nearly two generations under the terror of such forms and appearances and sights and sounds as frightened them almost to death And furthermore the old gardener added that he expected his own grand daughter would become the lady of that house when the property should have been neglected so long and the place became so fearful that no one in the neighborhood would undertake to purchase it or to even pass one moment after dark in exploring its horrible mysteries He begged on his knees that I would spare him with his gray hairs since he had so short a time to live He declared that he had been actuated by no other motive than pride and ambition for his child I told the poor old fellow that his secret should be safe with me and should not be made public so long as he lived The old man grasped my hand eagerly and expressed his gratitude in the strongest terms Thus mister Barnum I have given you the pure and honest facts in regard to my adventure in a so called haunted house Don t make it public until you are convinced that the old gardener has shuffled off this mortal coil So much for Kirby s story of the haunted house No doubt the old gardener has before this become in reality a disembodied spirit but that his grand daughter became legally possessed of the estate is not at all probable Real estate does not change hands so easily in England So powerful however is the superstitious belief in haunted houses that it is doubtful whether that property will for many years sustain half so great a cash value in the market as it would have done had it not been considered a haunted house It is to be hoped that as schools multiply and education increases the follies and superstitions which underlie a belief in ghosts and hobgoblins will pass away CHAPTER XXXV HAUNTED HOUSES GHOSTS GHOULS PHANTOMS VAMPIRES CONJURORS DIVINING GOBLINS FORTUNE TELLING MAGIC WITCHES SORCERY OBI DREAMS SIGNS SPIRITUAL MEDIUMS FALSE PROPHETS DEMONOLOGY DEVILTRY GENERALLY Whether superstition is the father of humbug or humbug the mother of superstition as well as its nurse I do not pretend to say for the biggest fools and the greatest philosophers can be numbered among the believers in and victims of the worst humbugs that ever prevailed on the earth As we grow up from childhood and begin to think we are free from all superstitions absurdities follies a belief in dreams signs omens and other similar stuff we afterward learn that experience does not cure the complaint Doubtless much depends upon our bringing up If children are permitted to feast their ears night after night as I was with stories of ghosts hobgoblins ghouls witches apparitions bugaboos it is more difficult in after life for them to rid their minds of impressions thus made But whatever may have been our early education I am convinced that there is an inherent love of the marvelous in every breast and that everybody is more or less superstitious and every superstition I denominate a humbug for it lays the human mind open to any amount of belief in any amount of deception that may be practised One object of these chapters consists in showing how open everybody is to deception that nearly everybody hankers after it that solid and solemn realities are frequently set aside for silly impositions and delusions and that people as a too general thing like to be led into the region of mystery As Hudibras has it Doubtless the pleasure is as great Of being cheated as to cheat As lookers on feel most delight That least perceive a juggler s sleight And still the less they understand The more they admire his sleight of hand The amount or strength of man s brains have little to do with the amount of their superstitions The most learned and the greatest men have been the deepest believers in ingeniously contrived machines for running human reason off the track If any expositions I can make on this subject will serve to put people on their guard against impositions of all sorts as well as foolish superstitions I shall feel a pleasure in reflecting that I have not written in vain The heading of this chapter enumerates the principal kinds of supernatural humbugs These it must be remembered are quite different from religious impostures It is astonishing to reflect how ancient is the date of this class of superstitions as well as of most others in fact and how universally they have prevailed Nearly thirty six hundred years ago it was thought a matter of course that Joseph the Hebrew Prime Minister of Pharaoh should have a silver cup that he commonly used to do his divining with so that the practice must already have been an established one In Homer s time about twenty eight hundred years ago ghosts were believed to appear The Witch of Endor pretended to raise the ghost of Samuel at about the same time To day here in the City of New York dream books are sold by the edition a dozen fortune tellers regularly advertise in the papers a haunted house can gather excited crowds for weeks abundance of people are uneasy if they spill salt dislike to see the new moon over the wrong shoulder and are delighted if they can find an old horse shoe to nail to their door post I have already told about one or two haunted houses but must devote part of this chapter to that division of the subject There are hundreds of such that is of those reputed to be such and have been for hundreds of years In almost every city and in many towns and country places they are to be found I know of one for instance in New Jersey one or two in New York and have heard of several in Connecticut There are great numbers in Europe for as white men have lived there so much longer than in America ghosts naturally accumulated In this country there are houses and places haunted by ghosts of Hessians and Yankee ghosts not to mention the headless Dutch phantom of Tarrytown that turned out to be Brom Bones but who ever heard of the ghost of an Indian And as for the ghost of a black man evidently it would have to appear by daylight You couldn t see it in the dark I have no room to even enumerate the cases of haunted houses One in Aix la Chapelle a fine large house stood empty five years on account of the knockings in it until it was sold for almost nothing and the new owner lucky man discovered that the ghost was a draft through a broken window that banged a loose door An English gentleman once died and his heir in a day or two heard of mysterious knockings which the frightened servants attributed to the defunct He however investigated a little and found that a rat in an old store room was trying to get out of an old fashioned box trap and being able to lift the door only partly it dropped again constituting the ghost Better pleased to find the rat than his father the young man exterminated rat and phantom together A very ancient and impressive specimen of a haunted house was the palace of Vauvert belonging to King Louis IX of France who was so pious that he was called Saint Louis This fine building was so situated as to become very desirable in the year twelve fifty nine to some monks So there was forthwith horrid shriekings at night times red and green lights shone through the windows and finally a large green ghost with a white beard and a serpent s tail came every midnight to a front window and shook his fist and howled at those who passed by Everybody was frightened King Louis good simple soul as well as the rest Then the bold monks appearing at the nick of time intimated that if the King would give them the palace they would do up the ghost in short order He did it and was very thankful to them besides They moved in and sure enough the ghost appeared no more Why should he The ghosts of Woodstock are well known How they tormented the Puritan Commissioners who came thither in sixteen forty nine to break up the place and dispose of it for the benefit of the Commonwealth The poor Puritans had a horrid time A disembodied dog growled under their bed and bit the bed clothes something invisible walked all about the chairs and tables danced something threw the dishes about like the Davenport spirits put logs for the pillows flung brickbats up and down without regard to heads smashed the windows threw pebbles in at the frightened commissioners stuck a lot of pewter platters into their beds ran away with their breeches threw dirty water over them in bed banged them over the head until after several weeks the poor fellows gave it up and ran away back to London Many years afterward it came out that all this was done by their clerk who was secretly a royalist though they thought him a furious Puritan and who knew all the numerous secret passages and contrivances in the old palace Most people have read Sir Walter Scott s capital novel of Woodstock founded on this very story The well known Demon of Tedworth that drummed and scratched and pounded and threw things about in sixteen sixty one in mister Mompesson s house turned out to be a gipsy drummer and confederates The still more famous Ghost in Cock Lane in London in seventeen sixty two consisted of a missus Parsons and her daughter a little girl trained by mister Parsons to knock and scratch very much after the fashion of the alphabet talking of the spirits of to day Parsons got up the whole affair to revenge himself on a mister Kent The ghost pretended to be that of a deceased sister in law of Kent and to have been poisoned by him But Parsons and his assistants were found out and had to smart for their fun being heavily fined imprisoned et cetera A very able ghost indeed a Methodist ghost the spectral property consequently of my good friends the Methodists used to rattle and clatter and bang and communicate in the house of the reverend mister Wesley the father of John Wesley at Epworth in England This ghost was very troublesome and utterly useless In fact none of the ghosts that haunt houses are of the least possible use They plague people but do no good They act like the spirits of departed monkeys I must add two or three short anecdotes about ghosts got up in the devil manner They are not new but illustrate very handsomely the state of mind in which a ghost should be met One is that somebody undertook to scare Cuvier the great naturalist with a ghost having an ox s head Cuvier woke and found the fearful thing glaring and grinning at his bedside What do you want To devour you growled the ghost Devour me quoth the great Frenchman Hoofs horns graminivorous You can t do it clear out And he did clear out A pious maiden lady in one of our New England villages was known to possess three peculiarities First she was a very religious honest matter of fact woman Second she supposed everybody else was equally honest hence she was very credulous always believing everything she heard And third having a conscience void of offense she saw no reason to be afraid of anything consequently she feared nothing On a dark night some boys knowing that she would be returning home alone from prayer meeting through an unfrequented street determined to test two of her peculiarities viz her credulity and her courage One of the boys was sewed up in a huge shaggy bear skin and as the old lady s feet were heard pattering down the street he threw himself directly in her path and commenced making a terrible noise Mercy exclaimed the old lady Who are you I am the devil was the reply Well you are a poor creature responded the antiquated virgin as she stepped aside and passed by the strange animal probably not for a moment doubting it was his Satanic Majesty but certainly not dreaming of being afraid of him It is said that a Yankee tin peddler who had frequently cheated most of the people in the vicinity of a New England village through which he was passing was induced by some of the acute ones to join them in a drinking bout He finally became stone drunk and in that condition these wags carried him to a dark rocky cave near the village then dressing themselves in raw head and bloody bones style awaited his return to consciousness As he began rousing himself they lighted some huge torches and also set fire to some bundles of straw and three or four rolls of brimstone which they had placed in different parts of the cavern The peddler rubbed his eyes and seeing and smelling all these evidences of pandemonium concluded he had died and was now partaking of his final doom But he took it very philosophically for he complacently remarked to himself In hell just as I expected A story is told of a cool old sea captain with a virago of a wife who met one of these artificial devils in a lonely place As the ghost obstructed his path the old fellow remarked If you are not the devil get out If you are come along with me and get supper I married your sister CHAPTER XXXVI MAGICAL HUMBUGS VIRGIL A PICKLED SORCERER CORNELIUS AGRIPPA HIS STUDENTS AND HIS BLACK DOG DOCTOR FAUSTUS HUMBUGGING HORSE JOCKEYS ZIITO AND HIS LARGE SWALLOW SALAMANCA DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST Magic sorcery witchcraft enchantment necromancy conjuring incantation soothsaying divining the black art are all one and the same humbug They show how prone men are to believe in some supernatural power in some beings wiser and stronger than themselves but at the same time how they stop short and find satisfaction in some debasing humbug instead of looking above and beyond it all to God the only being that it is really worth while for man to look up to or beseech Magic and witchcraft are believed in by the vast majority of mankind and by immense numbers even in Christian countries They have always been believed in so far as I know In following up the thread of history we always find conjuring or witch work of some kind just as long as the narrative has space enough to include it Already in the early dawn of time the business was a recognized and long established one And its history is as unbroken from that day down to this as the history of the race In the narrow space at my command at present I shall only gather as many of the more interesting stories about these humbugs as I can make room for Reasoning about the subject or full details of it are at present out of the question A whole library of books exists about it It is a curious fact that throughout the middle ages the Roman poet Virgil was commonly believed to have been a great magician Traditions were recorded by monastic chroniclers about him that he made a brass fly and mounted it over one of the gates of Naples having instilled into this metallic insect such potent magical qualities that as long as it kept guard over the gate no musquitos or flies or cockroach or other troublesome insects could exist in the city What would have become of the celebrated Bug Powder man in those days The story is told about Virgil as well as about Albertus Magnus Roger Bacon and other magicians that he made a brazen head which could prophesy He also made some statues of the gods of the various nations subject to Rome so enchanted that if one of those nations was preparing to rebel the statue of its god rung a bell and pointed a finger toward the nation The same set of stories tells how poor Virgil came to an untimely end in consequence of trying to live forever He had become an old man it appears and wishing to be young again he used some appropriate incantations and prepared a secret cavern In this he caused a confidential disciple to cut him up like a hog and pack him away in a barrel of pickle out of which he was to emerge in his new magic youth after a certain time But by that special bad luck which seems to attend such cases some malapropos traveller somehow made his way into the cavern where he found the magic pork barrel standing silently all alone in the middle of the place and an ever burning lamp illuminating the room and slowly distilling a magic oil upon the salted sorcerer who was cooking below The traveller rudely jarred the barrel the light went out as the torches flared upon it and suddenly there appeared to the eyes of the astounded man close at one side of the barrel a little naked child which ran thrice around the barrel uttering deep curses upon him who had thus destroyed the charm and vanished The frightened traveller made off as fast as he could and poor old Virgil for what I know is in pickle yet Cornelius Agrippa was one of the most celebrated magicians of the middle ages He lived from the year fourteen eighty six six years before the discovery of America until fifteen thirty four and was a native of Cologne Agrippa is said to have had a magic glass in which he showed to his customers such dead or absent persons as they might wish to see Thus he would call up the beautiful Helen of Troy or Cicero in the midst of an oration or to a pining lover the figure of his absent lady as she was employed at the moment a dangerous exhibition For who knows whether the consolation sought by the fair one will always be such as her lover will approve Agrippa they say had an attendant devil in the form of a huge black dog whom on his death bed the magician dismissed with curses The dog ran away plunged into the river Saone and was seen no more We are of course to suppose that his Satanic Majesty got possession of the conjuror s soul however as per agreement There is a story about Agrippa which shows conclusively how a little learning may be a dangerous thing When Agrippa was absent on a short journey his student in magic slipped into the study and began to read spells out of a great book After a little there was a knock at the door but the young man paid no attention to it In another moment there was another louder one which startled him but still he read on In a moment the door opened and in came a fine large devil who angrily asked What do you call me for The frightened youth answered very much like those naughty boys who say I didn t do nothing But it will not do to fool with devils The angry demon caught him by the throat and strangled him Shortly when Agrippa returned lo and behold a strong squad of evil spirits were kicking up their heels and playing tag all over the house and crowding his study particularly full Like a schoolmaster among mischievous boys the great enchanter sent all the little fellows home catechised the big one and finding the situation unpleasant made him reanimate the corpse of the student and walk it about town all the afternoon The malignant demon however was free at sunset and let the corpse drop dead in the middle of the market place The people recognized it found the claw marks and traces of strangling suspected the fact and Agrippa had to abscond very suddenly Another student of Agrippa s came very near an equally bad end The magician was in the habit of enchanting a broomstick into a servant to do his housework and when it was done turning it back to a broomstick again and putting it behind the door This young student had overheard the charm which made the servant and one day in his master s absence wanting a pail of water he said over the incantation and told the servant Bring some water The evil spirit promptly obeyed flew to the river brought a pailful and emptied it instantly brought a second instantly a third and the student startled cried out that s enough But this was not the return charm and the ill tempered demon rejoicing in doing mischief within the letter of his obligation now flew backward and forward like lightning so that he even began to flood the room about the rash student s feet Desperate he seized an axe and hewed this diabolical serving man in two Two serving men jumped up with two water pails grinning in devilish glee and both went to work harder than ever The poor student gave himself up for lost when luckily the master came home dismissed the over officious water carrier with a word and saved the student s life How thoroughly false all these absurd fictions are and yet how ingeniously based on some fact appears by the case of Agrippa s black dog Wierus a writer of good authority and a personal friend of Agrippa s reports that he knew very well all about the dog that it was not a superhuman dog at all but if the term be admissible a mere human dog an animal which he Wierus had often led about by a string and only a domestic pet of Agrippa Another eminent magician of those days was Doctor Faustus about whom Goethe wrote Faust Bailey wrote Festus and whose story mingled of human love and of the devilish tricks of Mephistopheles is known so very widely The truth about Faust seems to be that he was simply a successful juggler of the sixteenth century Yet the wonderful stories about him were very implicitly and extensively believed It was the time of the Protestant Reformation and even Melanchthon and Luther seem to have entirely believed that Faustus could make the forms of the dead appear could carry people invisibly through the air and play all the legendary tricks of the enchanters So strong a hold does humbug often obtain even upon the noblest and clearest and wisest minds Faustus according to the traditions had a pretty keen eye for a joke He once sold a splendid horse to a horse jockey at a fair The fellow shortly rode his fine horse to water When he got into the water lo and behold the horse vanished and the humbugged jockey found himself sitting up to his neck in the river on a straw saddle There is something quite satisfactory in the idea of playing such a trick on one of that sharp generation and Faust felt so comfortable over it that he entered his hotel and went quietly to sleep or pretended to Shortly in came the angry jockey he shouted and bawled but could not awaken the doctor and in his anger he seized his foot and gave it a good pull Foot and leg came off in his hand Faustus screamed out as if in horrible agony and the terrified jockey ran away as fast as he could and never troubled his very loose jointed customer for the money A magician named Ziito resident at the court of Wenceslaus of Bohemia A D thirteen sixty eight to fourteen nineteen appears to great advantage in the annals of these humbugs He was a homely crooked creature with an immense mouth He had a collision once in public on a question of skill with a brother conjuror and becoming a little excited opened his big mouth and swallowed the other magician all to his shoes which as he observed were dirty Then he stepped into a closet got his rival out of him somehow and calmly led him back to the company A story is told about Ziito and some hogs just like that about Faust and the horse In all these stories about magicians their power is derived from the devil It was long believed that the ancient university of Salamanca in Spain founded A D twelve forty was the chief school of magic and had regular professors and classes in it The devil was supposed to be the special patron of this department and he had a curious fee for his trouble which he collected every commencement day The last exercise of the graduating class on that day was to run across a certain cavern under the University The devil was always on hand at this time and had the privilege of grabbing at the last man of the crowd If he caught him as he commonly did the soul of the unhappy student became the property of his captor Hence arose the phrase Devil take the hindmost Sometime it happened that some very brisk fellow was left last by some accident If he were brisk enough to dodge the devil s grab that personage only caught his shadow In this case it was well understood that this particular enchanter never had any shadow afterwards and he always became very eminent in his art CHAPTER XXXVII WITCHCRAFT NEW YORK WITCHES THE WITCH MANIA HOW FAST THEY BURNED THEM THE MODE OF TRIAL WITCHES TO DAY IN EUROPE

not less than six thousand years of existence and eighteen hundred of revelation so many believers in witchcraft still exist among the most civilized nations CHAPTER XXXVIII CHARMS AND INCANTATIONS HOW CATO CURED SPRAINS THE SECRET NAME OF GOD SECRET NAMES OF CITIES ABRACADABRA CURES FOR CRAMP mister WRIGHT S SIGIL WHISKERIFUSTICUS WITCHES HORSES THEIR CURSES HOW TO RAISE THE DEVIL It is worth while to print in plain English for my readers a good selection of the very words which have been believed or are still believed to possess magic power Then any who choose may operate by themselves or may put some bold friend up in a corner and blaze away at him or her until they are wholly satisfied about the power of magic The Roman Cato so famous for his grumness and virtue believed that if he were ill it would much help him and that it would cure sprains in others to say over these words Daries dardaries astaris ista pista sista or as another account has it motas daries dardaries astaries or as still another account says Huat huat huat ista pista sista domiabo damnaustra And sure enough nothing is truer as any physician will tell you that if the old censor only believed hard enough it would almost certainly help him not by the force of the words but by the force of his own ancient Roman imagination Here are some Greek words of no less virtue Aski Kataski Tetrax When the Greek priests let out of their doors those who had been completely initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries they said to them last of all the awful and powerful words Konx ompax If you want to know what the usual result was just say them to somebody and you will see instantly The ancient Hebrews believed that there was a secret name of God usually thought to be inexpressible and only to be represented by a mystic figure kept in the Temple and that if any one could learn it and repeat it he could rule the intelligent and unintelligent creation at his will It is supposed by some that Jehovah is the word which stands for this secret name and some Hebraists think that the word Yahveh is much more nearly the right one The Mohammedans who have received many notions from the Jews believe the same story about the secret name of God and they think it was engraved on Solomon s signet as all readers of the Arabian Nights will very well remember The Jews believed that if you pronounced the word Satan any evil spirit that happened to be by could in consequence instantly pop into you if he wished and possess you as the devils in the New Testament possessed people Some ancient cities had a secret name and it was believed that if their enemies could find this out they could conjure with it so as to destroy such cities Thus the secret name of Rome was Valentia and the word was very carefully kept with the intention that none should know it except one or two of the chief pontiffs mister Borrow in one of his books tells about a charm which a gipsy woman knew and which she used to repeat to herself as a means of obtaining supernatural aid when she happened to want it This was Saboca enrecar maria ereria He induced her after much effort to repeat the words to him but she always wished she had not with an evident conviction that some harm would result He explained to her that they consisted of a very simple phrase but it made no difference An ancient physician named Serenus Sammonicus used to be quite sure of curing fevers by means of what he called Abracadabra which was a sort of inscription to be written on something and worn on the patient s person It was as follows ABRACADABRA BRACADABR RACADAB ACADA CAD A Another gentleman of the same school used to cure sore eyes by hanging round the patient s neck an inscription made up of only two letters A and Z but how he mixed them we unfortunately do not know By the way many of the German peasantry in the more ignorant districts still believe that to write Abracadabra on a slip of paper and keep it with you will protect you from wounds and that if your house is on fire to throw this strip into it will put the fire out Many charms or incantations call on God Christ or some saints just as the heathen ones call on a spirit Here is one for epilepsy that seems to appeal to both religions as if with a queer proviso against any possible mistake about either Taking the epileptic by the hand you whisper in his ear I adjure thee by the sun and the moon and the gospel of to day that thou arise and no more fall to the ground in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost A charm for the cramp found in vogue in some rustic regions is this The devil is tying a knot in my leg Mark Luke and John unloose it I beg Crosses three we make to ease us Two for the thieves and one for Christ Jesus Here is another often used in Ireland which in the same spirit of superstition and ignorant irreverence uses the name of the Savior for a slight human occasion It is to cure the toothache and requires the repeating of the following string of words saint Peter sitting on a marble stone our Savior passing by asked him what was the matter Oh Lord a toothache Stand up Peter and follow me and whoever keeps these words in memory of me shall never be troubled with a toothache Amen The English astrologer Lilly after the death of his wife formerly a missus Wright found in a scarlet bag which she wore under her arm a pure gold sigil or round plate worth about ten dollars in gold which the former husband of the defunct had used to exorcise a spirit that plagued him In case any of my readers can afford bullion enough and would like to drive away any such visitor let them get such a plate and have engraved round the edge of one side Vicit Leo de tribus Judae tetragrammaton cross Inside this engrave a holy lamb Round the edge of the other side engrave Annaphel and three crosses thus cross cross cross and in the middle Sanctus Petrus Alpha et Omega The witches have always had incantations which they have used to make a broom stick into a horse to kill or to sicken animals and persons et cetera Most of these are sufficiently stupid and not half so wonderful as one I know which may be found in a certain mysterious volume called The Girl s Own Book and which as I can depose has often power to tickle children It is this Bandy legged Borachio Mustachio Whiskerifusticus the bald and brave Bombardino of Bagdad helped Abomilique Bluebeard Bashaw of Babelmandel beat down an abominable bumblebee at Balsora But to the other witches Their charms were repeated sometimes in their own language and sometimes in gibberish When the Scotch witches wanted to fly away to their Witches Sabbath they straddled a broom handle a corn stalk a straw or a rush and cried out Horse and hattock in the Devil s name and immediately away they flew forty times as high as the moon if they wished Some English witches in Somersetshire used instead to say Thout tout throughout and about and when they wished to return from their meeting they said Rentum tormentum If this form of the charm does not manufacture a horse not even a saw horse then I recommend another version of it thus Horse and pattock horse and go Horse and pellats ho ho ho German witches said in High Dutch Up and away Hi Up aloft and nowhere stay Scotch witches had modes of working destruction to the persons or property of those to whom they meant evil which were strikingly like the negro obeah or mandinga One of these was to make a hash of the flesh of an unbaptised child with that of dogs and sheep and to put this goodly dish in the house of the victim reciting the following rhyme We put this untill this hame In our Lord the Devil s name The first hands that handle thee Burned and scalded may they be We will destroy houses and hald With the sheep and nolt i e cattle into the fauld And little shall come to the fore i e remain Of all the rest of the little store Another used to destroy the sons of a certain gentleman named Gordon was to make images for the boys of clay and paste and put them in a fire saying We put this water among this meal For long pining and ill heal We put it into the fire To burn them up stock and stour i e stack and band That they be burned with our will Like any stikkle stubble in a kiln In case any lady reader finds herself changed into a hare let her remember how the witch Isobel Gowdie changed herself from hare back to woman It was by repeating Hare hare God send thee care I am in a hare s likeness now But I shall be woman even now Hare hare God send thee care About the year sixteen hundred there was both hanged and burned at Amsterdam a poor demented Dutch girl who alleged that she could make cattle sterile and bewitch pigs and poultry by saying to them Turius und Shurius Inturius I recommend to say this first to an old hen and if found useful it might then be tried on a pig Not far from the same time a woman was executed as a witch at Bamberg having as was often the case been forced by torture to make a confession She said that the devil had given her power to send diseases upon those she hated by saying complimentary things about them as What a strong man what a beautiful woman what a sweet child It is my own impression that this species of cursing may safely be tried where it does not include a falsehood Here are two charms which the German witches used to repeat to raise the devil with in the form of a he goat Lalle Bachea Magotte Baphia Dajam Vagoth Heneche Ammi Nagaz Adomator Raphael Immanuel Christus Tetragrammaton Agra Jod Loi Konig Konig The two last words to be screamed out quickly This second one it must be remembered is to be read backward except the two last words It was supposed to be the strongest of all and was used if the first one failed Anion Lalle Sabolos Sado Poter Aziel Adonai Sado Vagoth Agra Jod Baphra Komm Komm In case the devil staid too long he could be made to take himself off by addressing to him the following statement repeated backward Zellianelle Heotti Bonus Vagotha Plisos sother osech unicus Beelzebub Dax Komm Komm Which would evidently make almost anybody go away A German charm to improve one s finances was perhaps no worse than gambling in gold It ran thus As God be welcomed gentle moon Make thou my money more and soon To get rid of a fever in the German manner go and tie up a bough of a tree saying Twig I bind thee fever now leave me To give your ague to a willow tree tie three knots in a branch of it early in the morning and say Good morning old one I give thee the cold good morning old one and turn and run away as fast as you can without looking back Enough of this nonsense It is pure mummery Yet it is worth while to know exactly what the means were which in ancient times were relied on for such purposes and it is not useless to put this matter on record for just such formulas are believed in now by many people Even in this city there are witches who humbug the more foolish part of the community out of their money by means just as foolish as these VIII ADVENTURERS CHAPTER XXXIX THE PRINCESS CARIBOO OR THE QUEEN OF THE ISLES Bristol was in eighteen twelve the second commercial city of Great Britain having in particular an extensive East India trade Among its inhabitants were merchants reckoned remarkably shrewd and many of them very wealthy and quite a number of aristocratic families who were looked up to with the abject toad eating kind of civility that follows the nobility On the whole Bristol was a very fashionable rich cultivated and intelligent place considering One fine evening in the winter of eighteen twelve thirteen the White Lion hotel a leading inn at Bristol was thrown into a wonderful flutter by the announcement that a very beautiful and fabulously wealthy lady the Princess Cariboo had just arrived by ship from an oriental port Her agent a swarthy and wizened little Asiatic who spoke imperfect English gave this information and ordered the most sumptuous suite of rooms in the house Of course there was great activity in all manner of preparations and the mysterious character of this lovely but high born stranger caused a wonderful flutter of excitement which grew and grew until the fair stranger at length deigned to arrive She came at about ten o clock in great state and with two or three coaches packed with servants and luggage the former of singularly dingy complexion and fantastic vestments and the latter of the most curious forms and material imaginable The eager anticipations of hosts and guests alike were not only fully justified but even exceeded by the rare beauty of the unknown the oriental style and magnificence of her attire and that of her attendants and the enormous bulk of her baggage a circumstance that has no less weight at an English inn than any where else The stranger too was most liberal with her fees to the servants which were always in gold It was quickly discovered that her ladyship spoke not one word of English and even her agent a dark wild queer little fellow got along with it but indifferently preferring all his requests in very broken China indeed The landlord thought it a splendid opportunity to create a long bill and got up rooms and a dinner in flaring style with wax candles a mob of waiters ringing of bells and immense ceremony But the lady like a real princess while well enough pleased and very gracious took all this as a matter of course and preferred her own cook a flat faced pug nosed yellow breeched and almond eyed Oriental with a pigtail dangling from his scalp which was shaved clean excepting at the back of the head This gentleman ran about in the kitchen yard with queer little brass utensils wherein he concocted sundry diabolical preparations as they seemed to the English servants to be of herbs rice curry powder et cetera et cetera for the repast of his mistress For the next three or four days the White Lion was in a state bordering upon frenzy at the singular deportment of the Princess and her numerous attendants The former arrayed herself in the most astonishing combinations of apparel that had ever been seen by the good gossips of Bristol and the latter indulged in gymnastic antics and vocal chantings that almost deafened the neighborhood There was a peculiar nasal ballad in which they were fond of indulging that commenced about midnight and kept up until well nigh morning that drove the neighbors almost beside themselves It sounded like a concert by a committee of infuriated cats and wound up with protracted whining notes commencing in a whimper and then with a sudden jerk bursting into a loud monotonous howl Yet withal these attendants who slept on mats in the rooms adjacent to that of their mistress and fed upon the preparations of her own cuisine were in the main very civil and inoffensive and seemed to look upon the Princess with the utmost awe The agent or secretary or prime minister or whatever he might be called was very mysterious as to the objects purposes history and antecedents of her Highness and the quidnuncs were in despair until one morning the Bristol Mirror then a leading paper came out with a flaring announcement expressing the pleasure it felt in acquainting the public with the fact that a very eminent and interesting foreign personage had arrived from her home in the remotest East to proffer His Majesty George III the unobstructed commerce and friendship of her realm which was as remarkable for its untold wealth as for its marvelous beauty The lady was described as a befitting representative of the loveliness and opulence of this new Golconda and Ophir in one since her matchless wealth and munificence were approached only by her ravishing personal charms The other papers took up the topic and were even more extravagant Felix Farley s Journal gave a long narrative of her wanderings and extraordinary adventures in the uttermost East as gleaned of course from her garrulous agent The island of her chief residence was described as being of vast extent and fertility immensely rich and populous and possessing many rare and beautiful arts unknown to the nations of Europe The princess had become desperately enamored of a certain young Englishman of high rank who had been shipwrecked on her coast but had afterward escaped and as she learned safely reached a port in China and thence departed for Europe The Princess had hereupon set out upon her journeyings over the world in search of him In order to facilitate her enterprise and softened by the deep affection she felt for the son of Albion she had determined to break through the usages of her country and form an alliance with that of her beloved Such were the statements everywhere put in circulation and when the Longbows of the place got full hold of it Gulliver Peter Wilkins and Sinbad the Sailor were completely eclipsed Diamonds as big as hen s eggs and pearls the size of hazelnuts were said to be the commonest buttons and ornaments the Princess wore and her silks and shawls were set beyond all price The announcement of this romantic and mysterious history this boundless wealth this interesting mission from majesty to majesty in person and the reality which every one could see of so much grace and beauty supplied all that was wanting to set the upper tendom of the place in a blaze It was hardly etiquette for a royal visitor to receive much company before having been presented at Court but as this princely lady came from a point so far outside of the pale of Christendom and all its formalities it was deemed not out of place to show her befitting attentions and the ice once broken there was no arresting the flood The aristocracy of Bristol vied with each other in seeing who should be first and most extravagant in their demonstrations The street in front of the White Lion was day after day blocked up with elegant equipages and her reception rooms thronged with fair women and brave men Milliners and mantuamakers pressed upon the lovely and mysterious Princess Cariboo the most exquisite hats dresses and laces just to acquaint her with the fashionable style and solicit her distinguished patronage dry goodsmen sent her rare patterns of their costliest and richest stuffs perfumers their most exquisite toilet cases filled with odors sweet jewellers their most superb sets of gems and florists and visitors nearly suffocated her with the scarcest and most delicate exotics Pictures sketches and engravings oil paintings and portraits on ivory of her rapturous admirers poured in from all sides and her own fine form and features were reproduced by a score of artists Daily she was feted and nightly serenaded until the Princess Cariboo became the furore of the United Kingdom Magnificent entertainments were given her in private mansions and at length to cap the climax mister Worrall the Recorder of Bristol managed by his influence to bring about for her a grand municipal reception in the town hall and people from far and near thronged to it in thousands In the meantime the papers were gravely trying to make out whether the Cariboo country meant some remote portion of Japan or the Island of Borneo or some comparatively unfamiliar archipelago in the remotest East and the Mirror was publishing type expressly cut for the purpose of representing the characters of the language in which the Princess spoke and wrote They were certainly very uncouth and pretended sages who knew very well that there was no one to contradict them declared that they were ancient Coptic Upon reading the sequel of the story one is irresistibly reminded of the ancient Roman inscription discovered by one of Dickens characters which some irreverent rogue subsequently declared to be nothing more nor less than Bil Stumps His Mark All this went on for about a fortnight until the whole town and a good deal of the surrounding country had made complete fools of themselves and only the naughty little boys in the streets held out against the prevailing mania probably because they were not admitted to the sport Their salutations took the form of an inharmonious thoroughfare ballad the chorus of which terminated with Boo hoo hoo And who s the Princess Cariboo yelled out at the top of their voices At length one day the luggage of her Highness was embarked upon a small vessel to be taken round by water to London while she announced through her agent her intention to reach the capital by post coaching Of course the most superb traveling carriages and teams were placed at her disposal but courteously declining all these offers she set out in the night time with a hired establishment attended by her retinue Days and weeks rolled on and yet no announcement came of the arrival of her Highness at London or at any of the intervening cities after the first two or three towns eastward of Bristol Inquiry began to be made and after long and patient but unavailing search it became apparent to divers and sundry dignitaries in the old town that somebody had been very particularly sold The landlord at the White Lion who had accepted the agent s order for Lone thousand on a Calcutta firm in London poor mister Worrall who had been Master of Ceremonies at the town hall affair and had spent large sums of money and the tradespeople and others who sent their finest goods all felt that they had heard something drop The Princess Cariboo had disappeared as mysteriously as she came For years the people of Bristol were unmercifully ridiculed throughout the entire Kingdom on account of this affair and burlesque songs and plays immortalized its incidents for successive seasons One of these insisted that the Princess was no other than an actress of more notoriety than note humbly born in the immediate vicinity of the old city where she practiced this gigantic hoax and that she had been assisted in it by a set of dissolute young noblemen and actors who furnished the money she had spent got up the oriental dresses published the fibs and fomented the excitement At all events the net profit to her and her confederates in the affair must have been some Lten thousand Within a few months and since the first publication of the above paragraphs the English newspapers have recorded the death of the Princess Cariboo who it appears afterward married in her own rank in life and spent a considerable number of years of usefulness in the leech trade an occupation not without a metaphorical likeness to her early and more ambitious exploit CHAPTER XL COUNT CAGLIOSTRO ALIAS JOSEPH BALSAMO

4277-185517-0024	train-other-500	chemistry the hidden properties of numbers astronomy astrology mesmerism clairvoyance and the genuine old fashioned black art but suffice it to say that he travelled through every part of Europe and set it in a blaze with excitement
4277-185517-0025	train-other-500	There were always enough of silly coxcombs
none	none	 young and old of high degree to be allured by the siren smiles of his 
4277-185517-0026	train-other-500	Countess and dupes of both sexes everywhere to swallow his yarns and gape at his juggleries In the course of his rambles he paid a visit to his great brother humbug the Count of saint Germain in Westphalia or Schleswig
none	none	 and it was not long afterward that he began to publish to the world 
4277-185517-0027	train-other-500	his grand discoveries in Alchemy of the Philosopher s Stone and the Elixir of Life or Waters of Perpetual Youth These and many similar wonders were declared to be the result of his investigations under the Arch of Old Egyptian Masonry which degree he claimed to have revived

4277-185517-0028	train-other-500	left by one George Cofton which fell into our quack s hands This degree was to give perfection to human beings by means of moral and physical regeneration Of these two the former was to be secured by means of a Pentagon
4277-185517-0029	train-other-500	which removes original sin and renews pristine innocence The physical kind of regeneration was to be brought about by using the prime matter or philosopher s stone and the Acacia which two ingredients will give immortal youth
4277-185517-0030	train-other-500	In this new structure he assumed the title of the Grand Cophta and actually claimed the worship of his followers declaring that the institution had been established by Enoch and Elias and that he had been summoned by spiritual agencies
4277-185517-0031	train-other-500	to restore it to its pristine glory In fact this pretension which influenced thousands upon thousands of believers was one of the most daring impostures that ever saw the light and it is astounding to think that so late as seventeen eighty
4277-185517-0032	train-other-500	it should for a long time have been entirely successful The preparatory course of exercises for admission to the mystic brotherhood
none	none	 has been described as a series of

none	none	 a mild and genial but feeble man 
4277-185517-0034	train-other-500	became one of Cagliostro s disciples and was bamboozled to his heart s content in fact made to believe that the Count could put the devil into him or take him out as the case might be
4277-185517-0035	train-other-500	The wondrous Water of Beauty that made old wrinkled faces look young smooth and blooming again was the special merchandise of the Countess and was of course
none	none	 in great request among the faded beaux 
4277-185517-0036	train-other-500	and dowagers of the day who were easily persuaded of their own restored loveliness The transmutation of baser metals into gold usually terminated in the transmigration of all the gold his victims had into the Count s own purse
4277-185517-0037	train-other-500	In seventeen seventy six the Count and Countess came to London Here funnily enough they fell into the hands of a gambler a shyster and a female scamp who together tormented them almost to death
4277-185517-0038	train-other-500	because the Count would not pick them out lucky numbers to gamble by They persecuted him fairly into jail and plagued and outswindled him so awfully
none	none	 that after a time the poor Count sneaked back to the Continent 
4277-185517-0039	train-other-500	with only fifty pounds left out of three thousand which he had brought with him One incident of Cagliostro s English experience was the affair of the Arsenical Pigs a notice of which may be found in the Public Advertiser

4277-185517-0041	train-other-500	Cagliostro at length irritated by these repeated attacks published in the Advertiser an open challenge offering to forfeit five thousand guineas if Morande should not be found dead in his bed on the morning after partaking of the flesh of a pig

4277-185517-0043	train-other-500	backed down completely to the great delight of his opponent and his credulous followers
none	none	 Cagliostro and his spouse now resumed their travels upon the Continent 
4277-185517-0044	train-other-500	and by their usual arts and trades in a great measure renewed their fallen fortunes Among other new dodges he now assumed so supernatural a piety that he said he could distinguish an unbeliever by the smell
4277-185517-0045	train-other-500	which of course was just the opposite of the odor of sanctity The Count s claim to have lived for hundreds of years was by some thoroughly believed He ascribed his immortality to his own Elixir and his comparatively youthful appearance

4277-185517-0047	train-other-500	At length in Rome he and the Countess fell into the clutches of the Holy Office and both having been tried for their manifold offences against the Church were found guilty and in spite of their contrition and eager confessions

4277-185517-0049	train-other-500	The portraits of Cagliostro of which a number are extant are pictures of a strong built bull necked fat gross man with a snub nose a vulgar face a look of sensuality and low hypocritical cunning
none	none	 The celebrated story of The Diamond Necklace in which Cagliostro Marie Antoinette the Cardinal de Rohan and others were mixed in such a hodge podge of rascality and folly must form a narrative by itself CHAPTER XLI THE DIAMOND NECKLACE 
4280-185518-0000	train-other-500	In my sketch of Joseph Balsamo alias the Count Alessandro de Cagliostro I referred to the affair of the diamond necklace known in French history
4280-185518-0001	train-other-500	as the Collier de la Reine or Queen s necklace from the manner in which the name and reputation of Marie Antoinette
none	none	 the consort of Louis XVI 
4280-185518-0002	train-other-500	became entangled in it I shall now give a brief account of this celebrated imposition perhaps the boldest and shrewdest ever known
none	none	 and almost wholly the work of a woman On the Quai de la Ferraille not far from the Pont Neuf stood the establishment part shop part manufactory of Messrs Boehmer Bassange 
4280-185518-0004	train-other-500	the most celebrated jewelers of their day After triumphs which had given them world wide fame
none	none	 during the reign of Louis XV 
4280-185518-0005	train-other-500	and made them fabulously rich they determined
none	none	 with the advent of Louis XVI to eclipse all their former efforts 
4280-185518-0006	train-other-500	and crown the professional glory of their lives Their correspondents in every chief jewel market of the world were summoned to aid their enterprise and in the course of some two or three years
4280-185518-0007	train-other-500	they succeeded in collecting the finest and most remarkable diamonds that could be procured in the whole world of commerce The next idea was to combine all these superb fragments in one grand ornament
4280-185518-0008	train-other-500	to grace the form of beauty A necklace was the article fixed upon
none	none	 and the best experience and most delicate taste that Europe could boast 
4280-185518-0009	train-other-500	were expended on the design Each and every diamond was specially set
none	none	 and faced in such manner as to reveal its excellence to the utmost advantage 
4280-185518-0010	train-other-500	and all were arranged together in the style best calculated to harmonize their united effect Form shape
none	none	 and the minutest shades of color were studied 
4280-185518-0011	train-other-500	and the result
none	none	 after many attempts and many failures 
4280-185518-0012	train-other-500	and the anxious labor of many months was the most exquisite triumph that the genius of the lapidary and the goldsmith could conceive
4280-185518-0013	train-other-500	The whole necklace consisted of three triple rows of diamonds or nine rows in all containing eight hundred faultless gems
4280-185518-0014	train-other-500	The triple rows fell away from each in the most graceful and flexible curves over each side of the breast and each shoulder of the wearer the curves starting from the throat
4280-185518-0015	train-other-500	whence a magnificent pendant depending from a single knot of diamonds each as large as a hazel nut hung down half way upon the bosom in the design of a cross and crown
4280-185518-0016	train-other-500	surrounded by the lilies of the royal house the lilies themselves dangling on stems which were strung with smaller jewels Rich clusters and festoons spread from the loop
4280-185518-0017	train-other-500	over each shoulder and the central loop on the back of the neck was joined in a pattern of emblematic magnificence corresponding with that in front It was in seventeen eighty two that this grand work was finally completed
4280-185518-0018	train-other-500	and the happy owners gloated with delight over a monument of skill as matchless in its way as the Pyramids themselves But alas
4280-185518-0019	train-other-500	the necklace might as well have been constructed of the common boulders piled in those same pyramids as of the finest jewels of the mine for all the good it seemed destined to bring the poor jewelers beyond the rapture of beholding it
none	none	 and calling it theirs 
4280-185518-0020	train-other-500	The necklace was worth one million five hundred thousand francs equivalent
none	none	 to more than three hundred thousand dollars in gold as money then went or nearly five hundred thousand dollars in gold now a days 
4280-185518-0021	train-other-500	Rather too large a sum to keep locked up in a casket the reader will confess
none	none	 And then it seems that Messrs Boehmer Bassange 
4280-185518-0022	train-other-500	had not entirely paid for it yet They had ten creditors on the diamonds in different countries and an immense capital still locked up in their other jewelry Of course then after their first delight had subsided
4280-185518-0023	train-other-500	they were most anxious to sell an article that had to be constantly and painfully watched and that might so easily disappear
4280-185518-0024	train-other-500	How many a nimble fingered and stout hearted rogue would not in those days have imperiled a dozen lives to clutch that blazing handful of dross convertible into an Elysium of pomp and pleasure
4280-185518-0025	train-other-500	It would hardly have been a safe noonday plaything in moral Gotham let alone the dissolute Paris of eighty years ago The first thought of course
none	none	 that kindled in the breasts of Boehmer and Bassange 
4280-185518-0026	train-other-500	was that the only proper resting place for their matchless bauble was the snowy neck of the Queen Marie Antoinette then the admired and beloved of all
4280-185518-0027	train-other-500	Her peerless beauty alone could live in the glow of such supernal splendor and the French throne was the only one in Christendom that could sustain such glittering weight Moreover
4280-185518-0028	train-other-500	the Queen had already once been a good customer to the court jewelers for in seventeen seventy four she bought four diamonds of them for seventy five thousand dollars
none	none	 Louis XV 
4280-185518-0029	train-other-500	would not have hesitated to fling it on the shoulders of the Du Barry
none	none	 and Louis XVI in spite of his odd notions upon economy and just administration 
4280-185518-0030	train-other-500	easily listened to the delicate insinuations of his court jewelers and one fine morning laid the necklace in its casket on the table of his Queen Her Majesty
4280-185518-0031	train-other-500	for a moment yielded to the promptings of feminine weakness and danced and laughed with the glee of an overjoyed child in the new sunshine of those burning sparkling dazzling gems
4280-185518-0032	train-other-500	Once and once only she placed it on her neck and breast and probably the world has never before or since seen such a countenance in such a setting
4280-185518-0033	train-other-500	It was almost the head of an angel shining in the glory of the spheres But a better thought prevailed and quickly removing it she with a wave of her beautiful hand declined the gift
4280-185518-0034	train-other-500	and besought the King to apply the sum to any other purpose that would be useful or honorable to France whose finances were sadly straitened
4280-185518-0035	train-other-500	We want ships of war more than we do necklaces said she The King was really delighted at this act of the Queen s and the incident soon becoming widely known
none	none	 gave the latter immense popularity 
4280-185518-0036	train-other-500	for at least twenty four hours after it occurred In fact
none	none	 the amount was really applied to the construction of a grand line of battle ship 
4280-185518-0037	train-other-500	called the Suffren after the great Admiral of that name Boehmer who seems to have been the business manager of the jeweler firm found his necklace as troublesome
4280-185518-0038	train-other-500	as the cobbler did the elephant he won in a raffle and tried so perseveringly to induce the Queen to buy it that he became a real torment She seems to have thought him a little cracked on the subject
4280-185518-0039	train-other-500	and one day when he obtained a private audience he besought her either to buy the necklace or to let him go and drown himself in the Seine Out of all patience
4280-185518-0040	train-other-500	the Queen intimated that he would have been wiser to secure a customer to begin with that she would not buy that if he chose to throw himself into the Seine it would be entirely on his own responsibility
4280-185518-0041	train-other-500	and that as for the necklace he had better pick it to pieces and sell it The poor German
none	none	 for Boehmer was a native of Saxony departed in deep distress but accepted neither his own suggestion nor the Queen s For some months after this the court jewelers busied themselves in peddling their necklace about among the courts of Europe But none of these concerns found it convenient just then to pay out three hundred and sixty thousand dollars for a concatenation of eight hundred diamonds and still the sparkling elephant remained on the jewelers hands 
4280-185518-0042	train-other-500	Time passed on Madame Campan one of the Queen s confidential ladies happened to meet Boehmer one day and the necklace was alluded to What is the state of affairs about the necklace
4280-185518-0043	train-other-500	asked the lady Highly satisfactory replied Boehmer whose serenity of countenance Madame Campan had already remarked I have sold it to the Sultan at Constantinople for his favorite Sultana
4280-185518-0044	train-other-500	This the lady thought rather curious but she was glad the thing was disposed of and said no more Time passed on again In the beginning of August seventeen eighty five Boehmer took the trouble
4280-185518-0045	train-other-500	to call on Madame Campan at her country house somewhat to her surprise Has the Queen given you no message for me he inquired No said the lady What message should she give
4280-185518-0046	train-other-500	An answer to my note said the jeweler Madame remembered a note which the Queen had received from Boehmer a little while before along with some ornaments sent by his hands to her as a present from the King
4280-185518-0047	train-other-500	It congratulated her on having the finest diamonds in Europe
none	none	 and hoped she would remember him 
4280-185518-0048	train-other-500	The Queen could make nothing of it and destroyed it
none	none	 Madame Campan therefore replied There is no answer 
4280-185518-0049	train-other-500	the Queen burned the note She does not even understand what you meant by writing that note This statement very quickly elicited from the now startled German a story which astounded the lady He said the Queen owed him
4280-185518-0050	train-other-500	the first instalment of the money for the diamond necklace that she had bought it after all that the story about the Sultana
none	none	 was a lie told by her directions to hide the fact since the Queen meant to pay by instalments 
4280-185518-0051	train-other-500	and did not wish the purchase known And Boehmer said she had employed the Cardinal de Rohan to buy the necklace for her
none	none	 and it had been delivered to him 
4280-185518-0052	train-other-500	for her and by him to her Now the Queen as Madame Campan knew very well had always strongly disliked this Cardinal he had even been kept from attending at Court in consequence
4280-185518-0053	train-other-500	and she had not so much as spoken to him for years And so Madame Campan told Boehmer and further she told him he had been imposed upon No said the man of sparklers decisively It is you who are deceived
4280-185518-0054	train-other-500	She is decidedly friendly to the cardinal I have myself the documents with her own signature authorizing the transaction for I have had to let the bankers see them in order to get a little time on my own payments
4280-185518-0055	train-other-500	Here was a monstrous mystification for the lady of honor who told Boehmer to instantly go and see his official superior the chief of the king s household She herself being very soon afterwards summoned to the Queen s presence
4280-185518-0056	train-other-500	the affair came up and she told the Queen all she knew about it Marie Antoinette was profoundly distressed by the evident existence of a great scandal and swindle
4280-185518-0057	train-other-500	with which she was plainly to be mixed up through the forged signatures to the documents which Boehmer had been relying on Now for the Cardinal Louis de Rohan
none	none	 a scion of the great house of Rohan one of the proudest of France 
4280-185518-0058	train-other-500	was descended of the blood royal of Brittany was a handsome proud dissolute foolish credulous unprincipled noble now almost fifty years old a thorough rake of large revenues
4280-185518-0059	train-other-500	but deeply in debt He was Peer of France Archbishop of Strasburg Grand Almoner of France Commander of the Order of the Holy Ghost
none	none	 Commendator of the benefice of saint Wast d Arras 
4280-185518-0060	train-other-500	said to be the most wealthy in Europe and a Cardinal He had been ambassador at Vienna a little after Marie Antoinette was married to the Dauphin and while there had taken advantage of his official station to do a tremendous quantity of smuggling
4280-185518-0061	train-other-500	He had also further and most deeply offended the Empress Maria Theresa
none	none	 by outrageous debaucheries 
4280-185518-0062	train-other-500	by gross irreligion and above all by a rather flat but in effect stingingly satirical description of her conduct about the partition of Poland This she never forgave him
4280-185518-0063	train-other-500	neither did her daughter Marie Antoinette and accordingly when he presented himself at Paris soon after she became Queen he received a curt repulse and an intimation
4280-185518-0064	train-other-500	that he had better go to Strasburg Now in those days a sentence of exclusion from Court was to a French noble
none	none	 but just this side of a banishment to Tophet 
4280-185518-0065	train-other-500	and de Rohan was just silly enough to feel this infliction most intensely He went however and from that time onward for year after year lived the life
4280-185518-0066	train-other-500	of a persevering Adam thrust out of his paradise hanging about the gate and trying all possible ways to sneak in again Once for instance
none	none	 he had induced the porter at the palace of the Trianon 
4280-185518-0067	train-other-500	to let him get inside the grounds during an illumination and was recognized by the glow of his cardinal s red stockings from under his cloak But he was only laughed at for his pains the porter was turned off
4280-185518-0068	train-other-500	and the poor silly miserable cardinal remained out in the cold breaking his heart over his exclusion from the most tedious mess of conventionalities that ever was contrived except those of the court of Spain
4280-185518-0069	train-other-500	About seventeen eighty three this great fool fell in with an equally great knave
none	none	 who must be spoken of here 
4280-185518-0070	train-other-500	where he begins to converge along with the rest towards the explosion of the necklace swindle This was Cagliostro who at that time came to Strasburg and created a tremendous excitement
4280-185518-0071	train-other-500	with his fascinating Countess his Egyptian masonry his Spagiric Food a kind of Brandreth s pill of the period which he fed out to poor sick people his elixir of life
4280-185518-0072	train-other-500	and other humbugs The Cardinal sent an intimation that he would like to see the quack The quack whose impudence was far greater than the Cardinal s pride sent back this sublime reply If he is sick let him come to me
4280-185518-0073	train-other-500	and I will cure him If he is well he does not need to see me nor I him This piece of impudence made the fool of a cardinal more eager than ever After some more affected shyness
4280-185518-0074	train-other-500	Cagliostro allowed himself to be seen He was just the man to captivate the Cardinal and they were quickly intimate personal friends practising transmutation alchemy masonry
4280-185518-0075	train-other-500	and still more particularly conducting a great many experiments on the Cardinal s remarkably fine stock of Tokay wine Whatever poor de Rohan had to do he consulted Cagliostro about it and when the latter went to Switzerland
none	none	 his dupe maintained a constant communication with him in cipher 
4280-185518-0076	train-other-500	Lastly is to be mentioned
none	none	 Jeanne de saint Remi Countess de Lamotte de Valois de France the chief scoundrel if the term may be used of a woman 
4280-185518-0077	train-other-500	of the necklace affair She seems to have been really a descendant of the royal house of Valois
none	none	 to which Francis I belonged through an illegitimate son of Henry II 
4280-185518-0078	train-other-500	created Count de saint Remi The family had run down and become poor and rascally one of Jeanne s immediate ancestors having practiced counterfeiting for a living She herself had been protected
none	none	 by a certain kind hearted Countess de Boulainvilliers was receiving a small pension from the Court of about three hundred twenty five dollars a year had married a certain tall soldier named Lamotte 
4280-185518-0079	train-other-500	had come to Paris and was living in poverty in a garret hovering about as it were for a chance to better her circumstances She was a quick witted bright eyed brazen faced hussy not beautiful
4280-185518-0080	train-other-500	but with lively pretty ways and indeed somewhat fascinating Her protectress the countess de Boulainvilliers was now dead while she was alive Jeanne had once visited her at de Rohan s palace of Saverne
4280-185518-0081	train-other-500	and had thus scraped a slight acquaintance with the gay Cardinal which she resumed during her abode at Paris Everybody at Paris knew about the Diamond Necklace and about de Rohan s desire to get into court favor
none	none	 This sharp witted female swindler now came in among the elements I have thus far been describing to frame necklace 
4280-185518-0082	train-other-500	jeweller cardinal queen and swindler all together into her plot just as the key stone drops into an arch and locks it up tight No mortal knows where ideas come from
4280-185518-0083	train-other-500	Suddenly a conception is in the mind whence or how we do not know any more than we know Life The devil himself might have furnished that which now popped into the cunning wicked mind of this adventuress
none	none	 This is what she saw all at once Boehmer is crazy to sell his necklace 
4280-185518-0084	train-other-500	De Rohan is crazy after the Queen s favor I am crazy after money Now if I can make De Rohan think that the Queen wants the necklace and will become his friend in return for his helping her to it if I can make him think
4280-185518-0085	train-other-500	I am her agent to him then I can steal the diamonds in their transit A wonderfully cunning and hardy scheme And most wonderful was the cool keen promptitude with which it was executed The countess began to hint to the cardinal that she was fast getting into the Queen s good graces
4280-185518-0086	train-other-500	by virtue of being a capital gossip and story teller and that she had frequent private audiences Soon she added intimations that the Queen was far from being really so displeased with the cardinal
none	none	 as he supposed At this the old fool bit instantly 
4280-185518-0087	train-other-500	and showed the keenest emotions of hope and delight On a further suggestion he presently drew up a letter or memoir humbly and plaintively stating his case which the countess undertook to put into the Queen s hands
4280-185518-0088	train-other-500	It was the first of over two hundred notes from him
none	none	 notes of abasement 
4280-185518-0089	train-other-500	beseeching argument expostulation and so on all entrusted to Jeanne She burnt them I suppose In order to make her dupe sure that she told the truth about her access to the Queen Jeanne more than once made him go and watch her enter a side gate
4280-185518-0090	train-other-500	into the grounds of the Trianon palace to which she had somehow obtained a key and after waiting he saw her come out again sometimes under the escort of a man who was she said
none	none	 one Desclos a confidential valet of the Queen 
4280-185518-0091	train-other-500	This was Villette de Retaux a pal of Jeanne s and of her husband Lamotte who had by the way become a low class gambler
none	none	 and swindler by occupation Next Jeanne talked about the Queen s charities and on one occasion 
4280-185518-0092	train-other-500	told how much the amiable Marie Antoinette longed to expend certain sums for benevolent purposes if she only had them but she was out of funds and the King was so close about money The poor cardinal bit again
4280-185518-0093	train-other-500	If the Queen would only allow him the honor to furnish the little amount The countess evidently hadn t thought of that She reflected hesitated The cardinal urged She consented it was not much and was so kind as to carry the cash herself
4280-185518-0094	train-other-500	At their next meeting she reported that the Queen was delighted telling a very nice story about it The cardinal would only be too happy to do so again And sure enough he did and quite a number of times too contributing in all to the funds
4280-185518-0095	train-other-500	of the countess in this manner about twenty five thousand dollars Well after a time the cardinal is at Strasburg when he receives a note from the countess that brings him back again as quick as post horses can carry him
4280-185518-0096	train-other-500	It says that there is something very important very secret very delicate that the queen wants his help about He is overflowing with zeal What is it Only let him know his life his purse his soul
4280-185518-0097	train-other-500	are at the service of his liege lady His purse is all that is needed With infinite shyness and circumspection the countess gradually half unwillingly lets him find out that it is the diamond necklace
4280-185518-0098	train-other-500	that the Queen wants By diabolical ingenuities of talk she leads de Rohan to the full conviction that if he secures the Queen that necklace he will thenceforward bask in all the sunshine of court favor
4280-185518-0099	train-other-500	that she can show or control And at proper times sundry notes from the Queen are bestowed upon the enraptured noodle These are written in imitation of the Queen s handwriting
none	none	 by that Villette de Retaux 
4280-185518-0100	train-other-500	who personated the Queen s valet and who was an expert at counterfeiting
none	none	 A last and sublime summit of impudent pretension is reached by a secret interview which the Queen says the countess 
4280-185518-0101	train-other-500	desires to grant to her beloved servant the cardinal This suggestion was rendered practicable
none	none	 by one of those mere coincidences 
4280-185518-0102	train-other-500	which are found though rarely in history and which are too improbable to put into a novel the casual discovery of a young woman of loose character who looked much like the Queen Whether her name was
none	none	 d Essigny or Gay d Oliva is uncertain she is usually called by the latter She was hired and taught 
4280-185518-0103	train-other-500	and with immense precautions this ostrich of a cardinal was one night introduced into the gardens of the Trianon and shown a little nook among the thickets where a stately female in the similitude of the Queen received him with soft spoken words
4280-185518-0104	train-other-500	of kindly greeting allowed him to kneel and kiss a fair and shapely hand and showed no particular timidity of any kind Yet the interview had scarcely more than begun before steps were heard Some one is coming exclaimed the lady
4280-185518-0105	train-other-500	it is Monsieur and Madame d Artois We must part There she gave him a red rose You know what that means Farewell And away they went Mademoiselle d Oliva to report to her employers and the cardinal
4280-185518-0106	train-other-500	in a seventh heaven of ineffable tomfoolery to his hotel But the interview and the lovely little notes that came sometimes fixed the necklace business And if further encouragement had been needed Cagliostro gave it
none	none	 For the cardinal now consulted him 
4280-185518-0107	train-other-500	about the future of the affair having indeed kept him fully informed about it for a long time as he did of all matters of interest So the quack set up his tabernacles of mummery in a parlor of the cardinal s hotel
4280-185518-0108	train-other-500	and conducted an Egyptian Invocation there all night long in solitude and pomp and in the morning he decreed in substance go ahead
none	none	 And the cardinal did so Boehmer and Bassange 
4280-185518-0109	train-other-500	were only too happy to bargain with the great and wealthy church and state dignitary A memorandum of terms and time of payment was drawn up and was submitted to the Queen That is
4280-185518-0110	train-other-500	swindling Jeanne carried it off and brought it back with an entry made by Villette de Retaux in the margin thus Bon bon Approuve
none	none	 Marie Antoinette de France 
4280-185518-0111	train-other-500	That is Good good I approve Marie Antoinette de France The payment was to be by instalments at six months and quarterly afterwards the Queen to furnish the money to the cardinal
4280-185518-0112	train-other-500	while he remained ostensibly holden to the jewellers she thus keeping out of sight So the jewels were handed over to the cardinal de Rohan he took them one evening in great state to the lodgings of the countess where with all imaginable formality
4280-185518-0113	train-other-500	there came a knock at the door and when it was open a tall valet entered who said solemnly On the part of the Queen De Rohan knew it was the Queen s confidential valet for he saw with his own eyes that it was the same man
4280-185518-0114	train-other-500	who had escorted the countess from the side gate at the Trianon And so it was to wit Villette de Retaux who calmly receiving the fifteen hundred thousand franc treasure marched but as solemnly as he had come in
none	none	 As that counterfeiting rascal goes out of the door the diamond necklace itself disappears from our knowledge 
4280-185518-0115	train-other-500	The swindle was consummated but there is no whisper of the disposition of the spoils Villette and Jeanne s husband Lamotte went to London and Amsterdam and had some money there
4280-185518-0116	train-other-500	but seemingly no more than the previous pillages upon the cardinal might have supplied nor did the countess subsequent expenditures show that she had any of the proceeds But that is not the last of the rest of the parties to the affair by any means
none	none	 Between this scene and the time when the anxious Boehmer 
4280-185518-0117	train-other-500	having a little bill to meet beset Madame Campan about his letter and the money the Queen was to pay him there intervened six months During that time countess Jeanne was smoothing as well as she could with endless lies and contrivances
4280-185518-0118	train-other-500	the troubles of the perplexed cardinal who couldn t seem to see that he was much better off in spite of his loyal performance of his part of the bargain But this application by Boehmer
none	none	 and the enormous swindle which it was instantly evident 
4280-185518-0119	train-other-500	had been perpetrated on somebody or other of course waked up a commotion at once The baron de Breteuil a deadly enemy of de Rohan got hold of it all and in his overpowering eagerness to ruin his foe
4280-185518-0120	train-other-500	quickly rendered the matter so public that it was out of the question to hush it up It seems probable that Jeanne de Lamotte expected that the business would be kept quiet for the sake of the Queen and that thus any very severe or public punishments
4280-185518-0121	train-other-500	would be avoided and perhaps no inquiries made
none	none	 It is clear that this would have been the best plan 
4280-185518-0122	train-other-500	but de Breteuil s officiousness prevented it and there was nothing for it but legal measures
none	none	 De Rohan was arrested and put in the Bastile 
4280-185518-0123	train-other-500	having barely been able to send a message in German to his hotel to a trusty secretary who instantly destroyed all the papers relating to the affair Jeanne was also imprisoned
none	none	 and Miss Gay d Oliva and Villette de Retaux 
4280-185518-0124	train-other-500	being caught at Brussels and Amsterdam were in like manner secured As for Cagliostro he was also imprisoned some accounts saying that he ostentatiously
4280-185518-0125	train-other-500	gave himself up for trial This was a public trial before the Parliament of Paris with much form
none	none	 The result was that the cardinal appearing to be only fool not knave 
4280-185518-0126	train-other-500	was acquitted Gay d Oliva appeared to have known nothing except that she was to play a part and she had been told that the Queen wanted her to do so so she was let go Villette was banished for life Lamotte
none	none	 the countess husband 
4280-185518-0127	train-other-500	had escaped to England and was condemned to the galleys in his absence which didn t hurt him much Cagliostro was acquitted But Jeanne was sentenced to be whipped branded on the shoulder with the letter V
none	none	 for Voleuse thief 
4280-185518-0128	train-other-500	and banished This sentence was executed in full but with great difficulty for the woman turned perfectly furious on the public scaffold flew at the hangman like a tiger bit pieces out of his hands shrieked
4280-185518-0129	train-other-500	cursed rolled on the floor kicked squirmed and jumped until they held her by brute force tore down her dress and the red hot iron going aside as she struggled
4280-185518-0130	train-other-500	plunged full into her snowy white breast planting there indelibly the horrible black V while she yelled like a fiend under the torment of the smoking brand She fled away to England
4280-185518-0131	train-other-500	lived there some time in dissolute courses and is said to have died in consequence of falling out of a window when drunk or as another account states
4280-185518-0132	train-other-500	of being flung out by the companions of her orgy whom she had stung to fury by her frightful scolding Before her death she put forth one or two memoirs false scandalous things
4280-185518-0133	train-other-500	The unfortunate Queen never entirely escaped some shadow of disrepute from the necklace business For to the very last both on the trial and afterwards Jeanne de Lamotte impudently stuck to it
4280-185518-0134	train-other-500	that at least the Queen had known about the trick played on the Cardinal at the Trianon and had in fact been hidden close by and saw and laughed heartily at the whole interview So sore and morbid was the condition of the public mind in France in those days
none	none	 when symptoms of the coming Revolution were breaking out on every side that this odious story found many and willing believers CHAPTER LXII THE COUNT DE saint GERMAIN SAGE PROPHET AND MAGICIAN 
4277-185519-0000	train-other-500	Superior to Cagliostro even in accomplishments and second to him in notoriety only was that human nondescript the so called Count de saint Germain whom Fredrick the Great called a man no one has ever been able to make out
none	none	 The Marquis de Crequy declares that saint Germain was an Alsatian Jew 
4277-185519-0001	train-other-500	Simon Wolff by name and born at Strasburg about the close of the seventeenth
none	none	 or the beginning of the eighteenth century others insist that he was a Spanish Jesuit named Aymar 
4277-185519-0002	train-other-500	and others again intimate that his true title was the Marquis de Betmar
none	none	 and that he was a native of Portugal 
4277-185519-0003	train-other-500	The most plausible theory however makes him the natural son of an Italian princess and fixes his birth at San Germano in Savoy about the year seventeen ten his ostensible father being one Rotondo a tax collector of that district
4277-185519-0004	train-other-500	This supposition is borne out by the fact that he spoke all his many languages with an Italian accent It was about the year seventeen fifty that he first began to be heard of in Europe as the Count saint Germain
4277-185519-0005	train-other-500	and put forth the astounding pretensions that soon gave him celebrity over the whole continent
none	none	 The celebrated Marquis de Belleisle made his acquaintance about that time in Germany and brought him to Paris where he was introduced to Madame de Pompadour 
4277-185519-0006	train-other-500	whose favor he very quickly gained The influence of that famous beauty
none	none	 was just then paramount with Louis XV and the Count was soon one of the most eminent men at court 
4277-185519-0007	train-other-500	He was remarkably handsome as an old portrait at Friersdorf in Saxony in the rooms he once occupied sufficiently indicated and his musical accomplishments added to the ineffable charm of his manners and conversation and the miracles he performed
4277-185519-0008	train-other-500	rendered him an irresistible attraction especially to the ladies
none	none	 who appear to have almost idolized him Endowed with an enchanting voice 
4277-185519-0009	train-other-500	he could also play every instrument then in vogue but especially excelled upon the violin which he could handle in such a manner as to give it the effect of a small orchestra Cotemporary writers declare that
none	none	 in his more ordinary performances a connoisseur could distinctly hear the separate tones of a full quartet 
4277-185519-0010	train-other-500	when the count was extemporizing on his favorite Cremona
none	none	 His little work entitled La Musique Raisonnee 
4277-185519-0011	train-other-500	published in England for private circulation only bears testimony to his musical genius and to the wondrous eccentricity as well as beauty of his conceptions But it was in alectromancy or divination by signs and circles
4277-185519-0012	train-other-500	hydromancy or divination by water cleidomancy or divination by the key and dactylomancy or divination by the fingers that the count chiefly excelled although he at the same time professed alchemy astrology
4277-185519-0013	train-other-500	and prophecy in the higher branches The fortunes of the Count saint Germain rose so rapidly in France that in seventeen sixty
none	none	 he was sent by Louis XV to the Court of England to assist in negotiations for a peace M de Choiseul then Prime Minister of France however 
4277-185519-0014	train-other-500	greatly feared and detested the Count and secretly wrote to Pitt begging the latter to have that personage arrested
none	none	 as he was certainly a Russian spy But saint Germain through his attendant sprites of course 
4277-185519-0015	train-other-500	received timely warning and escaped to the Continent In England he was the inseparable friend of Prince Lobkowitz a circumstance that gave some color to his alleged connection with the Russians
4277-185519-0016	train-other-500	His sojourn there was equally distinguished by his devotion to the ladies and his unwavering success at the gaming table where he won fabulous sums
4277-185519-0017	train-other-500	which were afterward dispensed with imperial munificence It was there too that he put forward his claims to the highest rank in Masonry and of course added thereby immensely to the eclat of his position
4277-185519-0018	train-other-500	He spoke English French Spanish Portuguese Italian German Russian Polish the Scandinavian and many of the Oriental tongues with equal fluency
none	none	 and pretended to have traveled over the whole earth and even to have visited the most distant starry orbs frequently 
4277-185519-0019	train-other-500	in the course of a lifetime which with continual transmigrations he declared to have lasted for thousands of years His birth he said had been in Chaldea in the dawn of time and that he was the sole inheritor of the lost sciences and mysteries
4277-185519-0020	train-other-500	of his own and the Egyptian race He spoke of his personal intimacy with all the twelve Apostles and even the august presence of the Savior and one of his pretensions would have been most singularly amusing had it not bordered upon profanity
none	none	 This was no less an assertion than that he had upon several occasions 
4277-185519-0021	train-other-500	remonstrated with the Apostle Peter upon the irritability of his temperament In regard to later periods of history he spoke with the careless ease of an every day looker on
4277-185519-0022	train-other-500	and told anecdotes that the researches of scholars afterwards fully verified His predictions were indeed
none	none	 most startling and the cotemporaneous evidence is very strong and explicit that he did foretell the time place and manner of the death of Louis XV several years before it occurred 
4277-185519-0023	train-other-500	His gift of memory was perfectly amazing Having once read a journal of the day he could repeat its contents accurately from beginning to end
none	none	 and to this endowment he united the faculty of writing with both hands 
4277-185519-0024	train-other-500	in characters like copperplate Thus he could indite a love letter with his right while he composed a verse with his left hand and apparently with the utmost facility a splendid acquisition for the Treasury Department
none	none	 or a literary newspaper 
4277-185519-0025	train-other-500	He would however have been ineligible for any faithful Post Office since he read the contents of sealed letters at a glance and by his clairvoyant powers detected crime or in fact the movements of men and the phenomena of nature at any distance
4277-185519-0026	train-other-500	Like all the great Magi and Brothers of the Rosy Cross of whom he claimed to be a shining light he most excelled in medicine and along with remedies for every ill that flesh is heir to boasted his Aqua Benedetta
4277-185519-0027	train-other-500	as the genuine elixir of life capable of restoring youth to age beauty and strength to decay and brilliant intellect to the exhausted brain and if properly applied protracting human existence through countless centuries
4277-185519-0028	train-other-500	As a proof of its virtues he pointed to his own youthful appearance and the testimony of old men who had seen him sixty or seventy years earlier and who declared that time had made no impression on him
4277-185519-0029	train-other-500	Strangely enough the Margrave of Anspach of whom I shall presently speak purchased what purported to be the recipe of the Aqua Benedetta from John Dyke the English Consul at Leghorn towards the close of the last century
none	none	 and copies of it are still preserved with religious care 
4277-185519-0030	train-other-500	and the utmost secrecy by certain noble families in Berlin and Vienna where the preparation has been used as they believe with perfect success against a host of diseases Still another peculiarity of the Count
4277-185519-0031	train-other-500	would be highly advantageous to any of us particularly at this period of high prices and culinary scarcity He never ate nor drank or at least he was never seen to do so It is said that boarding house regime in these days
4277-185519-0032	train-other-500	is rapidly accustoming a considerable class of our fellow citizens
none	none	 to a similar condition 
4277-185519-0033	train-other-500	but I can scarcely believe it Again the Count would fall into cataleptic swoons which continued often for hours and even days and during these periods he declared that he visited in spirit
4277-185519-0034	train-other-500	the most remote regions of the earth and even the farthest stars and would relate with astonishing power the scenes he there had witnessed He of course
4277-185519-0035	train-other-500	laid claim to the transmutation of baser metals into gold and stated that in seventeen fifty five while on a visit to India to consult the erudition of the Hindoo Brahmins he solved by their assistance the problem of the artificial crystallization of pure carbon
4277-185519-0036	train-other-500	or in other words the production of diamonds One thing is certain viz that upon a visit to the French ambassador to the Hague in seventeen eighty he in the presence of that functionary induced him to believe and testify
4277-185519-0037	train-other-500	that he broke to pieces with a hammer a superb diamond of his own manufacture the exact counterpart of another of similar origin
none	none	 which he had just sold for five thousand five hundred louis d or 
4277-185519-0038	train-other-500	His career and transformations on the Continent were multiform In seventeen sixty two he was mixed up with the dynastic conspiracies and changes at saint Petersburg
4277-185519-0039	train-other-500	and his importance there was indicated ten years later by the reception given to him at Vienna by the Russian Count Orloff who accosted him joyously as caro padre dear father and gave him twenty thousand golden Venetian sequins
4277-185519-0040	train-other-500	From Petersburg he went to Berlin where he at once attracted the attention of Frederick the Great who questioned Voltaire about him the latter replying as it is said that he was a man who knew all things
4277-185519-0041	train-other-500	and would live to the end of the world a fair statement in brief of the position assumed by more than one of our ward politicians In seventeen seventy four he took up his abode at Schwabach
none	none	 in Germany under the name of Count Tzarogy 
4277-185519-0042	train-other-500	which is a transposition of Ragotzy a well known noble name The Margrave of Anspach met him at the house of his favorite Clairon the actress and became so fond of him
none	none	 that he insisted upon his company to Italy 
4277-185519-0043	train-other-500	On his return he went to Dresden Leipzig and Hamburg and finally to Eckernfiorde in Schleswig where he took up his residence with the Landgrave Karl of Hesse and at length in seventeen eighty three tired as he said of life
4277-185519-0044	train-other-500	and disdaining any longer immortality he gave up the ghost It was during saint Germain s residence in Schleswig
none	none	 that he was visited by the renowned Cagliostro 
4277-185519-0045	train-other-500	who openly acknowledged him as master and learned many of his most precious secrets from him among others the faculty of discriminating the character by the handwriting and of fascinating birds animals and reptiles
none	none	 To trace the wanderings of saint Germain is a difficult task as he had innumerable aliases 
4277-185519-0046	train-other-500	and often totally disappeared for months together In Venice he was known as the Count de Bellamare at Pisa as the Chevalier de Schoening at Milan as the Chevalier Welldone at Genoa as the Count Soltikow et cetera
none	none	 In all these journeys his own personal tastes were quiet and simple and he manifested more attachment for a pocket copy of Guarini s Pastor Fido his only library than for any other object in his possession On the whole the Count de saint Germain was a man of magnificent attainments but the use he made of his talents proved him to be also a most magnificent humbug CHAPTER XLIII RIZA BEY THE PERSIAN ENVOY TO LOUIS XIV The most gorgeous and with one sole exception the most glorious reign that France has known so far as military success is concerned was that of Louis XIV the Grand Monarque His was the age of lavish expenditure of magnificent structures grand festivals superb dress and equipage aristocratic arrogance brilliant campaigns and great victories It was moreover particularly distinguished for the number and high character of the various special embassies sent to the court of France by foreign powers Among these Spain the Netherlands Great Britain and Venice rivaled each other in extravagant display and pomp The singular and really tangible imposture I am about to describe practiced at such a period and on such a man as Louis of France was indeed a bold and dashing affair L Etat c est moi I am the State was Louis celebrated and very significant motto for in his own hands he had really concentrated all the powers of the realm and woe to him who trifled with a majesty so real and so imperial However notwithstanding all this imposing strength this mighty domineering will and this keen intelligence a man was found bold enough to brave them all in the arena of pure humbug It was toward the close of the year sixteen sixty seven when Louis in the plenitude of military success returned from his campaign in Flanders where his invincible troops had proven too much for the broad breeched but gallant Dutchmen In the short space of three months he had added whole provinces including some forty or fifty cities and towns to his dominions and his fame was ringing throughout Christendom It had even penetrated to the farthest East and the King of Siam sent a costly embassy from his remote kingdom to offer his congratulations and fraternal greeting to the most eminent potentate of Europe Louis had already removed the pageantries of his royal household to his magnificent new palace of Versailles on which the wealth of conquered kingdoms had been lavished and there in the Great Hall of Mirrors received the homage of his own nobles and the ambassadors of foreign powers The utmost splendor of which human life was susceptible seemed so common and familiar in those days that the train was dazzling indeed that could excite any very particular attention What would have seemed stupendous elsewhere was only in conformity with all the rest of the scene at Versailles But at length there came something that made even the pampered courtiers of the new Babylon stare a Persian embassy Yes a genuine actual living envoy from that wonderful Empire in the East which in her time had ruled the whole Oriental world and still retained almost fabulous wealth and splendor It was announced formally one morning to Louis that His Most Serene Excellency Riza Bey with an interminable tail of titles hangers on and equipages had reached the port of Marseilles having journeyed by way of Trebizond and Constantinople to lay before the great King of the Franks brotherly congratulations and gorgeous presents from his own illustrious master the Shah of Persia This was something entirely to the taste of the vain French ruler whom unlimited good fortune had inflated beyond all reasonable proportions He firmly believed that he was by far the greatest man who had ever lived and had an embassy from the moon or the planet Jupiter been announced to him would have deemed it not only natural enough but absolutely due to his preeminence above all other human beings Nevertheless he was secretly immensely pleased with the Persian demonstration and gave orders that no expense should be spared in giving the strangers a reception worthy of himself and France It would be needless for me to detail the events of the progress of Riza Bey from Marseilles to Paris by way of Avignon and Lyons It was certainly in keeping with the pretensions of the Ambassador From town to town the progress was a continued ovation Triumphal arches bonfires chimes of bells and hurrahing crowds in their best bibs and tuckers military parades and civic ceremonies everywhere awaited the children of the farthest East who were stared at shouted at and by some wretched cynics sneered and laughed at to their hearts content All modern glory very largely consists in being nearly stunned with every species of noise choked with dust and dragged about through the streets until you are well nigh dead Witness the Japanese Embassy and their visit to this country where in some cases the poor creatures after hours of unmitigated boring with all sorts of mummery actually had their pigtails pulled by Young America in the rear and as at the windows of Willard s Hotel in Washington were stirred up with long canes like the Polar Bear or the Learned Seal Still Riza Bey and his dozen or two of dusky companions did not by any means cut so splendid a figure as had been expected They had with them some camels antelopes bulbuls and monkeys like any travelling caravan and were dressed in the most outrageous and outlandish attire They jabbered too a gibberish utterly incomprehensible to the crowd and did everything that had never been seen or done before All this however delighted the populace Had they been similarly transmogrified or played such queer pranks themselves it would only have been food for mockery but the foreign air and fame of the thing made it all wonderful and as the chief rogue in the plot had foreseen blinded the popular eye and made his embassy a complete success At length after some four weeks of slow progress the Persians arrived at Paris where they were received as had been expected with tremendous eclat They entered by Barriere du Trone so styled because it was there that Louis Quatorze himself had been received upon a temporary throne set up with splendid decorations and triumphal arches in the open air when he returned from his Flanders campaign Riza Bey was upon this occasion a little more splendid than he had been on his way from the sea coast and really loomed up in startling style in his tall black rimless hat of wool shaped precisely like an elongated flower pot and his silk robes dangling to his heels and covered with huge painted figures and bright metal decorations of every shape and size unknown to European man millinery A circlet or collar apparently of gold set with precious stones California diamonds surrounded his neck and monstrous glittering rings covered all the fingers and even the thumbs of both his hands His train consisting of sword cup and pipe bearers doctors chief cooks and bottle washers cork extractors and chiropodists literally so for it seems that sharing the common lot of humanity great men have corns even in Persia were similarly arrayed as to fashion but less stupendously in jewelry Well after the throng had scampered crowded and shouted themselves hoarse and had straggled to their homes sufficiently tired and pocket picked the Ambassador and his suite were lodged in sumptuous apartments in the old royal residence of the Tuileries under the care and charge of King Louis own assistant Major Domo and a guard of courtiers and regiments of Royal Swiss Banqueting and music filled up the first evening and upon the ensuing day His Majesty who thus did his visitors especial honor sent the Duc de Richelieu the most polished courtier and diplomatist in France to announce that he would graciously receive them on the third evening at Versailles Meanwhile the most extensive preparations were made for the grand audience thus accorded and when the appointed occasion had arrived the entire Gallery of Mirrors with all the adjacent spaces and corridors were crowded with the beauty the chivalry the wit taste and intellect of France at that dazzling period The gallery which is three hundred and eighty feet in length by fifty in height derives its name from the priceless mirrors which adorn its walls reaching from floor to ceiling opposite the long row of equally tall and richly mullioned windows that look into the great court and gardens These windows hung with the costliest silk curtains and adorned with superb historical statuary give to the hall a light and aerial appearance indescribably enchanting while the mirrors reflect in ten thousand variations the hall itself and its moving pageantry rendering both apparently interminable Huge marble vases filled with odorous exotics lined the stairways and twelve thousand wax lights in gilded brackets and chandeliers of the richest workmanship shone upon three thousand titled heads Louis the Great himself never appeared to finer advantage His truly royal countenance was lighted up with pride and satisfaction as the Envoy of the haughty Oriental king approached the splendid throne on which he sat and as he descended a step to meet him and stood there in his magnificent robes of state the Persian envoy bent the knee and with uncovered head presented the credentials of his mission Of the crowd that immediately surrounded the throne it is something to say that the Grand Colbert the famous Minister and the Admiral Duquesne were by no means the most eminent nor the lovely Duchess of Orleans and her companion the bewitching Mademoiselle de Kerouaille who afterward changed the policy of Charles II of England by no means the most beautiful personages in the galaxy A grand ball and supper concluded this night of splendor and Riza Bey was fairly launched at the French court every member of which to please the King tried to outvie his compeers in the assiduity of his attentions and the value of the books pictures gems equipages arms c which they heaped upon the illustrious Persian The latter gentleman very quietly smoked his pipe and lounged on his divan before company and diligently packed up the goods when he and his jolly companions were left alone The presents of the Shah had not yet arrived but were daily expected via Marseilles and from time to time the olive colored suite was diminished by the departure of one of the number with his chest on a special mission so stated to England Austria Portugal Spain and other European powers In the meantime the Bey was feted in all directions with every species of entertainment and it was whispered that the fair ones of that dissolute court were from the first eager in the bestowal of their smiles The King favored his Persian pet with numerous personal interviews at which in broken French the Envoy unfolded the most imposing schemes of Oriental conquest and commerce that his master was cordially willing to share with his great brother of France At one of these chatty tete a tetes the munificent Riza Bey upon whom the King had already conferred his own portrait set in diamonds and other gifts worth several millions of francs placed in the Royal hand several superb fragments of opal and turquoise said to have been found in a district of country bordering on the Caspian sea which teemed with limitless treasures of the same kind and which the Shah of Persia proposed to divide with France for the honor of her alliance The king was enchanted for these mere specimens as they were deemed must if genuine be worth in themselves a mint of money and a province full of such why the thought was charming Thus the great King fish was fairly hooked and Riza Bey could take his time The golden tide that flowed in to him did not slacken and his own expenses were all provided for at the Tuileries The only thing remaining to be done was a grand foray on the tradesmen of Paris and this was splendidly executed The most exquisite wares of all descriptions were gathered in without mention of payment and one by one the Persian phalanx distributed itself through Europe until only two or three were left with the Ambassador At length word was sent to Versailles that the gifts from the Shah had come and a day was appointed for their presentation The day arrived and the Hall of Audience was again thrown open All was jubilee the King and the court waited but no Persian no Riza Bey no presents from the Shah That morning three men without either caftans or robes but very much resembling the blacklegs of the day in their attire and deportment had left the Tuileries at daylight with a bag and a bundle and returned no more They were Riza Bey and his last body guard the bag and the bundle were the smallest in bulk but the most precious in value of a month s successful plunder The turquoises and opals left with the King turned out upon close inspection to be a new and very ingenious variety of colored glass now common enough and then worth if anything about thirty cents in cash Of course a hue and cry was raised in all directions but totally in vain Riza Bey the Persian Shah and the gentlemen in flower pots had gone glimmering through the dream of things that were L etat c est moi had been sold for thirty cents It was afterward believed that a noted barber and suspected bandit at Leghorn who had once really traveled in Persia and there picked up the knowledge and the ready money that served his turn was the perpetrator of this pretty joke and speculation as he disappeared from his native city about the time of the embassy in France and did not return All Europe laughed heartily at the Grand Monarque and his fair court dames and An Embassy from Persia was for many years thereafter an expression similar to Walker in English or Buncombe in American conversation when the party using it seeks to intimate that the color of his optics is not a distinct pea green IX RELIGIOUS HUMBUGS CHAPTER XLIV DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND OR YANKEE SUPERSTITIONS MATTHIAS THE IMPOSTOR NEW YORK FOLLIES THIRTY YEARS AGO There is a story that on a great and solemn public occasion of the Romish Church a Pope and a Cardinal were with long faces performing some of the gyrations of the occasion when instead of a pious ejaculation and reply which were down in the programme one said to the other gravely in Latin mundus vult decipi and the other replied with equal gravity and learning decipiatur ergo that is All the world chooses to be fooled Let it be fooled then This seems perhaps a reasonable way for priests to talk about ignorant Italians It may seem inapplicable to cool sharp school trained Protestant Yankees It is not however at least not entirely Intelligent Northerners have sometimes superstition enough in them to make a first class Popish saint If it had not been so I should not have such an absurd religious humbug to tell of as Robert Matthews notorious in our goodly city some thirty years ago as Matthias the Impostor In the summer of eighteen thirty two there was often seen riding in Broadway in a handsome barouche or promenading on the Battery usually attended by a sort of friend or servant a tall man of some forty years of age quite thin with sunken sharp gray eyes with long coarse brown and gray hair parted in the middle and curling on his shoulders and a long and coarse but well tended beard and mustache These Esau like adornments attracted much attention in those close shaving days He was commonly dressed in a fine green frock coat lined with white or pink satin black or green pantaloons with polished Wellington boots drawn on outside fine cambric ruffles and frill and a crimson silk sash worked with gold and with twelve tassels for the twelve tribes of Israel On his head was a steeple crowned patent leather shining black cap with a shade Thus bedizened this fantastic looking personage marched gravely up and down or rode in pomp in the streets Sometimes he lounged in a bookstore or other place of semi public resort and in such places he often preached or exhorted His preachments were sufficiently horrible He claimed to be God the Father and his doctrine was in substance this The true kingdom of God on earth began in Albany in June eighteen thirty and will be completed in twenty one years or by eighteen fifty one During this time wars are to stop and I Matthias am to execute the divine judgments and destroy the wicked The day of grace is to close on December one eighteen thirty six and all who do not begin to reform by that time I shall kill The discourses by which this blasphemous humbug supported his pretensions were a hodge podge of impiety and utter nonsense with rants curses and cries and frightful threats against all objectors Here is a passage from one All who eat swine s flesh are of the devil and just as certain as he eats it he will tell a lie in less than half an hour If you eat a piece of pork it will go crooked through you and the Holy Ghost will not stay in you but one or the other must leave the house pretty soon The pork will be as crooked in you as rams horns Again he made these pleasant points about the ladies They who teach women are of the wicked All females who lecture their husbands their sentence is Depart ye wicked I know you not Everything that has the smell of woman will be destroyed Woman is the cap sheaf of the abomination of desolation full of all deviltry There ladies Is anything further necessary to convince you what a peculiarly wicked and horrible humbug this fellow was If we had followed this impostor home we should have found him lodged during most of his stay in New York city with one or the other of his three chief disciples These were Pierson who commonly attended him abroad Folger and for a time only Mills All three of these men were wealthy merchants In their handsome and luxuriously furnished homes this noxious humbug occupied the best rooms and controlled the whole establishment directing the marketing meal times and all other household matters Master mistress in mister Folger s home and domestics were disciples and obeyed the scamp with an implicitness and prostrate humility even more melancholy than absurd both as to housekeeping and as to the ceremonies washing of feet et cetera which he enjoined When he was angry with his female disciples he frequently whipped them but being a monstrous coward he never tried it on a man The least opposition or contradiction threw him into a great rage and set him screaming and cursing and gesticulating like any street drab When he wished more clothes which was pretty often one of his dupes furnished the money When he wanted cash for any purpose indeed they gave it him This half crazy knave and abominable humbug was Robert Matthews who called himself Matthias He was of Scotch descent and born about seventeen ninety in Washington county New York and his blood was tainted with insanity for a brother of his died a lunatic He was a carpenter and joiner of uncommon skill and up to nearly his fortieth year lived on the whole a useful and respectable life being industrious a professing Christian of good standing and having married in eighteen thirteen a steady family man In eighteen twenty eight and eighteen twenty nine while living at Albany he gradually became excited about religious subjects his first morbid symptoms appearing after hearing some sermons by reverend E N Kirk and mister Finney the revivalist He soon began to exhort his fellow journeymen instead of minding his work so uproariously that his employer turned him away He discovered a text in the Bible that forbid Christians to shave He let his hair and beard grow began street preaching in a noisy brawling style announced that he was going to set about converting the whole city of Albany which needed it badly enough if we may believe the political gentlemen Finding however that the Lobby or the Regency or something or other about the peculiar wickedness of Albany was altogether too much for him he began like Jonah at Nineveh to announce the destruction of the obstinate town and at midnight one night in June eighteen twenty six he waked up his household and saying that Albany was to be destroyed next day took his three little boys two four and six years old his wife and oldest child a daughter refusing to go and fled to the mountains He actually walked the poor little fellows forty miles in twenty four hours to his sister s in Washington county Here he was reckoned raving crazy was forcibly turned out of church for one of his brawling interruptions of service and sent back to Albany where he resumed his street preaching more noisily than ever He now began to call himself Matthias and claimed to be a Jew Then he went on a long journey to the Western and Southern States preaching his doctrines getting into jail and sometimes fairly cursing his way out and returning to New York city preached up and down the streets in his crazy bawling fashion sometimes on foot and sometimes on an old bony horse His New York city dupes Elijah Pierson and Benjamin H Folger and their families together with a mister Mills and a few more figured prominently in the chief chapter of Matthews career during two years and a half from May eighteen thirty two to the fall of eighteen thirty four Pierson and Folger were the leaders in the folly These men merchants of wealth and successful in business were of that sensitive and impressible religious nature which is peculiarly credulous and liable to enthusiasms and delusions They had been with a number of other persons eagerly engaged in some extravagant religious performances including excessive fasts and asceticisms and a plan formed by one of their lady friends to convert all New York by a system of female visitations and preachings a plan not so very foolish I may just remark if the she apostles are only pretty enough Pierson the craziest of the crew besides other wretched delusions had already fancied himself Elijah the Tishbite and when his wife fell ill and died a little while before this time had first tried to cure her and then to raise her from the dead by anointing with oil and by the prayer of faith as mentioned in the Epistle of Saint James Curiously enough a sort of lair or nest very soft and comfortable was thus made ready for our religious humbug just as he wanted it worst for in these days he was but seedy He heard something of Pierson I don t know how and on the fifth of May eighteen thirty two he called on him Very quickly the poor fellow recognized the long bearded prophetical humbug as all that he claimed to be a possessor and teacher of all truth and as God himself Mills and Folger easily fell into the same pitiable foolery on Pierson s introduction And the lucky humbug was very soon living in clover in Mills house which he chose first had admitted the happy fools Pierson and Folger as the first two members of his true church Pierson believing that from Elijah the Tishbite he had become John the Baptist devoted himself as a kind of servant to his new Messiah and the deluded men began to supply all the temporal wants of the impostor believing their estates set apart as the beginning of the material Kingdom of God After three months some of Mills friends on charges of lunacy caused Mills to be sent to Bloomingdale Asylum and Matthias to be thrust into the insane poor s ward at Bellevue where his beard was forcibly cut off to his extreme disgust His brother however got him out by a habeas corpus and he went to live with Folger Mills now disappears from the story Matthias remained in the full enjoyment of his luxurious establishment until September eighteen thirty four it is true with a few uncomfortable interruptions He was always both insolent and cowardly and thus often irritated some strong minded auditor and got himself into some pickle where he had to sneak out which he did with much ease In his seedy days the landlord of a hotel in whose bar room he used to preach and curse put him down when he grew too abusive by coolly and sternly telling him to go to bed mister Folger himself had one or two brief intervals of sense in one of which angered at some insolence of Matthias he seized him by the throat shook him well and flung him down upon a sofa The humbug knowing that his living was in danger took this very mildly and readily accepted the renewed assurances of belief which poor Folger soon gave him In the village of Sing Sing where Folger had a country seat which he called Mount Zion Matthias was exceedingly obnoxious His daughter had married a mister Laisdell and the humbug who claimed that all Christian marriages were void and wicked by some means induced the young wife to come to Sing Sing where he whipped her more than once quite cruelly Her husband came and took her away after encountering all the difficulty which Matthias dared make and at a hearing in the matter before a magistrate he was very near getting tarred and feathered if not something worse and the danger frightened him very much He barely escaped being shaved by violence and being thrown overboard to test his asserted miraculous powers at the hands of a stout and incredulous farmer on the steamboat between Sing Sing and New York While imprisoned at Bellevue before his trial he was tossed in a blanket by the prisoners to make him give them some money The unlucky prophet dealt out damnation to them in great quantities but they told him it wouldn t work and the poor humbug finally instead of casting them into hell paid them a quarter of a dollar apiece to let him off When he was about to leave Folger s house some roguish young men of Sing Sing forged a warrant and with a counterfeit officer seized the humbug and a second time shaved him by force He was one day terribly set back as the phrase is by a sharpish answer He gravely asserted to a certain man that he had been on the earth eighteen hundred years His hearer startled and irreverent exclaimed The devil you have Do you tell me so I do said the prophet Then rejoined the other all I have to say is you are a remarkably good looking fellow for one of your age The confounded prophet grinned scowled and exclaimed indignantly You are a devil Sir and marched off In the beginning of August eighteen thirty four the unhappy Pierson died in Folger s house under circumstances amounting to strong circumstantial evidence that Matthias with the help of the colored cook an enthusiastic disciple had poisoned him with arsenic The rascal pretended that his own curse had slain Pierson There was a post mortem an indictment and a trial but the evidence was not strong enough for conviction Being acquitted he was at once tried again for an assault and battery on his daughter by the aforesaid whippings and on this charge he was found guilty and sent to the county jail for three months in April eighteen thirty five The trial for murder was just before the prophet having lain in prison since his apprehension for murder in the preceding autumn mister Folger s delusion had pretty much disappeared by the end of the summer of eighteen thirty four He had now become ruined partly in consequence of foolish speculations jointly with Pierson believed to be conducted under Divine guidance and partly because his strange conduct destroyed his business reputation and standing The death of Pierson and some very queer matters about another apparent poisoning trick awakened the suspicions of the Folgers and after a good deal of scolding and trouble with the impostor who hung on to his comfortable home like a good fellow Folger finally turned him out and then had him taken up for swindling He had been too foolish himself however to maintain this charge but shortly after the others for murder and assault followed with a little better success This imprisonment seems to have put a sudden and final period to the prophetical and religious operations of Master Matthias and to the follies of his victims too I know of no subsequent developments of either kind Matthias disappears from public life and died it is said in Arkansas but when or after what further career I don t know He was a shallow knave and undoubtedly also partly crazy and partly the dupe of his own nonsense If he had not so opportunely found victims of good standing he would not have been remembered at all except as George Munday the hatless prophet and Angel Gabriel Orr are remembered as one more obscure crazy street preacher And as soon as his accidental supports of other people s money and enthusiasm failed him he disappeared at once Many of my readers will remember distinctly as I do the remarkable career of this man and the humiliating position in which his victims were placed In the face of such an exposition as this of the weakness and credulity of poor human nature in this enlightened country of common schools and colleges in the boasted wide awake nineteenth century who shall deny that we can study with interest and profit the history of impositions which have been practiced upon mankind in every possible phase throughout every age of the world including the age in which we live There is literally no end to these humbugs and the reader of these pages weak as may be my attempts to do the subject justice will learn that there is no country no period and no sphere in life which has not been impiously invaded by the genius of humbug under more disguises and in more shapes than it has entered into the heart of man to conceive CHAPTER XLV A RELIGIOUS HUMBUG ON JOHN BULL JOANNA SOUTHCOTT THE SECOND SHILOH Joanna Southcott was born at saint Mary s Ottery in Devonshire about the year seventeen fifty She was a plain stout limbed 
4104-185522-0000	train-other-500	hard fisted farmer lass whose toils in the field for her father was in but very moderate circumstances had tawned her complexion and hardened her muscles at an early age
4104-185522-0001	train-other-500	As she grew toward woman s estate necessity compelled her to leave her home and seek service in the city of Exeter where for many years she plodded on very quietly in her obscure path
4104-185522-0002	train-other-500	first as a domestic hireling and subsequently as a washer woman I have an old and esteemed friend on Staten Island whose father still living
4104-185522-0003	train-other-500	recollects Joanna well as she used to come regularly to his house of a Monday morning to her task of cleansing the family linen He was then but a little lad yet he remembers her quite well with her stout robust frame
4104-185522-0004	train-other-500	and buxom and rather attractive countenance and her queer ways Even then she was beginning to invite attention by her singular manners and discourse which led many to believe her demented
4104-185522-0005	train-other-500	It was at Exeter that Joanna became religiously impressed and joined the Wesleyan Methodists as a strict and extreme believer in the doctrines of that sect During her attendance upon the Wesleyan rites
4104-185522-0006	train-other-500	she became intimate with one Sanderson who
none	none	 whether a designing rogue or only a very fanatical believer 
4104-185522-0007	train-other-500	pretended that he had discovered in the good washerwoman a Bible prodigy
none	none	 and it was not long before the poor creature began literally to see sights and dream dreams of the most preternatural description 
4104-185522-0008	train-other-500	for which Sanderson always had ready some very telling interpretation
none	none	 Her visions were of the most thoroughly mixed character withal 
4104-185522-0009	train-other-500	sometimes transporting her to the courts of heaven and sometimes to a very opposite region celebrated for its latent and active caloric When she ranged into the lower world
4104-185522-0010	train-other-500	she had a very unpleasant habit of seeing sundry scoffers and unbelievers in herself belonging to the congregation in very close but disadvantageous intercourse with the Evil One
4104-185522-0011	train-other-500	who was represented as having a particular eye to others around her even while they laid claim to special piety Of course such revelations as these could not be tolerated in any well regulated community
4104-185522-0012	train-other-500	and when some most astounding religious gymnastics performed by Joanna in the midst of prayers and sermons occurred to heap up the measure of her offences it became full time to take the matter in hand
4104-185522-0013	train-other-500	and the prophetess was expelled Now those whom she had not served up openly with brimstone agreeing with her about those whom she had thus
none	none	 cooked and delighted in their own exemption from that sort of dressing 
4104-185522-0014	train-other-500	seceded in considerable numbers and became Joanna s followers This gave her a nucleus to work upon and between seventeen ninety and eighteen hundred she managed to make herself known throughout Britain
4104-185522-0015	train-other-500	proclaiming that she was to be the destined Mother of the Second Messiah and although originally quite illiterate picking up enough general information and Bible lore
none	none	 to facilitate her publication of several very curious 
4104-185522-0016	train-other-500	though sometimes incoherent works One of the earliest and most startling of these was her
none	none	 Warning to the whole World 
4104-185522-0017	train-other-500	from the Sealed Prophecies of Joanna Southcott
none	none	 and other communications given since the writings were opened on the twelfth of January eighteen oh three This foretold the close approach of the great red dragon of the Revelations with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and the birth of the man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron In eighteen oh five a shoemaker named Tozer built her a chapel in Exeter at his own expense and it was from the first constantly filled on service days with eager worshipers 
4104-185522-0019	train-other-500	Here she gave exhortations and prophesied in a species of religious frenzy or convulsion sometimes uttering very heavy prose and sometimes the most fearful doggerel rhyme resembling well
4104-185522-0020	train-other-500	perhaps our album effusions here at home Indeed I can think of nothing else equally fearful
none	none	 In these paroxysms Joanna raved like an ancient Pythoness whirling on her tripod 
4104-185522-0021	train-other-500	and to just about the same purpose Yet it was astonishing to see how the thing went down Crowds of intelligent people came from all parts of the United Kingdom to listen be converted
none	none	 and to receive the seals as they were called 
4104-185522-0022	train-other-500	that secured their fortunate possessor unimpeded and immediate admission to heaven Of course tickets so precious could not be given away for nothing and the seal trade in this new form proved very lucrative
4104-185522-0023	train-other-500	The most remarkable of all these conversions was that of the celebrated engraver William Sharp who notwithstanding his eminent position as an artist by no means bore out his name in other things
4104-185522-0024	train-other-500	He had previously become thoroughly imbued with the notions of Swedenborg Mesmer and the famous Richard Brothers and was quite ripe for anything fantastic Such a convert was a perfect godsend to Joanna
4104-185522-0025	train-other-500	and she was easily persuaded to accompany him to London where her congregations rapidly increased to enormous proportions
none	none	 even rivaling those now summoned by the drum ecclesiastical and orthodox of the reverend mister Spurgeon 
4104-185522-0026	train-other-500	The whole sect extended until in eighteen thirteen it numbered no less than one hundred thousand members signed and sealed mister Sharp occupying a most conspicuous position
4104-185522-0027	train-other-500	at the very footstool of the Prophetess Late in eighteen thirteen appeared the Book of Wonders in five parts and it was a clincher Poor Sharp came in largely for the expenses
4104-185522-0028	train-other-500	but valiantly stood his ground against it all At length in eighteen fourteen the great Joanna dazzled the eyes of her adherents and the world at large with her
none	none	 Prophecies concerning the Prince of Peace This delectable manifesto flatly announced to mankind that the second Shiloh so long expected would be born of the Prophetess at midnight on October nineteen in that same year i e eighteen fourteen The inspired writer was then enceinte although a virgin 
4104-185522-0030	train-other-500	as she expressly and solemnly declared and in the sixty fourth year of her age Among the other preternatural concomitants of this anticipated eventful birth
4104-185522-0031	train-other-500	was the fact that the period of her pregnancy had lasted for several years Of course this stupendous announcement threw the whole sect into ecstasies of religious exultation
4104-185522-0032	train-other-500	while on the other hand it afforded a fruitful subject of ridicule for the utterly irreverent London pamphleteers Poor Sharp
4104-185522-0033	train-other-500	who had caused a magnificent cradle and baby wardrobe to be got ready at his own expense was most unmercifully scored The infant was caricatured with a long gray beard and spectacles
4104-185522-0034	train-other-500	with Sharp in a duster carefully rocking him to sleep while Joanna the Prophetess treated the engraver to some cuts in her own style with a bunch of twigs
4104-185522-0035	train-other-500	On the appointed night the street in which Joanna lived was thronged with the faithful who undeterred by sarcasm fully credited her prediction
none	none	 They bivouacked on the side walks in motley crowds of men women and children 
4104-185522-0036	train-other-500	and as the hours wore on and their interest increased burst forth into spontaneous psalmody The adjacent thoroughfares were as densely jammed with curious and incredulous spectators
4104-185522-0037	train-other-500	and the mutton pie and ballad businesses flourished extensively The interior of the house with the exception of the sick chamber was illuminated in all directions and the dignitaries of the sect held the ante rooms and corridors
none	none	 in full fig 
4104-185522-0038	train-other-500	to receive the expected guest But the evening passed
none	none	 then midnight came 
4104-185522-0039	train-other-500	then morning but alas no Shiloh and little by little the disappointed throngs dispersed Poor Joanna however kept her bed and finally after many fresh paroxysms and prophecies
4104-185522-0040	train-other-500	on the twenty seventh of December eighteen fourteen gave up the ghost the indefatigable Sharp still declaring that she had gone to heaven for a season
none	none	 only to legitimatize the unborn infant and would re arise again from death 
4104-185522-0041	train-other-500	after four days with the Shiloh in her arms So firm was this faith in him and many other respectable persons that the body of the Prophetess was retained in her house until the very last moment
4104-185522-0042	train-other-500	When the dissection demanded by the majority of the sect could no longer be delayed that operation was performed and it was found that the subject had died of ovarian dropsy but was
4104-185522-0043	train-other-500	as she had always maintained herself to be a virgin doctor Reece who had been a devout believer but was now undeceived published a full account of this and all the other circumstances of her death
4104-185522-0044	train-other-500	and another equally earnest disciple bore the expenses of her burial at saint John s Wood and placed over her a tombstone with appropriate inscriptions
4104-185522-0045	train-other-500	As late as eighteen sixty three there were many families of believers still existing near Chatham in Kent and even in this country can here and there be found admirers of the creed of Joanna Southcott
none	none	 who are firmly convinced that she will re appear some fine morning with Sanderson on one side of her and Sharp on the other CHAPTER XLVI THE FIRST HUMBUG IN THE WORLD ADVANTAGES OF STUDYING THE IMPOSITIONS OF FORMER AGES HEATHEN HUMBUGS THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES THE CABIRI ELEUSIS ISIS The domain of humbug reaches back to the Garden of Eden where the Father of lies practised it upon our poor innocent first grandmother Eve This was the first and worst of all humbugs But from that eventful day to the present moment falsehood hypocrisy deception imposition cant bigotry false appearances and false pretences superstitions and all conceivable sorts of humbugs have had a full swing and he or she who watches these things most closely and reflects most deeply upon these various peculiarities bearings and results will be best qualified to detect and to avoid them For this reason I should look upon myself as somewhat of a public benefactor in exposing the humbugs of the world if I felt competent to do the subject full justice Next to the fearful humbug practiced upon our first parents came heathen humbugs generally All heathenism and idolatry are one grand complex humbug to begin with All the heathen religions always were and are still audacious colossal yet shallow and foolish humbugs The heathen humbugs were played off by the priests the shrewdest men then alive It is a curious fact that the heathen humbugs were all solemn This was because they were intended to maintain the existing religions which like all false religions could not endure ridicule They always appealed to the pious terrors of the public as well as to its ignorance and appetite for marvels They offered nothing pleasant nothing to love nothing to gladden the heart and lift it up in joyful gratitude true adoration and childlike confidence prayer and thanksgiving On the contrary awful noises fearful sights frightful threats foaming at the mouth dark sayings secret processions bloody sacrifices grim priests costly offerings sleeps in darksome caverns to wait for a dream from the god these were the machineries of the ancient heathen They were as crude and as ferocious as those of the King of Dahomey or of the barbarous negroes of the Guinea coast But they often show a cunning as keen and effective as that of any quack or Philadelphia lawyer or Davenport Brother or Jackson Davis of to day The most prominent of the heathen humbugs were the mysteries the oracles the sibyls N B the word is often mis spelled sybils and augury Every respectable Pagan religion had some mysteries just as every respectable Christian family has a bible and as an ill natured proverb has it a skeleton It was considered a poor religion a one horse religion so to speak that had no mysteries The chief mysteries were those of the Cabiri of Eleusis and of Isis These mysteries used exactly the same kind of machinery which proves so effective every day in modern mysteries viz shows processions voices lights dark rooms frightful sights solemn mummeries striking costumes big talks and preachments threats gabbles of nonsense et cetera et cetera The mysteries of the Cabiri are the most ancient of which anything is known These Cabiri were a sort of Original old doctor Jacob Townsends of divinities They were considered senior and superior to Jupiter Neptune Plato and the gods of Olympus They were Pelasgic that is they belonged to that unknown ancient people from whom both the Greek and the Latin nations are thought to have come The Cabiri afterward figured as the elder gods of Greece the inventors of religion and of the human race in fact and were kept so very dark that it is not even known with any certainty who they were The ancient heathen gods like modern thieves very usually objected to pass by their real names The Cabiri were particularly at home in Lemnos and afterward in Samothrace Their mysteries were of a somewhat unpleasant character as far as we know them The candidate had to pass a long time almost starved and without any enjoyment whatever was then let into a dark temple crowned with olive tied round with a purple girdle and frightened almost to death with horrid noises terrible sights of some kind great flashes of light and deep darkness between et cetera et cetera There was a ceremony of absolution from past sin and a formal beginning of a new life It is a curious fact that this performance seems to have been a kind of pious marine insurance company as the initiated it was believed could not be drowned Perhaps they were put in a way to obtain a drier strangulation The reason why these ceremonies were kept so successfully secret is plain Each man as he was let in and found what nonsense it was was sure to hold his tongue and help the next man in as in the modern case of the celebrated Sons of Malta It is to be admitted however to the credit of the Cabiri that a doctrine of reformation or of living a better practical life seems to have been part of their religion This is an interesting recognition by heathen consciences of one of the greatest moral truths which Christianity has enforced Something of the same kind can be traced in other heathen mysteries But these heathen attempts at virtue invariably rotted out into aggravations of vice No religion except Christianity ever contained the principle of improvement in it Bugaboos and hob goblins may serve for a time to frighten the ignorant into obedience but if they get a chance to cheat the devil they will be sure to do it Nothing but the great doctrine of Christian love and brotherhood and of a kind and paternal Divine government has ever proved to be permanently reformatory and tending to lift the heart above the vices and passions to which poor human nature is prone The mysteries of Eleusis were celebrated every year at Eleusis near Athens in honor of Ceres and were a regular May Anniversary so to speak for the pious heathens of the period It took just nine days to complete them long enough for a puppy to get its eyes open The candidates were very handsomely put through On the first day they got together on the second they took a wash in the sea on the third they had some ceremonies about Proserpine on the fourth no mortal knows what they did on the fifth they marched round a temple two and two with torches like a Wide Awake procession on the sixth seventh and eighth there were more processions and the initiation proper said to have been something like that of Free masonry so that we may suppose the victims rode the goat and were broiled on the gridiron On the ninth day the ceremony they say consisted in overturning two vessels of wine I fear by this means that they all got drunk and the more so because the coins of Eleusis have a hog on one side as much as to say We make hogs of ourselves There was a set of mysteries at Athens called Thesmophoria and one at Rome called the mysteries of the Bona Dea which were celebrated by married women only Various notions prevailed as to what they did But can there be any reasonable doubt about it They were I fear systematic conspirators meetings in which the more experienced matrons instructed the junior ones how to manage their husbands If this was not their object then it was to maintain the influence of the heathen clergy over the heathen ladies Women have always been the constituents of priests where false religions prevailed as they have for better purposes of the ministers of the Gospel among Christians The mysteries of the goddess Isis which originated in Egypt were in general like those of Ceres at Eleusis The Persian mysteries of Mithra which were very popular during part of the latter days of the Roman empire were of the same sort So were those of Bacchus Juno Jupiter and various other heathen gods All of them were celebrated with great solemnity and secrecy all included much that was terrifying and all of their secrets have been so faithfully kept that we have only guesses and general statements about the details of the performances Their principal object seems to have been to secure the initiated against misfortunes and to gain prosperity in the future Some have imagined that very wonderful and glorious truths were revealed in the midst of these heathen humbugs But I guess that the more we find out about them the bigger humbugs they will appear as happened to the travelers who held a post mortem on the great heathen god in the story This was a certain very terrible and powerful divinity among some savage tribes of whom dreadful stories were told very authentic of course Some unbelieving scamps of travelers by unlawful ways managed to get into the innermost sacred place of the temple one night They found the god to be done up in a very large and suspicious looking bundle Having sacrilegiously cut the string they unrolled one envelop of mats and cloths after another until they had taken off more than a hundred wrappers The god grew smaller and smaller and smaller and the wonder of the travelers what he could be larger and larger At last the very innermost of all the coverings fell off and the great heathen god was revealed in all his native majesty It was a cracked soda water bottle This indicates what is beyond all question the fact that the heathen mysteries had their foundation in gas Indeed the whole composition of these impositions was gammon deception hypocrisy Humbug Truly the science of Humbug is entitled to some consideration simply for its antiquity if for nothing else CHAPTER XLVII HEATHEN HUMBUGS NO two HEATHEN STATED SERVICES ORACLES SIBYLS AUGURIES Something must be said about the Oracles the Sibyls and the Auguries which besides the mysteries elsewhere spoken of were the chief assistant humbugs or side shows used for keeping up the great humbug heathen religion One word about the regular worship of heathenism what maybe called their stated services They had no weekly day of worship indeed no week and no preaching such as ours is that is no regular instruction by the ministers of religion intended for all the people They had singing and praying after their fashion the singing being a sort of chant of praise to whatever idol was under treatment at the time and the praying being in part vain repetitions of the name of their god and for the rest a request that the god would do or give whatever was asked of him as a fair business transaction in return for the agreeable smell of the fine beef they had just roasted under his nose or for whatever else they had given him as a sum of money a pair of pantaloons or whatever they wore instead a handsome golden cup This made the temple a regular shop where the priests traded off promised benefits for real beef coining blessings into cash on the nail a very thorough humbug Such public religious ceremonies as the heathen had were mostly annual sometimes monthly There were also daily ones which were however the daily business of the priests and none of the business of the laymen To return to the subject All the heathen oracles old and new for abundance of them are still agoing sibyls auguries and all show how universally and naturally and humbly and helplessly too poor human nature longs to see into the future and longs for help and guidance from some power higher than itself Thus considered these shallow humbugs teach a useful lesson for they constitute a strong proof of man s inborn natural recognition of some God of some obligation to a higher power of some disembodied existence and so they show a natural human want of exactly what the Christian revelation supplies and constitute a powerful evidence for Christianity All the heathen religions I believe had oracles of some kind But the Greek and Latin ones tell the whole story Of these there were over a hundred more than twenty of Apollo who was the god of soothsaying divination prophecy and of the supernatural side of heathen humbug generally thirty or forty collectively of Jupiter Ceres Mercury Pluto Juno Ino a very good name for a goddess that gave oracles though she didn t know Faunus Fortune Mars et cetera and nearly as many of demi gods heroes giants et cetera such as Amphiaraus Amphilochus Trophonius Geryon Ulysses Calchas AEsculapius Hercules Pasiphae Phryxus et cetera The most celebrated and most patronized of them all was the great oracle of Apollo at Delphi The little fee appears to have been the only universal characteristic of the proceedings for obtaining an answer from the god Whether you got your reply in words spoken by the rattling of an old pot by observing an ox s appetite throwing dice or sleeping for a dream your own proceedings were essentially the same Terms invariably net cash in advance or its equivalent A fine ox or sheep sacrificed was cash for after the god had had his smell those ladies and gentlemen appear to have eaten as they say the Yankees talk through their noses all the rest was put carefully away by the reverend clergy for dinner and saved so much on the butcher s bill If your credit was good you might receive your oracle and afterward send in any little acknowledgment in the form of a golden goblet or statue or vase or even of a remittance in specie Such gifts accumulated in the oracle at Delphi and to an immense amount and to the great emolument of Brennus a matter of fact Gaulish commander who at his invasion of Greece coolly carried off all the bullion without any regard to the screeches of the Pythoness and with no more scruples than any burglar The Delphian oracle worked through a woman who on certain days went and sat on a three legged stool over a hole in the ground in Apollo s temple This hole sent out gas which instead of being used like that afforded by holes in the ground at Fredonia N Y to illuminate the village was much more shrewdly employed by the clerical gentlemen to shine up the knowledge boxes of their customers and introduce the glitter of gold into their own pockets I merely throw out the hint to any speculating Fredonian who owns a hole in the ground Well the Pythia as this female was termed warmed up her understanding over this hole as you have seen ladies do over the register of a hot air furnace and becoming excited she presently began to be drunk or crazy and in her fit she gabbled forth some words or noises These the priests took down and then told the customer that the noises meant so and so When business was brisk they worked two Pythias turn and turn about or as they say at sea watch and watch and kept a third all cocked and primed in case of accident besides for this gas sometimes gave the priestess literally fits which killed her in a few days Other oracles gave answers in many various ways The priest quietly wrote down whatever answer he chose or inspected the insides of a slaughtered beast and said that the bowels meant this and that At Telmessus the inquirer peeped into a well where he must see a picture in the water which was his answer at any rate if this wouldn t do he got none This plan was evidently based on the idea that truth is at the bottom of a well At Dodona they hung brass pots on the trees and translated the banging these made when the wind blew them together At Pherae you whispered your question in the ear of the image of Mercury and then shutting your ears until you got out of the market place the first remark you heard from anybody was the answer and you might make the best of it At Pluto s oracle at Charae the priest took a dream and in the morning told you what he chose In the cave of Trophonius after various terrifying performances they pulled you through a hole the wrong way of the feathers and then back again and then stuck you upon a seat and made you write down your own oracle being what you had seen which would I imagine usually be the elephant And so forth and so on Humbug ad libitum Like some of the more celebrated modern fortune tellers the managers of the oracles were frequently shrewd fellows and could often pick up the materials of a very smart and judicious answer from the appearance of the customer and his question Very often the answer was sheer nonsense It was in fact believed by many that as a rule you couldn t tell what the response meant until after it was fulfilled when you were expected to see it In many cases the answers were ingeniously arranged so as to mean either a good or evil result one of which was pretty likely Thus one of the oracles answered a general who asked after the fate of his campaign as follows the ancients remember using no punctuation marks Thou shalt go thou shalt return never in war shalt thou perish The point becomes visible when you first make a pause before never and then after it On a similar occasion the Delphic oracle told Croesus that if he crossed the River Halys he would overthrow a great empire This empire he chose to understand as that of Cyrus whom he was going to fight It came out the other way and it was his own empire that was overthrown The immense wisdom of the oracle however was tremendously respected in consequence Pyrrhus of Epirus on setting off against the Romans received equal satisfaction the Pythia telling him in Latin what amounted to this I say that you Pyrrhus the Romans are able to conquer Pyrrhus took it as he wished it but found himself sadly thimble rigged the little joker being under the wrong cup The Romans beat him and most wofully too Trajan was advised to consult the oracle at Heliopolis about his intended expedition against the Parthians The custom was to send your query in a letter so Trajan sent a blank note in an envelope The god very naturally sent back a blank note in reply which was thought wonderfully smart and so the imperial dupe sent again a square question Shall I finish this war and get safe back to Rome The Heliopolitan humbug replied by sending a piece of an old grape vine cut into pieces which meant either You will cut them up or They will cut you up and Trajan like the little boy at the peep show who asked which is Lord Wellington and which is the Emperor Napoleon had paid his penny and might take his choice Sometimes the oracles were quite jocular A man asked one of them how to get rich The oracle said Own all there is between Sicyon and Corinth Which places are some fifteen miles apart Another fellow asked how he should cure his gout The oracle coolly said Drink nothing but cold water The Delphic oracle and some of the others used for a long time to give their answers in verses At last however irreverent critics of the period made so much fun of the peculiarly miserable style of this poetry that the poor oracle gave it up and came down to plain prose Every once in a while some energetic and cunning man of skeptical character insisted on having just such an answer as he wanted It was well known that Philip of Macedon bought what responses he wished at Delphi Anybody with plenty of money who would quietly see the priests could have such a response as he chose Or if he was a bull headed hard fisted fighting man of irreligious but energetic mind the priests gave him what he wished out of fear When Themistocles wanted to encourage the Greeks against the Persians he fixed Delphi by bribes When Alexander the Great came to consult the same oracle the Pythia was disinclined to perform But Alexander rather roughly gave her to understand that she must and she did The Greek and Roman oracles finally all gave out not far from the time of Christ s coming having gradually become more or less disreputable for many years All the heathen nations as I have said had their oracles too The heathen Scandinavians had a famous one at Upsal The Getae in Scythia had one The Druids had them so did the Mexican priests The Egyptian and Syrian divinities had them in short oracles were quite as necessary as mysteries and continue so in heathen religions The only exception I believe is in Mohammedanism whose votaries save themselves any trouble about the future by their thorough fatalism They believe so fully and vividly that everything is immovably predestinated being at the same time perfectly sure of heaven at last that they quietly receive everything as it comes and don t take the least trouble to find out how it is coming The Sibyls were women supposed to be inspired by some divinity who prophesied of the future Some say there was but one some two three four or ten All sorts of obscure stories are told about the time and place of their activity There was the Persian or Chaldean who is said to have foretold with many details the coming and career of Christ the Lybian the Delphic the Cumaean much honored by the Romans and half a dozen more Then there was Mantho the daughter of Tiresias who was sent from Thebes to Delphi in a bag seven hundred and twenty years before the destruction of Troy These ladies lived in caves and among them are said to have composed the Sibylline books which contained the mysteries of religion were carefully kept out of sight at Rome and finally came into the hands of the Emperor Constantine They were burned one story has it about fifty years after his death But there are some Sibylline books extant which however are among the most transparent of humbugs for they are full of all sorts of extracts and statements from the Old and New Testaments I do not believe there ever were any Sibyls If there were any they were probably ill natured and desperate old maids who turned so sour tempered that their friends had to drive them off to live by themselves and who under these circumstances went to work and wrote books I must crowd in here a word or two about the Auguries and the Augurs These gentlemen were a sort of Roman priests who were accustomed to foretell future events decide on coming good or bad fortune whether it would do to go on with the elections to begin any enterprise or not et cetera by means of various signs These were thunder the way any birds happened to fly the way that the sacred chickens ate the appearance of the entrails of beasts sacrificed et cetera et cetera These augurs were for a long time much respected in Rome but at last the more thoughtful people lost their belief in them and they became so ridiculous that Cicero who was himself one of them said he could not see how one augur could look another in the face without laughing It is humiliating to reflect how long and how extensively such barefaced and monstrous humbugs as these have maintained unquestioned authority over almost the whole race of man Nor has humanity by any means escaped from such debasing slavery now for millions and millions of men still believe and practice forms and ceremonies even more absurd if possible than the Mysteries Oracles and Auguries CHAPTER XLVIII MODERN HEATHEN HUMBUGS FETISHISM OBI VAUDOUX INDIAN POWWOWS LAMAISM REVOLVING PRAYERS PRAYING TO DEATH A scale of superstition and religious beliefs of to day arranged from the lowest to the highest would show many curious coincidences with another scale which should trace the history of superstitions and religious beliefs backward in time toward the origin of man Thus for instance the heathen humbugs whether revolting or ridiculous which I am to speak of in this chapter are in full blast to day and they furnish perfect specimens of the beliefs which prevailed among the heathen of four thousand and of eighteen hundred years ago of the Chaldee and Canaanite superstitions and equally of those of the Romans under Augustus Caesar The most dirty vulgar low silly and absurd of all the superstitions in the world are as is natural those of the darkest minded of all the heathen who have any superstition at all For as if for the humiliation of our proud human nature there are really some human beings who seem to have too little intellect even to rise to the height of a superstition Such are the Andaman Islanders who crawl on all fours wear nothing but a plaster of mud to keep the musquitos off eat bugs and grubs and ants and turn their children out to shift for themselves as soon as the little wretches can learn to crawl and eat bugs These lowest of superstitions are Fetishism and Obi believed and practiced by negro tribes and remember this even by their ignorant white mistresses in the West Indies and in the United States to day Yes I know where Southern refugee secessionist women are living in and about New York city at this moment who really believe in the negro witchcraft called Obi practiced by the slaves A Fetish is anything not a living being worshiped because supposed to be inhabited by some god In some parts of Africa the Fetishes are a sort of guardian divinity and there is one for each district like a town constable and sometimes one for each family The Fetish is any stone picked up in the street a tree a chip a rag It may be some stone or wooden image an old pot a knife a feather Before this precious divinity the poor darkeys bow down and worship and sometimes sacrifice a sheep or a rooster Each more important Fetish has a priest and here is where the humbug comes in This gentleman lives on the offerings made to the Fetish and he exploits his god as a Frenchman would say with great profit Obi or Obeah is the name of the witchcraft of the negro tribes and the practitioner is termed an Obi man or Obi woman They practice it at home in Africa and carry it with them to continue it when they are made slaves in other lands Obi is now practiced as I have already hinted in Cuba and in the Southern States and is believed in by the more ignorant and foolish white people as much as by their barbarous slaves Obi is used only to injure and the way to perform it upon your enemy is to hire the Obi man or woman to concoct a charm and then to hide this or cause it to be hidden in some place about the person or abode of the victim where he will find it He is expected thereupon to fall ill to wither and waste away and so to die Absurd as it may seem this cursing business operates with a good deal of certainty on the poor negroes who fall sick instantly on finding the ball of Obi two or three inches in diameter hidden in their bed or in the roof or under the threshold or in the earthen floor of their huts The poor wretches become dejected lose appetite strength and spirits grow thin and ill and really wither away and die It is a curious fact however that if under these circumstances you can cause one of them to become converted to Christianity or to become a Christian by profession he becomes at once free from the witches dominion and quickly recovers The ball of Obi or as it is called among the Brazilian negroes Mandinga may be made of various materials always I believe including some which are disgusting or horrible Leaves of trees and scraps of rag may be used ashes usually from bones or flesh of some kind pieces of cats bones and skulls feathers hair earth or clay which ought to be from a grave teeth of men and of snakes alligators or other beasts vegetable gum or other sticky stuff human blood pieces of eggshell et cetera et cetera This mixture is curiously like that in the witches caldron in Macbeth which among other equally toothsome matters contained frogs toes bats wool lizards legs owlets wings wolfs teeth witches mummy Jew s liver tigers bowels and lastly as a sort of thickening to the gravy baboon s blood A creole lady now at the North recently told a friend of mine that the negroes can put some pieces of paper or powder or something or other in your shoes that will make you sick or make you do anything they want The poor foolish woman told this with a face full of awe and eyes wide open Another lady known to me long resident at the South tells me that the belief in this sort of devilism is often found among the white people The practices called Vaudoux or Voudoux are a sort of Obi being like that an invoking of the aid of some god to do what the worshipers wish The Vaudoux humbug is quite prevalent in Cuba Hayti and other West India islands where there are wild negroes or where they are still imported from Africa There is also a good deal of this sort of humbug among the slaves in New Orleans and cases arising from it have recently quite often appeared in the police reports in the newspapers of that city The Vaudoux worshipers assemble secretly with a kind of chief witch or mistress of ceremonies there is a boiling caldron of hell broth a la Macbeth the votaries dance naked around their soup amulets and charms are made and distributed During a quarter of a century last past some hundreds of these orgies have been broken up by the New Orleans police and probably as many more have come off as per programme The Vaudoux processes are most frequently appealed to for the purposes of some unsuccessful or jealous lover and the Creole ladies believe in Vaudouxism as much as in Obi In the West Indies the Vaudoux orgies are more savage than in this country It is but a little while since in Hayti under the energetic and sensible administration of President Geffrard eight Vaudoux worshipers were regularly tried and executed for having murdered a young girl the niece of two of them by way of human sacrifice to the god They tied the poor child tight put her in a box called a humfort fed her with some kind of stuff for four days and then deliberately strangled her beheaded her flayed her cooked the head with yams ate of the soup and then performed a solemn dance and chant around an altar with the skull on it The Caffres in Southern Africa have a kind of humbug somewhat like the Obi men who are known as rainmakers These gentlemen furnish what blessing and cursing may be required for other purposes but as that country is liable to tremendous droughts their best business is to make rain This they do by various prayers and ceremonies of which the most important part is receiving a large fee in advance from the customer The rain making business though very lucrative is not without its disadvantages for whenever Moselekatse or Dingaan or any other chief sets his rainmaker at work and the rain was not forthcoming as per application the indignant ruler caused an assegai or two to be stuck through the wizard for the encouragement of the other wizards This was not so unreasonable as it may seem for if the man could not make rain when it was wanted what was he good for The ceremonies of the pow wows or medicine men of the North American Indians are less brutal than the African ones These soothsayers like the Obi men prepared charms for their customers usually however not so much to destroy others as to protect the wearer These charms consist of some trifling matters tied up in a small bag the medicine bag which is to be worn round the neck and will it is supposed insure the wearer the special help and protection of the Great Spirit The pow wows sometimes do a little in the cursing line There is a funny story of a Puritan minister in the early times of New England who coolly defied one of the most famous Indian magicians to play off his infernal artillery A formal meeting was had and the pow wow rattled his traps howled danced blew feathers and vociferated jargon until he was perfectly exhausted the old minister quietly looking at him all the time The savage humbug was dumbfounded but quickly recovering his presence of mind saved his home reputation by explaining to the red gentlemen in breech cloths and nose rings that the Yankee ate so much salt that curses wouldn t take hold on him at all The Shamans or Schamans of Siberia follow a very similar business but are not so much priestly humbugs as mere conjurors The Lamas or Buddhist leaders of Central and Southern Asia are however regular priests again and may be said with singular propriety to run their machine on principles of thorough religious humbug for they do really pray by a machine They set up a little mill to go by water or wind which turns a cylinder On this cylinder is written a prayer and every time the barrel goes round once it counts they say for one prayer It may be imagined how piety intensifies in a freshet or in a heavy gale of wind And there is a ludicrous notion of economy as well as a pitiable folly in the conception of profiting by such windy supplications and of saving all one s time and thoughts for business while the prayers rattle out by the hundred at home Only imagine the pious fervor of one of these priests in a first class Lowell mill of say a hundred thousand spindles Print a large edition of some good prayer and paste a copy on each spindle and the place would seem to him the very gate of a Buddhist heaven He would feel sure of taking heaven by storm with a sustained fire of one hundred thousand prayers every second His first requisite for a prosperous church would be a good water power for prayer mills And yet absurd as these prayer mills of the heathen really are it may not be safe to bring them under unqualified condemnation for who among us has not sometimes heard windy prayers even in our Christian churches Young clergymen are especially liable and I might say prone to this mockery These however are but exceptions to the general Christian rule viz that the Omniscient careth only for heart service and that before Him all mere lip service or machine service is simply an abomination A less innocent kind of praying is one of the religious humbugs of the bloody and cruel Sandwich Islands form of heathenism Here a practice prevailed and does yet of paying money to a priest to pray your enemy to death For cash in advance this bargain could always be made and so groveling was the spiritual cowardice of these poor savages that like the negro victim of Obi the man prayed at seldom failed to sicken as soon as he found out what was going on and to waste away and die This bit of heathen humbug now in operation from so many distant portions of the earth shows how radically similar is all heathenism It shows too how mean vulgar filthy and altogether vile is such religion as man unassisted contrives for himself It shows again how sadly great is the proportion of the human race still remaining in this brutal darkness And by contrast it affords us great reason for thankfulness that we live in a land of better culture and happier hopes and practices CHAPTER XLIX ORDEALS DUELS WAGER OF BATTLE ABRAHAM THORNTON RED HOT IRON BOILING WATER SWIMMING SWEARING CORSNED PAGAN ORDEALS Ordeals belong to times and communities of rudeness violence materialism ignorance gross superstition and blind faith The theory of ordeals is that God will miraculously decide in the case of any accused person referred to Him He will cause the accused to be victorious or defeated in a duel will punish him on the spot for perjury and if the innocent be exposed to certain physical dangers will preserve him harmless The duel for instance used to be called the ordeal by battle and was simply the commitment of the decision of a cause to God Duels were regularly prefaced by the solemn prayer God show the right Now a days nobody believes that skill with a pistol is going to be specially bestowed by the Almighty without diligent practice at a mark Accordingly the idea of a divine interposition has long ago dropped out of the question and duelling is exclusively in the hands of the devil and his human votaries is a purely brutal absurdity But in England so long was this bloody superstitious humbug kept up that any hardened scoundrel who was a good hand at his weapon might down to the year eighteen nineteen absolutely have committed murder under the protection of English law Two years before that date a country rough named Abraham Thornton murdered his sweetheart Mary Ashford but by deficiency of proof was acquitted on trial There was however a moral conviction that Thornton had killed the girl and her brother a mere lad caused an appeal to be entered according to the English statute and Thornton was again arraigned before the King s Bench In the mean time his counsel had looked up the obsolete proceedings about assize of battle and when Thornton was placed at the bar he threw down his glove upon the floor according to the ancient forms and challenged his accuser to mortal combat In reply the appellant Ashford set forth facts so clearly showing Thornton s guilt as to constitute as he alleged cause for exemption from the combat and for condemnation of the prisoner The court taken by surprise spent five months in studying on the matter At last it decided that the fighting man had the law of England on his side admitted his demand and further found that the matters alleged for exemption from combat were not sufficient On this poor William Ashford who was but a boy declined the combat by reason of his youth and the prisoner was discharged and walked in triumph out of court the innocent blood still unavenged upon his hands The old fogies of Parliament were startled at finding themselves actually permitting the practice of barbarisms abolished by the Greek emperor Michael Palaeologus in twelve fifty nine and by the good King Louis IX of France in twelve seventy and two years afterwards in eighteen nineteen the legal duel or assize of battle was by law abolished in England It had been legal there for five centuries and a half having been introduced by statute in twelve sixty one Before that time the ordeals by fire and by water were the regular legal ones in England These were known even to the Anglo Saxon law being mentioned in the code of Ina A D about seven hundred It appears that fire was thought the most aristocratic element for the ordeal by fire was used for nobles and that by water for vulgarians and serfs The operations were as follows When one was accused of a crime murder for instance he had his choice whether to be tried by God and his country or by God If he chose the former he went before a jury If the latter he underwent the ordeal Nine red hot ploughshares were laid on the ground in a row The accused was blindfolded and sent to walk over them If he burnt himself he was guilty if not not Sometimes instead of this the accused carried a piece of red hot iron of from one to three pounds weight in his hand for a certain distance The ordeal by water was in one form at least the same wise alternative in after years so often offered to witches The accused was tied up in a heap each arm to the other leg and flung into water If he floated he was guilty and must be killed If he sank and drowned he was innocent but killed Trial was therefore synonymous with execution The nature of such alternatives shows how important it was to have a character above suspicion Another mode was for the accused to plunge his bare arm into boiling water to the elbow The arm was then instantly sealed up in bandages under charge of the clergy for three days If it was then found perfectly well the accused was acquitted if not he was found guilty Another ordeal was expurgation or compurgation It was a simple business as easy as swearing very much like a custom house oath It was only this the accused made solemn oath that he was not guilty and all the respectable men he could muster came and made their solemn oath that they believed so too This is much like the jurisprudence of the Dutch justice of the peace in the old story before whom two men swore that they saw the prisoner steal chickens The thief however getting a little time to collect testimony brought in twelve men who swore that they did not see him take the chickens Balance of evidence overwhelmingly in favor of the prisoner said the sapient justice in Dutch I suppose and finding him innocent in a ratio of six to one he discharged him at once This ordeal by oath was reserved for people of eminence whose word went for something and who had a good many thorough going friends Another sort of ordeal was reserved for priests It was called corsned The priest who took the ordeal by corsned received a bit of bread or a bit of cheese which was loaded heavily by way of sauce with curses upon whomsoever should eat it falsely This he ate together with the bread of the Lord s supper Everybody knew that if he were guilty the sacred mouthful would choke him to death on the spot History records no instance of the choking of any priest in this ordeal but there is a story that the Saxon Earl Godwin of Kent took the corsned to clear himself of a charge of murder and being a layman was choked I fully believe that Earl Godwin is dead for he was born about the year one thousand But I have not the least idea that corsned killed him The priests had the management of ordeals which being appeals to God were reckoned religious ceremonies They of course much preferred the swearing and eating and hot iron and water ordeals which could be kept under the regulation of clerical good sense Not so with the ordeal by battle No priests could do anything with the wrath of two great mad ugly brutes hot to kill each other and crazy to risk having their own throats cut or skulls cleft rather than not have the chance In consequence the whole influence of the Romish church went against the ordeal by battle and in favor of the others Thus the former soon lost its religious element and became the mere duel a base indulgence of a beast s passion for murder and revenge The progress of enlightenment gradually pushed ordeals out of court Mobs have however always tried the ordeal by water on witches Almost all the heathen ordeals have depended on fire water or something to eat or drink Even in the Bible we find an ordeal prescribed to the Jews Numbers chap v for an unfaithful wife who is there directed to drink some water with certain ceremonies which drink God promises shall cause a fatal disease if she be guilty and if not not It is worth noticing that Moses says not a word about any water of jealousy or any other ordeal for unfaithful husbands This drinking or eating ordeal prevails quite extensively even now In Hindostan theft is often enquired into by causing the suspected party to chew some dry rice or rice flour which has some very strong curses stirred into it corsned fashion After chewing the accused spits out his mouthful and if it is either dry or bloody he is guilty It is easy to see how a rascal if as credulous as rascals often are would be so frightened that his mouth would be dry and would thus betray his own peccadillo Another Hindoo mode was to give a certain quantity of poison in butter and if it did no harm to acquit Here the man who mixes the dose is evidently the important person In Madagascar they give some tangena water Now tangena is a fruit of which a little vomits the patient and a good deal poisons or kills him a quality which sufficiently explains how they manage that ordeal Ordeals by fire and water are still practiced with some variations in Hindostan China Pegu Siberia Congo Guinea Senegambia and other pagan nations Some of those still in use are odd enough A Malabar one is to swim across a certain river which is full of crocodiles A Hindoo one is for the two parties to an accusation to stand out doors each with one bare leg in a hole he to win who can longest endure the bites they are sure to get This would be a famous method in some of the New Jersey and New York and Connecticut seashore lowlands I know of The mosquitoes would decide cases both civil and criminal at a speed that would make a Judge of the Supreme Court as dizzy as a humming top Another Hindoo plan was for the accused to hold his head under water while a man walked a certain distance If the walker chose to be lazy about it or the prisoner had diseased lungs this would be a rather severe method The Wanakas in Eastern Africa draw a red hot needle through the culprit s lips a most judicious place to get hold of an African and if the wound bleeds he is guilty In Siam accuser and accused are put into a pen and a tiger is let loose on them He whom the tiger kills is guilty If he kills both both are guilty if neither they try another mode Blackstone says that an ordeal might always be tried by attorney I should think this would give the legal profession a very lively time whenever the courts were chiefly using tigers poison drowning fire and red hot iron but not so much so when a little swearing or eating was the only thing required This whole business of ordeals is a singular superstition and the extent of its employment shows how ready the human race is to believe that God is constantly influencing even their ordinary private affairs In other words it is in principle like the doctrine of special providence Looked at as a superstition however considered as a humbug the history of ordeals show how corrupt becomes the nuisance of religious ways of deciding secular business and how proper is our great American principle of the separation of state and church CHAPTER L APOLLONIUS OF TYANA The annals of ancient history are peculiarly rich in narratives of pretension and imposition and either owing to the greater ignorance and credulity of mankind or the superior skill of gifted but unscrupulous men in those days present a few examples that even surpass the most remarkable products of the modern science of humbug One of their most surprising instances in fact perhaps absolutely the leading impostor was the sage or charlatan for it is difficult to determine which known as Apollonius Tyanaeus so called from Tyana in Cappadocia Asia Minor his birthplace where he first saw the light about four years earlier than Christ and consequently more than eighteen and a half centuries ago His arrival upon this planet was attended with some very amazing demonstrations With his first cry a flash of lightning darted from the heavens to the earth and back again dogs howled cats mewed roosters crowed and flocks of swans so say the olden chroniclers probably geese every one of them clapped their wings in the adjacent meadows with a supernatural clatter Ushered into the world with such surprising omens as these young Apollonius could not fail to make a noise himself ere long Sent by his doting father to Tarsus in Cilicia to be educated he found the dissipations of the place too much for him and soon removed to AEgae a smaller city at no great distance from the other There he adopted the doctrines of Pythagoras and subjected himself to the regular discipline of that curious system whose first process was a sort of juvenile gag law the pupils being required to keep perfectly silent for a period of five years during which time it was forbidden to utter a single word Even in those days few female scholars preferred this practice and the boys had it all to themselves nor were they by any means numerous After this probation was over they were enjoined to speak and argue with moderation At AEgae there stood a temple dedicated to AEsculapius who figured on earth as a great physician and compounder of simples and after death was made a god The edifice was much larger and more splendid than the Brandreth House on Broadway although we have no record of AEsculapius having bestowed upon the world any such benefaction as the universal pills However unlike our modern M D s the latter was in the habit of re appearing after death in this temple and there holding forth to the faithful on various topics of domestic medicine Apollonius was allowed to take up his residence in the establishment and no doubt the priests initiated him into all their dodges to impose upon the people Another tenet of the Pythagorean faith was a total abstinence from beans an arrangement which would be objectionable in New England and in Nassau street eating houses Apollonius however who knew nothing of Yankees or Nassau street manfully completed his novitiate Restored at length to the use of beans and of his talking apparatus he set forth upon a lecturing tour through Pamphylia and Cilicia His themes were temperance economy and good behavior and for the very novelty of the thing crowds of disciples soon gathered about him At the town of Aspenda he made a great hit when he pitched into the corn merchants who had bought up all the grain during a period of scarcity and sold it to the people at exorbitant prices Of course such things are not permitted in our day Apollonius moved by the sufferings of women and children took his stand in the market place and with his stylus wrote in large characters upon a tablet the following advice to the speculators in grain The earth the common mother of all is just But ye being unjust would make her a bountiful mother to yourselves alone Leave off your dishonest traffic or ye shall be no longer permitted to live The grain merchants upon beholding this appeal relented for there was conscience in those days and moreover the populace had prepared torches and proposed to fry a few of the offenders like oysters in bread crumbs So they yielded at once and great was the fame of the prophet Thus elevated in his own opinion Apollonius still preaching virtue by the wayside set out for Babylon after visiting the cities of Antioch Ephesus et cetera always attracting immense crowds As he penetrated further toward the remote East his troops of followers fell off until he was left with only three companions who went with him to the end One of these was a certain Damis who wrote a description of the journey and by the way tells us that his master spoke all languages even those of the animals We have men in our own country who can talk horse talk at the races but probably none so perfectly as this great Tyanean The author of The Ruined Cities of Africa a recent publication informs us that at Lamba an African village there is a leopard who can speak This would go to show that the animals are aspiring in a direction directly the opposite of the acquirements of Apollonius and I shall secure that leopard if possible for exhibition in the Museum and for a fair consideration send him to any public meeting where some one is needed who will come up to the scratch But to resume On his way to Babylon Apollonius saw by the roadside a lioness and eight whelps where they had been killed by a party of hunters and argued from the omen that he should remain in that city just one year and eight months which of course turned out to be exactly the case The Babylonish monarch was so delighted with the eloquence and skill of the noted stranger that he promised him any twelve gifts that he might choose to ask for but Apollonius declined accepting anything but food and raiment However the King gave him camels and escort to assist his journey over the northern mountains of Hindostan which he crossed and entered the ancient city of Taxilia On the way he had a high time in the gorges of the hills with a horrible hobgoblin of the species called empusa by the Greeks This demon terrified his companions half out of their wits but Apollonius bravely assailed him with all sorts of hard words and to literally translate the old Greek narrative blackguarded him so effectually that the poor devil fled with his tail between his legs At Taxilia Phraortes the King a lineal descendant of the famous Porus and truly a porous personage since he was renowned for drinking gave the philosopher a grand reception and introduced him to the chief of the Brahmins whose temples he explored These Hindoo gentlemen opened the eyes of Apollonius wider than they had ever been before and taught him a few things he had never dreamed of but which served him admirably during his latter career He returned to Europe by way of the Red Sea passing through Ephesus where he vehemently denounced the speculators in gold and other improper persons As they did not heed him he predicted the plague and left for Smyrna Sure enough the pestilence broke out just after his departure and the Ephesians telegraphed to Smyrna by the only means in their power for his immediate return gold in the meanwhile falling at least ten per cent Apollonius reappeared in the twinkling of an eye suddenly in the very midst of the wailing crowd on the market place Pointing to a beggar he directed the people to stone that particular unfortunate and they obeyed so effectually that the hapless creature was in a few moments completely buried under a huge heap of brickbats The next morning the philosopher commanded the throng to remove the pile of stones and as they did so a dog was discovered instead of the beggar The dog sprang up wagged his tail and made away at two forty and with him the pestilence departed For this feat the Ephesians called Apollonius a god and reared a statue to his honor The appellation of divinity he willingly accepted declaring that it was only justice to good men In these degenerate days we have accorded the term to only one person the divine Fanny Ellsler That too was a tribute to superior understanding Our hero next visited Pergamus the site of ancient Troy where he shut himself up all night in the tomb of Achilles and having raised the great departed held conversation with him on a variety of military topics Among other things Achilles told him that the theory of his having been killed by a wound in the heel was all nonsense as he had really died from being bitten by a puppy in the back If the reader does not believe me let him consult the original MS of Damis The same accident has disabled several great generals in modern times Apollonius next made a tour through Greece visiting Athens Sparta Olympia and other cities and exhorting the dissolute Greeks to mend their evil courses The Spartans particularly came in for a severe lecture on the advantages of soap and water and it is said that the first clean face ever seen in that republic was the result of the great Tyanean s teachings At Athens he cured a man possessed of a demon the latter bouncing out of his victim at length with such fury and velocity as to dash down a neighboring marble statue The Isle of Crete was the next point on the journey and an earthquake occurring at the time Apollonius suddenly exclaimed in the streets The earth is bringing forth land Folks looked as he pointed toward the sea and there beheld a new island in the direction of Therae He arrived at Rome whither his fame had preceded him just as the Emperor Nero had issued an edict against all who dealt in magic and although he knew that he was included in the denunciation he boldly went to the forum where he restored to life the dead body of a beautiful lady and predicted an eclipse of the sun which shortly occurred Nero caused him to be arrested loaded with chains and flung into an underground dungeon When his jailers next made their rounds they found the chains broken and the cell empty but heard the chanting of invisible angels This story would not be believed by the head jailer at Sing Sing Prolonging his trip as far as Spain Apollonius there got up a sedition against the authority of Nero and thence crossed over into Africa This was the darkest period of his history From Africa he proceeded to the South of Italy and the island of Sicily still discoursing as he went About this time he heard of Nero s death and returned to Egypt where Vespasian was endeavoring to establish his authority While in Egypt he explored the supposed sources of the Nile and learned all the lore of the Ethiopean necromancers who could do any thing even to making a black man white thus greatly excelling the skill of after ages Vespasian had immense faith in the Tyanean sage and consulted him upon the most important matters of State Titus the successor of that monarch manifested equal confidence and regarded him absolutely as an oracle Apollonius who really seems to have been a most sensible politician wrote the following brief but pithy note to Titus when the latter modestly refused the crown of victory after having destroyed Jerusalem Apollonius to Titus Emperor of Rome sendeth greeting Since you have refused to be applauded for bloodshed and victory in war I send you the crown of moderation You know to what kind of merit crowns are due Yet Apollonius was by no means an ultra peace man for he strongly advocated the shaving and clothing of the Ethiopians and their thorough chastisement when they refused to be combed and purified When Domitian grasped at the imperial sceptre the great Tyanean sided with his rival Nerva and having for this offence been seized and cast into prison suddenly vanished from sight and reappeared on the instant at Puteoli one hundred and fifty miles away The distinguished mister Jewett of Colorado is the only instance of similar rapidity of locomotion known to us in this country and time After taking breath at Puteoli the sage resumed his travels and revisited Greece Asia Minor et cetera At Ephesus he established his celebrated school and then once more returning to Crete happened to give his old friends the Cretans great offence and was shut up in the temple Dictymna to be devoured by famished dogs but the next morning was found perfectly unharmed in the midst of the docile animals who had already made considerable progress in the Pythagorean philosophy and were gathered around the philosopher seated on their hind legs with open mouths and lolling tongues intently listening to him while he lectured them in the canine tongue So devoted had they become to their eloquent instructor and so enraged were they at the interruption when the Cretans re opened the temple that they rushed out upon the latter and made a breakfast of a few of the leading men This is one of the last of the remarkable incidents that we find recorded of the mighty Apollonius How he came to his end is quite uncertain but some veracious chroniclers declare that he simply dried up and blew away Others aver that he lived to the good old age of ninety seven and then quietly gave up the ghost at Tyana where a temple was dedicated to his memory However that may be he was subsequently worshiped with divine honors and so highly esteemed by the greatest men of after days that even Aurelian refused to sack Tyana out of respect to the philosopher s ashes Dion Cassius the historian records one of the most remarkable instances of his clairvoyance or second sight He states that Apollonius in the midst of a discourse at Ephesus suddenly paused and then in a different voice exclaimed to the astonishment of all Have courage good Stephanus Strike strike Kill the tyrant On that same day the hated Domitian was assassinated at Rome by a man named Stephanus The humdrum interpretation of this miracle is simply that Apollonius had a foreknowledge of the intended attempt upon the tyrant s life Long afterwards Cagliostro claimed that he had been a fellow traveler with Apollonius and that his mysterious companion the sage Athlotas was the very same personage who consequently at that time must have reached the ripe age of some seventeen eighty four years a lapse of time beyond the memory of even the oldest inhabitant in these parts at least THE END Illustration A Catalogue of BOOKS ISSUED BY Carleton Publisher NEW YORK eighteen sixty six There is a kind of physiognomy in the titles of books no less than in the faces of men
