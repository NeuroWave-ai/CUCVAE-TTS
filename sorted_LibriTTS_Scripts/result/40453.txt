4145_104606_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you 
none	none	been recommended by one of my pupils She cast her mind over the scanty list to ascertain which of them might be likely to give such a recommendation His stumbling answer saved her further trouble on that score No I I saw the plate on the gate so I I thought I d just come in and ask you to give me one Give you a music lesson Yes if you wouldn t mind But she paused hardly knowing what to say She had never contemplated giving lessons to pupils of this description I never have given lessons to a gentleman I supposed they always went to professors of their own sex Do they I don t know I hope you don t mind making an exception in my case I I m so fond of music Suddenly he changed the subject This is Clover Cottage Yes this is Clover Cottage Are you pardon me but are you Miss Ossington Ossington No that is not my name But doesn t some one of that name live here No one I never heard it before I think there must be some mistake She laid her hand on the latch by way of giving him a hint to go He prevented her opening it placing his own hand against the door courteously yet unmistakably Excuse me but I hope you will give me a lesson if it is only of a quarter of an hour to try what I can do to see if it would be worth your while to have me as a pupil I have been long looking for an opportunity of taking lessons and when I saw your plate on the gate I jumped at the chance She hesitated The situation was an odd one and yet she had already been for some time aware that young women who are fighting for daily bread have not seldom to face odd situations Funds were desperately low She had to contribute her share to the expenses of the little household and that share was in arrear Of late MSS had been coming back more monotonously than ever Pupils especially those who were willing to pay possible prices were few and far between Who was she that she should turn custom from the door It was nothing that this was a stranger all her pupils were strangers at the beginning most of them were still strangers at the end Men she had heard pay better than women She might take advantage of this person s sex to charge him extra terms even to the extent of five shillings a lesson instead of half a crown It was an opportunity she could not afford to lose She resolved to at least go so far as to learn exactly what it was he wanted and then if from any point of view it seemed advisable to make an appointment for a future date She led the way into the sitting room he following Are you quite a beginner she asked No not not altogether Let me see what you can do She went to a pile of music which was on a little table for the purpose of selecting a piece of sufficient simplicity to enable a tyro to display his powers or want of them He was between her and the window In passing the window he glanced through it As he did so he gave a sudden start a start in fact which amounted to a positive jump His hat dropped from his hand and wholly regardless that he was leaving it lying on the floor he hurried backwards keeping in the shadow and as far as possible from the window The action was so marked that it was impossible it should go unnoticed It filled Madge Brodie with a sense of shock which was distinctly disagreeable Her eyes too sought the window it looked out on to the road A man it struck her of emphatically sinister appearance was loitering leisurely past As she looked he stopped dead and leaning over the palings stared intently through the window It was true that the survey only lasted for a moment and that then he shambled off again but the thing was sufficiently conspicuous to be unpleasant So startled was she by the connection which seemed to exist between the fellow s insolence and her visitor s perturbation that without thinking of what she was doing she placed the first piece she came across upon the music stand saying as she did so Let me see what you can do with this Her words were unheeded Her visitor was drawing himself into an extreme corner of the room in a fashion which considering his size and the muscle which his appearance suggested was in its way ludicrous It was not however the ludicrous side which occurred to Madge his uneasiness made her uneasy too She spoke a little sharply as if involuntarily Do you hear me Will you be so good as to try this piece and let me see what you can make of it Her words seemed to rouse him to a sense of misbehaviour I beg your pardon I am afraid you will think me rude but the truth is I I have been a little out of sorts just lately He came briskly towards the piano glancing however as Madge could not help but notice nervously through the window as he came The man outside was gone his absence seemed to reassure him Is this the piece you wish me to play I will do my best He did his best or if it was not his best his best must have been something very remarkable indeed The piece she had selected unwittingly was a Minuet of Mozart s A dainty trifle a pitfall for the inexperienced seeming so simple yet needing the soul and knowledge of a virtuoso to make anything of it at all Hardly the sort of thing to set before a seeker after music lessons whose acquaintance with music for all she knew was limited to picking out the notes upon the keyboard At her final examination she herself had chosen it first because she loved it and second because she deemed it to be something which would enable her to illustrate her utmost powers at their very best It was only when he struck the first few notes that she realised what it was she had put in front of him when she did she was startled Whether he understood what the piece was there for that he was being set to play it as an exhibition of his ignorance rather than of his knowledge was difficult to say It is quite possible that in the preoccupation of his mind it had escaped him altogether that the sole excuse for his presence in that room lay in the fact that he was seeking lessons from this young girl There could be no doubt whatever that at least one of the things that he had said of himself was true and that he did love music there could be just as little doubt that he already was a musician of a quite unusual calibre one who had been both born and made He played the delicate fragment with an exquisite art which filled Madge Brodie with amazement She had never heard it played like that before never Not even by her own professor Perhaps her surprise was so great that in the first flush of it she exaggerated the player s powers It seemed to her that this man played like one who saw into the very depths of the composer s soul and who had all the highest resources of his art at his command to enable him to give a perfect an ideal rendering Such an exquisite touch such masterly fingering such wondrous phrasing such light and shade such insight and such execution She had not supposed that her cheap piano had been capable of such celestial harmony She listened spellbound for she too had imagination and she too loved music All was forgotten in the moment s rapture in her delight at hearing so unexpectedly sounding in her ears what seemed to her in her excitement the very music of the spheres The player seemed to be as oblivious of his surroundings as Madge Brodie his very being seemed wrapped up in the ecstasy of producing the quaint sweet music for the stately old time measure When he had finished the couple came back to earth with a rush With an apparent burst of recollection his hands came off the keyboard and he wheeled round upon the music stool with an air of conscience stricken guilt Madge stood close by actually quivering with a conflict of emotions He met her eyes instantly to avert his own There was silence then a slight tremor in her voice in spite of her effort to prevent it I suppose you have been having a little jest at my expense A jest at your expense I daresay that is what you call it though I believe in questions of humour there is room for wide differences of opinion I should call it something else I don t understand you That is false At this point blank contradiction the blood showed through his sallow cheeks False Yes false You do understand me
4145_104606_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Did you 
none	none	not say that you had been for some time seeking for an opportunity to take lessons in music I I Confronted by her red hot accusatory glances he stammered stumbled stopped Yes go on I have been seeking such an opportunity Indeed And do you wish me to suppose that you believed that you you could be taught anything in music by an unknown creature who fastened a plate announcing lessons in music to the palings of such a place as this He was silent looking as if he would have spoken but could not She went on I thank you for the pleasure you have given me the unexpected pleasure It is a favourite piece of mine which you have just performed I say performed advisedly I never heard it better played by any one never and I never shall You are a great musician I I am a poor teacher of the rudiments of the art in which you are such an adept I am obliged by your suggestion that I should give you lessons I regret that to do so is out of my power You already play a thousand times better than I ever shall I was just going out as you came in I must ask you to be so good as to permit me to go now He rose from the music stool towering above her higher and higher From his altitude he looked down at her for some seconds in silence Then in his deep bass voice he began as it seemed to excuse himself Believe me She cut him short I believe nothing and wish to believe nothing You had reasons of your own for coming here what they were I do not know nor do I seek to know All I desire is that you should take yourself away He stooped to pick up his hat Rising with it in his hand he glanced towards the window As he did so the man who had leaned over the palings came strolling by again The sight of this man filled him with his former uneasiness He retreated further back into the room all but stumbling over Miss Brodie in his haste In a person of his physique the agitation he displayed was pitiful It suggested a degree of cowardice which nothing in his appearance seemed to warrant I I beg your pardon but might I ask you a favour A favour What is it I will be frank with you I am being watched by a person whose scrutiny I wish to avoid Because I wished to escape him was one reason why I came in here Madge went to the window The man in the road was lounging lazily along with an air of indifference which was almost too marked to be real He gave a backward glance as he went At sight of Madge he quickened his pace Is that the man who is watching you Yes I I fancy it is You fancy Don t you know It is the man He is shorter than you smaller altogether Compared to you he is a dwarf Why are you afraid of him Either the question itself or the tone in which it was asked brought the blood back into his cheeks

none	none	not say I was afraid No Then if you are not afraid why should you have been so anxious to avoid him as to seek refuge on so shallow a pretext in a stranger s house The intruder bit his lip His manner was sullen I regret that the circumstances which have brought me here are of so singular and complicated a character as to prevent my giving you the full explanation to which you may consider yourself entitled I am sorry that I should have sought refuge beneath your roof as I own I did and the more so as I am compelled to ask you another favour permission to leave that refuge by means of the back door She twirled round on her heels and faced him The back door I presume there is a back door Certainly only it leads to the front Again he bit his lip His temper did not seem to be improving The girl s tone face bearing were instinct with scorn Is there no means of getting away by the back without returning to the front Only by climbing a hedge and a fence on to the common Perhaps the feat will be within my powers if you will allow me to try Allow you to try And is it possible that you forced your way into the house on the pretence of seeking lessons in music when your real motive was to seek an opportunity of evading pursuit by means of the back door I am aware that the seeming anomaly of my conduct entitles you to think the worst of me Seeming anomaly She laughed contemptuously Pray sir permit me to lead the way to the back door She strode off with her head in the air he came after with a brow as black as night At the back door they paused I thank you for having afforded me shelter and apologise for having sought it She looked him up and down as if she were endeavouring by mere force of visual inspection to make out what kind of a man he was I want to ask you a question Answer it truthfully if you can Is the man in front a policeman He started with what seemed genuine surprise A policeman Good heavens no Are you sure Of course I m sure He s very far from being a policeman rather if anything the other way What he meant to infer she did not know but he laughed shortly What makes you ask such a thing She was holding the door open in her hand He had crossed the threshold and stood without Malice and something else gleamed in her eyes Because she answered I wondered if you were a thief With that she slammed the door in his face and turned the key Then slipping into the kitchen which was on her left keeping the door on the jar remaining well in the shadow she watched his proceedings through the window For a moment he stayed where she had left him standing as if rooted to the spot Then with an exaggerated courtesy taking off his hat he bowed to the door Turning he marched down the garden path his tall figure seeming more gigantic than ever as she noted how straight he held himself In a twinkling he was over the fence and hedge Once on the other side he shook his fist at Clover Cottage The watcher in the kitchen clenched her teeth as she perceived the gesture Ungrateful creature And to think that a man who has the very spirit of music in his soul and who plays the piano like an angel should be such a wretch That a monster seven feet high who looks like a combination of Samson and Goliath rolled into one should be such a coward and a cur afraid of a pigmy five foot high I hope I ve seen the last of him If I have any more such pupils I shall have to shut up shop Now perhaps I shall be allowed to post my MS and run across to Brown s to get a chop for Ella s tea With that she passed from the back to the front Outside the front door she paused to look around her and take her bearings half doubtful as to whether any more dubious strangers might not be in sight The only person to be seen was the man whose presence had proved so disconcerting to her recent visitor He had reached the corner of the street and turning strolled slowly back towards Clover Cottage He gave one quick shifty glance at her as she came out but beyond that he took or appeared to take no notice of her appearance Now I wonder she said to herself who you may be Your friend who for all I know is now running for his life across the common said you were no policeman and I am bound to say you don t look as if you were he added that if anything you were rather the other way If by that he meant you were a thief I m free to admit you look your profession to the life I wonder if it would be safe to run across to Brown s while you re about not that I m afraid of you as I ll prove to your entire satisfaction if you only let me have the chance Only you seem to be one of those agreeable creatures who if they are only sure that a house is empty and there s not even a girl inside can enact to perfection the part of area sneak and neither Ella nor I wish to lose any of the few possessions which we have While she hesitated a curious scene took place a scene in which the gentleman on the prowl played a leading role The road in which Clover Cottage stood was bisected on the right and left by other streets within a hundred yards of the house itself On reaching the corner of the street on the left the gentleman on the prowl as we have seen had performed a right about face and returned to the cottage As he advanced a woman came round the corner of the street upon the right He saw her the instant she appeared and the sight had on him an astonishing effect He stopped as if petrified stared as if the eyes were starting from his head gave a great gasp turned tore off like a hunted animal dashed round the corner on the left and vanished out of sight Having advanced to within a few feet of where Madge was standing she was a close spectator of his singular behaviour As she looked to see what had been the exciting cause half expecting that her recent visitor had come back and that the tables had been turned and the gentleman on the prowl had played the coward in his turn the woman who had come round the other corner had already reached the cottage Pushing the gate unceremoniously open she strode straight past Madge and without a with your leave or by your leave marched through the open door into the hall beyond As Madge eyed her with mingled surprise and indignation she exclaimed with what seemed unnecessary ferocity I ve come to see the house CHAPTER II THERE S A CONSCIENCE Madge had been taken so wholly unawares that for a moment she remained stock still and voiceless Then she followed the woman to the door You have come to do what I ve come to see the house And pray who are you What affair is that of yours Don t I tell you I ve come to see the house But I don t understand you What do you mean by saying you ve come to see the house For only answer the woman turning her back on her walked another step or two along the little passage She exclaimed as if addressing the staircase which was in front of her in what seemed a tone of intense emotion How his presence is in all the place How he fills the air Madge felt more bewildered than she would have cared to admit Was the woman mad Mad or sane she resolved that she would not submit tamely to such another irruption as the last She laid her hand upon the woman s shoulder Will you be so good as to tell me at once to whom I have the pleasure of speaking and what business has brought you here The woman turned and looked at her as she did so Madge was conscious of a curious sense of discomfort She was of medium height slender build and apparently between forty and fifty years of age Her attire was not only shabby it was tawdry to the last degree Her garments were a heterogeneous lot one might safely swear they had none of them been made for the wearer One and all were shocking examples of outworn finery The black chip hat which she wore perched on her head with an indescribable sort of would be jauntiness was broken at the brim and the one time gorgeous ostrich feathers were crushed and soiled A once well cut cape of erstwhile dark blue cloth was about her shoulders It was faded stained and creased The fur which had been used to adorn the edges was bare and rusty It had been lined with silk as she moved her arms one perceived that of the lining there was nothing left but rags and tatters Her dress once the latest fashionable freak in some light hued flimsy silk had long since been fit for nothing else than cutting into dusters She wore ancient patent leather shoes upon her feet and equally ancient gloves upon her hands the bare flesh showing through holes in every finger If her costume was strange her face was stranger It was the face of a woman who had once been beautiful how long ago no one who chanced on her haphazard could with any certainty have guessed It might have been five ten fifteen twenty years ago and more than that since hers had been a countenance which charmed even a casual beholder It was the face of a woman who had been weak or wicked and maybe both and who in consequence had been bandied from pillar to post till this was all that there was left of her Her big blue eyes were deep set in careworn caverns her mouth which had once been small and dainty was now blurred and pendulous the mouth of a woman who drank her cheeks were sunk and hollow as if she had lost every tooth in her head the cheek bones gleaming through the yellow skin in sharp and cruel ridges To crown it all her hair was dyed a vivid yellow Like all the rest of her the dye was old and worn It stood in urgent need of a renewal The roots were grey they demonstrated their greyness with savage ostentation Here and there among the yellow there were grey patches too in some queer way her attempt at juvenesence had made her look older even than she was This was not a pleasant face to have encountered anywhere at any time being the sort from which good women instinctively shrink back Just now its unpleasantness was intensified by the fact that it was lit up by some to Madge inscrutable emotion inflamed by some mastering excitement The hollow eyes gleamed as if they were lighted by inner fires the lips twitched as if the muscles which worked them were uncontrollable The woman spoke in short sharp angry gusts as if she were stumbling on the verge of frenzied passion This house is mine she said Yours It was his and mine and now it s mine Madge persuaded that the woman must be either mad or drunk felt that perhaps calmness might be her safest weapon Do you mean that you re the landlady The landlady The woman laughed unmirthfully There is no landlady And the landlord he s a ghost He s in it now don t you feel that he is in it She spoke with such singular intensity that in spite of herself Madge shuddered She was feeling more and more uncomfortable wishing heartily that some one might come if it was only the mysterious stranger who had previously intruded The woman went on her excitement seeming to grow with every word she uttered The house is full of ghosts full They re in every corner every nook and cranny and I know them every one Come here I ll show you some of them She caught the girl by the arm Madge yielding to her strange frenzy suffered herself to be led into the sitting room Once inside the woman loosed her hold She looked about her Then crossed to the fireplace standing in the centre of the hearthrug This is where I struck him She pointed just in front of her He was sitting there I had asked him for some money He would not let me have any He always clung to his money always I swear it always She raised her hands as if appealing to the ceiling to bear her witness He said that I was ruining him Ruining him bah I knew better than that He would let no one ruin him he was not of that kind I told him I must have money He said he d given me five pounds last week Five pounds I cried what are five pounds Then we quarrelled he said things I said things Then I flew into a rage my temper has been the curse of my whole life I caught up a decanter of whisky which was on the table and struck him with it on the head The bottle broke the whisky went all over him how it smelt Can t you smell it and he went tumbling down down on to the floor He s lying there now can t you see him lying there She turned to Madge with a gesture which seemed to make the girl s blood run colder Can t you see the ghost She moved a little to one side Just here is where I knelt down and asked him to forgive me That was after I d been carrying on with some fellow I d met at a dance and he had found me out I cried and cried as if my heart would break and at last he came and put his hand upon my head when I set myself to do it and stuck at it I could twist him round my finger and he began to stroke my hair I d lovely hair then no woman ever had lovelier and he was always one to stroke it when I d let him and he said My girl how 
4145_104606_000034_000001	train-clean-360	often 
none	none	shall I have to forgive you Listen Can t you hear him saying it now Can t you see the ghost She went to where the modest sideboard stood This is where we had our sideboard too it was a bigger one than this all our things were good I was standing here leaning against it just like this the first time he saw me drunk He d been out all the evening on some sort of business and I d been left in the house alone with the girl and I hadn t liked it and I d been sulking And at last I got to the whisky and I started to drink drink drink I always had been fond of drink long before that but I d never let him find it out But that time I was that sulky I didn t seem to care and by the time I might have cared I couldn t care I was too far gone I had to keep on drinking There wasn t much in the bottle when I got to the end of it I started on another Then I got to the sideboard and stood leaning over it lolly fashion booze booze boozing All of a sudden the door opened and he came into the room I turned to have a look at him the bottle in one hand and the glass in the other Directly I got clear of the sideboard I went flop on the floor and the bottle and the glass went with me and there I had to lie He rushed towards me and as soon as he had had a look at me he saw how it was Then he fell on his knees at my side and put his hands up to his face and began to cry My God how he did cry not like me His sobs seemed tearing him to pieces and his life s blood seemed coming from him with every tear Drunk as I was it made me cry to hear him Listen Can t you hear him crying now Can t you see the ghost The woman s words and manner were so realistic and despite or perhaps because of her seeming frenzy she had such an eerie capacity of conjuring up the picture as her memory painted it that Madge listened spellbound She was as incapable of interrupting the other s flow of language as if the conscience haunted wretch had cast on her some strange enchantment The sea of visions went to the table and bending over it beckoned to Madge to draw closer As if she found the invitation irresistible Madge approached The woman s outstretched finger pointed to a particular place about the centre of one side of the table Her excitement all at once subsided her voice grew softer Her manner became more human more womanly See this is where my little baby died my little child the only one I ever had It was a girl we called it Lily my name s Lily she glanced up with a grin as if conscious of how grotesquely inappropriate in her case such a name was now it was such a little thing I didn t want it when it came I never was fond of children and I wasn t one to play the mother But when it did come it got hold of me somehow yes it did it did I was fond of it in my way As for him he worshipped it it was baby baby baby all the time I was nowhere It made me wild to hear him and to see the way that he went on We fell out because I would have it brought up by hand He wanted me to let it have my milk but I wouldn t have it I wasn t going to be any baby s slave not likely I don t think he ever forgave me that Then he was always at me because he said I neglected it and that made me worse than ever I wasn t going to have a crying brat thrust down my throat at every turn and so I told him Why isn t there a place in which they bring up babies so that they needn t worry their mothers I wanted to know When I said that how he did look at me and how he went on I thought he would have killed me but I didn t care He did his share of all the nursing that baby ever had and perhaps a little more Again the woman laughed At last the little thing went wrong It always was small it never seemed to grow except thin It was the queerest looking little mite with a serious face like a parson s and great big eyes which seemed to go right through you as if it was looking at something which nobody but itself could see He would have it that it got worse and worse but he was always making such a fuss that I said he was making a fool of the child The doctor came and came but I was pretty often out and when I wasn t I didn t always choose to see him so I only heard what he cared to tell me and I didn t believe the half of that One night I went to a masked ball with missus Sutton she was a larky one she was and led her husband a pretty dance It was latish when I came back I hadn t enjoyed myself one bit and left in a temper and came off home by myself I let myself in at the front door and when I came into this room on the table just here she pointed with her finger there was a pillow and on the pillow was the baby and he was kneeling on the floor in front his elbows on the table and his face on his hands and the tears streaming down his cheeks as if they d never stop I d been to the ball as a ballet girl though he hadn t known it and I hadn t meant that he should but the sight took me so aback that without thinking I dropped my cloak and stood before him just as I was What s the matter now I cried what s the child down here at this time of the night for I expected that he d let fly at me and perhaps send me packing out of the house right there and then But instead he just glanced my way as if he hardly saw me or wanted to and said Baby s dying When he said that it was as if he had run something right into my heart Dying I cried stuff I ran to the table and bent over the pillow I had never seen anybody dying before and knew nothing at all about it but directly I looked at it I seemed to know that what he said was true and that the child was dying My heart stopped beating I couldn t breathe I couldn t speak I couldn t move I could only stare like a creature who had lost her wits it was as if a hand had been stretched right out of Heaven to strike me a blow There he was on one side of the table and there was me leaning right over the other both of us motionless neither of us speaking a word and there was the baby lying on the pillow between us stiller than we were How long we stopped like that I don t know it seemed to me as if it was hours but I daresay it was only a few minutes All at once the baby my baby gave a little movement with its little arms a sort of trembling He moved his arm and put one of his fingers into its tiny hand the baby seemed to fasten on to it Give it one of your fingers he said sobbing as if his heart would break It ll like to feel your finger as it goes Hardly knowing what I was doing I stretched out one of my fingers it was the first finger of my right hand this one She held up the finger in question in its ragged casing And I put it in the mite s wee hand It took it yes it took it It closed its fingers right round it and gave it quite a squeeze yes quite a squeeze Then it loosened its hold It was dead Dead upon the pillow And it s there now Can t you see it lying on the pillow with a smile on its face a smile Can t you see the ghost Stooping the woman made pretence to kiss the lips of some one who was lying just beneath her It might have been that to her the thing was no pretence and that as in a vision the dead lips did indeed touch hers Then drawing herself erect again she broke into another of her discordant laughs Throwing out her arms on either side of her she exclaimed in strident tones Ghosts Ghosts The place is full of them I see them everywhere I touch them hear them all the time They ve been with me all through the years wherever I ve been and where haven t I been My God in heaven and hell crowds and crowds of them more and more as the years went on And do you think that I can t see them here in their house and mine Can t you see them too Madge replied between set lips she had been forming her own conclusions while the woman raved No I do not see them Nor would you were you not under the influence of drink The woman stared at her in what seemed genuine surprise Under the influence of drink Me No such luck I wish I were Again she gave one of those bursts of laughter which so jarred on Madge s nerves When I m drunk I can t see ghosts it s only when I m sober I ve had nothing to eat since I don t know when let alone to drink I m starving starving That s the time when I see ghosts They point at me with their fingers and say Look at us and look at you this is what it s come to They make me see what might have been He made me come to day I didn t want to but he made me And now he s in all the house Listen He s getting out of bed in the room upstairs that s his bedroom Can t you hear his lame foot moving about the floor How often I ve thrown that lame foot in his face when I ve been wild can t you hear it hobble hobble You are mad How dare you talk such nonsense There s no one in the house but you and I The woman seemed to believe so implicitly in the diseased imaginings of her conscience haunted brain that Madge felt that unless she made a resolute effort her own mental equilibrium might totter On the other s face there came a look of shrewd malignant cunning Isn t there That s all you know I m no more mad than you are And I tell you what he s not the only thing that s in the house There s something else as well It was his and now it s mine And don t you think to rob me Rob you I Yes you There s others after it as well as you I know I m not the simpleton that some may think But I won t be robbed by all the lot of you you make no error It was his and now it s mine If there really is anything in the house to which you have the slightest shadow of a claim which I very much doubt and let me know what it is and where it is I ll see that you have it without fail A look of vacancy came on the woman s face She passed her hand across her brow That s it I don t know just where it is He comes and tells me almost but never quite He says it s in the house but he doesn t say exactly where But he never lies so I do know it s in the house and I won t be robbed I have not the slightest idea of what you mean if you really do mean anything at all I don t know if you know me or are under the impression that I know you if so I can only assure you that I don t I have not the faintest notion who you are The woman drawing nearer clutched Madge s arm with both her hands Don t you know who I am I m the ghost s wife Her manner was not only exceedingly unpleasant it was in a sense uncanny so uncanny that in spite of herself Madge could not help a startled look coming into her face The appearance of this look seemed to amuse her tormentor She broke into a continuous peal of unmelodious laughter I m the ghost s wife she kept repeating I m the ghost s wife Madge Brodie prided herself on her strength of nerve and as a rule not without cause But on that occasion almost for the first time in her life it played her false She would have been glad to have been able to scream and flee but she was incapable even of doing that The other seemed to hold her spellbound she was conscious that her senses were reeling that unless something happened soon she would faint But from that final degradation she was saved Madge exclaimed a voice who is this woman It was Ella Duncan and with her was Jack Martyn At the sound of the voice the woman released her hold Never before had Madge been sensible of such a spasm of relief She rushed to Ella with a hysterical sob Oh Ella she cried how thankful I am you ve come Ella looked at her with surprise Madge who is this woman The woman in question spoke for herself She threw up her arms I m the ghost s wife she shrieked I m the ghost s wife Before they had suspected her purpose or could say anything to stop her she had rushed out of the room and from the house CHAPTER III TWO LONE LORN YOUNG WOMEN Ella and Jack eyed each other Madge took refuge in a chair conscious of a feeling of irritation at her weakness now that the provocation had passed Ella regarded her curiously What s the matter with you Madge What s happened It s nothing only that horrible woman has upset me Who is she and what s she been doing and what s she want I don t know who she is or what she wants or anything at all about her I only know that she s prevented me getting anything for your tea That s all right we ve got something haven t we Jack Jack waved a parcel But whatever did you let such an extraordinary looking creature into the house for and whatever did she mean by screaming out that she s a ghost s wife Is she very mad I think she is and I didn t let her in Then while they were preparing tea the tale was told or at least a part of it But even that part was enough to make Jack Martyn grave As the telling proceeded he grew graver and graver until at the end he wore a face of portentous gloom When they seated themselves to the meal he made precisely the remark which they had expected him to make He rested his hands on his knees and he solemnly shook his head This comes of your being alone in the house Ella laughed There now you ve started him on his own particular crotchet he ll never let you hear the last of this Jack went on I ve said before and I say again and I shall keep on saying that you two girls ought not to live alone by yourselves in a house in this out of the way corner of the world Out of the way corner of the world on Wandsworth Common For all practical intents and purposes you might as well be in the middle of the Desert of Sahara you might shriek and shriek and I doubt if any one would hear you This agreeable visitor of Madge s might have cut her throat from ear to ear or chopped her into mincemeat and she would have been as incapable of summoning assistance as if she had been at the top of Mont Blanc That s it Jack pile it on I don t think it s fair of you to talk like that Ella I m not piling it on I m just speaking the plain and simple truth Honestly Madge when you ve been alone in the house all day long haven t you felt that you were at the mercy of the first evil disposed person who chose to come along or if you haven t felt it before don t you think you ll feel it now No to both your questions Supposing this woman comes back again to morrow Madge had to bite her lip to repress a shudder the idea was not a pleasant one She won t come back But suppose she does and from what you say I think it very probable that she will if not to morrow then the day after If she comes the day after to morrow she ll find me out I shall be out all day There s a confession It s only because you know that you will be out that you re able to face the prospect with equanimity You are not entitled to infer anything of the kind Ella interposed perceiving that the girl was made uncomfortable by the man s persistence Don t do quite so much supposing Jack let me do a little for a change Suppose we lived in one of those flats in the charming neighbourhood of Chancery Lane or Bloomsbury after which vicariously your soul so hankers how much better off should we be there You would at any rate be within the reach of assistance No more so than we are now because quite probably the kind of neighbours we should be likely to have in the sort of flat we should be able to afford would be worse much worse than none at all The truth is that two lonely hard up girls desperately hard up girls will be lonely wherever they are We are quite prepared for that Only we intend to choose the particular kind of loneliness which we happen to prefer don t we Madge Of course we do It makes me wild to hear you say such things Rather than you should feel like that I d marry on nothing Thank you but I wouldn t I find it quite hard enough to be single on nothing You know what I mean I don t mean actually on nothing I was reckoning it up the other night My income Your income s like mine Jack capable of considerable increment And would you be so kind as to change the subject But the thing was easier said than done Jack s thoughts had been started in a groove and they kept in it the conversation was continually reverting to the subject of the girls loneliness His last words as he left the room were on the familiar theme I grant that there are advantages in having a pretty little place like this all to yourselves especially when you get it at a peppercorn rent and that it s nice to be your own mistresses and all that kind of thing But in the case of you two girls the disadvantages are so many and so serious that I wonder you don t see them more clearly for yourselves Anyhow Madge has had her first peep at them to day and I sincerely hope it will be her last though I am persuaded that before very long you will discover that as a place of residence for two lone lorn young women Clover Cottage has its drawbacks When Ella returned from saying farewell to mister Martyn in the hall she glanced at Madge and laughed Jack s in his prophetic mood I shouldn t be surprised if his prophecy s inspired Her tone was unexpectedly serious Ella stared What do you mean What I say You re oracular my dear What do you say That I think it quite possible that we shall find that residence at Clover Cottage has its drawbacks I ve lighted on one or two of them already Ella leaned against the edge of the table regarding the speaker with twinkling eyes and smiling lips My dear you don t mean to say that that crazy creature has left such an impression on your mind You see my dear Ella I haven t told you all the story I felt that I had given mister Martyn a sufficient handle against us as it was so I refrained Pray what else is there to tell To judge from your looks and manner one would think that there was something dreadful I don t know about dreadful but there certainly is something odd To begin with that wretched woman was not my only visitor Then the rest of the tale was told and this time the whole of it Ella heard of the stranger who had intruded on the pretence of seeking music lessons of his fear of the seedy loafer in the street of his undignified exit through the back door and the whole of his singular behaviour And you say he could play Play He played like an I was going to say an angel but I ll substitute artist And he looked like a gentleman Certainly and spoke like one But he didn t behave like one I won t go so far as to say that He said or did nothing that was positively offensive when he was once inside the house But you called him a thief Yes but mind you I didn t think he was one I felt so angry I should think you did I should have felt murderous And you don t think the man in the road was a policeman Not he He was as evil looking a vagabond as ever I saw It doesn t follow merely on that account my dear that he wasn t a policeman There was malice in the lady s tones Not at all but even a policeman of that type would hardly have jumped out of his skin with fright at the sight of that horrible woman He knew her and she knew him There s a mystery somewhere How nice Nice You think so I wish you had interviewed her instead of me My dear Ella she she was beyond expression Ella came and seated herself on a stool at Madge s feet Leaning her arms on her knees she looked up at her face Poor old chap It wasn t an agreeable experience Madge s answer was as significant as it was curt It wasn t She gave further details of what the woman had said and done and of how she had said and done it details which she had omitted for reasons of her own in mister Martyn s presence By the time she had finished the listener was as serious as the narrator It makes me feel creepy to hear you It would have made you creepy to have heard her I felt as if the house was peopled with ghosts Madge don t You ll make me want to sleep with you if you go on like that Poor old chap I m sorry if I seemed to chaff you She reflected before she spoke again I can see that it can t be nice for you to be alone in the house while I m away in town all day earning my daily bread especially now that the days are drawing in If you like we ll clear out of this this week we could do it at a pinch and we ll return to the seething masses Madge reflected in her turn before she answered Nothing of the sort has happened before and nothing may happen again But I tell you frankly that if my experiences of to day do recur it won t take much to persuade me that I have an inclination towards the society of my fellows and that I prefer even the crushes of Petticoat Lane to the solitudes of Wandsworth Common Well in that case it shall be Petticoat Lane There was silence Presently Madge stretched herself and yawned In the meantime suggested Ella putting her hand up to her own lips what do you say to bed And it was bed Would you like me to sleep with you inquired Ella as they went upstairs because if you would like me to very much I would No said Madge I wouldn t I never did like to share my bed with any one and I never shall I like to kick about and I like to have plenty of room to do it in Very good have plenty of room to do it in Ungrateful creature If you re haunted don t call to me for aid As it happened Madge did call to her for aid after a fashion though it was not exactly because she was haunted CHAPTER IV IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT Madge was asleep almost as soon as she was between the sheets and it seemed to her that as soon as she was asleep she was awake again waking with that sudden shock of consciousness which is not the most agreeable way of being roused from slumber since it causes us to realise too acutely the fact that we have been sleeping Something had woke her what she could not tell She lay motionless listening with that peculiar intensity with which one is apt to listen when woke suddenly in the middle of the night The room was dark There was the sound of distant rumbling they were at work upon the line where they would sometimes continue shunting from dusk to dawn She could hear faintly the crashing of trucks as they collided the one with the other A breeze was murmuring across the common It came from Clapham Junction way which was how she came to hear the noise of the shunting All else was still She must have been mistaken Nothing had roused her She must have woke of her own accord Stay what was that Her keen set ears caught some scarcely uttered sound Was it the creaking of a board Well boards will creak at night when they have a trick of being as audible as if they were exploding guns It came again and again It was unmistakably a board that creaked downstairs Why should a board creak like that downstairs unless it was being stepped upon As Madge strained her hearing she became convinced that there were footsteps down below stealthy muffled footsteps which would have been inaudible had it not been for the tell tale boards Some one was creeping along the passage Suddenly there was a noise as if a coin or a key or some small object had fallen to the floor Possibly it was something of the kind which had roused her It was followed by silence as if the person who had caused the noise was waiting to learn if it had been overheard Then once more the footsteps she heard the door of the sitting room beneath her open and shut and knew that some one had entered the room In an instant she was out of bed She hurried on a pair of bedroom slippers which she kept beside her on the floor and an old dressing gown which was handy on a chair moving as quickly and as noiselessly as the darkness would permit Snatching up her candlestick with its box of matches she passed without a moment s hesitation as noiselessly as possible from the room On the landing without she stood for a second or two listening There could be no doubt about it some one was in the sitting room Someone who wished to make himself or herself as little conspicuous as possible but whose presence was still sufficiently obvious to the keen eared auditor Madge went to Ella s room and turning the handle entered As she did so she could hear Ella start up in bed Who s there she cried Hush It s I There s some one in the sitting room Lighting a match Madge applied it to the candle Ella was sitting up in bed staring at her with tumbled hair and sleepy eyes apparently only half awake Madge what do you mean What I say We re about to experience another of the drawbacks of rural residence There s some one in the sitting room another uninvited guest Are you sure Quite If you care to go downstairs and look you ll be sure Whatever shall we do Do I ll show you what we ll do Where s that revolver of Jack Martyn s which he lent you It s in my handkerchief drawer but it s loaded All the better I ve fired off a revolver before to day and I am quite willing at a pinch to fire off another one to night I ll show you what we ll do While she spoke Madge had been searching the drawer in question Now she stood with the weapon in her hand Perhaps you ll be so good as to get out of bed and put something on unless you prefer to go downstairs as the Woman in White I suppose you re not afraid Ella had got so far out of bed as to sit on the side with her feet dangling over the edge Well I don t know that I am exactly afraid but if you ask me if being woke in the middle of the night to be told there s burglars in the house is the kind of thing I m fond of I ll admit it isn t Madge laughed Ella s tone and air of exceeding ruefulness apparently struck her as comical It occurs to me Miss Duncan that it won t be long before mister Martyn makes a convert of you As for me now my blood s getting up and it is getting up I am beginning to think that it is rather fun Are you Then I m afraid your sense of humour must be keener than mine She followed Madge s example putting on a pair of slippers and a dressing gown Now what are you going to do I m going down to ask our guest to show me his card of invitation Madge Hadn t we better open the window and scream Or you might fire into the air if you re sure you do know how to fire a revolver I ll soon show you if I know and I ll show our visitor too And I don t think we d better open the window and scream Are you coming Madge moved out of the room Ella going after her with a rush Madge don t leave me The two girls stood listening at the top of the stairs Madge with the candlestick in one hand and the revolver in the other It strikes me that we sha n t be able to inquire for that card of invitation because he doesn t mean to stay for us to ask him His intention is not to stand upon the order of his going but to go at once Apparently the proceedings in Ella s bedroom had been audible below Evidently the person in the sitting room had become startled There was a stampede of heavy feet across the floor the noise of furniture being hastily pushed aside then they could hear the sound of the window being unlatched and opened It was plain that the intruder whoever it was was bent on showing a clean pair of heels It seemed as if the certitude of this fact had inspired Ella with sudden courage Anyhow she there and then shouted with the full force of her lungs as if she all at once had found her voice Who s that downstairs Speak exclaimed Madge with a nearly simultaneous yell or I fire And she did fire though no one spoke or for the matter of that had a chance of speaking for the words and the shot came both together What she fired at was not quite plain since if appearances could be trusted the bullet lodged in the ceiling for at the same moment a small shower of plaster came tumbling down Madge cried Ella I believe you ve sent the bullet right through the roof How you frightened me It was rather a startler admitted Madge in whose voice there seemed a slight tendency to tremor I d no idea it would make such a noise the other revolver I fired didn t Ella what are you doing The question was induced by the fact that Ella had rushed to the landing window thrown the sash up thrust her head out and was shouting as loudly as she could Thieves thieves help Madge came up and put her head out beside her Can you see him Has he gone Of course he s gone there he is running down the road Are you sure it s a man A man It s a villain Help thieves help Don t make that noise What s the use No one can hear you and it only gives him the impression that we re afraid of him which we re not as if he comes back again we ll show him There s more bullets in this revolver than one I remember Jack saying so and I m not forced to send them all through the roof Ella drew her head inside There was colour in her cheeks and fire in her eyes Now that the immediate danger seemed past her humour was a ferocious one I wish you d shot him Madge was calmer though still sufficiently sanguinary Well I couldn t very well shoot him if I never caught a glimpse of him could I But we ll do better next time Ella clenched her fists and her teeth too Next time Oh I think a burglar s the most despicable wretch on the face of the earth and if I had my way I d send every one caught in the act right straight to the gallows Precisely when caught But you can scarcely effect a capture by standing on the top of the stairs and inquiring of the burglar if he s there I know I behaved like a coward you needn t remind me But that was because I was taken by surprise If he were to come back Yes if he were to come back Madge looked out of the window casually I fancy there s some one coming down the road it may be he returning Ella clutched at her arm Madge You needn t be alarmed my dear I was mistaken it s no one after all Suppose instead of breathing threatenings and slaughters after the battle is over we go down and see what mementoes of his presence our visitor has left behind or rather what mementoes he has taken with him Are you sure he was alone We shall be able to make sure by going down to see Oh Madge do you think No my dear I don t or I should be no more desirous of going down than you I m only willing to go and see if there is some one there because I m sure there isn t There was not luckily There was little conspicuously heroic about the bearing of the young ladies as they descended the stairs to suggest that they would have made short work of any ruthless ruffian who might have been in hiding About halfway down Madge gave what was perhaps an involuntary little cough at which Ella started as if the other had been guilty of a crime and both paused as if fearful that something dreadful might ensue The sitting room door was closed They hung about the handle as if it had been the entrance to some Bluebeard s den and unimaginable horrors were concealed within When Madge giving the knob a courageous twist flung the door wide open Ella s face was pasty white Both perceptibly retreated as if expecting some monster to spring out on them But no one sprang apparently because there was no one there A current of cold air came from the room The window s open Ella s voice was tremulous Her tremor had the effect of making Madge sarcastic That s probably because our visitor opened it You could hardly expect him to stop to close it could you She went boldly into the room Ella hard on her heels She held the candle above her head to have it almost blown out by the draught She placed it on the table If we want to have a light upon the subject we shall have to shut that window She did so Then looked about her Well he doesn t seem to have left many tokens of his presence There s a chair knocked over and he s pushed the cloth half off the table but I don t see anything else He seems to have taken nothing Probably that was because there was nothing worth his taking If he came here in search of plunder he must have gone away a disgusted man If he came here in search of plunder what else could he have come for Ah that s the question What s this Stooping Ella picked up something off the floor Here s something he s left behind at any rate She was holding a scrap of paper What is it a piece de conviction of the first importance the button off the coat by means of which the infallible detective hunts down the callous criminal I don t know what it is It s a sort of hieroglyphic if it isn t nonsense Madge went and looked over her shoulder Ella was holding half a sheet of dirty white notepaper on which was written with very bad ink and a very bad pen in a very bad hand TOM OSSINGTON S GHOST Right Straight across three four up Right cat dog cat dog cat dog cat dog left eye push The two girls read to the end then over again Then they looked at each other Madge with smiling eyes That s very instructive isn t it Very There seems to be a good deal of cat and dog about it There does I wonder what it means If it means anything Madge taking the paper from Ella s hand went with it closer to the candle She eyed it very shrewdly turning it over and over and making as if she were endeavouring to read between the lines Do you know Ella that there is something curious about this I suppose there is since it s gibberish and gibberish is curious No I m not thinking of that I m thinking of the heading Tom Ossington s Ghost Do you know that that enterprising stranger who came in search of music lessons he didn t want asked me if my name was Ossington and if no one of that name lived here Are you sure Ossington was the name he mentioned It s an unusual one Certain it was because it was an unusual one that I particularly noticed it Then that dreadful woman was full of her ghosts even claiming as you heard to be the ghost s wife Doesn t it strike you under the circumstances as odd that the paper the burglar has left behind him should be headed Tom Ossington s Ghost It does seem queer though I don t know what you are driving at No I don t know what I am driving at either But I do know that I am driving at something I m beginning to think that I shall see a glimmer of light somewhere soon though at present I haven t the faintest notion where Do you think it was either of your visitors who has paid us another call to night No but I tell you what I do think What I shouldn t be surprised if we ve been favoured with a call from the individual who wasn t one of my visitors the man in the road who took to his heels in such a hurry at the sight of the woman What cause have you to suppose that None whatever I admit it frankly but I do suppose it all the same In the first place the man was burning to be one of my visitors of that I m persuaded and he would have been if the woman hadn t come along And in the second he looked a burglar every inch of him Ella I ll tell you what She brought her hand on to the table with a crash which made Ella start There s a mystery about this house you mark my words and see It s haunted in one sense if it isn t in another Ella cast furtive glances over her shoulder which were suggestive of anything but a mind at ease You ve a comfortable way of talking upon my word Madge threw her arms out in front of her There is a mystery about the house it s one of these old ramshackle sort of places in which there is that kind of thing I m sure of it Aren t you conscious of a sense of mystery about the place and don t you feel it s haunted Madge if you don t stop talking like that I ll leave the house this instant The notion is not altogether an agreeable one I ll allow but facts are What s that What s what Ella clutching at Madge s arm stared over her shoulder with a face white as a sheet Did didn t
4145_104606_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I hear 
none	none	s something in the kitchen Something in the kitchen If you did hear something in the kitchen I ll shoot that something as dead as a door nail Madge caught up the revolver which she had placed on the table Madge for goodness sake don t do anything rash I will do something rash if you call it rash to shoot at sight any scoundrel who ventures to intrude on my premises at this hour of the night and I ll do it quickly Do you think I m going to be played the fool with because I m only a woman I ll soon prove to you I m not that is if it is to be proved by a little revolver practice Madge spoke at the top of her voice her words seeming to ring through the house with singular clearness But whether this was done for the sake of encouraging herself and Ella or with the view of frightening a possible foe was an open question She strode out of the room with an air of surprising resolution Ella clinging to her skirts and following her simply because she dare not be left behind As it chanced the kitchen door was open Madge marched bravely into the room only to find that her display of courage was thrown away since the room was empty Having made sure of this Madge turned to Ella with a smile on her face though her cheeks like her friend s were whiter than they were wont to be You see we are experiencing some of the disadvantages of two lone lorn young women being the solitary inhabitants of a rural residence Jack Martyn scores For answer Ella burst into tears Madge took her in her arms as well as she could for the candle in one hand and the revolver in the other Don t cry girl there s nothing to cry at You ll laugh at and be ashamed of yourself in the morning I ll tell you what I ll make an exception you shall have half my bed and for the rest of the night we ll sleep together CHAPTER V A REPRESENTATIVE OF LAW AND ORDER The next morning information was given to a passing policeman of the events of the night and in the course of the day an officer came round from the local station to learn particulars Madge received him in solitary state she had refused Ella s offer to stop away from business to keep her company declaring that for that day at any rate she would be safe from undesirable intruders The officer was a plain clothes man middle aged imperfectly educated with the stolid matter of fact rather stupid looking countenance which one is apt to find an attribute of the detective of fact rather than fiction You say you didn t see him I saw the back of him Hum This stands for a sort of a kind of a sniff Would you know him if you saw him again From the glimpse which I caught of him last night I certainly shouldn t It was pretty dark and he was twenty or thirty yards down the road when I first caught sight of his back You didn t follow him We did not Madge smiled as she thought of how such a suggestion would have been received had it been made at the time He came in through the back window and left through the front That s it And he took nothing No but he left something behind him he left this Madge produced the half sheet of paper which Ella had picked up from the floor You re sure this was his property I m sure it isn t ours and I m sure we found it in this room just after he left it The officer took the paper read it turned it over and over looked it up and down read it again Then he gave his mouth a rather comical twist then he looked at Madge with eyes which he probably intended to be pregnant with meaning Hum He paused to cogitate I suppose you know there s been a burglary here before I know nothing of the kind We have only been here six weeks and are quite strangers to the place There was Something more than a year ago The house was empty at the time The man who did it was caught at the job and our chap got pretty well knocked about for his pains But that wasn t the only time we ve had business at this house our fellows have been here a good many times Neither my friend or I had the slightest notion that the house had such a reputation I daresay not It s been empty a good long time I expect the stories which were told about it were against its letting What sort of stories All sorts nonsense most of them Were the people who lived here named Ossington Ossington The officer screwed his mouth up into the comical twist which it seemed he had a trick of giving it I believe it was or at any rate something like it A queer lot they were very Do you see what s written as a heading on that piece of paper The officer s glance returned to the writing Tom Ossington s Ghost yes I noticed it but I don t know what it means do you Except that if the name of the people who lived here last was Ossington it would seem as if last night s affair had some reference to the house s former occupants Yes it would look as if it had when you come to look at it in that way He was studying it as if now he had made up his mind to understand it clearly It looks as if it was some sort of cryptogram and yet it mightn t be it s hard to tell He wagged his head I ll take it to our chaps and see what they can make of it Some men are better at this sort of thing than others Folding up the paper he placed it in his pocket book Am I to understand that you can give no description of the burglar that there s no one you suspect I don t know that it amounts to suspicion but there was a man hanging about here in rather a singular fashion whom I can t help thinking might have had a finger in the pie Can you describe him He was about my height I m five feet six and a half thick set and I noticed he walked in a sort of rolling way I thought he was drunk at first but I don t believe he was He kept his hands in his trousers pockets and he was very shabbily dressed in an old black coat I believe you call them Chesterfields which was buttoned down the front right up to the chin I doubt if he had a waistcoat a pair of old patched trousers and I m under the impression that his boots were odd ones He had an old black billycock hat with no band on crammed over his eyes iron grey hair and a fortnight s growth of whiskers on his cheeks and chin He had a half impudent half hang dog air altogether just the sort of person to try his hand at this sort of thing I ll take down that description if you ll repeat it She did repeat it and he did take it down with irritating slowness When she had finished he read what he had written tapping his teeth with the end of his pencil and looking most important I shouldn t be surprised if you ve laid your finger on the very man and if we lay our fingers on him before the day is over You will excuse my saying miss that you ve got the faculty of observation marked I couldn t have given a better description of a chap myself and I ve been a bit longer at the game than you have Now I ll just go through the place once more and then I ll go and then in due course you ll hear from us again He did go through the place once more and he did go Now observed Madge to herself as she watched him going down the road all that remains is for us in due course to hear from you again to some effect and that if you re the sort of blunderbuss I take you to be will be never Turning from the window she looked about the room speaking half in jest and half in earnest This is a delightful state of things truly It seems as if we couldn t have found a more undesirable habitation if we had tried Petticoat Lane Not the first burglar that s been in the place And the house well known to the police not to speak of a sinister reputation in all the country side Charming Clover Cottage seems to be an ideal place of residence for two lone lorn young women The abode of mystery and so far as I can make out a sink of crime one wonders if it still waits to become the scene of some ghastly murder to give to the situation its crowning touches I shiver or at any rate I ought to shiver when I reflect on the horrors with which I may be and probably am surrounded Ella returned earlier than the day before and this time she came alone The question burst from her lips the instant she was in the house Well has anything happened Nothing of importance It s true the police have been but as it appears that they ve been here over and over again before that s a trifle There s been at least one previous burglar upon the premises and it seems that the house has been known to the police and to the whole neighbourhood for years in the most disreputable possible sense Ella could but gasp Madge The statements which the officer had made were retailed with comments and additions and it may be added interpolations Ella was more impressed even than Madge had been being divided between concern and indignation To think that we should have been inveigled into taking such a place We ought to claim damages from those scamps of agents who let it us without a word of warning You can t think how I have been worrying about you the whole day long the idea of our being together in the place is bad enough but the idea of your being alone in it is worse What that policeman has said settles it Jack may laugh if he likes but my mind is made up that I won t stop a moment longer in the house than I can help the notion of your being all those hours alone here would worry me into the grave if nothing else did and so I shall tell him when he comes Madge s manner was more equable He will laugh at you you ll find and unless I m in error here he is to do it As she spoke there was a vigorous knock at the front door

none	none	 THE LONG ARM OF COINCIDENCE
4145_104606_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Go said Ella as she hastened from the room and open the door while I go upstairs and take my hat off 
none	none	Madge did as she was told 
4145_104606_000007_000001	train-clean-360	There were two persons at the door Jack Martyn and another 
4145_104606_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 This said Jack referring to his companion is a friend of mine 
4145_104606_000009_000000	train-clean-360	It was dark in the passage and Madge was a little flurried 
4145_104606_000009_000001	train-clean-360	She perceived that Jack had a companion and that was all 
none	none	Go into the sitting room I ll bring you a lamp in a minute 
4145_104606_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Ella has gone to take her hat off 
4145_104606_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Presently returning with the lighted lamp in her hand placing it on the table she glanced at Jack s companion and stared 
4145_104606_000011_000001	train-clean-360	In her astonishment she all but knocked the lamp over 
4145_104606_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Jack laughed 
4145_104606_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe he said you two have met before 
4145_104606_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Madge continued speechless 
4145_104606_000013_000001	train-clean-360	She passed her hand before her eyes as if to make sure she was not dreaming 
4145_104606_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Jack laughed again 
4145_104606_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I repeat that I believe you two have met before 
4145_104606_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Madge drew herself up to her straightest and her stiffest 
4145_104606_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Her tone was icy 
4145_104606_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I rather believe we have 
4145_104606_000017_000000	train-clean-360	She rather believed they had If she could credit the evidence of her own eyes the man in front of her was the stranger who had so unwarrantably intruded on pretence of seeking music lessons who had behaved in so extraordinary a fashion 
4145_104606_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 This went on Jack airily is a friend of mine Bruce Graham Graham this is Miss Brodie 
4145_104606_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Madge acknowledged the introduction with an inclination of the head which was so faint as to be almost imperceptible 
4145_104606_000019_000001	train-clean-360	mister Graham on the contrary bent almost double he seemed scarcely more at his ease than she was 
4145_104606_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid Miss Brodie that I ve behaved very badly 
4145_104606_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I trust you will allow me to express my contrition 
none	none	I beg you will not mention it she turned away I will go and tell Ella you have come 
4145_104606_000022_000000	train-clean-360	There came a voice from behind her 
4145_104606_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 You needn t Ella is aware of it already 
4145_104606_000024_000000	train-clean-360	As Ella came into the room she moved to leave it 
4145_104606_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Jack caught her by the arm 
none	none	Madge don t go away in a fume you wait till you have heard what I have got to say 
4145_104606_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Do you know that we re standing in the presence of a romance in real life on the verge of a blood curdling mystery Fact aren t we Graham 
4145_104606_000026_000000	train-clean-360	mister Graham s language was slightly less emphatic 
none	none	We are or rather we may be confronted by rather a curious condition of affairs 
4145_104606_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Jack waved his arm excitedly 
4145_104606_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I say it s the most extraordinary thing 
4145_104606_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Now honestly Graham isn t it a most extraordinary thing 
4145_104606_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 It certainly is rather a striking illustration of the long arm of coincidence 
4145_104606_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Listen to him 
4145_104606_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Isn t he cold blooded 
4145_104606_000031_000002	train-clean-360	If you d heard him an hour or two ago he was hot enough to melt all the ice cream in town 
4145_104606_000031_000003	train-clean-360	But you wait a bit 
4145_104606_000031_000004	train-clean-360	This is my show and I ll let you know it 
4145_104606_000031_000005	train-clean-360	Sit down Ella sit down Madge Graham take a chair 
4145_104606_000031_000006	train-clean-360	To you a tale I will unfold 
4145_104606_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Taking up his position on the hearthrug in front of the fireplace he commenced to orate 
4145_104606_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You see this man 
4145_104606_000033_000001	train-clean-360	His name s Graham 
4145_104606_000033_000002	train-clean-360	He digs in the same house I do To be perfectly frank his rooms are on the opposite side of the landing 
4145_104606_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 perfectly 
none	none	frank his rooms are on the opposite side of the landing 
4145_104606_000033_000003	train-clean-360	You may have heard me speak of him 
none	none	I have Often 
4145_104606_000034_000002	train-clean-360	This was Ella 
4145_104606_000041_000000	train-clean-360	This was Ella 
none	none	Have you 
4145_104606_000035_000001	train-clean-360	You must know Graham that there are frequently occasions on which I have nothing whatever to talk about so I fill up the blanks with what I may call padding 
4145_104606_000035_000002	train-clean-360	I say this because I don t want you to misunderstand the situation 
4145_104606_000035_000003	train-clean-360	This morning he lunched at the same crib I did 
none	none	Directly he came in I saw that he was below par so I said I always am a sympathetic soul I do hope Graham you won t forget to let me have an invitation to your funeral and in the meantime perhaps you ll let me know of what it is you re dying Now he s not one of those men who wear their hearts upon their sleeves for daws to peck at you know the quotation and if you don t I do and it was some time before I could extract a word from him even edgeways But at last he put down his knife and fork with a clatter it was distinctly with a clatter and he observed Martyn I ve been misbehaving myself I was not surprised and I told him so I m in a deuce of a state of mind because I ve been insulting a lady That s nothing I replied
4145_104606_000035_000006	train-clean-360	 I m always insulting a lady I may explain that when I made that remark Ella you were the lady I had in my mind s eye 
4145_104606_000035_000007	train-clean-360	At this point I would pause to inquire why Miss Brodie you did not take me into your confidence yesterday afternoon 
4145_104606_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 you did not 
none	none	take me into your confidence yesterday afternoon I did You did not I did
4145_104606_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 You told me about the lunatic lady because I suppose you could not help it since you were caught in the act but you said nothing about a lunatic gentleman He wagged his finger portentously 
4145_104606_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t think you deceive me Madge Brodie I smell a rat and one of considerable size 
none	none	Jack do go on This was Ella I will go on in my own way 
4145_104606_000042_000001	train-clean-360	If you bustle me I ll keep going on for ever 
4145_104606_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Don t I tell you this is my show 
4145_104606_000042_000003	train-clean-360	Do you want to queer it 
4145_104606_000042_000004	train-clean-360	Well as I was about to observe when I was interrupted Graham started spinning a yarn about how he had forced his way into a house in which there was a young woman all alone by herself and so far as I could make out gone on awful 
4145_104606_000042_000005	train-clean-360	 May I ask I said beginning to think that his yarn smelt somewhat fishy what house this was The place he replied as cool as a cucumber is called Clover Cottage What s that I cried I almost jumped out of my chair 
4145_104606_000042_000006	train-clean-360	 I say that the place is called Clover Cottage I had to hold on to the hair of my head with both my hands 
4145_104606_000042_000007	train-clean-360	 And whereabouts may Clover Cottage be On Wandsworth Common When he said that as calmly as if he were asking me to pass the salt I collapsed 
4145_104606_000042_000008	train-clean-360	I daresay he thought that I d gone mad 
4145_104606_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I began to wonder 
4145_104606_000043_000001	train-clean-360	This was Graham 
none	none	Did you 
4145_104606_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Let me tell you sir that as far as you were concerned I had long since passed the stage of wonder and had reached the haven of assurance 
4145_104606_000044_000002	train-clean-360	 Are you aware I cried that Clover Cottage Wandsworth Common is the residence of the lady whom I hope to make my wife Good Lord he said 
none	none	No I screamed good lady I fancy the waiter from his demeanour was under the impression that I was about to fight in which case I should have proved myself mad because as you perceive for yourselves the man s a monster
4145_104606_000044_000004	train-clean-360	 It seems to me I said that if the lady you insulted was not the lady whom I hope to make my wife it was that lady s friend which is the same thing 
4145_104606_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Is it interposed Ella 
none	none	You hear him Madge I hear
4145_104606_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Which is the same thing continued Jack 
4145_104606_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 And therefore sir I must ask you to explain He explained I am bound to admit that he explained there and then 
4145_104606_000047_000002	train-clean-360	He gave me an explanation which I have no hesitation in asserting Jack holding his left hand out in front of him brought his right list solemnly down upon his open palm was the most astonishing I ever heard 
4145_104606_000047_000003	train-clean-360	It shows the hand of Providence it shows that the age of miracles is not yet past it shows 
4145_104606_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Ella cut the orator short 
4145_104606_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind what it shows what s the explanation 
4145_104606_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Jack shook his head sadly 
4145_104606_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 I was about to point out several other things which that explanation shows with a view as I might phrase it of improving the occasion but having been interrupted for the third time I refrain 
4145_104606_000051_000001	train-clean-360	The explanation itself you will hear from Graham s own lips after tea 
4145_104606_000051_000002	train-clean-360	He is here for the purpose of giving you that explanation after tea 
4145_104606_000051_000003	train-clean-360	I believe Graham I am correct in saying so 
none	none	Perfectly 
4145_104606_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Only so far as I am concerned I am ready to give my explanation now 
4145_104606_000052_000002	train-clean-360	I cannot but feel that I shall occupy an invidious position in at any rate Miss Brodie s eyes until I have explained 
4145_104606_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Then feel 
4145_104606_000053_000001	train-clean-360	I ll be hanged if you shall explain now 
4145_104606_000053_000002	train-clean-360	Dash it man I want my tea I want a high tea a good tea at once 
4145_104606_000054_000000	train-clean-360	Ella sprang up from her chair 
none	none	Come Madge let s give the man his tea 
4145_104606_000056_000000	train-clean-360	It was a curious meal if only because of the curious terms on which two members of the party stood toward each other 
4145_104606_000056_000001	train-clean-360	The two girls sat at each end of the table the men on either side 
4145_104606_000056_000002	train-clean-360	Madge unlike her usual self was reserved and frosty what little she did say was addressed to Ella or to Jack 
4145_104606_000056_000003	train-clean-360	mister Graham she ignored treating his timorous attempts in a conversational direction with complete inattention 
4145_104606_000056_000004	train-clean-360	His position could hardly have been more uncomfortable 
4145_104606_000056_000005	train-clean-360	Ella influenced by Madge s attitude seemed as if she could not make up her mind how to treat him on her own account her bearing towards him to say the least was chilly 
4145_104606_000056_000006	train-clean-360	On the other hand 
4145_104606_000056_000007	train-clean-360	Jack s somewhat cumbrous attempts at humour and sociability did not mend matters and more than once before the meal was over mister Graham must have heartily wished that he had never sat down to it 
4145_104606_000057_000000	train-clean-360	Still even Madge might have admitted and perhaps in her heart she did admit that under the circumstances he bore himself surprisingly well that he looked as if he was deserving of better treatment 
4145_104606_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Half unconsciously to herself and probably quite unconsciously to him she kept a corner of her eye upon him all the time 
4145_104606_000057_000002	train-clean-360	He scarcely looked the sort of man to do anything unworthy 
4145_104606_000057_000003	train-clean-360	The strong rough face suggested honesty the bright clear eyes were frank and open the broad brow spelt intellect the lines of the mouth and jaw were bold and firm The man s whole person was suggestive of strength both physical and mental 
4145_104606_000057_000004	train-clean-360	And when he came to tell the story which Jack Martyn had foreshadowed it was difficult as one listened not to believe that he was one who had been raised by nature above the common sort 
none	none	He told his tale with a dramatic earnestness and yet a simple modest sincerity which held his hearers from the first and which before he had done had gained them all over to his side CHAPTER VII BRUCE GRAHAM S FIRST CLIENT I don t know he began if Martyn has told you that by profession I am a barrister No said Jack as he shook his head I have told them nothing to your credit Graham smiled the smile lighting up his features and correcting what was apt to be their chief defect a prevailing sombreness I am a barrister one of the briefless brigade One morning about fourteen months ago I left London for a spin on my bicycle It was the long vacation every one was out of town except myself I thought I would steal a day with the rest I came through Wandsworth meaning to go across Wimbledon Common through Epsom and on towards the Shirley Hills As I came down saint John s Hill my tyre caught up a piece of broken glass off the road and the result was a puncture or rather a clean cut nearly an inch in length I took it to a repairing shop by the bridge As I stood waiting for the job to be done two policemen came along with a man handcuffed between them a small crowd at their heels I asked the fellow who was doing my cycle what was wrong He told me that there had been a burglary at a house on the Common the night before that the burglar had been caught in the act had half murdered the policeman who had caught him and was now on his way to the magistrate s court As it seemed likely that the mending of my tyre would take some time actuated by a more or less professional curiosity I followed the crowd to the court The case was taken up without delay The statement that the constable who had detected what was taking place had been half murdered was an exaggeration as the appearance of the officer himself in the witness box disclosed But he had been roughly handled His head was bandaged he carried his arm in a sling and he bore himself generally as one who had been in the wars My experience small as it is teaches that constables on such occasions are wont perhaps not unnaturally to make the most of their injuries and to say the least the prisoner had not escaped scot free His skull had been laid open two of his teeth had been knocked down his throat his whole body was black and blue with bruises Indeed his battered appearance so excited my sympathy that then and there I offered him my gratuitous services in his defence My offer was accepted I did what I could However there was very little that could be done The burglary it seemed had occurred at a place called Clover Cottage Why cried Ella this is Clover Cottage Yes said Jack shaking his head with what he meant to be mysterious significance as you correctly observe this is Clover Cottage Didn t I tell you you d see the hand of Providence You just wait a bit you ll be dumbfounded mister Graham continued Clover Cottage it appeared was unoccupied There were in it neither tenants nor goods So far as the evidence showed it contained nothing at all Being found in an absolutely empty house is not as a rule an offence which meets with a severe punishment I was at a loss therefore to understand why my client should have made such a desperate defence and thus have enormously increased the measure of his guilt in the way he had done Had it not been for what was termed and perhaps rightly his assault on the police the affair would have been settled out of hand As it was the magistrate felt that he had no option but to send the case to trial which he did do there and then Before his trial I had more than one interview with my client in his cell at Wandsworth Gaol He told me by way of explaining his conduct an extraordinary story so extraordinary that from that hour to this I have never been able to make up my mind as to its truth Under ordinary circumstances I should have had no hesitation in affirming his statement or rather his series of statements was a more or less badly contrived set of lies But there was something about the fellow which assured me that at any rate he himself believed what he said He was by no means an ordinary criminal type and there seemed no reason to doubt his assertion that this was the first felonious transaction he had ever had a hand in He admitted he had led an irregular life and that he had come down the ladder of respectability with a run but he stoutly maintained that this was the first time he had ever done anything deserving the attention of the police He was a man about forty years of age he claimed to be only thirty six If that was the fact then the life he had been living and the injuries he had recently received made him look considerably older His name he said was Charles Ballingall By trade he was a public house broker once and that not so long ago in a very fair way of business He had had a lifelong friend I am telling you the story you understand exactly as he told it me named Ossington Thomas Ossington Ballingall always spoke of him as Tom Ossington Ellen looked at Madge Madge she exclaimed how about Tom Ossington s Ghost I know Madge sat listening with compressed lips and flashing eyes that was all she vouchsafed to reply mister Graham glanced in her direction as he went on According to Ballingall s story Ossington must have been a man of some eccentricity He was possessed of considerable means according to Ballingall of large fortune But his whole existence had been embittered by the fact that he suffered from some physical malformation For one thing he had a lame foot I know that he was lame This was Madge all eyes stared at her You knew How did you know Because she told me Ella s eyes opened wider She told you Who The ghost s wife The ghost s wife Yes the ghost s wife But never mind about that now mister Graham will perhaps go on And mister Graham went on This had preyed upon his spirits his whole life long and as his unwillingness to show himself among his fellows increased it had made of him almost a recluse He was however as it seemed a man of strong affections tender heart and simple disposition In these respects Ballingall could not speak of him with sufficient warmth There never had been he declared a man like Tom There was nothing he would not do for a friend self abnegation was the passion of his life Ballingall owned that he owed everything to Ossington Ossington had set him up in business had helped him in a hundred ways In return he Ballingall had rewarded him with the most hideous ingratitude This part of the story was accompanied by such a strong exhibition of remorse that I for one found it difficult not to believe in the fellow s genuineness In spite of his mis shapenness Ossington had found a wife apparently a lovely one The man loved her with the single eyed affection of which such natures as his are capable She on the other hand was as unworthy of his affection as she possibly could have been From Ballingall s account she was evil through and through he could find no epithet too evil to hurl at her But then it was very possible that he was prejudiced According to him this woman Ossington s wife loathing her devoted husband full to the lips with scorn of him had deliberately laid herself out to win his Ballingall s love and had succeeded so completely as to have caused him to forget the mountain load of gratitude under which he ought to have stumbled even to the extent of causing him to steal his friend s wife the wife who was the very light of that friend s eyes I think there was some truth in the fellow s version of the crime for crime it was and of the blackest dye He declared to me that as soon as the thing was done he knew himself to be the ineffable hound which he indeed was The veil which the woman s allurements and sophistries had spread before his eyes was torn into shreds and he saw the situation in all its horrible reality She was as false to him as she had been to her husband and he had been to his friend In a few months she had left him having ruined him before she went From that time his career was all downhill Remorse pursued him day and night He felt that he was a pariah an outcast among men that an ineffaceable brand was on his brow which would for ever stamp him as accursed It is possible that under the stress of privation for he quickly began to suffer actual privation his mind became unhinged But that he had suffered and was still suffering acutely for his crime the sweat of agony which broke out upon his brow as he told his tale was to me sufficient evidence Two or three years passed He sank to about the lowest depths to which a man could sink At last ragged penniless hungry he was refused a job as a sandwich man because of his incapacity to keep up with his fellows One night he was on the Surrey side of the Embankment near Westminster Bridge It was after one o clock in the morning shortly before he had heard Big Ben striking the hour He was leaning over the parapet in front of Doulton s factory you will observe that I reproduce the attention to detail which characterised this portion of his story such an impression did it make upon my mind As he stood looking at the water some one touched him on the shoulder Supposing it was a policeman who suspected his intentions he turned hastily round To his astonishment it was Tom Ossington Tom he gasped Charlie returned the other Come the first thing to morrow morning to Clover Cottage Without another word he walked rapidly away in the direction of the Wandsworth Road Ballingall distinctly noticing as he went that his limp had perceptibly diminished Left once more alone Ballingall was at a loss what to make of the occurrence Ossington s appearance at that particular moment so far away from home at that hour of the night was a problem which he found it difficult to solve He at last decided that the man s incurable tender heartedness had caused him to at least partially overlook the blackness of the offence and to offer his whilom friend succour in the depths of his distress Anyhow the next morning found the broken down wretch in front of Ossington s house of this house as I understand As mister Graham said this for some reason or other at least two of its hearers shivered Ella clasped her hands more tightly as they lay upon her knee and the expression of Madge s wide open eyes grew more intense Even Jack Martyn seemed subdued To his indescribable astonishment the house was empty A board in the garden announced that it was to be let or sold As he stood staring a policeman came along Excuse me he said but doesn t mister Ossington live here He did answered the policeman but he doesn t now Can you tell me where he is living I want to know because he asked me to call on him Did he Then if he asked you to call on him I should if I was you You ll find him in Wandsworth Churchyard That s where he is living now The policeman s tone was jocular Ballingall s appearance was against him Evidently the officer suspected him of some clumsy attempt at invention But as soon as the words were uttered Ballingall staggered back against the wall according to his own account like one stricken with death He was speechless The policeman with a laugh turned on his heel and left him there Impelled by some influence which he could not resist the conscience haunted vagabond dragged his wearied feet to the churchyard There among the tombstones he found one which purported to be erected to the memory of Thomas Ossington who had been interred there some two years previously While he stared thunderstruck at the inscription Ballingall assured me that Tom Ossington stood at his side and pointed at it with his finger Illustration Tom Ossington stood at his side and pointed at it with his finger To face p one hundred sixteen Graham paused His listeners fidgeted in their seats It was a second or two before the narrator continued You understand that I am telling you the story precisely as it was told me without accepting for it any responsibility whatever I can only assure you that whilst it was being told I was so completely held by what I can best describe as the teller s frenzied earnestness that I accepted his facts precisely as he told them and it was only after I got away from the glamour of his intensity of self conviction that I perceived how entirely irreconcilable they were with the teachings of our everyday experience Thenceforward Ballingall declared that he was never without a feeling that Ossington was somewhere in the intermediate neighbourhood to use his own word that he was shadowing him For the next week or two he lighted upon somewhat better times He obtained a job at road cleaning and in one way or another managed to preserve himself from actual starvation But shortly the luck ran out and one night he again found himself without a penny with which to buy either food or lodging He was struggling up Southampton Street in the Strand intending to hang about the purlieus of Covent Garden with the faint hope that he might be able to get some sort of job at the dawn of day when he saw coming towards him from the market Tom Ossington Ballingall shrank back into the doorway and while he stood there shivering Ossington came and planted himself in front of him Charlie he said why didn t you come to Clover Cottage when I told you Ballingall protested that he looked and spoke just like a rational being with the little air of impatience which had always been his characteristic that there was nothing either in his manner or his appearance in any way unusual and that there was certainly nothing to suggest an apparition A conversation was carried on between them just as it might have been between an ordinary Jones and Robinson I did come he replied Yes but you stopped outside Why didn t you come inside Because the house was empty That s all you know Yes repeated Ballingall that s all I do know There s my fortune in that house Your fortune Yes my fortune all of it I brought it home and hid it away after Lily went Lily was his wife s name He spoke of her with a sort of gasp Ballingall felt as if he had been struck What s your fortune to do with me Everything maybe because it is yours if you ll come and get it every farthing It s anyone s who finds it anyone s I don t care who it is What does it matter to me who has it now Why shouldn t it be yours There s heaps and heaps of money heaps More than you suppose It ll make a rich man of you set you up for life buy you houses carriages and all You have only got to come and get it and it is yours Think of what a difference it ll make to you of all that it will do for you of all that it will mean It will pick you out of the gutter and place you in a mansion with as many servants as you like to pay for at your beck and call And all yours for the fetching or anyone s for the matter of that But why shouldn t you make it yours Don t be a fool but come man come He continued urging and entreating Ballingall to come and take for his own the treasures which he declared were hidden away in Clover Cottage until turning round without a farewell word he walked down the street and disappeared into the Strand Ballingall assured me that he didn t know what to make of it and if he was speaking the truth I quite understand his difficulty He was aware that neither physically nor mentally was he in the best of health and he knew also that Ossington was continually in his mind He might be the victim of hallucination but if so it was hallucination of an extraordinary sort He himself had not touched Ossington but Ossington had touched him His touch had been solid enough he looked solid enough but how came he to be in Southampton Street if he was lying in Wandsworth Churchyard On the other hand the story of the hidden fortune was quite in accordance with what he knew of the man s character He always had a trick of concealing money valuables all sorts of things in unusual places And for him to have secreted the bulk of his capital or even the whole of it or what represented the whole of it and then to have left the hiding place unrevealed for some one to discover after he was dead and gone was just the sort of thing he might have been expected to do Anyhow Ballingall did not go to Clover Cottage the following day He found a job when the market opened and that probably had a good deal to do with his staying away The next night Ossington returned if I remember rightly just as Ballingall was about to enter a common lodging house And he came back not that night only but over and over again so far as I could understand for weeks together and always with the same urgent request that he would come and fetch the fortune which lay hidden in Clover Cottage At last torn by conflicting doubts driven more than half insane as he himself admitted by the feeling that his life was haunted he did as his mysterious visitor desired he went to Clover Cottage He hung about the house for an hour At last persuaded that it was empty he gained admission through the kitchen window No sooner was he in than a constable who unconsciously to himself had been observing his movements with suspicious eyes came and found him on the premises The feeling that after all he had allowed himself to be caught in something that looked very like a trap bereft Ballingall of his few remaining senses and he resisted the officer with a degree of violence which he would not have shown had he retained his presence of mind The result was that instead of leaving Clover Cottage the possessor of a fortune he left it to be hauled ignominiously to the stationhouse CHAPTER VIII MADGE AND THE PANEL And is that all the story asked Ella for mister Graham had paused All of it as it relates to Ballingall So far as he was concerned it brought his history up to date And what became of him He was tried at the Surrey Sessions There was practically no defence for of course I could not urge on his behalf the wild story he had told me All I could do was to plead extenuating circumstances He was found guilty and got twelve months And then Then I came in that was my first brief and my last Although I could not see my way to shape his story into the form of any legal plea still less could I erase it from my mind Never had I heard such a tale before and never had I listened to a man who had so impressed me by his complete sincerity as Ballingall had done when telling it He had struck me as being as sane as I myself was had used commonplace words had not gone out of his way to heighten their colour but had simply told the thing straight on exactly as it occurred I felt convinced that from his own point of view the affair was genuine Months went by and still the story stuck in my brain I found myself putting propositions of this kind There was a house called Clover Cottage and there had lived in it a man named Ossington an avowed eccentric for I had made inquiries in the neighbourhood and had learned that he had been regarded thereabouts as more or less insane Suppose in this empty house of his he had hidden something which was more or less valuable for which there existed no actual owner nor any designated heir What then The speaker paused again Then spoke more softly On his countenance the shadows seemed to deepen You must understand that I am a poor man All the world that knows me is conscious of my poverty but none but myself is aware how poor I really am I have felt and feel that if I can only hold on I shall win my way in my profession yet But it is the holding on which is so difficult Some time ago I came to the end of my resources and during the last year I have been living from hand to mouth Had I had my time more fully occupied I should have been able to banish from my mind the man s queer story or had I seen my way to earn money sufficient to supply my daily needs anyhow without forfeiting my right to call myself a professional man and so barring that gate to my future advancement my thoughts would not have turned so frequently to that possibly hidden useless hoard I was frequently conscious that the whole thing might be and probably was a pure phantasm and that there was no such hoard and never had been but at the same time I was persuaded that Ballingall had not been a conscious liar Things came to such a pitch that I found myself in possession of less than ten shillings and with nothing pawnable on which to raise the wind you must forgive my entering on these details but it is absolutely necessary if you are to have a complete comprehension of my position This I told myself was absurd and if there really was something hidden at Clover Cottage worth having which could be had for the finding it was absurder still I started then and there with a half formed resolution to put the matter to a final test and to look for myself I reached Clover Cottage to find that it was occupied There was a plate outside announcing that lessons were given in music My mind had been in a tolerable state of confusion when I started I was conscious of the apparent absurdity of my quest and that consciousness had not grown less as I went on The discovery that the house was tenanted made my confusion worse confounded More than half ashamed of my errand I was wholly at a loss what to do While I hesitated I chanced to glance up and there a few yards down the road was Ballingall I knew it was Ballingall This was Madge Ella turned on her You knew it was Ballingall How did you know it was Ballingall It seems to me that you know everything Miss Brodie observed Bruce Graham very naturally draws her own conclusions The sight of him turned me into a drivelling idiot In the confusion of my mind his appearance on the scene at that particular moment seemed nothing short of supernatural I felt as if I had been guilty of some act of treachery towards him and as if he had sprung from goodness alone knew where to catch me in the very act I blundered through the gate knocked at the door and almost forced my way into the house You did almost force your way into the house Madge s tone was grim I m afraid I did and being in I blurted out some nonsense about being in search of music lessons and generally misbehaved myself all round As a climax just as I was about to put an end to my intrusion I saw Ballingall staring at me through the window I would not have encountered him then for all the hidden hoards the world contains I entreated Miss Brodie to permit me to make my escape through the back door and she did Yes and insulted you as you went Graham rose from his seat You behaved to me Miss Brodie infinitely better than I deserved You would have been perfectly justified in summoning a policeman and giving me into charge I can only thank you for your forbearance I assure you of my most extreme penitence And while I cannot expect that you will forgive me at once But I do forgive you Madge had also risen Miss Brodie Of course I do And I did behave badly like a wretch But why didn t you explain You saw what at the moment was my capacity to explain and now you perceive how extremely complicated the explanation would have had to be But to think cried Ella that we should be in the very centre of a mystery Jack struck in Exactly living in the very heart of it surrounded by it on every side having it staring you in the face whichever way you turn What did I tell you Isn t it blood curdling Like the man says in the song you really never do know where you are Ella glanced at Madge The burglary last night do you think Of course it was Ballingall Without a doubt But my dear how can you be so sure He was hanging about all day he tried again last night it s as plain as it possibly can be Jack puzzled had been looking from one to the other Perhaps you will tell us what is as plain as it possibly can be Ella turned to him There was another burglary last night Where Here in the very middle of the night Upon my honour this appears to be Graham this really does appear to be a pleasant house to live in The delights of the country with the horrors of town thrown in Did you catch the ruffian Madge heard him first Oh Madge heard him first Yes and then she came and told me Where was he all the time Wait a bit and I ll tell you Then we both of us heard him then Madge fired Fired what Your revolver Gracious did she hit him She never saw him Never saw him Then what did she fire at Well Ella stopped as if somewhat at a loss So Madge went on I fired to let him know he was discovered I believe the bullet lodged in the roof Heavens what a target He took the hint and did not wait to be made a target of himself Then didn t you see him at all Through the window as he was running down the road Did you give the alarm We were in our night dresses Why he might have murdered the two of you if he had liked He might but he didn t Madge s tone was dry Ella put her hand up to her ears Jack don t talk like that I ve been shivering ever since You can t think what a day I ve had in town thinking of Madge in the house all alone My dear girl He put his arm about her waist to comfort her And you think that it was Graham s friend It was Charles Ballingall This was Madge Ella was less positive My dear how can you be so certain You only caught a glimpse of the man s back in the darkness He has committed burglary here before His presence in the daytime is followed by another burglary that same night Isn t the inference an obvious one Don t you think so mister Graham It looks exceedingly suspicious To convince a jury of his innocence he would have to prove an alibi The burglar whoever it was and for the sake of argument we ll say that we don t know took nothing with him but he left something behind him a piece of paper with writing on it When the police came today Do you mean to say that the police have been here to day Certainly or rather a sample of them And a lot of good he did or is likely to do I gave him the original piece of paper but not before I had copied what was on it Here is the copy What do you make of it mister Graham Madge handed a sheet of paper to the gentleman addressed As he looked at it Jack too impatient to wait his turn leaned over his elbow to look at it too My stars Tom Ossington s Ghost Large as life Here s thrillers What s that Right straight across three four up Here s mysteries Right cat dog cat dog cat dog dog cat dog left eye push there seem to be several dogs after a good few cats Perhaps it is my stupidity but while it s very interesting I don t quite see what it means Madge paid no attention to Martyn She kept her eyes fixed on his companion What do you make of it mister Graham she asked Bruce Graham continued silent for a moment longer keeping his eyes fixed upon the paper Then he looked up and met her glance I think that we have here the key of the riddle if we could only read it If we could only read it Nor from a superficial glance should I imagine that that would be very difficult Nor I One thing it seems to me that this paper proves that you were correct in your inference and that last night s burglar was Charles Ballingall I am sure of it You two interposed Martyn appear to be in thorough agreement thorough Which is the more delightful since you began by disagreeing But you must excuse my saying that I don t quite see where the cause for harmony comes in Are you so stupid My dear Madge Don t strike me It s constitutional Don t you see what the situation really is Well pardon me but really you are so warm Miss Brodie If this gentleman were to allow me to study this interesting document I might Somewhere in this house the dead man Tom Ossington concealed his fortune all that he had worth having It is as clear as if I saw the actual hiding place My gracious goodness Is it It is within a few feet of where we re standing At this moment we re hot I know I feel it Listen to that now Madge you must have second sight That scrap of paper contains as mister Graham puts it the key of the riddle It s a minute description of the precise whereabouts of the dead man s hiding place All we have to do is to find out what it means and if we are not all idiots that shouldn t be hard Why you ve only got to see the house you ve only to look about you and use your eyes to at once perceive that it s honeycombed with possible hiding places just the sort of crevices and crannies which would commend themselves to such a man as this Tom Ossington Look at this very room for instance it s wainscotted That means probably that between the outer wall and the wainscot there s an open space and who knows what beside Listen She struck the wainscot in question with her open palm You can hear it has a hollow backing Why she touched it again more gently then stopped as if puzzled why the wood work moves She gave a little cry Ella Madge They came crowding round her with eager faces CHAPTER IX THE THING WHICH WAS HIDDEN She had placed her hand against a portion of the wainscotting which was about level with her breast As in her excitement she had unconsciously pressed it upwards the panel had certainly moved Between it and the wood below there was a cavity of perhaps a quarter of an inch Push it Push it higher This was Jack Apparently that was just what Madge was endeavouring to do in vain It won t move It s stuck or something mister Graham advanced Allow me perhaps I may manage She ceded to him her position He placed his huge hand where her smaller one had been He endeavoured his utmost to induce the panel to make a further movement Put your fingers into the opening suggested Jack and lever it Graham acted on the suggestion without success He examined the panel closely If it were ever intended to go higher the wood has either warped or the groove in which it slides has become choked with dust Ella was peeping through the opening There is something inside there is I don t know what it is but there is something I can see it Oh mister Graham can t you get it open wider Here here let s get the poker we ll try gentle persuasion Jack forcing the point of the poker into the cavity leant his weight upon the handle There was a creaking sound and nothing else George it s stiff I m putting on a pressure of about ten tons As he paused preparatory to exerting greater force Madge brushing him aside caught the poker from him She drove the point against the wainscot with all her strength once twice thrice The wood was shivered into fragments There I think that s done the business So far as destroying the panel was concerned it certainly had Only splinters remained The wall behind was left almost entirely bare They pressed forward to see what the act of vandalism had disclosed Between the wainscot and the party wall there was a space of two or three inches Among the cobwebs and the dust there was plainly something something which was itself so encrusted with a coating of dust as to make it difficult without closer inspection to tell plainly what it was Ella prevented Jack from making a grab at it Let Madge take it it s hers she s the finder Madge snatching at it with eager fingers withdrew the something from its hiding place Covered exclaimed Jack with the dust of centuries It s covered returned the more practical Madge at any rate with the dust of a year or two She wiped it with a napkin which she took from the sideboard drawer Why cried Ella it s nothing but a sheet of paper Jack echoed her words That s all blue foolscap folded in four Madge unfolded what indeed seemed nothing but a sheet of paper The others craned their necks to see what it contained In spite of them she managed to get a private peep at the contents and then closed it hastily Guess what it is she said A draft on the Bank of Elegance for a million sterling This was Jack I fancy it is some sort of legal document This was Graham Ella declined to guess Don t be so tiresome Madge tell us what it is mister Graham is right it is a legal document It s a will the will of Thomas Ossington At least I believe it is If you ll give me breathing space I ll read it to you every word She drew herself away from them When she was a little relieved of their too pressing importunities she unfolded the paper slowly with dramatic impressiveness Listen to a voice from the grave She read to them the contents of the document in a voice which was a trifle shaky I give and bequeath absolutely this house called Clover Cottage which is my house and all else in the world which at present is or in time to come shall become my property to the person who finds my fortune which is hidden in this house whoever the finder may chance to be I desire that the said finder shall be the sole heir to all my worldly goods and shall be at liberty to make such use of them as he or she may choose I do this because I have no one else to whom to leave that of which I am possessed I have neither kith nor kin nor friend My wife has left me my friend has betrayed me my child is dead I am a lonely man May my fortune bring more happiness to the finder than it has ever brought to me God grant it This is my last will and testament Signed Thomas Ossington October the twenty second eighteen ninety two In the presence of Edward John Hurley Solicitor s Clerk thirteen Hercules Buildings Holborn And of Louisa Broome two Acacia Cottages Battersea Maid servant at present in the employ of the said Thomas Ossington The reading was followed by silence possibly the silence of amazement The first observation came from Jack By George The next was Ella s Dear life For some reason Madge s eyes were dim and her tone still shaking Isn t it a voice from the grave She looked down biting her lower lip then up again I think mister Graham this may be more in your line than ours She handed him the paper He read it Without comment he passed it to Jack who read it with Ella leaning over his shoulder He placed it on the table where they all four gathered round and looked at it The paper was stained here and there as with spots of damp But these had in no way blurred the contents The words were as clear and legible as on the day they were written The caligraphy was small and firm and a little finical but as easy to read as copperplate the handwriting of a man who had taken his time and who had been conscious that he was engaged on a weighty and a serious matter The testator s signature was rather in contrast with the body of the document and was bold and strong as if he had desired that the witnesses should have no doubt about the fact that it was his name he was affixing Edward John Hurley s attestation was in a cramped legal hand expressionless while Louisa Broome s was large and straggling the sign manual of an uneducated woman Jack Martyn asked a question addressed to Graham Is it a will a valid one I mean Looking at it on the surface I should say certainly if the witnesses can be produced to prove the signatures Indeed given certain circumstances even that should not be necessary The man expresses his wishes their meaning is perfectly plain he gives reasons for them No testator need do more than that What may seem the eccentric devising of his property is in his position easily accounted for and is certainly consistent with entire sanity Thousands of more eccentric documents have been held to be good in law I have little doubt if the testator s signature can be proved that the will is as sound as if it had been drawn up by a bench of judges Madge drew a long breath Jack was jocular or meant to be Think of that now But I don t see said Ella that we re any forwarder now or that we re any nearer to Madge s mysterious hoard The will if it is a will says that the fortune is hidden in the house but it doesn t give the faintest notion where We might pull the whole place to pieces and then not find it Suppose the whole affair is a practical joke mister Graham commented on Jack s insinuation I have been turning something over in my mind and I think Martyn that I can bring certain facts to bear upon your supposition which will go far to show that it is unlikely that there is much in the nature of a practical joke about the matter I want to call attention to Miss Brodie s copy of the paper which the burglar left behind last night to the second line Now observe He crossed the room The paper says Right I have the door post on my right close to my right arm The paper says straight across I walk straight across the room Miss Brodie have you a tape measure Madge produced one which she ferreted out of a work basket which was on a chair in a corner The paper says three I measure three feet from where I am standing along the wainscot you see It says four I measure four feet from the floor As you perceive that measurement brings us exactly to the panel behind which the will was hidden The paper says up As Miss Brodie showed there can be no doubt whatever that the panel was meant to move up Owing to the efflux of time and to disuse it had become jammed Does not all this suggest that we have here an explanation of part of what was written on the burglar s paper It does by George Graham cried Jack I always did know you had a knack of clarifying muddles Your mental processes are as effective in their way as a handful of isinglass dropped into a cask of muddy beer Ladies I give you my word they are Martyn was ignored If therefore part of the paper is capable of explanation of such a striking kind does it not seem probable that the rest of it also has a meaning a meaning which does not partake of the nature of a practical joke The idea declared Madge of a practical joke is utter nonsense As you say everything points the other way It is as clear as anything can be that while one part of the paper is a key to the hiding place of the will the other is the key to the hiding place of the fortune Very well said Jack Let s grant it I stand snubbed But perhaps you ll tell us what is the key to the key That s another question Very much another question But it needn t be an insoluble one if we use our wits The house isn t a large one it isn t as though it contained a hundred rooms mister Graham had been studying the scrap of paper This allusion to cats and dogs seems a striking one I notice that each word is repeated five times Is there anything about the house which gives you a hint as to the meaning Madge replied to the question with another Is there anything in this room which gives you a hint Look around and see I have been looking round and I confess there isn t Nor do I think it likely that the fortune would be hidden in the same room which contained the will Very well then we ll all of us go over the house together and we ll all of us look out for hints Madge led the way and they went over the house It was a tiny one Behind the solitary sitting room was the kitchen The kitchen was an old fashioned one with brick floor and bare brick walls coloured white In one corner a door led into the pantry in another was a door into the scullery there was nothing remarkable about either of these Under the staircase was a roomy cupboard They examined it with some thoroughness by the aid of a lamp without discovering anything out of the way On the floor above were the bedrooms used by Ella and Madge and a smaller room in which they stored their lumber The walls of these were papered from floor to ceiling and in none of them did there seem to be anything calculated to convey a hint as to the meaning of the cabalistic allusion It seems to me observed Jack when the work of exploration was completed that there s nothing about these premises breathing of either dogs or cats It is just possible said Graham that they may be in the grounds For instance several of them may be buried there and the reference may be to one of their graves Then do you propose to dig up the whole of the back garden till you light upon their hallowed bones Graham smiled I propose to do nothing Madge struck in But I do I mean to do a great deal I m going to strip all the wainscot off the sitting room wall and all the flooring up as well And I m going to continue that process till we reach the roof I m absolutely certain absolutely certain mind you that that unhappy man s hoard is somewhere within the four walls of this house and I give you my word that I mean to find it How about the landlord asked Graham What about his feelings By the way who is the landlord We re the landlord Ella and I or at any rate we very soon shall be But in the meantime I don t know anything about a landlord We took the house from Parker and Beading the house agents over by the station They would probably be acting for some principal Did they not tell you his name They told us nothing We took the house from them and the supposition is that we re to pay the rent to them If you will allow me I ll take the will away with me if you will trust me with it and obtain expert opinion as to its validity I will also call on Messrs Parker and Beading and ascertain if possible on whose authority they are acting When will you do this The agents I will call upon to morrow and will acquaint you by letter with the result You will do nothing of the kind or rather I would prefer that you did not Both Ella and I would prefer that you should come and tell us the result in person that is if you can spare the time mister Graham bowed expressing acquiescence in the lady s wishes And on that understanding the matter was left When the two men had gone Ella faced Madge with sparkling eyes Suppose Madge there should be a fortune hidden somewhere in the house Madge was scornful Suppose there s no supposition about it It s a certainty I know there is And suppose you should find it it would be yours What would you do with it What a question We shall find it all four of us together It will be share and share alike What mister Graham too Possibly the question was put maliciously It provoked Miss Brodie to wrath mister Graham too Ella what can you mean If it hadn t been for mister Graham we should have known nothing whatever about it I suppose that in strict equity the whole of it would be his Whatever can you mean by saying mister Graham too in such a tone as that My dear I meant no harm Really you re a trifle warm don t you think you are Warm It s enough to make any one a trifle warm to hear you talk like that Ella made a little face behind Miss Brodie s back Well fortune or no fortune I do hope that no more burglars will come and look for it again to night If they do declared Madge with a viciousness which presaged violence they ll not find us unprepared I shall sleep with Jack s revolver at my bedside and if you like you can have half my bed again Ella s manner was much more mild Thank you my dear since you re so good I think I will CHAPTER X MADGE FINDS HERSELF IN AN AWKWARD SITUATION There was no burglar The night was undisturbed and the next day was for both a busy one The morning post brought Madge an intimation from a publisher to whom she had submitted one of her MSS that he would be obliged if when she was in town she would call on him so that she might discuss with him terms for its publication That business like memorandum made her heart beat faster sent the blood coursing quickly through her veins added a sparkle to her eyes This after all was the sort of fortune she preferred one for which she had striven with her own brains and hands better than hidden hoards The simple breakfast became an Elysian feast Ella was almost as jubilant as she herself was Northcote company That s a good house isn t it Rather They published Madge reeled off the names of two or three pronounced fictional successes How much do you think they ll give you for it In cash not much don t you think I shall bring home the Bank of England So long as they give me a fair share of anything it may ultimately bring I ll be content But it isn t that it s getting the first footing on the ladder that s the thing Of course it is How splendid And I ll tell you what you shall dedicate it to me and then if it sells by the hundred thousand I shall have a bit of your fame Done and your name upon the flyleaf ought to help to sell the book it s as well known as mine is anyhow The author s spoken you shall be the dedicatee They went up to town together Ella had to be at her office at half past nine and it is true that that seemed a trifle early to make a call upon a publisher But as Ella correctly observed You can look at the shops until it is time Which is precisely what Madge did do And it is remarkable how many things she saw in the shop windows which she mentally resolved to purchase if the book succeeded Such an unusual number of useful things seemed to be displayed And it certainly is odd what a quantity of them were just the articles which Ella and she particularly required Her interview with the publisher was a delightful one She agreed to everything he proposed His propositions were not quite on the scale of magnificence which she had conceived as being within the range of possibility But still they were near enough to be satisfactory She was to have a sum of money paid her on the publication of the book not a large sum but still something And there was to be royalty besides When she hinted almost as if she had been hinting at something of which she ought to be ashamed that if part of the money were paid before publication it would be esteemed a favour that publisher went so far as to draw a check for half the amount and to hand it to her then and there It is a fact that Madge Brodie was an uncommonly pretty girl but such an accident was not likely to make any impression on the commercial instincts of a creature who battens upon authors She went straight off and cashed that cheque When she had the coin in her pocket actually in her pocket she felt the financial equal of a Rothschild She lunched all by herself at a restaurant in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross and a nice little lunch she had made some purchases with one eye on Ella and another on herself and then she went and gave a music lesson to Miss Clara Parkins whose father is the proprietor of the Belvedere Tavern that well known hostelry within a hundred miles of Wandsworth Common Miss Parkins was within a year or two of her own age an uncommonly shrewd young woman and a pleasant one to boot The lesson had not been proceeding two minutes before she perceived that something was disturbing the ordinarily tranquil currents of her teacher s mind When the lesson was finished she made a valiant effort to find out what that something was She looked down and she picked at the nap of her frock and she asked a tone or two under her usual key What is it I wish you d tell me Madge stared nothing which had gone before had led to such a question What is what What is it which makes you all brimming over Madge went red She was an arrant little snob and by no means proud of giving music lessons to a publican s daughter although that publican s daughter was the best paying pupil she had and not the least agreeable She was on her stilts in a moment I don t understand you That s a story Of course it s no business of mine But you do seem so happy and I think that sharing other people s happiness is almost as good as being happy yourself don t you But I m awfully sorry I asked Miss Parkins air of contrition melted Madge s mood As she adjusted her veil she condescended to explain I have had rather a stroke of luck I m awfully glad to hear it Of course I know you think nothing of me but I think no end of you I do hope that some one has left you a fortune I like it as well as if some one had though I daresay you ll think it s nothing I ve sold a book A book Oh one of your own writing I knew you were clever When is it coming out We ve hardly got so far as dates When it does come I ll buy a dozen and pay for them if you ll give me one with your name inside I ll give you the one without there being the necessity for your buying the dozen I knew you d say that I know you don t think I m good enough to buy your book But I don t mind I hope it will be a success That s very kind of you And it will be I m sure of it You re the sort that does succeed How do you make that out I don t know exactly but you are You ve got the air of success about you I noticed it when first I spoke to you And when people have got the air of success you ll generally find that they get the thing itself You student of the world She stooped and kissed the girl It was the first familiarity they had exchanged Miss Parkins put her arms about her neck and kissed her in return a half quizzical something in her eyes You mark my word you re the sort that does succeed Madge walked home with an added feeling of elation She laughed at the girl s pretension to what almost amounted to prophetic insight yet wondered if there might not be something in what she said At any rate it was nice to be believed in even by Miss Parkins She felt that she had done the young woman an injustice A publican s daughter after all is flesh and blood If the book succeeded should opportunity offer she would place it upon public record that Clara Parkins had foretold its success which would be fame for Clara She smiled at her own conceit The possibility that she might one day become an important person only loomed on the horizon since the advent of that note in the morning Immersed in such thoughts almost unwittingly she arrived at Clover Cottage Inserting her latchkey in the keyhole she turned and opened the door Almost as soon as she did so it was thrust violently back on her and banged in her face She was so startled that for a second or two she stared at the closed door as if in doubt as to what had really happened She had been in imagination so far away that it required positive effort on her part to bring herself back to earth Well she muttered below her breath that s cool I wonder who did that Perhaps it was the wind She did not stay to consider how the wind could have behaved in such an eccentric manner She gave her key another twist and the door a push But the key refused to act or to move in the direction required and the door stood still This under the circumstances singular behaviour of the key and the door seemed to rouse her to a clearer perception of the situation She gave the key a further twist exerting all her strength What is the matter It turned easily enough just now It would not turn then try how she might and the door would not budge Can the catch have fallen I don t see how it has never done anything of the kind before I wonder if some one s having a joke with me perhaps Ella has returned Acting on the supposition though it was two hours in advance of the time at which Miss Duncan might be generally expected she knocked at the door None answered She knocked again louder If Ella was having a jest at her expense it was hardly to be expected that she would put an end to the joke by answering her first summons She knocked again and again without result This is charming to be locked out of my own house is not what I expected She drew back in order to survey the premises Nothing was to be seen Perhaps I d better try the back door Since the front seems hermetically closed the back may be open for a change But it was not She rattled at the handle shook the door rapped at the panels with her knuckles No one heeded her She returned to the front with a curious feeling of discomfiture What can have happened It s very odd The door opened easily enough at first it felt as if some one had pulled it from within I wonder Hullo that s the time of day is it I saw that curtain move I fancy now Miss Ella Duncan that I ve caught you you are amusing yourself inside I ll give that knocker a hammering which I ll engage to say you shall hear She was as good as her word so far as the hammering was concerned She kept up a hideous tattoo for some three or four minutes without cessation But though it is not impossible that the din was audible on the other side of the Common within none heeded She was becoming annoyed Going to the sitting room window she tapped sharply at the frame Ella I saw you Don t be so silly Open the door You ll have all the neighbourhood about the place It s too bad of you to keep me outside like this It might be too bad but the offender showed no sign of relenting Madge struck her knuckles against the pane with force enough to break the glass Ella Still silence How can you be so stupid and unkind Ella open the door Or is it you Jack Don t think I didn t see you because I did I saw you move the curtain She might have done but the curtain was motionless enough now Madge was losing her temper fast In her estimation to be kept out of the house like this was carrying a sufficiently bad joke a good deal too far If you don t open the door at once I shall break the glass and let myself in that way She assailed the window pane with a degree of violence which suggested that she meant what she said then flattened her nose against it in an endeavour to discover who might be within While she peered the door was opened and some one did come in She started back Who on earth She was going to say Who on earth is that But when she got so far she stopped because she knew At least in part First through the door there came a woman And although she could scarcely credit the evidence of her own eyesight in her she recognised the visitor of the day but one before the creature who had persisted in calling herself the ghost s wife At her heels there was a man a perfect stranger to Madge Having recognised the woman she looked to see in her companion the loafer of the previous afternoon but this certainly was not he This was a miserable insignificant looking fellow very much down at heel and apparently very much down at everything else The woman with impudent assurance came striding straight to the window The man hung back exhibiting in his bearing every symptom of marked discomfort The female as brazen faced as if she was on the right side of the window stared at Madge And Madge stared at her amazed So amazed indeed that for a moment or two she was at a loss for words When they came at last they came in the form of an inquiry What she asked are you doing there The woman waved her hand in fact she waved both her hands as if repelling some noxious insect Go away she cried go away This house is mine mine Madge gasped That the creature was mad at the best she made no doubt But that conviction in the present situation was of small assistance What was she to do As she asked herself this question with no slight sense of helplessness the gate clicked behind her Some one entered the garden It was Bruce Graham CHAPTER XI UNDER THE SPELL mister Graham she exclaimed Really I do believe that if I had been asked what thing I most desired at this particular moment I should have answered you Graham s sombre features were chastened by a smile That s very good of you Look here Laying one hand against his arm with the other she pointed at the sitting room window His glance followed her finger tips Who s that That s what I should very much like to ascertain I don t quite follow you Do you mean that you don t know who she is I only know that I ve been away all day and that on my return I find her there How she got there I can t say but she seems determined to keep me out You don t mean that And have you no notion who the woman is She looks half mad I should think she must be quite mad It s the woman who forced herself into the house the day before yesterday after you had gone that s all I know of her This time she is not alone she has a man in there with her A man Not Ballingall No not Ballingall At least I only caught a glimpse of him but it s not the man who was watching you From her behaviour the woman must be perfectly insane We ll soon make an end of her insane or not Graham went to the window The woman completely unabashed had remained right in front of it an observant spectator of their proceedings He spoke to her Open the door at once She repeated the gesture she had used to Madge raising her voice at the same time to a shrill scream Go away go away This house is mine mine I don t want any trespassers here Graham turned to Madge Do you authorise me to gain an entry Certainly I don t want to spend the night out here Permission was no sooner given than the thing was done Grasping the upper sash of the window with both his hands Graham brought it down with a run tearing away the hasp from its fastening as if it had been so much thread It was a capital object lesson of the utility of such a safeguard against the wiles of a muscular burglar The upper sash being lowered in another moment the lower one was raised mister Graham was in the room The woman was possibly too astonished by the unceremonious nature of his proceedings to attempt any resistance even had she felt disposed Graham addressed Miss Brodie through the window Will you come this way or shall I open the door If you wouldn t mind I d rather you opened the door He opened the door Presently they were in the sitting room face to face with the intruders Graham took them to task the woman evincing no sign of discomposure Who are you and what is the meaning of your presence on these premises This house is mine mine It s all of it mine And who are you that you ask such a question of a lady She crossed her hands on her breast with an assumption of dignity which in a woman of her figure and scarecrow like appearance was sufficiently ludicrous Graham eyed her as if subjecting her to a mental appraisement Then he turned to the man And pray sir what explanation have you to offer of the felony you are committing This man was a little undergrown fellow with sharp hatchet shaped features and bent and shrunken figure He had on an old grey suit of clothes which was three or four sizes too large for him the trousers being turned up in a thick roll over the top of an oft patched pair of side spring boots There was about him none of the assurance which marked the woman the air of bravado which he attempted to wear fitted him as ill as his garments I ain t committed no felony not likely She asked me to come to her house so I come She says to me You come along o me to my house and I ll give you a bit of something to eat Now didn t you Certainly I suppose a gentleman is allowed to visit a lady if she asks him The dreadful looking woman as she stood with her head thrown back and her nose in the air presented a picture of something which was meant for condescension which was not without its pathos Of course ain t that what I m saying She come here and she took a key out of her pocket and she put it in the keyhole and she opened the door all quite regular and she says This here s my house and she asked me to come in so of course I come in Do you mean to say that she gained entrance to this house by means of a key which she took from her pocket Course How do you suppose we came in through the window Not hardly that s not my line and so I tell you Graham returned to the woman Be so good as to give me the key with which you obtained admission to these premises The woman put her hand up to her neck for the first time showing signs of discomposure The key Starting back she looked about her wildly and broke into a series of shrill exclamations The key my key no no no It is all I have left the only thing I ve got I ve kept it through everything I ve never parted from it once I won t give it you no She came closer to him glaring at him with terrible eyes It s my key mine I took it with me when I went that night He was sitting in here and I came downstairs with the key in my pocket and I went and he never knew And I ve kept it ever since because I ve always said that one day when I went back I should want my key to let me in I hate to have to stand on the step while they are letting me in mister Graham was regarding her intently as if he was endeavouring to read what stood with her in the place of a soul Is your name Ossington Ossington Ossington She touched the sides of her forehead with the tips of her fingers glancing about her affrightedly as if making an effort to recall her surroundings Her voice dropped to a whisper Who said Ossington Who said it Who asked if my name was Ossington mister Graham addressed Miss Brodie With your permission I should like to speak to this woman after the man has gone In his last words there was meaning By all means if you wish it Get rid of him at once At the best the fellow is an impudent intruder and the story he tells is a ridiculously lame one He must have been perfectly well aware that a woman of this sort was not likely to possess a house of her own and that accepting what he calls her invitation he was committing felony The fellow in question shook his head as if he felt himself ill used I call that hard cruel hard If the young lady was to think of it for half a moment she d see as it was cruel hard The young lady declines to think of it Have the goodness to take yourself away and consider yourself lucky that you are allowed to escape scot free The man moved towards the door endeavouring to bear himself as if he were doing so of his own free will He spoke to the woman Ain t you coming with me Yes I m coming She hastened towards him Graham interposed Let him go There are one or two things about which we should like to speak to you this young lady and I after he has gone But she would have none of him Shrinking back she stared at him in silence for a second or two then began to shriek at him like some wild creature I won t stay I won t I shall go I shall You tried to get my key my key You touch it you dare You asked me if my name she stopped stared about as if in terror gave a great sigh You asked me if my name She stopped again and sighed again the pupils of her eyes dilating as she watched and listened for what was invisible and inaudible to all but her Graham moved forward intending to soothe her Mistaking apparently his intention she rushed at him with outstretched arms giving utterance to yell after yell In a moment she was past him and flying from the house Her male companion who stood still in the doorway pointed his thumb over his shoulder with a grin There you are you see drove her out of her seven senses So you have Much more leisurely the man went after the woman For some reason when mister Bruce Graham and Miss Brodie were left alone nothing was said about the recent visitors If you ll sit down and wait remarked Miss Brodie I ll go and take my things off Having returned from performing those sacred offices the topic still remained untouched Possibly that was because there were so many things which needed doing When one has been out all day and keeps no maid when one returns there are things which must be done For instance there was a fire to make Miss Brodie observed that there ought to have been two one in the kitchen and one in the sitting room but declared that folks would have to be content with one And that one Bruce Graham made She brought in the wood and the coal and the paper and then she went to fetch the matches When she returned she caught him in the act What are you doing she demanded He was on his knees on the hearthrug with some sticks in his hand Making a fire on scientific principles I m a scientific expert at this kind of thing Women s methods are unscientific as a rule Indeed Her air was scornful Men always think they can make fires It s most surprising She commented on his methods particularly when he took the pieces of coal from the scuttle and placed them in their places with his fingers That s right Men always use their fingers to put coal on the fire if they can It s an agreeable habit He continued calm It s scientific strictly scientific and may be logically defended especially when a fire is being lighted Heaping on coal with a shovel is unscientific in the highest degree He struck a match presently the paper was in flames Now you had better go and wash your hands You ll have to do it in the scullery and by the time you re done the fire will be out But the fire was not out It was a complete success The kettle was put on preparations were made for tea and the table was laid Graham showing a talent for rendering assistance which was not accorded the thanks it might have been Madge was chilly I should imagine you were rather a handy person to have about the house There are diversities of gifts let us hope that each of us has at least one Exactly But unfortunately I do not care to see a man what is called making himself useful about the house if your gift lies in that direction I suppose it is because I am not enough of a New Woman Perhaps now you ve given me your assistance in laying the cloth you will give me some music He was smoothing a corner of the cloth in question and looked down It is you who are the teacher She flashed up at him What do you mean by that It is true is it not If you wish me to understand that you would rather not play have the goodness to say so plainly Whereupon he sat down and played And Madge listened When he stopped she was looking away from him toward the fire Tears were in her eyes I suppose you are a genius Her voice seemed a little strained He shook his head No the music comes out of the ends of my fingers He went on playing When he ceased again she turned to him with passionate eyes I never heard any one play like you before It s because I m in the mood He played on It seemed to her that he spoke to her out of the soul of music She sat still and listened Her heart strings tightened her pulses throbbed her cheeks burned every nerve in her frame was on the alert Never had such things been said to her before She could have cried and would have cried if she had dared The message breathed to her by Bruce Graham s playing told of a world of which she unconsciously had dreamed He played and she sat and listened in the firelight till Ella came home to tea And with Ella came Jack Martyn CHAPTER XII TOM OSSINGTON S LAWYER It was while they were seated at table that Bruce Graham told them of the result of his investigations Although for some reason the subject had not been mentioned when Madge and he had been alone together that young lady showed herself alert and eager enough then Nor in that respect was Ella behind her friend while Martyn concealed an interest which was probably equal to theirs under ponderous attempts at jocularity It was Jack who brought him to the point If the honourable and learned gentleman has sufficiently refreshed himself with the cup that cheers would he oblige the company by mentioning if he has done anything in the matter of the Hidden Treasure with capitals please and if so what I have at least found that everything points to there being such a hidden treasure in spite of Jack s pretended scepticism My pretended scepticism Sir I would have you know that I am no sceptic or if I am never was one more willing to be converted to the faith Ella interposed And mister Graham you really think there is a hidden treasure I think it extremely probable Tell us all about it What have you been doing All day long I have been dreaming in the City of what would happen if we did light upon a secret hoard It really would be too splendid for words The young lady looked the eagerness which the words suggested like an imaginative child who pictures the materialisation of some favourite tale of faerie To begin with I went to the house agents to learn for whom they are acting Well and what did they say They were not particularly willing to say anything as I expected They were apparently under the impression that I intended to take the bread out of their mouths by dealing with their principals direct But when I had succeeded in at any rate partly reassuring them they informed me they were acting for a firm of solicitors Messrs Nicholls Hawkins three South Square Gray s Inn Well and what did you do then I went to the solicitors It is awfully good of you to take so much trouble And what did they say As it happened I had some knowledge of the firm My father was on terms of friendship with their senior partner so that when I introduced myself to mister Nicholls as my father s son the way was smoothed for me They have the reputation of being a steady going old fashioned firm and I found them as open and above board as they very well could have been When I mentioned my errand mister Nicholls was all alive at once Messrs Palmer Beading of Wandsworth I began inform me that in letting Clover Cottage they are instructed by you May I ask who is the owner of the property When I said that he sat up straight in his chair and as I observed became all alive oh May I inquire in return why you ask the question The question I admitted is a little irregular but I take it that you will have no objection to give me an answer Not the slightest On the contrary we shall be delighted if you will help us to throw light into what is at present a very dark corner because as a matter of fact so far as we are concerned there is no owner The late Thomas Ossington died intestate So far as our knowledge goes Leaving instructions that you should act on his behalf Not a bit of it So far as we re aware he left no instructions of any sort or kind We have assumed a responsibility of which we should be glad to be rid Do you know the man s history I know something of it though I confess candidly that I should like to know more My own connection with the matter is a curious one At a later stage I will tell you exactly what it is In the interim I assure you on my word of honour that any information you can give me shall be used for the furtherance of justice and for that only Very good so long as right is done all that we require is to be relieved of a very awkward situation You know that Ossington was peculiar Not insane Insane No he was as sane as you are every whit But he was a disappointed man He was malformed the muscles of one leg were paralysed As he grew older the paralysis increased until it extended up the whole of one side and at last it killed him He married a girl who acted as book keeper at an hotel at which he was in the habit of stopping at Ilfracombe She turned out a regular bad lot finally running away with a man named Ballingall Charles Ballingall That s the man Do you know him I have acted for him professionally Have you Then let me inform you without prejudice that you have acted for as rascally a scamp as ever trod the earth Ossington regarded him as a particular friend and as particular friends sometimes have a knack of doing he borrowed no end of money from Ossington ending by robbing him not only of his money but of his wife as well The double blow almost broke Ossington s heart and during the remainder of his existence he lived the life of a recluse But until then we had acted for him continually For instance we had acted for him in the purchase of Clover Cottage Do you hold the deeds of the house Not a deed We hold nothing All that we have are the various letters which he wrote to us at various times on business We had heard nothing of him for months when one morning we received a telegram asking us to go at once to Clover Cottage I went myself I liked the man He was in his way as fine a gentleman as I ever met He had been cruelly used by friend and fortune I found him dead alone in the house there with a maid and a doctor dead killed according to the medical testimony by a paralytic affection of the heart but actually as sure as you and I are alive by the wicked wanton usage of those he had held dear Now here the queer part of the thing comes in His last words had been an instruction to send for us but that was the only instruction he had given I myself searched the house from top to bottom and as you know it is not a large one I had it searched by others every nook and cranny Not a scrap of writing could be discovered letter note or memorandum Not a document of any sort of kind Nothing whatever to show of what he had died possessed or to whom it was to go You had reasons to suppose that he had means Every reason We had every reason to believe him to be a man of comfortable means We ourselves had on more than one occasion acted for him in matters involving thousands of pounds We applied to the National and Provincial Bank where we were aware he had an account They informed us that he had closed the account some two months previously and that on that occasion they had handed him over six thousand pounds in notes on the Bank of England They gave us a list of the numbers of the notes and not one of them has been presented for payment to this day Is that so It is We furnished the Bank with a copy of the list requesting them to notify us should one of them come in as yet not a single one of them has made its appearance Where are those notes Surely if they were in the possession of any living person ere this some of them would have been presented Where are the title deeds of Clover Cottage and of other properties of which he was the undoubted owner He is the registered holder of ten thousand Great Northern Railway Stock Since his death the dividends on it have remained unclaimed Where is the scrip With the rest has it vanished into air In a box in his bedroom were forty seven pounds in gold That was all the cash the house contained We buried him in Wandsworth Cemetery Hawkins I and the doctor were the only mourners We sold the furniture paid the expenses and the balance stands to the credit of the estate We advertised for next of kin without results We advertised also for information as to the whereabouts of any property of which he might have died possessed such as title deeds and anything of that kind You understand that there is a delicate question as to who is entitled to collect the rents of other properties which we believe to have been his freehold But nothing came of that Clover Cottage we placed in the hands of Messrs Parker and Beading but only recently have they succeeded in letting it I believe to two single ladies So I understand Jack struck in You are the two single ladies You pointing to Ella are one of them and you pointing to Madge are the other Ella was impatient Jack I do wish you wouldn t interrupt mister Graham do go on It s like a romance My curiosity is such that I feel as if I were all pins and needles Bruce Graham continued And you mister Nicholls I said have you formed no theory of your own upon the subject Old Nicholls leaned back in his chair He put his hands into his two pockets and he looked at me out of the corners of his eyes I have I have formed a decided theory But upon my word I don t know what right you have to ask me I trust before we part to prove to your entire satisfaction that I have every right What s the nature of your theory What s the nature of your right I laughed I saw that he meant to understand more clearly where we stood before he went any further I believe I am in a position to produce an owner for the property when found When found Precisely when found As yet it still remains to be found I must ask you not at this moment to press me for further details and of course you on your part are entitled to keep your theory to yourself I am entitled to keep my theory to myself as you say But I know your father was an honest man and as it happens I know something about you and I believe you also are an honest man So as I am anxious for many reasons that this Ossington mystery should be unravelled you shall have my theory for what it s worth He tilted his chair on to its hind legs watching me keenly all the time Thomas Ossington was peculiar not in any sense of the word insane but out of the common run In particular he was secretive especially latterly as perhaps was only natural My theory is that distrusting banks and all such human institutions he secreted his cash his title deeds and everything he valued in some hiding place of his own contriving and that there it remains concealed unto this hour The two girls rose simultaneously Madge cried Ella did you hear that That s exactly what you said In Madge s tones there was the ring of an assured conviction I was sure of it and I am sure of it as sure as any one possibly can be May I ask inquired Jack with mock severity who is it who is interrupting now Will you let the gentleman go on Graham went on But where I said do you think he is likely to have found such a hiding place Old Nicholls looked at me if possible more shrewdly than ever At Clover Cottage I knew the man The salient events of his life happened there In his whimsical way he regarded it as part and parcel of himself I have heard him say so half a dozen times His heart was in the place Whatever he did conceal was concealed within its four walls Before the furniture was sold I had it overhauled by an expert some of the things were pulled to pieces His verdict was that nothing was hidden there Had I had my way I would have dismantled the whole house only Hawkins was against me He said very properly that if the heir at law proved cantankerous I might be made to smart in damages to the tune of a pretty penny So I abstained All the same if the house was in the market to morrow I d be a purchaser at a good round sum if all rights of treasure trove went with it You may tell the present tenants here he looked at me in a fashion which took me a little aback if you have the honour of their acquaintance that we keep a sharp eye on the property that it is not to be tampered with to the extent of one jot or tittle and that not so much as one inch of paper is to be taken off the wall except with our express permission Ella turned to Madge What do you say to that she exclaimed That knocks on the head all your notions of pulling the house to pieces Madge was defiant Does it It does nothing of the kind Not after what I found in this very room last night In the face of that I care nothing for mister Nicholls or for his threats either What do you think yourself mister Graham If you will allow me I will give you my own opinion when I have told you of all that passed between mister Nicholls and myself Indeed I am now coming to that very point There you are you see You will not let the man finish you really won t I never saw anything like you women for interrupting never in all my life This of course was Jack who was as usual ignored Graham brought his story to an end There is one more question I said which I should like to ask you mister Nicholls Do you know any one of the name of Edward John Hurley I ought to seeing that some one of the name of Edward John Hurley is in our office at this moment and has been in our office for something over a quarter of a century Can I see him mister Nicholls touched a bell and presently mister Hurley entered I felt that his presence on the spot was a stroke of luck for which I had certainly been unprepared He was a tall thin dignified looking man with grey hair He wore spectacles Taking them off he wiped them with his handkerchief before he replaced them on his nose to look at me Do you remember mister Hurley I began the twenty second of October eighteen ninety two The twenty second of October eighteen ninety two He repeated my words then replied to my question with another May I inquire why you ask I will put my question in another form Do you remember witnessing mister Thomas Ossington s attachment of his signature to a certain document on the twenty second of October eighteen ninety two I had noticed that mister Nicholls and he had exchanged glances when I first put my query Now he looked at his principal evidently in search of guidance Shall I answer this gentleman s question sir Certainly Give him all the information you can This mister Hurley proceeded to do with the utmost clearness I do remember the twenty second of October eighteen ninety two and the whole of the circumstances I chanced to meet mister Ossington in Holborn as I was leaving the office He asked me if I would dine with him in his house at Wandsworth I went with him to dinner there and then After dinner he asked me if I would witness his signature I expressed my willingness I witnessed it Were you acquainted with the nature of the document he was signing I was not I have often wondered what it was especially in the light of after events The document which was on a sheet of blue foolscap had evidently been prepared before my arrival mister Ossington covering the writing with a piece of blotting paper signed it in the middle of the page directly underneath while I affixed my signature as witness on the left hand side Was there another witness There was the servant girl What was her name I never heard it I only know that he called her Louisa I think I should recognise her if I saw her again She was a red faced light haired strapping wench about eighteen years of age Should you recognise Ossington s signature and your own and the document to which they were attached Most decidedly under any circumstances at any time I thanked him for his frankness and rose to go Nicholls stopped me One moment he said Hurley informed us at the time of what he has just now told you and like him we have frequently wondered what was the nature of the document he witnessed As you are evidently aware that such a paper existed once upon a time you are probably acquainted with its present whereabouts I am It will be produced in due course When I promise you you will see as curious a document as is to be found upon the records Both Nicholls and Hurley endeavoured to induce me to be more definite But I was not to be persuaded Thanking them for the information they had given me I came away CHAPTER XIII AN INTERRUPTED TREASURE HUNT Well inquired Martyn when Graham had finished what is the situation now First of all struck in Madge how about the will As regards the will I do not hesitate to say that it is as sound and valid a declaration of the testator s wishes as has been admitted to probate mister Hurley s testimony removes all doubt upon that point A man has a right to do what he will with his own and that is all mister Ossington has done How does it effect our right of search That is another question The will gives neither you nor any one else a title for the destruction of property It simply conveys to the finder the possession of certain things which are not specifically mentioned But it authorises no one to look for those things still less to do damage while looking Then is our search barred Aren t we to look at all I don t say that My advice is to put the legal aspect aside and to regard the common sense one only The will says that certain things when found are to become the property of the finder and this house with them You have reason to believe that those things are concealed within this house Then it is for you to consider whether it is worth your while to run the risk of becoming responsible for any damage you may do in case of your failure to find those things My opinion is that it is worth your while to run that risk that it is worth any one s while to run that risk Madge stood up with resolute lips and sparkling eyes She struck her hand upon the table I m sure it is I know it is Bruce Graham also rose I am willing to share the risk if it is shareable or to assume the whole of it for the matter of that I incline strongly to your belief Miss Brodie that there is something hidden well worth the finding and that its hiding place is within the walls of Clover Cottage Jack Martyn hammered his fist upon the table Hear hear bravo spoken like a man Pon my word I m beginning to think that there is something in it after all A conviction is creeping over me slowly but surely that in less time than no time I shall be filling my pockets with the contents of Aladdin s Cave and as there is only a bent sixpence and two bad pennies in them at present there s plenty of room for more The point is said Ella where are you going to begin to look I am going to do what mister Nicholls wanted to do declared Madge tear the house to pieces But my dear even if you set about the business in that drastic fashion you ll require method How are you going to begin to take the house to pieces by taking the slates off the roof and the chimney pots down And by taking the windows out of their frames and the doors off their hinges and displaying the grates in the front garden George you ll be improving the property with a vengeance if you do I propose to do nothing so absurd I simply wish you to understand that before I give up the search the house will literally have been torn to pieces though I assure you Ella that I do not intend to begin by taking off either the slates or the chimney pots Have you been able to make anything more of the writing which was left behind by your burglarious visitor The inquiry came from Graham Madge shook her head Let me try my hand at it cried Jack I have brains I place them at your service It is true I never have been able to solve a puzzle from my very earliest hours but that is no reason why I should not begin by solving this The scrap of paper was given him He spread it out on the table in front of him Leaning his head upon his hands he stared at it the expression on his face scarcely promising a prompt elucidation The first part is simple extremely simple Especially after mister Graham s last night s lucid exposition Otherwise I should have described it as recondite But the second part s a howler yes a howler Right cat dog cat dog cat dog cat dog left eye push The conjunction is surprising I can only remark that if that assorted collection of animals is bottled up somewhere in this house all together that alone would be a find worth coming upon There will be some lively moments when you let the collection out Did you mention anything to mister Nicholls about the paper asked Madge of Graham Not a syllable I gathered from what he said that the house was done up before it was let papered painted and so on and that therefore any former landmarks to which it might have been alluding have probably disappeared That s what I think and that s what I mean by saying we shall have to pull the house to pieces Even if that is the case as Miss Duncan puts it where are you going to begin You must remember that you will have to continue living in the house while it is being dismantled and that you must spare yourselves as much discomfort as possible It seems that you have to begin by pushing the left eye said Jack who still was studying the paper Though whether it is the left eye of the entire assorted collection is not quite clear If that is the case and that remarkable optic has to be pushed with any degree of vigour I can only say that I shall take up a position in the centre of the road till the proceedings are concluded Why not commence asked Madge with a thorough examination of the room which we re now in You yourself said Ella admitted last night that it was hardly likely that the treasure would be hidden in the same room which contained the will Madge pursed her lips and frowned I ve been thinking about that since and I don t at all see why we should take it for granted One thing s certain the room is honeycombed with possible hiding places There are hollows behind the wainscot the walls themselves sound hollow That unhappy man can hardly have found a part of the house better adapted to his purpose See there what s that Ella was pointing to a kind of plaster cornice which ran round the room What are those things which are cut or moulded on that strip of beading if it is beading under the ceiling They look to me like some sort of ornamental bosses said Graham They certainly are neither cats or dogs decided Madge I m not so sure of that you know what extraordinary things they tell you are intended to represent things which are not in the least bit like them Where s that paper Jack give me that paper Jack gave it her She glanced at it Right I ll take up a position like you did last night mister Graham to the right of the door cat dog cat dog cat dog cat dog now Well queried Madge for Ella had stopped Now what I think continued Ella with evident dubitation that I ll again do what you did last night mister Graham and cross right over though it says nothing about it here but perhaps that was omitted on purpose She marched straight across the room Now we ll take the first thing upon the beading or whatever it is to be a cat and we ll count them alternately cat dog the fifth dog Very good said Graham standing close up to the wall and pointing with his outstretched hand Cat dog cat dog cat dog cat dog here you are Now left eye push Or shove suggested Jack But there is no eye whether left or otherwise That s a detail murmured Jack Let me see Ella clambered on to a chair From that position of vantage she examined the protuberances in question There really does seem nothing which could represent an eye the things look more like knuckle bones than anything else What s the odds Let s all get hammers and whack the whole jolly lot of them in the eye or where if right is right it ought to be And then if nothing happens and we ll hope to goodness nothing will we ll whack em again I m afraid Ella put in Madge that your cats and dogs are merely suppositions I vote by way of doing something practical that we start stripping the wainscot You ll find hiding places enough behind that and it s quite on the cards something in them Certainly assented Jack I am on Bring out your hatchets pickaxes crowbars and other weapons of war and we ll turn up our shirt sleeves and shiver our timbers and not leave one splinter of wood adhering to another Buck up Graham Take off your coat my boy You re going to begin to enjoy yourself at last I give you my word Ella possibly slightly exacerbated by the failure of her little suggestion endeavoured to snub the exuberant mister Martyn I don t know if you think you re funny Jack because you re only silly If you can t be serious perhaps you d better go then if we do find something you ll have no share Upon my Sam cried Jack if that ain t bitter hard If there s any sharing going on I don t care what it is if there s any man who wants his bit of it more than I do I should like you to point him out Ella my dearest Ella I do assure you by the token of those peerless charms Jack don t be silly I think insinuated Madge that you and I mister Graham had better go and fetch a chisel and a hammer They went When they returned bearing those useful implements however the discussion might have gone mister Martyn showed no signs of being crushed Give me that chisel he exclaimed You never saw a man handle a tool like me and to the last day of your life you ll never see another I m capable of committing suicide while hammering in a tack Thank you Jack said Madge but I think carpentering may be within the range of mister Graham s capacity rather than yours At least mister Graham showed himself capable of stripping the wainscot though with the tools at his command those being limited to the hammer and the chisel with occasional help from the poker it was not so easy a business as it might have been It took some time And as none of the hoped for results ensued nothing being revealed except the wall behind it became a trifle tedious Eleven o clock struck and still a considerable portion of the wainscot was as before Might I ask inquired Jack if this is going to be an all night job because I have to be at the office in the morning and I should like to have some sleep before I start Graham surveyed the work of devastation I will finish this side and then I think Miss Brodie we might leave the rest to another time till to morrow say I really don t see what s the use of doing it at all said Ella I don t believe there s anything hidden in this room and look at the mess it will take hours to clear it up And who wants to live in a place with bare brick walls It gives me the horrors to look at them Madge looked at her more in sorrow than in anger I think mister Graham that perhaps you had better stop He detected the mournful intonation At any rate I ll finish this side He continued to add to the uncomfortable appearance of the room for there certainly was something in what Ella said He had worked for another quarter of an hour or twenty minutes and had torn off three or four more strips of wood for they had been firmly secured in their places and took some tearing and the others were gathered round them assisting and looking on momentarily expecting that something would come to light better worth having than dust and cobwebs of which articles there were very much more than sufficient when Ella gave a sudden exclamation Madge Jack she cried Who who s this man What man asked Madge Turning she saw CHAPTER XIV THE CAUSE OF THE INTERRUPTION What she saw and what they saw spoke eloquently of the engrossed attention with which they had watched the work of destruction being carried on So absorbed had they been in Bruce Graham s proceedings that actually without their knowledge a burglarious entry had been all but effected into the very room in which they were There was the proof before them The window had been raised the blind and curtains pushed away and a man s head and shoulders thrust inside When Ella s exclamation called their attention to the intruder s presence they stared at him as well they might for a moment or two with stupefied amazement the impudence of the act seemed almost to surpass the bounds of credibility He on his part met their gaze with a degree of fortitude not to say assurance which was more than a little surprising To the fellow s character his looks bore evidence The buttoning of his coat up to his chin failed to conceal the fact that his neck was bare while the crushing of a dilapidated billycock down over his eyes served to throw into clearer relief his unshaven cheeks and hungry looking eyes For the space of perhaps thirty seconds they looked at him and he at them in silence Then Jack moved hastily forward You re a cool hand he cried But Madge caught him by the arm Don t she said This is the man who stared through the window Jack turned to her bewildered The man who stared through the window What on earth do you mean Don t she repeated I think that mister Graham knows this man The man himself endorsed her supposition Yes I m rather inclined to think that mister Graham does His voice was not a disagreeable one not at all the sort of voice which one would have expected from a person of his appearance He spoke too like an educated man with however a strenuous something in his tone which suggested in some occult fashion the bitterness of a wild despair Seeing that he remained unanswered he spoke again What s more if there is a cool hand it s mister Graham it isn t me I am a poor starving police ridden devil being hounded to hell full pelt by a hundred other devils but Bruce Graham what are you They turned to the man who was thus addressed At the moment of interruption he had been levering a strip of wainscot from its place with the aid of the inserted chisel He still kept one hand upon the handle holding the hammer with the other while he drew his body back against the wall as close as it would go and with pallid cheeks and startled eyes he stared at the intruder as if he had been some straggler from the spiritual world From between his lips which seemed to tremble there came a single word Ballingall Yes Ballingall That s my name And what s yours cur hound thief By God there have been people I ve used badly enough in my time but none worse than you ve used me You are mistaken Am I It looks like it What are you doing here You know what I m doing By God I do you re right there And it s because you know I know that although you re twice my size and have got all the respectability and law of England at your back you stand there shivering and shaking afraid for your life at the sight of me I am not afraid of you I repeat that you are mistaken And I say you lie you are afraid of me penniless shoeless hungry beggar though I am Your face betrays you look at him Isn t there cowardice writ large The man stretched out his arm pointing to Graham with a dramatic gesture which certainly did not tend to increase that gentleman s appearance of ease Do you think I didn t see you the other day knowing that the time was due for me to come out of gaol trying to screw your courage to the striking point to play the traitor how at the sight of me the blood turned to water in your veins Deny it lie if you can I do not wish to deny it nor do I propose to lie I repeat for the third time that in the conclusions you draw you are mistaken Miss Brodie this is the person of whom I was telling you Charles Ballingall So you have told them of me have you And a pretty yarn you ve spun I bet my boots Yes madam I am Charles Ballingall lately out of Wandsworth Prison sent there for committing burglary at this very place My God yes this house of haunting memories of a thousand ghosts I only came out the day before yesterday and that same night I committed burglary again here And now I m at it for the third time driven to it by a ghost And my God he s behind me now A sudden curious change took place in the expression of the fellow s countenance Partially withdrawing his head he turned and looked behind him as if constrained to the action against his will His voice shrank to a hoarse whisper Is that you Tom Ossington None replied Madge moved forward quite calm and in her own peculiar fashion stately though she was a little white about the lips and there was an odd something in her eyes I think you had better come inside and if convenient please moderate your language At the sound of her voice the man turned again and stared I beg your pardon Were you speaking to me I was and am mister Graham has spoken to me of you and I am quite certain that in doing so he has told us nothing but the exact and literal truth In the light of what he has said I know that I am giving expression to our common feeling in saying that we shall feel obliged to you if you will come in The man hesitated fumbling with his hands as if nonplussed It s a good many years since I was spoken to like that Possibly it s a good many years since you deserved to be spoken to like that As a rule that sort of speech is addressed to us to which we are entitled That s true By God it is I believe I asked you to moderate your language I beg your pardon but it s a habit of some standing Then if that is the case probably the time is come that it should die Please let it die if for this occasion only Must I repeat my invitation and press you to enter in face of the eagerness to effect an entrance which it seems that you have already shown mister Ballingall continued to exhibit signs of indecision This isn t a trap or anything of that kind I am afraid I hardly understand you What do you mean by a trap Well his lips were distorted by what was possibly meant for a grin it doesn t want much understanding when you come to think of it We ask you to come in If you accept our invitation you will of course be at liberty to go again whenever you please We certainly shall make no effort to detain you for any cause whatever Well if that s the case it s a queer start by He seemed about to utter his accustomed imprecation then catching her eyes refrained adding in a different tone I think I will He did passing first one leg over the sill and then the other When the whole of his body was in the room he removed his hat the action effecting a distinct improvement in his appearance The departure of the disreputable billycock disclosed the fact that his head was not by any means ill shaped One perceived that this had once been an intelligent man whose intelligence was very far from being altogether a thing of the past More it suggested the probability of his having been good looking Nor did it need a keen observer to suspect that if he was shaven and shorn combed and groomed and his rags were exchanged for decent raiment that there was still enough of manliness about him to render him sufficiently presentable He was not yet of the hopelessly submerged although just then he could scarcely have appeared to greater disadvantage His clothes were the scourings of the ragman s bag ill fitting torn muddy His boots were odd ones whose gaping apertures revealed the sockless feet within In his whole bearing there was that indefinable furtive something which is the hall mark of the wretch who hopes for nothing but an opportunity to snatch the wherewithal to stay the cravings of his belly and who sees an enemy even in the creature who flings to him a careless dole This atmosphere which was about him of the outcast and the pariah was heightened by the obvious fact that at that very moment he was hungry hideously hungry His eyes now that they were more clearly seen were wolfish In their haste to begin their treasure hunting they had not even waited to take away the tea things The man s glances were fastened on the fragments of food which were on the table as if it was only by an effort of will that he was able to keep himself from pouncing on them like some famished animal Madge perceived the looks of longing We are just going to have supper You must join us Then we can talk while we are eating Ella help me to get it ready Sit down mister Ballingall I daresay you are tired and perhaps you had better close the window Ella and I shall not be long They made a curious trio the three men while the two girls made ready Ballingall closed the window with an air half sheepish half defiant Then placed himself upon a seat in bolt upright fashion as if doubtful of the chair s solidity Jack took up a position in the centre of the hearthrug so evidently at a loss for something appropriate to say as to make his incapacity almost pathetic apparently the unusual character of the situation had tied his tongue into a double knot Graham s attitude was more complex The portion of the wainscot which he had undertaken to displace not having been entirely removed resuming his unfinished task he continued to wrench the boards from their fastenings as if intentionally oblivious of the new arrival s presence Nor was the meal which followed of a familiar type The resources of the larder were not manifold but all that it contained was placed upon the table The piece de resistance consisted of six boiled eggs If you boil all those eggs Ella declared when Madge laid on them a predatory hand there ll be nothing left in the house for breakfast The man is famished retorted Madge with some inconsequence What does breakfast matter to us if the man is starving So the six were boiled And he ate them all Indeed he ate all there was to eat devoured would have been the more appropriate word For he attacked his food with a voracity which it was not nice to witness bolting it with a complete disregard to rules which suggest the advisability of preliminary mastication It was not until his wolf like appetite was at least somewhat appeased by the consumption of nearly all the food that was on the table that Madge approached the subject which was uppermost in all their thoughts As I was saying mister Ballingall mister Graham has told us of all that passed between you At the moment he had a piece of bread in one hand and some cheese in the other all the cheese that was left The satisfaction of his appetite seemed to have increased his ferocity Cramming both morsels into his mouth at once he turned on her with a sort of half choked snarl Then what right had he to do that It seems to me that he had a good deal of right How Who s he A lawyer out of a job who comes and offers me his services I m his client As his client I give him my confidence Looking at it from the professional point of view only what right has he to pass my confidence on to any one any one He s been guilty of a dirty and disgraceful action and he knows it You know it you do He snarled across the board at Graham If I were to report him to the Law Society they d take him off the rolls I question it Madge s tone was dry You may question it but I know what I m talking about What use does he make of the confidence which he worms out of me I wormed nothing out of you The interruption was Graham s Whatever you said to me was said spontaneously without the slightest prompting on my part What difference does that make Then what use does he make of what I said spontaneously He knows that I am a poor driven devil charged with a crime which I never committed I explain to him how it happened that that crime comes to be laid against me how I ve been told that there s money waiting for me in a certain place which is mine for the fetching and how when I went to fetch it I was snapped for burglary I m found guilty of what I never did and I get twelve months In this country law and justice are two different things What does my lawyer my own lawyer who pressed on me his services mind do while I m in prison for what I never did He takes advantage of my confidence and without a word to me or a hint of any sort he goes and looks for my money my money mind on his own account and for all I know he s got it in his pocket now That he certainly has not This was Madge Then it isn t his fault if he hasn t Can you think of anything dirtier not to speak of more unprofessional Why one thief wouldn t behave to another thief like that not if he was a touch above the carrion Here have I an innocent man been rotting in gaol think think thinking of what I d do with the money when I did come out and here was the man who ought to have been above suspicion and whom I thought was above suspicion plotting and planning all the time how he could rob me of what he very well knew was the only thing which could save me from the outer darkness of hell and of despair Graham motioned Madge to silence One moment Miss Brodie You must not suppose mister Ballingall that because I suffer you to make your sweeping charges against me without interruption that I admit their truth or the justice of the epithets which you permit yourself to apply to me On the contrary I assert that your statements are for the most part wholly unjustifiable and that where they appear to have some measure of justification they are easily capable of complete explanation Whatever you may continue to say I shall decline to argue with you here If you will come to my rooms I will give you every explanation you can possibly desire Yes I daresay and take the earliest opportunity of handing me over to the first convenient copper Unless I m mistaken that s the kind of man you are Madge caught the speaker by the sleeve of his ragged coat with a glance at Graham whose countenance had grown ominously black If you will take my advice mister Ballingall since it is plain that you know nothing of the mind of man mister Graham really is instead of continuing to talk in that extremely foolish fashion you will listen to what I have to say The night before last we were the victims of an attempted burglary I did it you know I did it I give myself away if there s any giving about it You can whistle for a constable and give me into charge right off I m willing Perhaps it ll turn out to be the same bobby I handled before and then he ll be happier than ever I am sorry to learn that you were the burglar very sorry My friend Miss Duncan and I were alone in the house a fact of which you were probably aware That mister Ballingall might still be possessed of some remnants of saving grace was suggested by the fact that at this point he winced Other considerations aside it was hardly a heroic action to break at dead of night into a lonely cottage whose only inmates were a couple of unprotected girls There was a revolver fired As you say there was a revolver fired by me at the ceiling Does that tend to strengthen the evidence which goes to show that the deed on your part was a courageous one I never said that it was You are perfectly conscious that we shall not whistle for a policeman and that we shall not give you into charge Is it necessary for you to talk as if you thought we should Am I to be robbed I fancy that the robbing has not been all upon one side mister Ballingall did not look happier The burglar left behind him a scrap of paper Oh I did did I I wondered where it was At present it is in the possession of the police The devil You need not be alarmed mister Ballingall had suddenly risen as if disturbed by some reflection That was before we knew by whom we had been favoured Now that we do know the paper will not be used in evidence against you nor the police either Before handing over that scrap of paper we took a copy of the writing which was on it That writing was a key to two secret hiding places which are contained within this house How do you know that By exercising a little of my elementary common sense Observe mister Ballingall Rising from her seat she crossed to the door On that paper which you were so good as to leave behind you it was written Right I stand on the right of the door Straight across I walk straight across the room Three I measure three feet horizontally Four and four feet perpendicularly Up I push the panel up it opens and I find that there is something within That mister Ballingall is how I know the paper was a guide to two secret hiding places by discovering the first What is the matter with the man Has he gone mad The question which was asked with a sudden and striking change of tone was induced by the singularity of mister Ballingall s demeanour He had started when Madge took up her position at the door eyeing her following evolutions speechlessly breathlessly as if spellbound Her slightest movement seemed to possess for him some curious fascination As she proceeded his agitation increased every nerve seemed strained so that he might not lose the smallest detail of all that happened until when with dramatic gestures she imitated the action of striking the panel raising it and taking out something which was contained within he broke into cry after cry My God my God my God he repeated over and over again Covering his face with his hands as if he strove to guard his eyes against some terrible vision he crouched in a sort of heap on the floor CHAPTER XV THE COMPANION OF HIS SOLITUDE When he looked up it was timidly doubtfully as if fearful of what he might see He glanced about him anxiously from side to side as if in search of something or some one Tom Tom he said speaking it was difficult to say to whom He paused as if for an answer When none came he drew himself upright gradually inch by inch They noticed how his lips were twitching and how the whole of his body trembled He passed his hand over his eyes as a man might who is waking from a dream Then he stretched it out in front of him palm upwards with a something of supplication in the action which lent pathos to the words he uttered words which in themselves were more than sufficiently bizarre Do any of you believe in ghosts in disembodied spirits assuming a corporeal shape in the dead returning from their graves Or is a man who thinks he sees a ghost who knows he sees a ghost who knows that a ghost is a continual attendant of his waking and of his sleeping hours alike must such a man be in labour with some horrible delusion of his senses Is his brain of necessity unhinged Must he of a certainty be mad Not only was such an interrogation in itself remarkable but more especially was it so as coming from such a figure as Ballingall presented His rags and dirt were in strange contrast with his language His words chosen as it seemed with a nice precision came from his lips with all the signs of practiced ease His manner even his voice assumed a touch of refinement which before it lacked In him was displayed the spectacle of a man of talent and of parts encased in all the outward semblance of a creature of the kennel Madge to whom the inquiry seemed to be more particularly addressed replied to it with another Why do you ask us such a question About the man s earnestness as he responded there could be no doubt The muscles of his face twitched as with saint Vitus Dance beads of sweat stood upon his brow the intensity of his desire to give adequate expression to his thoughts seemed to hamper his powers of utterance Because I want some one to help me some one God or man Because during the last year and more I have endured a continual agony to which I doubt if the pains of hell can be compared Because things with me have come to such a pitch that it is only at times I know if I am dead or living asleep or waking mad or sane myself or another He pointed to Graham He has told you how it was with me aforetime how I was haunted driven by a ghost to gaol When I was in gaol it was worse a thousandfold I was haunted always day and night The ghost of my old friend the best friend man ever had whom in so many ways I had so blackly and often wronged was with me continually in my cell Oh for some sign by which I could know that my sins have been forgiven me by which I could learn that by suffering I could atone for the evil I have done Some sign O Lord some sign He threw his hands above his head in a paroxysm of passion As has been said of more than one great tragic actor in his voice there were tears As indeed there were in the eyes of at least one of those who heard His manner when he proceeded was a little calmer which very fact seemed to italicise the strangeness of his tale The first day I spent in prison I was half beside myself with rage I had done things for which I had merited punishment even of man and now that punishment had come it was for something I had not done The irony as well as the injustice of it made me nearly wild I had my first taste of the crank which is as miserable as futile and as irritating a mode of torture as was ever spewed out of a flesh and blood crank s unhealthy stomach and I was having what they called there dinner when the cell door opened and Tom Ossington came in It was just after noon in the broad day He came right in front of me and leaning on his stick he stood and watched me I had not been thinking of him and a moment before had been hot with fury ready to dare or do anything but at the sight of him the strength went out of me My bones might have been made of jelly they seemed so little able to support my body There was nothing about him which was in the least suggestive of anything unusual He was dressed in a short coat and felt hat which were just like the coat and hats which he always had worn and he had in his hand the identical stick which I had seen him carry perhaps a thousand times If it was a ghost then there are ghosts of clothes as well as of men If it was an optical delusion then there are more things in optics than are dreamt of in our philosophy If it was an hallucination born of a disordered mind then it is possible to become lunatic without being conscious of any preliminary sappings of the brain and it is indeed but an invisible border line which divides the madmen from the sane Well Charlie he said in the quiet tones which I had known so well so it s come to this You made a bit of a mistake in coming when you did to fetch away that fortune of yours It seems I said as if I had He laughed that gentle laugh of his which had always seemed to me to be so full of enjoyment Never mind Charlie you come another time The fortune won t run away while you re in here With that he turned and limped out of the cell the door seeming to open before him at a touch of his hand and shutting behind him as noiselessly as it had opened It was only after he had gone that I realised what it was that I had seen In an instant I was in a muck of sweat While I was sitting on my stool more dead than alive the door opened again this time with clatter and noise enough and a warder appeared He glared at me in a fashion which meant volumes Is that you talking in here You d better take care my lad or you ll make a bad beginning He banged the door behind him and he went Ballingall paused to wipe his brow with the back of his hand and he sighed I made a bad beginning and from the warder s point of view I went from bad to worse I do not know if the man I had injured has been suffered to torture me before my time or if where he is his nature has changed and he seeks in the grave the vengeance he never sought in life If so he has his fill of it he surely has had his fill of it already It was through him that I was there and now that I was there he made my sojourn in the prison worse than it need have been Much worse God knows That first visitation of his was followed by others Twice thrice sometimes four times a day he would come to me when I was in my cell and speak to me and compel me to answer him and my voice would be heard without It became quite a custom for the warder on duty to stand outside my cell often in the middle of the night and pounce on me as soon as Tom had gone The instant Tom went the warder would come in Never once did an officer enter while he was actually with me but almost invariably his departure was the signal for the warder to put in his appearance I don t know how it was or why it was but so it was I would be accused of carrying on a conversation with myself reported and punished As a matter of fact I was in continual hot water because of Tom Not a single week passed from that in which I entered the prison to that in which I left it during which I did not undergo punishment of some sort or the other because of Tom As a result all my marks were bad marks When I left the gaol so far from receiving the miserable pittance which good conduct prisoners are supposed to earn I was penniless I had not even the wherewithal with which to buy myself a crust of bread A more dreadful form of torture Tom could hardly have invented A man need not necessarily suffer although he is in gaol But I suffered Always I was in the bad books of the officers They regarded me as an incorrigible bad conduct man which from their point of view I was All sorts of ignominy was heaped on me Every form of punishment I could be made to undergo I had to undergo I never earned my stripe nor the right of having a coir mattress with which to cover the bare board on which I was supposed to sleep I was nearly starved owing to the perpetually recurring bread and water And the horrors I endured the devils which beset me in that unspeakable dark cell To me gaol was a long drawn out and ever increasing agony from the first moment to the last God knows it was The speaker paused He stood his fists clenched staring vacantly in front of him as if he saw there in a mist the crowding spectres of the past There seemed to come a break in his voice as he continued He spoke with greater hesitation Some three months before my sentence was completed Tom changed his tactics While I was sleeping such sleep on the bare board which served me as a bed I d have a vision It was like a vision like a vision and yet it was as if I was awake It seemed as if Tom came to me and put his arm into mine and led me out of gaol and brought me here to Clover Cottage He d stand at the gate and say Charlie this is Clover Cottage and I d answer I know it is Then he d laugh in some way that laugh of his seemed to cut me like a knife And he d lead me down the pathway and into the house to this very room Though Ballingall looked about him doubtfully it wasn t furnished as it is now It was like it used to be And he d go and stand by the door as you did this was to Madge and he d say Now Charlie pay particular attention to what I am about to do I m going to show you how to get that fortune of yours which you came for once before and went away without Now observe Then he d walk straight across the room as you did again to Madge and he d turn to me and say Notice exactly what I m doing Then he d take a foot rule from his pocket and he d measure three feet from where he stood along the floor And he d hold up the rule and say You see three feet Then he d measure four feet from the floor and hold out the rule again and say You see four feet Then he d put his hand against the panel and move it upwards and it would slide open and there was an open space within He d put his hand into the open space and take something out it looked to me like a sheet of paper And he d say This is what will give you that fortune of yours when you find it Only you ll have to find it first Be sure you find it Charlie And he d laugh and though it was the gentle laugh of his which I had known so well of old there was something about it which seemed to mock me and cut me like a whip and make me quiver He d take my arm again and lead me from the house and back to the gaol and I d wake to find myself lying on the bare board alone in the dark cell crying like a child In the morning perhaps at dinner time he d come into the cell in the usual way and ask me Charlie do you remember last night Yes Tom I d reply I do And then he d go on Mind you don t forget It s most important Charlie that you shouldn t forget I ll tell you what you must remember Take this and write it down And he d give me something my Bible or my prayer book or even the card of rules which was hung against the wall and a piece of pencil though where he got that from I never knew and he d say Now write what I dictate And I did just as you saw it on the paper which I left behind the first line Tom Ossington s Ghost he always made me write that it was the only allusion he ever made to there being anything unusual about his presence there and the second line right straight across three four up When I d written it he d say Charlie mind you take the greatest care of that don t let it go out of your possession for a moment It s the guide to that fortune of yours Then he d go And the moment he had gone the warder would come bursting in and catch me with the pencil and the Bible or whatever it was in my hand with the writing on the flyleaf And he d begin to gird at me So you re at it again are you And you ve got a pencil have you and been writing in your Bible You re a pretty sort upon my word you are I tell you what it is my lad you ll get yourself into serious trouble before you ve done And he d take the pencil away with him and the Bible and the writing and I d be reported again and punished with the utmost severity which was within the compass of the Governor s power Ballingall stopped again A convulsive fit of trembling seemed to go all over him Towards the end the vision took another form Tom would bring me to the house only I think not to this room but to another and he would do something he would do something I saw quite clearly what it was he did and understood it well but so soon as I was out of the house the recollection of what he had done became blurred as by a mist I could not remember at all I d wake in my cell in an agony to think that all that Tom had shown me should have slipped my memory In the morning he d come and ask Charlie you remember what we did last night No Tom I don t I ve tried to think but I can t It s all forgotten He d laugh his laugh seeming to mock me more than ever Never mind Charlie I ll tell you all about it You write down what I say And I wrote it down the last line which was on the scrap of paper Though I never knew what it meant never never I ve searched my brains many times to think and been punished for writing it again and again At last I was released At last my God at last His whole frame quivered He drew himself upright as if endeavouring to bear himself as became a man I was treated when going out according to my deserts I had earned no favour and I received none The Governor reprimanded me by way of a God speed told me that my conduct while in prison had been very bad and warned me that it would go ill with me if I returned I went out in the rags in which I had entered without a penny in my pocket hungry at the moment of release I have not tasted bite or sup from the time that I came out of gaol until tonight In the afternoon I came round to Clover Cottage The first thing I saw was him He pointed to Graham He was afraid of me and I was afraid of him that is the truth Otherwise I should have gone up to him and asked him for at least a shilling because directly I caught sight of him I knew what he was after and that I was going to be tricked and robbed again While I was trying to summon up courage enough to beg of the man whom I knew had played me false I saw some one else and I ran away I meant to get a bed in the casual ward of the Wandsworth Workhouse But Tom came to me as I was going there and told me not to be so silly but to come and get the fortune which was waiting for me at Clover Cottage So I came But I never got the fortune And ever since I ve been growing hungrier and hungrier until I ve grown beside myself with hunger because Tom stopped me when I was going to the workhouse again last night and bade me not to be so silly though I don t know why I should have been silly in seeking for shelter and for food And not a couple of hours ago he came to me while I was trying to find a hole on the Common in which to sleep and packed me off once more to fetch away my fortune But I haven t found it yet not yet not yet Though he stretched out his arms on either side of him and on his face there came a strange look of what seemed exultation I know it s near In the pause which followed Ella raised her hand Listen she exclaimed who s that There s some one at the garden gate There did seem some one at the garden gate some one who opened and shut it with a bang They heard footsteps on the tiles which led to the front door While they waited listening for a knock another sound was heard Hark cried Ella There s some one fumbling with a latchkey at the door trying to open it Whoever can it be at this hour of the night There must be some mistake I think said Madge in her eyes there was a very odd expression it is possible there is no mistake this time CHAPTER XVI TWO VISITORS Instinctively Ella drew closer to Jack nestling at his side as if for the sake of the near neighbourhood Graham advanced towards Madge placing himself just at her back with a something protective in his air as if he designed to place himself in front of her at an instant s warning While Ballingall moved farther towards the window with that in his bearing which curiously suggested the bristling hairs of the perturbed and anxious terrier And all was still with that sort of silence which is pregnant with meaning Without in the stillness there could be plainly heard the fumbling of the latchkey as if some one with unaccustomed hands was attempting to insert it in the door Presently the aperture being found and the key turned the door was opened Some one entered the house and being in the door was shut with a bang which seemed to ring threateningly through the little house causing the listeners to start Some one moved with uncertain steps along the passage A grasp was laid from without on the handle of the sitting room door They saw it turn The door opened while those within with one accord held their breath And there entered as strange and pitiful a figure as was ever seen It was the ghost s wife the woman who had so troubled Madge who had done her best that afternoon to keep her outside the house She was the saddest sight in her parti coloured rags the dreadful relics of gaudy fripperies When they saw it was her there was a simultaneous half movement which never became a whole movement for it was stopped at its initiatory stage stopped by something which was in the woman s face and by the doubt if she was alone On her face her poor dirty degraded wrinkled face which was so pitifully thin there was nothing left of it but skin and bone there was a look which held them dumb It was a look like nothing which any of them had ever seen before It was not only that it was a look of death for it was plain that the outstretched fingers of the angel already touched her brow but it was the look of one who seemed to see beyond the grave such a look as we might fancy on the face of the dead in that sudden shock of vision which as some tell us comes in the moment after death She was gazing straight in front of her as if at some one who was there and she said in the queerest shakiest voice So Tom you ve brought me home at last I m glad to be at home again Oh Tom This last with the strangest catching in her throat She looked about her with eyes that did not see It seems a long time since I was at home I thought I never should come back never After all there s nothing to a woman like her home nothing Tom Again there was that strange catching You ve brought me a long way a long long way To think that you should see me in the Borough after all these years and should bring me right straight home I wondered if ever you did see me if you d bring me home Tom Only I wish I wish you d seen me before I m a little tired now She put her hand up to her face with a gesture which suggested weariness which was more than mortal and which only eternal rest could soothe her hand in what was once a glove When she removed it there was something in her eyes which showed that she had suddenly attained to at least a partial consciousness of her surroundings She looked at the two girls and the two men grasped together on her right with at any rate a perception that they were there Who who are these people Whoever you are I m glad to see you this is a great night with me I ve seen my husband for the first time for years and years and he s brought me home with him again after all that time This is my husband Tom She held out her hand as if designating with it some one who was in front of her They on their part were silent spellbound uncertain whether the person to whom and of whom she spoke with so much confidence might not be present though by them unseen It s a strange homecoming is it not And though I m tired oh so tired I m glad I m home again To this house he brought me when we were married didn t you Tom In this house my baby was born wasn t it Tom And here it died There came a look into her face which for the moment made it beautiful to such an extent is beauty a matter of expression My dear little baby It seems only the other day when I held it in my arms It s as if the house were full of ghosts isn t it Tom Her eyes wandered round the room as if in search of some one or of something and presently they lighted upon mister Ballingall As they did so the whole expression of her countenance was changed it assumed a look of unspeakable horror Charles Ballingall she gasped Tom Tom what is he doing here She stretched out her hands seeming to seek for protection from the some one who was in front of her repeating the other s name as if involuntarily as though it were a thing accursed Charles Ballingall Slowly inch by inch her glance passed from the shrinking vagabond until it stayed seeming to search with an eager longing the face of the one who was before her in the apparently vacant air Tom what s he doing here Tom Tom don t look at me like that Don t Tom for God s sake don t look at me like that She broke into sudden volubility every word a cry of pain Tom I m I m your wife You you brought me home Just now from the Borough all the way all the long long way home Tom The utterance of the name was like a scream of a wounded animal in its mortal agony The four onlookers witnessed an extraordinary spectacle They saw this tattered drabbled remnant of what was once a woman whose whole appearance spoke of one who tottered on the very borders of the grave struggling with the frenzy of an hysterical despair with the visitant from the world of shades who it was plain to her if not to others was her companion the husband whom with such malignant cruelty and such persistent ingratitude she had wronged so long ago She had held out her hands her treacherous hands seeking to shelter them in his and it seemed as if for a moment he had suffered them to stay and that now since she had realised the presence of her associate in sin unwilling to retain them any more in his he sought to thrust them from him while she perceiving that what she had supposed to be the realisation of hopes which she had not even dared to cherish was proving but a chimera and the fruit which she was already pressing to her lips but an Apple of Sodom strained every nerve to retain the hold of the hands whose touch had meant to her almost an equivalent to an open door to Paradise With little broken cries and gasping supplications she writhed and twisted as she strove to keep her grasp Tom Tom Tom she exclaimed over and over again You brought me home you brought me home Don t put me from you Tom Tom Tom It seemed that the struggle ended in her discomfiture and that the hands which she had hoped would draw her forward had been used to thrust her back for staggering backwards as if she had been pushed she put her palms up to her breasts and panted staring like one distraught By degrees regaining something of her composure she turned and looked at Ballingall with a look before which he cowered actually raising his arm as if warding off a blow And when she had breath enough she spoke to him in a whisper as if her strength was gone What are you doing here Ballingall hesitated looking about him this way and that as if seeking for some road of retreat Finding none making a pitiful effort to gather himself together he replied to her question in a voice which was at once tremulous and sullen Tom asked me to come You know Tom you asked me to come He stretched out his arm with a gesture which was startling as if to him also the woman s companion was a reality There was silence He repeated his assertion still with his outstretched arm You know Tom you asked me to come Then there happened the most startling thing of all Some one laughed It was a man s laugh low soft and musical But there was about it this peculiar quality it was not the merriment of one who laughs with but of one who laughs at as though the laugher was enjoying thoroughly with all his heart a jest at another s expense Before it the man and woman cowered as if beneath a rain of blows After it ceased they were still It was plain that the woman was ashamed disillusioned conscious that she had been made a butt of and that in spite of all appearances to the contrary she was still among the hopeless the outcast the condemned She glanced furtively towards the companion of her shame then more quickly still away from him as if realising only too well that in that quarter there was no promise of hope rekindled And she said with choking utterance Tom I never thought you d laugh at me Did you bring me home for this She put up her hands in their dreadful gloves to her raddled shrunken face and stood for a moment still Then her frame began to quiver and she cried and as she cried there came that laugh again The note of mockery that was in it served to sting Ballingall into an assertion of such manhood as was in him He clenched his fists drew himself straighter and throwing back his head faced towards where the laughter seemed to stand Tom he said I ve used you ill We ve both of us used you ill both she and I she s been as false a wife to you as I ve been friend Our sins have been many black as ink bitter as gall We know it both of us We ve had reason to know it well But Tom consider what our punishment has been Look at us at her at me Think of what we were and what we are Remember what it means to have come to this from that Every form of suffering I do believe we ve known of mind and of body too she in her way and I in mine We ve been sinking lower and lower and lower through every form of degradation privation misery until at last we re in the ditch amidst the slime of the outer ditch We ve lost all that there is worth having so far as life s concerned for ever The only hope that is left us is the hour in which it is appointed that we shall die For my part my hope is that for me that hour is not far off And as I m a living man I believe that for her it has already come that the scythe is raised to reap that she s dying where she stands Have you no bowels of compassion Tom none You used to have Are they all dried and withered There s forgiveness for sinners Tom with God is there none with you You used to be of those who forgive till seventy times seven are you now so unforgiving You may spurn me you may trample on me you may press my head down into the very slime of the ditch you know that these many months you ve torn and racked me with all the engines of the torture chambers but she s your wife Tom she was your wife you loved her once She bore to you a little child a little baby Tom a little baby It s dead with God Tom with God She s going to it now now now While she s passing into the very presence chamber where her baby is don t abase her Tom Don t Tom don t He threw out his arms with a gesture of such frenzied entreaty and his whole figure was so transformed by the earnestness and passion and pathos and even anguish with which he pressed his theme that at least the spectators were cut to the heart I know not he cried whether you are dead or living or whether I myself am mad or sane for indeed to me of late the world has seemed all upside down But this I know that I see you and that you see me and if as I suppose you come from communion with the Eternal you must know that in that Presence there is mercy for the lowest for the chief of sinners There is mercy Tom I know that there is mercy Therefore I entreat you to consider Tom the case of this woman of she who was your wife the mother of your child She has paid dearly for her offence against you paid for it every moment of every hour of every day of every year since she offended Since then she has been continually paying Is not a quittance nearly due from you Tom If blood is needed to wash out her guilt she has wept tears of blood If suffering look at her and see how she has suffered And now even as I stand and speak to you she dies She bears her burden to the grave Is she to add to it still the weight of your resentment That will be the heaviest weight of all Beneath it how shall she stagger to the footstool of her God All these years she has lived in hell Don t with your hand Tom now she s dying thrust her into hell for ever But put her hand in yours and bear her up and stay her Tom and lead her to the throne of God If she can say that you ve forgiven her God will forgive her too And then she ll find her baby Tom It was a strange farrago of words which Ballingall had strung together but the occasion was a strange one too His earnestness in which all was forgotten save his desire to effect his purpose seemed to cast about them a halo as of sanctity It was almost as if he stood there pleading for a sinner in the very Name of Christ the great Pleader for all great sinners The woman this latest Magdalene did as that first Magdalene had done she fell on her knees and wept tears of bitterness Tom Tom she cried Tom Tom But he to whom she cried did not do as the Christ the Impersonation of Divine Mercy did Christ wept with the sinners He to whom she pleaded laughed at her And beneath his laughter she crouched lower and lower till she lay almost prostrate on the floor and her body quivered as if he struck her with a whip Ballingall as if he could scarcely credit the evidence of his own senses started back and stared as though divided between amazement and dismay Under his breath he put a singular inquiry the words seeming to be wrung from him against his will Tom Are you a devil And it seemed as if an answer came For he stood in the attitude of one who listens and the muscles of his face worked as if what was being said was little to his mind A dogged look came into his eyes and about his mouth He drew himself further back as if retreating before undesired advances Words came sullenly from between his teeth No Tom no I want none of that It isn t that I ask you know it isn t that It appeared as if the overtures made by the unseen presence unwelcome though they were were being persisted in For Ballingall shook his head raising his hands as if to put them from him conveying in his bearing the whole gamut of dissent breaking at last into exclamations which were at once defiant suppliant despairing No Tom no I don t want your fortune You know I don t All this time you ve been dangling it before my eyes and all the time it s been a will o the wisp leading me deeper and deeper into the mire I was unhappy enough when first you came to me and spoke of it but I ve been unhappier since a thousand times You might have let me have it at the beginning if you d chosen but you didn t choose You used it to make of me a mock and a gibe your plaything whipping boy To night the lure of it has only served as a means to bring us here together she and I when you know I d rather have gone a hundred miles barefooted to hide from her my face I don t know if there is a fortune hidden in this house or not and I don t care if behind its walls are concealed the riches of Golconda I ll have none of it it s too late too late I ve asked you for what I d give a many fortunes and you ve laughed at me You ll not show by so much as a sign that you forgive her now at this eleventh hour There s nothing else of yours I ll have In reply there came again that quiet laughter with in it that curious metallic quality which seemed to act on the quivering nerves of the two sin stained wayworn wretches as if it had been molten metal At the sound of it they gave a guilty start as if the ghosts of all their sins had risen to scourge them From her demeanour the laugher diverting his attention from Ballingall had apparently turned to address the woman In accents which had grown perceptibly weaker since her first entering she essayed to speak Yes Tom I ll get up If you wish me Tom of course I will I m tired Tom that s all She did get up in a fashion which demonstrated she was tired The process of ascension was not the work of a moment and when she had regained her feet she swung this way and that like a reed in the wind It was only by what seemed a miracle that she did not fall Don t be angry I m tired Tom that s all In her voice there was a weariness unspeakable Something it seemed was said to her from which as Ballingall had done only in her feebler way she expressed dissent I don t want your money Tom It s so good of you it s like you used to be kind and generous You always did give me lots of money Tom But I don t want money not now Tom not now Something else was said which stung her for she clasped her hands in front of her with a movement of pain I didn t wish to make you angry Tom I m sure I didn t Don t speak to me and look at me like that don t Tom don t You don t know how it hurts me now that I m so tired I ll go and fetch your money if you wish me of course I will if you ll show me where it is I ll go at once Upstairs Yes Tom I don t think I m too tired to go upstairs if you ll come with me Yes Tom I m going now The woman turned towards the door hastily With a swift eager gesture in which there was something both mysterious and secretive Ballingall addressed the four onlookers the spellbound spectators of this perhaps unparelleled experience in the regions of experimental psychology He spoke beneath his breath hurriedly hoarsely with fugitive sidelong glances as if before all things he was anxious that what he said should be heard by them alone He s going to show her where the fortune is The woman opened the door CHAPTER XVII THE KEY TO THE PUZZLE She stood for a second with the handle of the open door in her grasp as if she was glad of its support to aid her stand Then with a quick glance backwards as of pleading to the one who exercised over her so strange a spell she tottered from the room She continued speaking as she went as if deprecating the other s wrath I shall be all right in a moment if you don t hurry me at first I m only slow because I m a little tired It ll soon go this tired feeling Tom and I ll be sure to be quicker when it s gone Ballingall hung back as she passed from the room seeming from his attitude to be in two minds whether to follow her at all The others as if taking their cue from him seemed hesitating too until Madge with head thrown back and fists hanging clenched at her sides went after her through the door Then they moved close on Madge s heels Bruce Graham in front Ballingall bringing up the rear The woman was staggering up the stairs with obvious unwillingness and also with more than sufficient feebleness It was with difficulty she could lift her feet from step to step Each time she raised her foot she gave a backward lurch which threatened to precipitate her down the whole of the distance she had gained Madge s impulse was to dash forward put her arms about the unfortunate creature s wrist and if she needs must go forward bear her bodily to the top of the stairs But although at the pitiful sight which the woman presented her fingers tingled and her pulses throbbed she was stayed from advancing to proffer her the assistance which she longed to render by the consciousness against which she strove in vain that between the woman and herself there was a something which not only did she dare not pass but which she dare not even closely approach Over and over again she told herself that it was nonsense but a delusion born of the woman s diseased and conscience haunted brain There was absolutely nothing to be seen and why should she a healthy minded young woman suffer herself to be frightened by the vacant air But in spite of all her efforts at self persuasion she allowed a considerable space to continue to exist between herself and the trembling wretch upon the stairs Slowly the queer procession advanced the woman punctuating as it were with her plaintive wailings every step she took Tom Tom Tom She continually repeated the name with all the intonations of endearment supplication reproach and even terror To hear her was a liberal education in the different effects which may be produced by varieties of emphasis Don t hurry me I m going as quickly as I can I shall soon be at the top It s so so steep a staircase Tom At last the top was reached She stood upon the landing clinging to the banisters as she gasped for breath Her figure swayed backward and forward in so ominous a fashion that halfway up the staircase almost involuntarily Madge stretched out her arms to catch her if she fell But she did not fall nor was she allowed much time to recover from her exertions I m going if you ll let me rest for just one moment Tom Where do you wish me to go It seemed as if her question was answered for she gave a shuddering movement towards the wall and burst into a passion of cries No Tom not there not there not there Don t make me go into our bedroom not into our bedroom The command which had been given her was apparently repeated for drawing herself away from the wall she went with new and shuddering haste along the passage I m I m going Only have mercy have mercy on me Tom I don t wish to anger you only have mercy Tom The bedroom in front of the house was the one which was occupied by Ella It was towards this room that the woman was moving with hurried tremulous steps Her unwillingness to advance was more marked than before and yet she seemed urged by something which was both in front and behind her which she was powerless to resist They could see she shuddered as she went and she uttered cries half of terror half of pain And yet she advanced with a decision and a firmness and also a rapidity which was unlike anything she hitherto had shown On the threshold of the room she stopped starting back and throwing out her hands in front of her It s our bedroom Tom it s full of ghosts Ghosts Ghosts Don t make me go into the bedroom Tom But the propelling force whatever it might have been was beyond her power to withstand She gave a sudden exceeding bitter cry Turning the handle she flung the door right back upon its hinges With a peal of laughter which grated on the ears of those who heard almost more than anything which had gone before she staggered into the room As she disappeared they stopped listening with faces which had suddenly grown whiter to her strange merriment This is our bedroom ha ha ha where you brought me when we were first married Why Tom how many years is it since I was here Ha ha ha I never thought I should come back to our bedroom Tom never Ha ha ha All at once there was a change in her tone a note of terror The laughter fled with the dreadful suddenness with which it had come Don t Tom Don t Have mercy mercy I ll do as you wish me you know I will I ll get your money Only I didn t know you kept it in our bedroom Tom You didn t use to So soon as the laughter fading was exchanged for that panic cry Madge hurried after her into the room the others as ever hard upon her heels The woman stood in the centre of the floor looking about her with glances of evident bewilderment as if seeking for something she had been told to look for She searched in vain Her eagerness was pitiful She looked hither and thither in every direction as if urged to the search she feared in speechless agony the penalties of disobedience All the while she kept giving short sharp cries of strained and frenzied fear I m looking I m looking Tom as hard as I can but I see nothing nothing Tom I m doing as you tell me I am I am I am Oh Tom I am But I don t see your money I don t I don t If you ll show me where it is I ll get it but I see nothing of your money Tom Where is it Here She moved towards the wash hand stand which was at the side of the room Behind the washstand She lifted the piece of furniture on one side with a degree of strength of which light though it was one would not have thought that she was capable Getting behind it she placed against the wall her eager trembling hand But your money isn t here There s nothing but the wall Take the paper off the wall But how am I to do it With my fingers I can t tear off with my fingers Tom Oh Tom I ll try Don t speak to me like that I ll try With feverish haste she dragged the apologies for gloves off her quivering hands Where shall I tear it off Here Yes Tom I ll try to tear it off just here Dropping on her knees she attacked with her nails the wall where while she remained in that posture it was about the height of her head endeavouring to drive the edges through the paper and to pick it off as children do But her attempts were less successful than are the efforts of the average ingenious child I can t Tom I can t My fingers are not strong enough and my nails are broken don t be angry with me Tom She made frantic little dabs at the wall But her endeavours to make an impression on the paper were without result It was plain that with her unassisted nails she might continue to peck at it in vain for ever Madge turned to mister Graham Illustration I can t Tom I can t My fingers are not strong enough and my nails are broken don t be angry with me Tom To face p two hundred ninety Have you a pocket knife Without a word he took one from his waistcoat pocket Not waiting for him to open it she took it from him with an action which almost amounted to a snatch With her own fingers she opened the largest blade Making a large and under the circumstances curious circuit in order to reach her leaning over the washstand touching the woman on the shoulder she held out to her the knife Shrinking under Madge s finger with an exclamation she looked round to see who touched her Take this said Madge It s a knife With its help you ll be better able to tear the paper off the wall She took it without a word of thanks and with it in her grasp returned to the attack with energies renewed I ve got a knife Tom I ve got a knife Now I ll get the paper off quicker much quicker I ll soon get to your money Tom But she did not get to it On the contrary the process of stripping off the paper did not proceed much more rapidly than before even with the help of mister Graham s knife It was with the greatest difficulty that she was able to get off two or three square inches The disappearance however of even this small portion revealed the fact that the paper hanger who had been responsible for putting it into place instead of stripping off the previous wall covering as paperhangers are supposed to do had been content to save himself what he had perhaps deemed unnecessary trouble to paste this latest covering on the previous one This former paper appeared to have been of that old fashioned kind which used to be popular in the parlours of country inns and such like places and which was wont to be embellished with pictorial illustrations The scraping off by the woman of the small fragments of paper which she had succeeded in removing showed that the one beneath it seemed to have been ornamented with more or less striking representations of various four footed animals On the space laid bare were figures of what might have been meant for anything and which in the light of the last line on mister Ballingall s manuscript were probably intended for cats and dogs With these the woman was fumbling with hesitating awkward fingers Cat dog I don t I don t understand Tom I see Tom these are the pictures of cats and dogs I m blind and stupid and slow I ought to have seen at once what they were I know I ought But be patient with me Tom Which one This one Yes I see this one It s it s yes Tom it s a dog s head I see it is What am I to do with it Press Yes Tom I am pressing Press harder Yes I ll I ll try but I m I m not very strong and I can t press much harder Have mercy have mercy Tom Say say you forgive me forgive me but I I can t press harder Tom I can t She could not so much was plain Even as the words were passing from her lips she relinquished pressing altogether Uttering a little throbbing cry she turned away from the wall throwing up her arms with a gesture of entreaty and sinking on to the floor she lay there still As she dropped that gentle mocking laugh rang through the startled room CHAPTER XVIII MADGE APPLIES MORE STRENGTH Was it imagination Or was it fact Did some one or something really pass from the room causing in going a little current of air With startled faces each put to the other an unspoken query Which none answered The woman lay there motionless her exceeding stillness seeming accentuated by the sudden silence which filled the room Bruce Graham moving forward took her up in his arms as if she were but a feather s weight His knife fell from her nerveless fingers tumbling to the floor with startling clatter Madge picked it up Her voice rang out with clarion clearness the voice of a woman whose nerves were tense as fiddle strings I ll see if I cannot press harder This mystery must be solved to night before some of us go mad if pressing will do it it shall soon be done if there s strength in me at all There was strength in her and not a little She went on her knees where the woman had been and as she had done fumbled with her fingers where the paper had been scraped from the wall peering closely at it as she did so A dog s head is it it doesn t look as if it were a dog s head to me and that s not because I m stupid It s to be pressed is it Well if pressing will do it here s for pressing She exerted all her force against the point to which the woman had been directed It gives It gives something gives beneath my thumb it s the knob of a spring or something I m sure of it Turning she looked up at Graham with flaming cheeks and flashing eyes The spring is sure to be rusty It will need all your strength Try it again She tried again It does give it does But whatever it is supposed to open is not likely to act now that the wall has been repapered Some one go and fetch the hammer and the chisel from downstairs we ll try another way She glanced at Jack as if intending the suggestion to apply to him But Ella clung to his arm which perhaps prevented him from moving with the speed which might have been expected Will no one go cried Madge Why then I ll go myself But that Bruce Graham would not permit Swiftly depositing his still unconscious burden on Ella s bed he went in search of the required tools returning almost as soon as he had gone I think Miss Brodie that perhaps you had better allow me to try my hand I am stronger than you She gave way to him unhesitatingly Drive the chisel into the wall and see if it is hollow He did as she bade him A couple of blows put the thing beyond a doubt The chisel disappeared up to the hilt through what was evidently but an outer shell Madge continued to issue her instructions Break the wall in It s no use fumbling with dogs head in search of hidden springs with us it s a case of the shortest road s the best Whatever s inside that wall has been there long enough to excuse us if we re a little neglectful of ceremonious observances In a few minutes the wall was broken in the ancient woodwork offering no resistance to Bruce Graham s vigorous onslaught A cavity was made large enough to thrust one s head in Madge stopped him That ll do for the present Now let s see what there is inside She went down on her knees the better to enable her to see Graham moving aside to give her room She thrust her fair young face as far into the opening as she could get it only to discover that she was obscuring her own light Out it came again Give me a light a match or something It s as dark as pitch in there Graham gave her a box of matches Striking one she introduced it into what was as the heart of the wall There is something in there She dropped the match Fortunately it went out as it fell It s the hidden fortune She gave a gasp Then in an instant she was on her feet and was hastening towards the recumbent figure on the bed The woman still lay motionless Madge bending down caught her by the shoulder forgetful of all in her desire to impart the amazing news Your husband s fortune s in the wall we ve found it there Something on the woman s face in her utter stillness seemed to fill her with new alarm She called to the others Ella mister Graham Jack Her voice sank to a whisper there was a catching of her breath Is she dead They came hastening towards her Jack Martyn stopping halfway looking round startled them with a fresh inquiry to which he himself supplied the answer By George I say where s Ballingall Why he s gone CHAPTER XIX THE WOMAN AND THE MAN Yes the woman was dead Ballingall had gone and the fortune was found Put in that way it was a curious sequence of events Indeed put in any way there could be no doubt about the oddity of the part which the woman had played Medical examination clearly showed that death had come to her from natural causes She must the doctor said have been within a hand s breadth of death for at any rate the last twelve months He declared that every vital organ was hopelessly diseased Asked if the immediate cause of death was shock he replied that there was nothing whatever in the condition of the body which could be regarded as supporting such a theory In his opinion the woman had burned out like a candle which when it is all consumed dies Nothing in his judgment could have retarded the inevitable end just as there was nothing to suggest that it came one instant sooner than might in the natural course have been expected That was what the doctor said in public at the coroner s inquest He listened to them when in private they told him the strange story of the night s adventure pronouncing at the conclusion an opinion which contained in it the essence of all wisdom for it might be taken any way The gist of it was this Very probably for some time before her death the woman had been light headed When people are light headed they suffer from hallucinations It was quite possible that in her case those hallucinations had taken the form literally of her injured husband It was on record that hallucinations had taken form in similar cases It was a perfectly feasible and reasonable theory which supposed that the woman wandering a homeless outcast in the streets of London delirious premonitions of her approaching dissolution being borne in upon her in spite of her delirium would turn her dying footsteps towards her one time home to which as her behaviour in forcing herself on Madge plainly showed her thoughts had recently returned Nor under the circumstances was there anything surprising in her delusion that her husband had led her there It was when asked to explain how it was that she had hit upon the hiding place of her husband s fortune hit upon it as it seemed altogether against her will that the doctor became oracular But even here he was not without his hints as to the direction in which an explanation might be found He pointed out that our study of the science of mental psychology was still in its infancy But even so far as it had gone it seemed to suggest the possibility of what has come to be called telepathic communication between two minds even when the whilom owner of one of the minds has passed beyond the confines of the grave This sounded a trifle abstruse But as the doctor professed his inability to put it any clearer they had to take his statement as it stood and make out just as much of it as they were able As for Ballingall s pretensions to having shared the woman s hallucination if hallucination it was the doctor pooh poohed them altogether The man was as mad as the woman and madder and an impudent rogue to boot Where was he Let him come forward and allow himself and his statements to be scientifically tested Then it would be shown what reliance could be placed on anything which he might say But where Ballingall was was exactly the problem which they found insoluble He had vanished as completely as if he had never existed The presumption was that while they had been absorbed in watching Madge s efforts to carry on the work of discovery from the point at which the woman had left it he had sneaked unnoticed from the room and from the house The curious feature was that they were unable to agree as to the exact moment at which he could have gone Bruce Graham declared that he was in the room when he went to fetch the hammer and chisel and that he was still there when he returned Madge protested that he was in the room when she ran across to the recumbent figure on Ella s bed If so since Jack discovered his absence within less than a minute afterwards it was during that scant sixty seconds that he made good his escape Why he had gone at all was difficult to say One might have thought that after what he had undergone during his search for the fortune he would hardly have disappeared at the moment of its finding He had suffered so much in looking that he had earned at least a share when at last it was brought to light Such certainly was the strong feeling of its actual discoverer He stood in need enough of money that was sure Why then at what from one point of view might be described as the very moment of his triumph had he vanished He alone could tell They could only give wild guesses Nothing has been seen or heard of him from that hour to this They put advertisements for him in the papers without result Then as they felt that living the sort of life which he probably was living that is if he was living at all it was within the range of probability that a newspaper would never come his way and that he would never glance at it if it did they distributed handbills broadcast through the slums of London beseeching him to apply to a certain address and offering a reward to any one who could give an account of his proceedings after the night on which he had taken himself away To those handbills they did receive answers in abundance There were evidently plenty of people who were willing nay anxious to lay their hands on that reward just as there seemed several Charles Ballingalls with whom they were acquainted But no one of them was the Charles Ballingall More than once they thought they had chanced on him at last the stories told were such very specious ones and they followed up the trail till it proved beyond all manner of doubt to be a false one When the Charles Ballingall to whom it referred was unearthed he proved in each and every case to be not in the least like theirs And so the presumption is that the man is dead He was probably as the doctor suggested more than half out of his mind on that eventful night his sins had brought him suffering enough to have driven the average mortal mad It is not unlikely that the strange things which then transpired completing the work of destruction robbed him of his few remaining senses and that at that last moment when Madge Brodie announced her discovery of what he had sought with so much pain and with such ardour the irony of fate which seemed to have pursued him pressing on him still had driven him out into the night a raving lunatic seeking anywhere and anyhow for escape from the burden of life which haunted him God alone can tell where and how he found it CHAPTER XX THE FORTUNE And the fortune This remark may be made that had they not found it when they did there would very shortly have been nothing left to find mister Thomas Ossington had chosen for the treasure chest a simple opening in the wall to which access had originally been gained by touching a spring This spring had been concealed under what had probably been a picture of a dog s head the fifth alternating dog s head on the right hand side of the bedroom door When you pressed it a door flew open But this primitive treasure chest if not entirely obvious to the world at large was open to the rats and mice and similar small deer who had their happy hunting grounds within the wall itself The result was that when the contents were examined it was found that the bundles of bank notes had been gnawed in some cases to unrecognisable shreds that meals hearty ones of the cut and come again description had been made of parchment deeds bonds share certificates and similar impediments that coin gold coin had been contained in bags which bags had been consumed even to the strings which once had tied them The coins lay under accumulations of dust in heaps upon the floor On several were actually well marked indentations showing that sharp gleaming teeth had applied to them a stringent test before finally deciding that they really were not good to eat A curious spectacle the whole presented when first brought to the light of day However in but few cases had the damage proceeded to lengths which had rendered what was left absolutely worthless discovery had come just in the nick of time The Bank of England was good enough to hand over cash in exchange for the fragments of all notes of which there was satisfactory evidence that there had been once a whole The various documents which represented property were none of them in a condition which rendered recognition altogether impossible and when it was once established what they were for all intents and purposes they were as available for their original use as if they had been in a condition of pristine freshness Altogether the find represented a sum of something like Lforty thousand Not a large fortune as fortunes go but still a comfortable capital to be the possessor of If fate only had been kind to him and the men and women who formed his world of finer texture Tom Ossington might have been as happy as the days were long Oddly enough the real trouble came after the fortune was found The difficulty was as to whom it belonged not because the claimants were so many but because they were so few It was Madge s wish that it should be divided between those who were actually present at the moment of its discovery maintaining that such a division would be in accordance with both law and equity Ballingall s continued disappearance resolved the number of these into four Ella Jack Martyn Bruce Graham and herself The first rift in the lute was caused by mister Graham he refusing point blank to have part or parcel in any such transaction He maintained that the fortune had been found by Madge and that therefore in accordance with the terms of the will the whole of it was hers In any case he would have none of it He had felt on mature reflection that Ballingall s accusations had not been without foundation that his conduct had been unprofessional that he had had no right to share his confidence with anybody that in short he had behaved ill in the whole affair and that therefore he had no option but to decline to avail himself of any advantages which were so to speak the proceeds of his misbehaviour When she heard this Madge laughed outright Seeing that her laughter made no impression and that the gentleman continued of the same opinion still she was moved to use language which was to say the least surprising It was plain that beneath the lash of the lady s tongue he was unhappy But his unhappiness did not go deep enough to induce him to change his mind When it was obvious that his resolve was adamant and that by no means could he be induced to move from it she announced her own decision Very well if the fortune s mine it s mine And if it s mine I can do what I like with it And what I like is to divide it with Ella and if Ella will not have half then I ll not have a farthing either And the whole shall go to the Queen or to whoever unclaimed money does go And you ll find that I can be as firm or as obstinate as anybody else But my dear observed Ella mildly I never said that I wouldn t have half I m sure I ll be delighted I ll need no pressing and thank you very kindly ma am I do believe Ella returned Madge with calmness which was both significant and deadly that you are the only reasonable person with whom I am acquainted So it was arranged the two girls divided the whole which of course meant as Madge knew perfectly that Jack Martyn would have his share As a matter of fact mister and missus Martyn have been husband and wife for some time now and are doing very well And it is said as such things are said that Madge Brodie will be missus Bruce Graham yet before she dies It is believed by those who know them best that he would give his eyes to marry her and that she has made up her mind to marry him This being so it would seem as if a marriage might ensue If such is the case it appears extremely likely if Madge ever is his wife that whether he will or won t Bruce Graham will have to have his share She is as obstinate as he is every whit The Gresham Press UNWIN BROTHERS WOKING AND LONDON End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tom Ossington s Ghost by Richard Marsh END OF THIS
