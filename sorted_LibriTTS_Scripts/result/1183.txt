START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RETURN OF doctor FU MANCHU Produced by Alan Johns THE RETURN OF doctor FU MANCHU By Sax Rohmer CHAPTER I A MIDNIGHT SUMMONS When did you last hear from Nayland Smith asked my visitor I paused my hand on the syphon reflecting for a moment Two months ago I said he s a poor correspondent and rather soured I fancy What a woman or something Some affair of that sort He s such a reticent beggar I really know very little about it I placed a whisky and soda before the reverend J D Eltham also sliding the tobacco jar nearer to his hand The refined and sensitive face of the clergy man offered no indication of the truculent character of the man His scanty fair hair already gray over the temples was silken and soft looking in appearance he was indeed a typical English churchman but in China he had been known as the fighting missionary and had fully deserved the title In fact this peaceful looking gentleman had directly brought about the Boxer Risings You know he said in his clerical voice but meanwhile stuffing tobacco into an old pipe with fierce energy I have often wondered Petrie I have never left off wondering What That accursed Chinaman Since the cellar place beneath the site of the burnt out cottage in Dulwich Village I have wondered more than ever He lighted his pipe and walked to the hearth to throw the match in the grate You see he continued peering across at me in his oddly nervous way one never knows does one If I thought that doctor Fu Manchu lived if I seriously suspected that that stupendous intellect that wonderful genius Petrie er he hesitated characteristically survived I should feel it my duty Well I said leaning my elbows on the table and smiling slightly If that Satanic genius were not indeed destroyed then the peace of the world may be threatened anew at any moment He was becoming excited shooting out his jaw in the truculent manner I knew and snapping his fingers to emphasize his words a man composed of the oddest complexities that ever dwelt beneath a clerical frock He may have got back to China Doctor he cried and his eyes had the fighting glint in them Could you rest in peace if you thought that he lived Should you not fear for your life every time that a night call took you out alone Why man alive it is only two years since he was here among us since we were searching every shadow for those awful green eyes What became of his band of assassins his stranglers his dacoits his damnable poisons and insects and what not the army of creatures He paused taking a drink You he hesitated diffidently searched in Egypt with Nayland Smith did you not I nodded Contradict me if I am wrong he continued but my impression is that you were searching for the girl the girl Karamaneh I think she was called Yes I replied shortly but we could find no trace no trace You er were interested More than I knew I replied until I realized that I had lost her I never met Karamaneh but from your account and from others she was quite unusually She was very beautiful I said and stood up for I was anxious to terminate that phase of the conversation Eltham regarded me sympathetically he knew something of my search with Nayland Smith for the dark eyed Eastern girl who had brought romance into my drab life he knew that I treasured my memories of her as I loathed and abhorred those of the fiendish brilliant Chinese doctor who had been her master Eltham began to pace up and down the rug his pipe bubbling furiously and something in the way he carried his head reminded me momentarily of Nayland Smith Certainly between this pink faced clergyman with his deceptively mild appearance and the gaunt bronzed and steely eyed Burmese commissioner there was externally little in common but it was some little nervous trick in his carriage that conjured up through the smoky haze one distant summer evening when Smith had paced that very room as Eltham paced it now when before my startled eyes he had rung up the curtain upon the savage drama in which though I little suspected it then Fate had cast me for a leading role I wondered if Eltham s thoughts ran parallel with mine My own were centered upon the unforgettable figure of the murderous Chinaman These words exactly as Smith had used them seemed once again to sound in my ears Imagine a person tall lean and feline high shouldered with a brow like Shakespeare and a face like Satan a close shaven skull and long magnetic eyes of the true cat green Invest him with all the cruel cunning of an entire Eastern race accumulated in one giant intellect with all the resources of science past and present and you have a mental picture of doctor Fu Manchu the Yellow Peril incarnate in one man This visit of Eltham s no doubt was responsible for my mood for this singular clergyman had played his part in the drama of two years ago I should like to see Smith again he said suddenly it seems a pity that a man like that should be buried in Burma Burma makes a mess of the best of men Doctor You said he was not married No I replied shortly and is never likely to be now Ah you hinted at something of the kind I know very little of it Nayland Smith is not the kind of man to talk much Quite so quite so And you know Doctor neither am I but he was growing painfully embarrassed it may be your due I er I have a correspondent in the interior of China Well I said watching him in sudden eagerness Well I would not desire to raise vain hopes nor to occasion shall I say empty fears but er no Doctor He flushed like a girl It was wrong of me to open this conversation Perhaps when I know more will you forget my words for the time The telephone bell rang Hullo cried Eltham hard luck Doctor but I could see that he welcomed the interruption Why he added it is one o clock I went to the telephone Is that doctor Petrie inquired a woman s voice Yes who is speaking missus Hewett has been taken more seriously ill Could you come at once Certainly I replied for missus Hewett was not only a profitable patient but an estimable lady I shall be with you in a quarter of an hour I hung up the receiver Something urgent asked Eltham emptying his pipe Sounds like it You had better turn in I should much prefer to walk over with you if it would not be intruding Our conversation has ill prepared me for sleep Right I said for I welcomed his company and three minutes later we were striding across the deserted common A sort of mist floated amongst the trees seeming in the moonlight like a veil draped from trunk to trunk as in silence we passed the Mound pond and struck out for the north side of the common I suppose the presence of Eltham and the irritating recollection of his half confidence were the responsible factors but my mind persistently dwelt upon the subject of Fu Manchu and the atrocities which he had committed during his sojourn in England So actively was my imagination at work that I felt again the menace which so long had hung over me I felt as though that murderous yellow cloud still cast its shadow upon England And I found myself longing for the company of Nayland Smith I cannot state what was the nature of Eltham s reflections but I can guess for he was as silent as I It was with a conscious effort that I shook myself out of this morbidly reflective mood on finding that we had crossed the common and were come to the abode of my patient I shall take a little walk announced Eltham for I gather that you don t expect to be detained long I shall never be out of sight of the door of course Very well I replied and ran up the steps There were no lights to be seen in any of the windows which circumstance rather surprised me as my patient occupied or had occupied when last I had visited her a first floor bedroom in the front of the house My knocking and ringing produced no response for three or four minutes then as I persisted a scantily clothed and half awake maid servant unbarred the door and stared at me stupidly in the moonlight missus Hewett requires me I asked abruptly The girl stared more stupidly than ever No sir she said she don t sir she s fast asleep But some one phoned me I insisted rather irritably I fear Not from here sir declared the now wide eyed girl We haven t got a telephone sir For a few moments I stood there staring as foolishly as she then abruptly I turned and descended the steps At the gate I stood looking up and down the road The houses were all in darkness What could be the meaning of the mysterious summons I had made no mistake respecting the name of my patient it had been twice repeated over the telephone yet that the call had not emanated from missus Hewett s house was now palpably evident Days had been when I should have regarded the episode as preluding some outrage but to night I felt more disposed to ascribe it to a silly practical joke Eltham walked up briskly You re in demand to night Doctor he said A young person called for you almost directly you had left your house and learning where you were gone followed you Indeed I said a trifle incredulously There are plenty of other doctors if the case is an urgent one She may have thought it would save time as you were actually up and dressed explained Eltham and the house is quite near to here I understand I looked at him a little blankly Was this another effort of the unknown jester I have been fooled once I said That phone call was a hoax But I feel certain declared Eltham earnestly that this is genuine The poor girl was dreadfully agitated her master has broken his leg and is lying helpless number two hundred eighty Rectory Grove Where is the girl I asked sharply She ran back directly she had given me her message Was she a servant I should imagine so French I think But she was so wrapped up I had little more than a glimpse of her I am sorry to hear that some one has played a silly joke on you but believe me he was very earnest this is no jest The poor girl could scarcely speak for sobs She mistook me for you of course Oh said I grimly well I suppose I must go Broken leg you said and my surgical bag splints and so forth are at home My dear Petrie cried Eltham in his enthusiastic way you no doubt can do something to alleviate the poor man s suffering immediately I will run back to your rooms for the bag and rejoin you at two hundred eighty Rectory Grove It s awfully good of you Eltham He held up his hand The call of suffering humanity Petrie is one which I may no more refuse to hear than you I made no further protest after that for his point of view was evident and his determination adamant but told him where he would find the bag and once more set out across the moonbright common he pursuing a westerly direction and I going east Some three hundred yards I had gone I suppose and my brain had been very active the while when something occurred to me which placed a new complexion upon this second summons I thought of the falsity of the first of the improbability of even the most hardened practical joker practising his wiles at one o clock in the morning I thought of our recent conversation above all I thought of the girl who had delivered the message to Eltham the girl whom he had described as a French maid whose personal charm had so completely enlisted his sympathies Now to this train of thought came a new one and adding it my suspicion became almost a certainty I remembered as knowing the district I should have remembered before that there was no number two hundred eighty in Rectory Grove Pulling up sharply I stood looking about me Not a living soul was in sight not even a policeman Where the lamps marked the main paths across the common nothing moved in the shadows about me nothing stirred But something stirred within me a warning voice which for long had lain dormant What was afoot A breeze caressed the leaves overhead breaking the silence with mysterious whisperings Some portentous truth was seeking for admittance to my brain I strove to reassure myself but the sense of impending evil and of mystery became heavier At last I could combat my strange fears no longer I turned and began to run toward the south side of the common toward my rooms and after Eltham I had hoped to head him off but came upon no sign of him An all night tramcar passed at the moment that I reached the high road and as I ran around behind it I saw that my windows were lighted and that there was a light in the hall My key was yet in the lock when my housekeeper opened the door There s a gentleman just come Doctor she began I thrust past her and raced up the stairs into my study Standing by the writing table was a tall thin man his gaunt face brown as a coffee berry and his steely gray eyes fixed upon me My heart gave a great leap and seemed to stand still It was Nayland Smith Smith I cried Smith old man by God I m glad to see you He wrung my hand hard looking at me with his searching eyes but there was little enough of gladness in his face He was altogether grayer than when last I had seen him grayer and sterner Where is Eltham I asked Smith started back as though I had struck him Eltham he whispered Eltham is Eltham here I left him ten minutes ago on the common Smith dashed his right fist into the palm of his left hand and his eyes gleamed almost wildly My God Petrie he said am I fated always to come too late My dreadful fears in that instant were confirmed I seemed to feel my legs totter beneath me Smith you don t mean I do Petrie His voice sounded very far away Fu Manchu is here and Eltham God help him is his first victim CHAPTER II ELTHAM VANISHES Smith went racing down the stairs like a man possessed Heavy with such a foreboding of calamity as I had not known for two years I followed him along the hall and out into the road The very peace and beauty of the night in some way increased my mental agitation The sky was lighted almost tropically with such a blaze of stars as I could not recall to have seen since my futile search concluded I had left Egypt The glory of the moonlight yellowed the lamps speckled across the expanse of the common The night was as still as night can ever be in London The dimming pulse of a cab or car alone disturbed the stillness With a quick glance to right and left Smith ran across on to the common and leaving the door wide open behind me I followed The path which Eltham had pursued terminated almost opposite to my house One s gaze might follow it white and empty for several hundred yards past the pond and further until it became overshadowed and was lost amid a clump of trees I came up with Smith and side by side we ran on whilst pantingly I told my tale It was a trick to get you away from him cried Smith They meant no doubt to make some attempt at your house but as he came out with you an alternative plan Abreast of the pond my companion slowed down and finally stopped Where did you last see Eltham he asked rapidly I took his arm turning him slightly to the right and pointed across the moonbathed common You see that clump of bushes on the other side of the road I said There s a path to the left of it I took that path and he took this We parted at the point where they meet Smith walked right down to the edge of the water and peered about over the surface What he hoped to find there I could not imagine Whatever it had been he was disappointed and he turned to me again frowning perplexedly and tugging at the lobe of his left ear an old trick which reminded me of gruesome things we had lived through in the past Come on he jerked It may be amongst the trees From the tone of his voice I knew that he was tensed up nervously and his mood but added to the apprehension of my own What may be amongst the trees Smith I asked He walked on God knows Petrie but I fear Behind us along the highroad a tramcar went rocking by doubtless bearing a few belated workers homeward The stark incongruity of the thing was appalling How little those weary toilers hemmed about with the commonplace suspected that almost within sight from the car windows in a place of prosy benches iron railings and unromantic flickering lamps two fellow men moved upon the border of a horror land Beneath the trees a shadow carpet lay its edges tropically sharp and fully ten yards from the first of the group we two hatless both and sharing a common dread paused for a moment and listened The car had stopped at the further extremity of the common and now with a moan that grew to a shriek was rolling on its way again We stood and listened until silence reclaimed the night Not a footstep could be heard Then slowly we walked on At the edge of the little coppice we stopped again abruptly Smith turned and thrust his pistol into my hand A white ray of light pierced the shadows my companion carried an electric torch But no trace of Eltham was discoverable There had been a heavy shower of rain during the evening just before sunset and although the open paths were dry again under the trees the ground was still moist Ten yards within the coppice we came upon tracks the tracks of one running as the deep imprints of the toes indicated Abruptly the tracks terminated others softer joined them two sets converging from left and right There was a confused patch trailing off to the west then this became indistinct and was finally lost upon the hard ground outside the group For perhaps a minute or more we ran about from tree to tree and from bush to bush searching like hounds for a scent and fearful of what we might find We found nothing and fully in the moonlight we stood facing one another The night was profoundly still Nayland Smith stepped back into the shadows and began slowly to turn his head from left to right taking in the entire visible expanse of the common Toward a point where the road bisected it he stared intently Then with a bound he set off Come on Petrie he cried There they are Vaulting a railing he went away over a field like a madman Recovering from the shock of surprise I followed him but he was well ahead of me and making for some vaguely seen object moving against the lights of the roadway Another railing was vaulted and the corner of a second triangular grass patch crossed at a hot sprint We were twenty yards from the road when the sound of a starting motor broke the silence We gained the graveled footpath only to see the taillight of the car dwindling to the north Smith leaned dizzily against a tree Eltham is in that car he gasped Just God are we to stand here and see him taken away to He beat his fist upon the tree in a sort of tragic despair The nearest cab rank was no great distance away but excluding the possibility of no cab being there it might for all practical purposes as well have been a mile off The beat of the retreating motor was scarcely audible the lights might but just be distinguished Then coming in an opposite direction appeared the headlamp of another car of a car that raced nearer and nearer to us so that within a few seconds of its first appearance we found ourselves bathed in the beam of its headlights Smith bounded out into the road and stood a weird silhouette with upraised arms fully in its course The brakes were applied hurriedly It was a big limousine and its driver swerved perilously in avoiding Smith and nearly ran into me But the breathless moment past the car was pulled up head on to the railings and a man in evening clothes was demanding excitedly what had happened Smith a hatless disheveled figure stepped up to the door My name is Nayland Smith he said rapidly Burmese Commissioner He snatched a letter from his pocket and thrust it into the hands of the bewildered man Read that It is signed by another Commissioner the Commissioner of Police With amazement written all over him the other obeyed You see continued my friend tersely it is carte blanche I wish to commandeer your car sir on a matter of life and death The other returned the letter Allow me to offer it he said descending My man will take your orders I can finish my journey by cab I am But Smith did not wait to learn whom he might be Quick he cried to the stupefied chauffeur You passed a car a minute ago yonder Can you overtake it I can try sir if I don t lose her track Smith leaped in pulling me after him Do it he snapped There are no speed limits for me Thanks Goodnight sir We were off The car swung around and the chase commenced One last glimpse I had of the man we had dispossessed standing alone by the roadside and at ever increasing speed we leaped away in the track of Eltham s captors Smith was too highly excited for ordinary conversation but he threw out short staccato remarks I have followed Fu Manchu from Hongkong he jerked Lost him at Suez He got here a boat ahead of me Eltham has been corresponding with some mandarin up country Knew that Came straight to you Only got in this evening He Fu Manchu has been sent here to get Eltham My God and he has him He will question him The interior of China a seething pot Petrie They had to stop the leakage of information He is here for that The car pulled up with a jerk that pitched me out of my seat and the chauffeur leaped to the road and ran ahead Smith was out in a trice as the man who had run up to a constable came racing back Jump in sir jump in he cried his eyes bright with the lust of the chase they are making for Battersea And we were off again Through the empty streets we roared on A place of gasometers and desolate waste lots slipped behind and we were in a narrow way where gates of yards and a few lowly houses faced upon a prospect of high blank wall Thames on our right said Smith peering ahead His rathole is by the river as usual Hi he grabbed up the speaking tube Stop Stop The limousine swung in to the narrow sidewalk and pulled up close by a yard gate I too had seen our quarry a long low bodied car showing no inside lights It had turned the next corner where a street lamp shone greenly not a hundred yards ahead Smith leaped out and I followed him That must be a cul de sac he said and turned to the eager eyed chauffeur Run back to that last turning he ordered and wait there out of sight Bring the car up when you hear a police whistle The man looked disappointed but did not question the order As he began to back away Smith grasped me by the arm and drew me forward We must get to that corner he said and see where the car stands without showing ourselves CHAPTER III THE WIRE JACKET I suppose we were not more than a dozen paces from the lamp when we heard the thudding of the motor The car was backing out It was a desperate moment for it seemed that we could not fail to be discovered Nayland Smith began to look about him feverishly for a hiding place a quest in which I seconded with equal anxiety And Fate was kind to us doubly kind as after events revealed A wooden gate broke the expanse of wall hard by upon the right and as the result of some recent accident a ragged gap had been torn in the panels close to the top The chain of the padlock hung loosely and in a second Smith was up with his foot in this as in a stirrup He threw his arm over the top and drew himself upright A second later he was astride the broken gate Up you come Petrie he said and reached down his hand to aid me I got my foot into the loop of chain grasped at a projection in the gatepost and found myself up There is a crossbar on this side to stand on said Smith He climbed over and vanished in the darkness I was still astride the broken gate when the car turned the corner slowly for there was scanty room but I was standing upon the bar on the inside and had my head below the gap ere the driver could possibly have seen me Stay where you are until he passes hissed my companion below There is a row of kegs under you The sound of the motor passing outside grew loud louder then began to die away I felt about with my left foot discerned the top of a keg and dropped panting beside Smith Phew I said that was a close thing Smith how do we know That we have followed the right car he interrupted Ask yourself the question what would any ordinary man be doing motoring in a place like this at two o clock in the morning You are right Smith I agreed Shall we get out again Not yet I have an idea Look yonder He grasped my arm turning me in the desired direction Beyond a great expanse of unbroken darkness a ray of moonlight slanted into the place wherein we stood spilling its cold radiance upon rows of kegs That s another door continued my friend I now began dimly to perceive him beside me If my calculations are not entirely wrong it opens on a wharf gate A steam siren hooted dismally apparently from quite close at hand I m right snapped Smith That turning leads down to the gate Come on Petrie He directed the light of the electric torch upon a narrow path through the ranks of casks and led the way to the further door A good two feet of moonlight showed along the top I heard Smith straining then These kegs are all loaded with grease he said and I want to reconnoiter over that door I am leaning on a crate which seems easy to move I reported Yes it s empty Lend a hand We grasped the empty crate and between us set it up on a solid pedestal of casks Then Smith mounted to this observation platform and I scrambled up beside him and looked down upon the lane outside It terminated as Smith had foreseen at a wharf gate some six feet to the right of our post Piled up in the lane beneath us against the warehouse door was a stack of empty casks Beyond over the way was a kind of ramshackle building that had possibly been a dwelling house at some time Bills were stuck in the ground floor window indicating that the three floors were to let as offices so much was discernible in that reflected moonlight I could hear the tide lapping upon the wharf could feel the chill from the river and hear the vague noises which night nor day never cease upon the great commercial waterway Down whispered Smith Make no noise I suspected it They heard the car following I obeyed clutching at him for support for I was suddenly dizzy and my heart was leaping wildly furiously You saw her he whispered Saw her yes I had seen her And my poor dream world was toppling about me its cities ashes and its fairness dust Peering from the window her great eyes wondrous in the moonlight and her red lips parted hair gleaming like burnished foam and her anxious gaze set upon the corner of the lane was Karamaneh Karamaneh whom once we had rescued from the house of this fiendish Chinese doctor Karamaneh who had been our ally in fruitless quest of whom when too late I realized how empty my life was become I had wasted what little of the world s goods I possessed Karamaneh Poor old Petrie murmured Smith I knew but I hadn t the heart He has her again God knows by what chains he holds her But she s only a woman old boy and women are very much alike very much alike from Charing Cross to Pagoda Road He rested his hand on my shoulder for a moment I am ashamed to confess that I was trembling then clenching my teeth with that mechanical physical effort which often accompanies a mental one I swallowed the bitter draught of Nayland Smith s philosophy He was raising himself to peer cautiously over the top of the door I did likewise The window from which the girl had looked was nearly on a level with our eyes and as I raised my head above the woodwork I quite distinctly saw her go out of the room The door as she opened it admitted a dull light against which her figure showed silhouetted for a moment Then the door was reclosed We must risk the other windows rapped Smith Before I had grasped the nature of his plan he was over and had dropped almost noiselessly upon the casks outside Again I followed his lead You are not going to attempt anything singlehanded against him I asked Petrie Eltham is in that house He has been brought here to be put to the question in the medieval and Chinese sense Is there time to summon assistance I shuddered This had been in my mind certainly but so expressed it was definitely horrible revolting yet stimulating You have the pistol added Smith follow closely and quietly He walked across the tops of the casks and leaped down pointing to that nearest to the closed door of the house I helped him place it under the open window A second we set beside it and not without some noise got a third on top Smith mounted His jaw muscles were very prominent and his eyes shone like steel but he was as cool as though he were about to enter a theater and not the den of the most stupendous genius who ever worked for evil I would forgive any man who knowing doctor Fu Manchu feared him I feared him myself feared him as one fears a scorpion but when Nayland Smith hauled himself up on the wooden ledge above the door and swung thence into the darkened room I followed and was in close upon his heels But I admired him for he had every ampere of his self possession in hand my own case was different He spoke close to my ear Is your hand steady We may have to shoot I thought of Karamaneh of lovely dark eyed Karamaneh whom this wonderful evil product of secret China had stolen from me for so I now adjudged it Rely upon me I said grimly I The words ceased frozen on my tongue There are things that one seeks to forget but it is my lot often to remember the sound which at that moment literally struck me rigid with horror Yet it was only a groan but merciful God I pray that it may never be my lot to listen to such a groan again Smith drew a sibilant breath It s Eltham he whispered hoarsely they re torturing No no screamed a woman s voice a voice that thrilled me anew but with another emotion Not that not I distinctly heard the sound of a blow Followed a sort of vague scuffling A door somewhere at the back of the house opened and shut again Some one was coming along the passage toward us Stand back Smith s voice was low but perfectly steady Leave it to me Nearer came the footsteps and nearer I could hear suppressed sobs The door opened admitting again the faint light and Karamaneh came in The place was quite unfurnished offering no possibility of hiding but to hide was unnecessary Her slim figure had not crossed the threshold ere Smith had his arm about the girl s waist and one hand clapped to her mouth A stifled gasp she uttered and he lifted her into the room I stepped forward and closed the door A faint perfume stole to my nostrils a vague elusive breath of the East reminiscent of strange days that now seemed to belong to a remote past Karamaneh that faint indefinable perfume was part of her dainty personality it may appear absurd impossible but many and many a time I had dreamt of it In my breast pocket rapped Smith the light I bent over the girl as he held her She was quite still but I could have wished that I had had more certain mastery of myself I took the torch from Smith s pocket and mechanically directed it upon the captive She was dressed very plainly wearing a simple blue skirt and white blouse It was easy to divine that it was she whom Eltham had mistaken for a French maid A brooch set with a ruby was pinned at the point where the blouse opened gleaming fierily and harshly against the soft skin Her face was pale and her eyes wide with fear There is some cord in my right hand pocket said Smith I came provided Tie her wrists I obeyed him silently The girl offered no resistance but I think I never essayed a less congenial task than that of binding her white wrists The jeweled fingers lay quite listlessly in my own Make a good job of it rapped Smith significantly A flush rose to my cheeks for I knew well enough what he meant She is fastened I said and I turned the ray of the torch upon her again Smith removed his hand from her mouth but did not relax his grip of her She looked up at me with eyes in which I could have sworn there was no recognition But a flush momentarily swept over her face and left it pale again We shall have to gag her Smith I can t do it The girl s eyes filled with tears and she looked up at my companion pitifully Please don t be cruel to me she whispered with that soft accent which always played havoc with my composure Every one every one is cruel to me I will promise indeed I will swear to be quiet Oh believe me if you can save him I will do nothing to hinder you Her beautiful head drooped Have some pity for me as well Karamaneh I said We would have believed you once We cannot now She started violently You know my name Her voice was barely audible Yet I have never seen you in my life See if the door locks interrupted Smith harshly Dazed by the apparent sincerity in the voice of our lovely captive vacant from wonder of it all I opened the door felt for and found a key We left Karamaneh crouching against the wall her great eyes were turned towards me fascinatedly Smith locked the door with much care We began a tip toed progress along the dimly lighted passage From beneath a door on the left and near the end a brighter light shone Beyond that again was another door A voice was speaking in the lighted room yet I could have sworn that Karamaneh had come not from there but from the room beyond from the far end of the passage But the voice who having once heard it could ever mistake that singular voice alternately guttural and sibilant doctor Fu Manchu was speaking I have asked you came with ever increasing clearness Smith had begun to turn the knob to reveal to me the name of your correspondent in Nan Yang I have suggested that he may be the Mandarin Yen Sun Yat but you have declined to confirm me Yet I know Smith had the door open a good three inches and was peering in that some official some high official is a traitor Am I to resort again to the question to learn his name Ice seemed to enter my veins at the unseen inquisitor s intonation of the words the question This was the Twentieth Century yet there in that damnable room Smith threw the door open Through a sort of haze born mostly of horror but not entirely I saw Eltham stripped to the waist and tied with his arms upstretched to a rafter in the ancient ceiling A Chinaman who wore a slop shop blue suit and who held an open knife in his hand stood beside him Eltham was ghastly white The appearance of his chest puzzled me momentarily then I realized that a sort of tourniquet of wire netting was screwed so tightly about him that the flesh swelled out in knobs through the mesh There was blood God in heaven screamed Smith frenziedly they have the wire jacket on him Shoot down that damned Chinaman Petrie Shoot Shoot Lithely as a cat the man with the knife leaped around but I raised the Browning and deliberately with a cool deliberation that came to me suddenly shot him through the head I saw his oblique eyes turn up to the whites I saw the mark squarely between his brows and with no word nor cry he sank to his knees and toppled forward with one yellow hand beneath him and one outstretched clutching clutching convulsively His pigtail came unfastened and began to uncoil slowly like a snake I handed the pistol to Smith I was perfectly cool now and I leaped forward took up the bloody knife from the floor and cut Eltham s lashings He sank into my arms Praise God he murmured weakly He is more merciful to me than perhaps I deserve Unscrew the jacket Petrie I think I was very near to weakening Praise the good God Who gave me fortitude I got the screw of the accursed thing loosened but the act of removing the jacket was too agonizing for Eltham man of iron though he was I laid him swooning on the floor Where is Fu Manchu Nayland Smith from just within the door threw out the query in a tone of stark amaze I stood up I could do nothing more for the poor victim at the moment and looked about me The room was innocent of furniture save for heaps of rubbish on the floor and a tin oil lamp hung on the wall The dead Chinaman lay close beside Smith There was no second door the one window was barred and from this room we had heard the voice the unmistakable unforgettable voice of doctor Fu Manchu But doctor Fu Manchu was not there Neither of us could accept the fact for a moment we stood there looking from the dead man to the tortured man who only swooned in a state of helpless incredulity Then the explanation flashed upon us both simultaneously and with a cry of baffled rage Smith leaped along the passage to the second door It was wide open I stood at his elbow when he swept its emptiness with the ray of his pocket lamp There was a speaking tube fixed between the two rooms Smith literally ground his teeth Yet Petrie he said we have learnt something Fu Manchu had evidently promised Eltham his life if he would divulge the name of his correspondent He meant to keep his word it is a sidelight on his character How so Eltham has never seen doctor Fu Manchu but Eltham knows certain parts of China better than you know the Strand Probably if he saw Fu Manchu he would recognize him for who he really is and this it seems the Doctor is anxious to avoid We ran back to where we had left Karamaneh The room was empty Defeated Petrie said Smith bitterly The Yellow Devil is loosed on London again He leaned from the window and the skirl of a police whistle split the stillness of the night CHAPTER IV THE CRY OF A NIGHTHAWK Such were the episodes that marked the coming of doctor Fu Manchu to London that awakened fears long dormant and reopened old wounds nay poured poison into them I strove desperately by close attention to my professional duties to banish the very memory of Karamaneh from my mind desperately but how vainly Peace was for me no more joy was gone from the world and only mockery remained as my portion Poor Eltham we had placed in a nursing establishment where his indescribable hurts could be properly tended and his uncomplaining fortitude not infrequently made me thoroughly ashamed of myself Needless to say Smith had made such other arrangements as were necessary to safeguard the injured man and these proved so successful that the malignant being whose plans they thwarted abandoned his designs upon the heroic clergyman and directed his attention elsewhere as I must now proceed to relate Dusk always brought with it a cloud of apprehensions for darkness must ever be the ally of crime and it was one night long after the clocks had struck the mystic hour when churchyards yawn that the hand of doctor Fu Manchu again stretched out to grasp a victim I was dismissing a chance patient Good night doctor Petrie he said Good night mister Forsyth I replied and having conducted my late visitor to the door I closed and bolted it switched off the light and went upstairs My patient was chief officer of one of the P and O boats He had cut his hand rather badly on the homeward run and signs of poisoning having developed had called to have the wound treated apologizing for troubling me at so late an hour but explaining that he had only just come from the docks The hall clock announced the hour of one as I ascended the stairs I found myself wondering what there was in mister Forsyth s appearance which excited some vague and elusive memory Coming to the top floor I opened the door of a front bedroom and was surprised to find the interior in darkness Smith I called Come here and watch was the terse response Nayland Smith was sitting in the dark at the open window and peering out across the common Even as I saw him a dim silhouette I could detect that tensity in his attitude which told of high strung nerves I joined him What is it I said curiously I don t know Watch that clump of elms His masterful voice had the dry tone in it betokening excitement I leaned on the ledge beside him and looked out The blaze of stars almost compensated for the absence of the moon and the night had a quality of stillness that made for awe This was a tropical summer and the common with its dancing lights dotted irregularly about it had an unfamiliar look to night The clump of nine elms showed as a dense and irregular mass lacking detail Such moods as that which now claimed my friend are magnetic I had no thought of the night s beauty for it only served to remind me that somewhere amid London s millions was lurking an uncanny being whose life was a mystery whose very existence was a scientific miracle Where s your patient rapped Smith His abrupt query diverted my thoughts into a new channel No footstep disturbed the silence of the highroad where was my patient I craned from the window Smith grabbed my arm Don t lean out he said I drew back glancing at him surprisedly For Heaven s sake why not I ll tell you presently Petrie Did you see him I did and I can t make out what he is doing He seems to have remained standing at the gate for some reason He has seen it snapped Smith Watch those elms His hand remained upon my arm gripping it nervously Shall I say that I was surprised I can say it with truth But I shall add that I was thrilled eerily for this subdued excitement and alert watching of Smith could only mean one thing Fu Manchu And that was enough to set me watching as keenly as he to set me listening not only for sounds outside the house but for sounds within Doubts suspicions dreads heaped themselves up in my mind Why was Forsyth standing there at the gate I had never seen him before to my knowledge yet there was something oddly reminiscent about the man Could it be that his visit formed part of a plot Yet his wound had been genuine enough Thus my mind worked feverishly such was the effect of an unspoken thought Fu Manchu Nayland Smith s grip tightened on my arm There it is again Petrie he whispered Look look His words were wholly unnecessary I too had seen it a wonderful and uncanny sight Out of the darkness under the elms low down upon the ground grew a vaporous blue light It flared up elfinish then began to ascend Like an igneous phantom a witch flame it rose high higher higher to what I adjudged to be some twelve feet or more from the ground Then high in the air it died away again as it had come For God s sake Smith what was it Don t ask me Petrie I have seen it twice We He paused Rapid footsteps sounded below Over Smith s shoulder I saw Forsyth cross the road climb the low rail and set out across the common Smith sprang impetuously to his feet We must stop him he said hoarsely then clapping a hand to my mouth as I was about to call out Not a sound Petrie He ran out of the room and went blundering downstairs in the dark crying Out through the garden the side entrance I overtook him as he threw wide the door of my dispensing room Through it he ran and opened the door at the other end I followed him out closing it behind me The smell from some tobacco plants in a neighboring flower bed was faintly perceptible no breeze stirred and in the great silence I could hear Smith in front of me tugging at the bolt of the gate Then he had it open and I stepped out close on his heels and left the door ajar We must not appear to have come from your house explained Smith rapidly I will go along the highroad and cross to the common a hundred yards up where there is a pathway as though homeward bound to the north side Give me half a minute s start then you proceed in an opposite direction and cross from the corner of the next road Directly you are out of the light of the street lamps get over the rails and run for the elms He thrust a pistol into my hand and was off While he had been with me speaking in that incisive impetuous way of his with his dark face close to mine and his eyes gleaming like steel I had been at one with him in his feverish mood but now when I stood alone in that staid and respectable byway holding a loaded pistol in my hand the whole thing became utterly unreal It was in an odd frame of mind that I walked to the next corner as directed for I was thinking not of doctor Fu Manchu the great and evil man who dreamed of Europe and America under Chinese rule not of Nayland Smith who alone stood between the Chinaman and the realization of his monstrous schemes not even of Karamaneh the slave girl whose glorious beauty was a weapon of might in Fu Manchu s hand but of what impression I must have made upon a patient had I encountered one then Such were my ideas up to the moment that I crossed to the common and vaulted into the field on my right As I began to run toward the elms I found myself wondering what it was all about and for what we were come Fifty yards west of the trees it occurred to me that if Smith had counted on cutting Forsyth off we were too late for it appeared to me that he must already be in the coppice I was right Twenty paces more I ran and ahead of me from the elms came a sound Clearly it came through the still air the eerie hoot of a nighthawk I could not recall ever to have heard the cry of that bird on the common before but oddly enough I attached little significance to it until in the ensuing instant a most dreadful scream a scream in which fear and loathing and anger were hideously blended thrilled me with horror After that I have no recollection of anything until I found myself standing by the southernmost elm Smith I cried breathlessly Smith my God where are you As if in answer to my cry came an indescribable sound a mingled sobbing and choking Out from the shadows staggered a ghastly figure that of a man whose face appeared to be streaked His eyes glared at me madly and he mowed the air with his hands like one blind and insane with fear I started back words died upon my tongue The figure reeled and the man fell babbling and sobbing at my very feet Inert I stood looking down at him He writhed a moment and was still The silence again became perfect Then from somewhere beyond the elms Nayland Smith appeared I did not move Even when he stood beside me I merely stared at him fatuously I let him walk to his death Petrie I heard dimly God forgive me God forgive me The words aroused me Smith my voice came as a whisper for one awful moment I thought So did some one else he rapped Our poor sailor has met the end designed for me Petrie At that I realized two things I knew why Forsyth s face had struck me as being familiar in some puzzling way and I knew why Forsyth now lay dead upon the grass Save that he was a fair man and wore a slight mustache he was in features and build the double of Nayland Smith CHAPTER V THE NET We raised the poor victim and turned him over on his back I dropped upon my knees and with unsteady fingers began to strike a match A slight breeze was arising and sighing gently through the elms but screened by my hands the flame of the match took life It illuminated wanly the sun baked face of Nayland Smith his eyes gleaming with unnatural brightness I bent forward and the dying light of the match touched that other face Oh God whispered Smith A faint puff of wind extinguished the match In all my surgical experience I had never met with anything quite so horrible Forsyth s livid face was streaked with tiny streams of blood which proceeded from a series of irregular wounds One group of these clustered upon his left temple another beneath his right eye and others extended from the chin down to the throat They were black almost like tattoo marks and the entire injured surface was bloated indescribably His fists were clenched he was quite rigid Smith s piercing eyes were set upon me eloquently as I knelt on the path and made my examination an examination which that first glimpse when Forsyth came staggering out from the trees had rendered useless a mere matter of form He s quite dead Smith I said huskily It s unnatural it Smith began beating his fist into his left palm and taking little short nervous strides up and down beside the dead man I could hear a car humming along the highroad but I remained there on my knees staring dully at the disfigured bloody face which but a matter of minutes since had been that of a clean looking British seaman I found myself contrasting his neat squarely trimmed mustache with the bloated face above it and counting the little drops of blood which trembled upon its edge There were footsteps approaching I stood up The footsteps quickened and I turned as a constable ran up What s this he demanded gruffly and stood with his fists clenched looking from Smith to me and down at that which lay between us Then his hand flew to his breast there was a silvern gleam and Drop that whistle snapped Smith and struck it from the man s hand Where s your lantern Don t ask questions The constable started back and was evidently debating upon his chances with the two of us when my friend pulled a letter from his pocket and thrust it under the man s nose Read that he directed harshly and then listen to my orders There was something in his voice which changed the officer s opinion of the situation He directed the light of his lantern upon the open letter and seemed to be stricken with wonder If you have any doubts continued Smith you may not be familiar with the Commissioner s signature you have only to ring up Scotland Yard from doctor Petrie s house to which we shall now return to disperse them He pointed to Forsyth Help us to carry him there We must not be seen this must be hushed up You understand It must not get into the press The man saluted respectfully and the three of us addressed ourselves to the mournful task By slow stages we bore the dead man to the edge of the common carried him across the road and into my house without exciting attention even on the part of those vagrants who nightly slept out in the neighborhood We laid our burden upon the surgery table You will want to make an examination Petrie said Smith in his decisive way and the officer here might phone for the ambulance I have some investigations to make also I must have the pocket lamp He raced upstairs to his room and an instant later came running down again The front door banged The telephone is in the hall I said to the constable Thank you sir He went out of the surgery as I switched on the lamp over the table and began to examine the marks upon Forsyth s skin These as I have said were in groups and nearly all in the form of elongated punctures a fairly deep incision with a pear shaped and superficial scratch beneath it One of the tiny wounds had penetrated the right eye The symptoms or those which I had been enabled to observe as Forsyth had first staggered into view from among the elms were most puzzling Clearly enough the muscles of articulation and the respiratory muscles had been affected and now the livid face dotted over with tiny wounds they were also on the throat set me mentally groping for a clue to the manner of his death No clue presented itself and my detailed examination of the body availed me nothing The gray herald of dawn was come when the police arrived with the ambulance and took Forsyth away I was just taking my cap from the rack when Nayland Smith returned Smith I cried have you found anything He stood there in the gray light of the hallway tugging at the lobe of his left ear an old trick of his The bronzed face looked very gaunt I thought and his eyes were bright with that febrile glitter which once I had disliked but which I had learned from experience were due to tremendous nervous excitement At such times he could act with icy coolness and his mental faculties seemed temporarily to acquire an abnormal keenness He made no direct reply but Have you any milk he jerked abruptly So wholly unexpected was the question that for a moment I failed to grasp it Then Milk I began Exactly Petrie If you can find me some milk I shall be obliged I turned to descend to the kitchen when The remains of the turbot from dinner Petrie would also be welcome and I think I should like a trowel I stopped at the stairhead and faced him I cannot suppose that you are joking Smith I said but He laughed dryly Forgive me old man he replied I was so preoccupied with my own train of thought that it never occurred to me how absurd my request must have sounded I will explain my singular tastes later at the moment hustle is the watchword Evidently he was in earnest and I ran downstairs accordingly returning with a garden trowel a plate of cold fish and a glass of milk Thanks Petrie said Smith If you would put the milk in a jug I was past wondering so I simply went and fetched a jug into which he poured the milk Then with the trowel in his pocket the plate of cold turbot in one hand and the milk jug in the other he made for the door He had it open when another idea evidently occurred to him I ll trouble you for the pistol Petrie I handed him the pistol without a word Don t assume that I want to mystify you he added but the presence of any one else might jeopardize my plan I don t expect to be long The cold light of dawn flooded the hallway momentarily then the door closed again and I went upstairs to my study watching Nayland Smith as he strode across the common in the early morning mist He was making for the Nine Elms but I lost sight of him before he reached them I sat there for some time watching for the first glow of sunrise A policeman tramped past the house and a while later a belated reveler in evening clothes That sense of unreality assailed me again Out there in the gray mists a man who was vested with powers which rendered him a law unto himself who had the British Government behind him in all that he might choose to do who had been summoned from Rangoon to London on singular and dangerous business was employing himself with a plate of cold turbot a jug of milk and a trowel Away to the right and just barely visible a tramcar stopped by the common then proceeded on its way coming in a westerly direction Its lights twinkled yellowly through the grayness but I was less concerned with the approaching car than with the solitary traveler who had descended from it As the car went rocking by below me I strained my eyes in an endeavor more clearly to discern the figure which leaving the highroad had struck out across the common It was that of a woman who seemingly carried a bulky bag or parcel One must be a gross materialist to doubt that there are latent powers in man which man in modern times neglects or knows not how to develop I became suddenly conscious of a burning curiosity respecting this lonely traveler who traveled at an hour so strange With no definite plan in mind I went downstairs took a cap from the rack and walked briskly out of the house and across the common in a direction which I thought would enable me to head off the woman I had slightly miscalculated the distance as Fate would have it and with a patch of gorse effectually screening my approach I came upon her kneeling on the damp grass and unfastening the bundle which had attracted my attention I stopped and watched her She was dressed in bedraggled fashion in rusty black wore a common black straw hat and a thick veil but it seemed to me that the dexterous hands at work untying the bundle were slim and white and I perceived a pair of hideous cotton gloves lying on the turf beside her As she threw open the wrappings and lifted out something that looked like a small shrimping net I stepped around the bush crossed silently the intervening patch of grass and stood beside her A faint breath of perfume reached me of a perfume which like the secret incense of Ancient Egypt seemed to assail my soul The glamour of the Orient was in that subtle essence and I only knew one woman who used it I bent over the kneeling figure Good morning I said can I assist you in any way She came to her feet like a startled deer and flung away from me with the lithe movement of some Eastern dancing girl Now came the sun and its heralding rays struck sparks from the jewels upon the white fingers of this woman who wore the garments of a mendicant My heart gave a great leap It was with difficulty that I controlled my voice There is no cause for alarm I added She stood watching me even through the coarse veil I could see how her eyes glittered I stooped and picked up the net Oh The whispered word was scarcely audible but it was enough I doubted no longer This is a net for bird snaring I said What strange bird are you seeking Karamaneh With a passionate gesture Karamaneh snatched off the veil and with it the ugly black hat The cloud of wonderful intractable hair came rumpling about her face and her glorious eyes blazed out upon me How beautiful they were with the dark beauty of an Egyptian night how often had they looked into mine in dreams To labor against a ceaseless yearning for a woman whom one knows upon evidence that none but a fool might reject to be worthless evil is there any torture to which the soul of man is subject more pitiless Yet this was my lot for what past sins assigned to me I was unable to conjecture and this was the woman this lovely slave of a monster this creature of doctor Fu Manchu I suppose you will declare that you do not know me I said harshly Her lips trembled but she made no reply It is very convenient to forget sometimes I ran on bitterly then checked myself for I knew that my words were prompted by a feckless desire to hear her defense by a fool s hope that it might be an acceptable one I looked again at the net contrivance in my hand it had a strong spring fitted to it and a line attached Quite obviously it was intended for snaring What were you about to do I demanded sharply but in my heart poor fool that I was I found admiration for the exquisite arch of Karamaneh s lips and reproach because they were so tremulous She spoke then doctor Petrie Well You seem to be angry with me not so much because of what I do as because I do not remember you Yet Kindly do not revert to the matter I interrupted You have chosen very conveniently to forget that once we were friends Please yourself But answer my question She clasped her hands with a sort of wild abandon Why do you treat me so she cried she had the most fascinating accent imaginable Throw me into prison kill me if you like for what I have done She stamped her foot For what I have done But do not torture me try to drive me mad with your reproaches that I forget you I tell you again I tell you that until you came one night last week to rescue some one from There was the old trick of hesitating before the name of Fu Manchu from him I had never never seen you The dark eyes looked into mine afire with a positive hunger for belief or so I was sorely tempted to suppose But the facts were against her Such a declaration is worthless I said as coldly as I could You are a traitress you betray those who are mad enough to trust you I am no traitress she blazed at me her eyes were magnificent This is mere nonsense You think that it will pay you better to serve Fu Manchu than to remain true to your friends Your slavery for I take it you are posing as a slave again is evidently not very harsh You serve Fu Manchu lure men to their destruction and in return he loads you with jewels lavishes gifts Ah so She sprang forward raising flaming eyes to mine her lips were slightly parted With that wild abandon which betrayed the desert blood in her veins she wrenched open the neck of her bodice and slipped a soft shoulder free of the garment She twisted around so that the white skin was but inches removed from me These are some of the gifts that he lavishes upon me I clenched my teeth Insane thoughts flooded my mind For that creamy skin was red with the marks of the lash She turned quickly rearranging her dress and watching me the while I could not trust myself to speak for a moment then If I am a stranger to you as you claim why do you give me your confidence I asked I have known you long enough to trust you she said simply and turned her head aside Then why do you serve this inhuman monster She snapped her fingers oddly and looked up at me from under her lashes Why do you question me if you think that everything I say is a lie It was a lesson in logic from a woman I changed the subject Tell me what you came here to do I demanded She pointed to the net in my hands To catch birds you have said so yourself What bird She shrugged her shoulders And now a memory was born within my brain it was that of the cry of the nighthawk which had harbingered the death of Forsyth The net was a large and strong one could it be that some horrible fowl of the air some creature unknown to Western naturalists had been released upon the common last night I thought of the marks upon Forsyth s face and throat I thought of the profound knowledge of obscure and dreadful things possessed by the Chinaman The wrapping in which the net had been lay at my feet I stooped and took out from it a wicker basket Karamaneh stood watching me and biting her lip but she made no move to check me I opened the basket It contained a large phial the contents of which possessed a pungent and peculiar smell I was utterly mystified You will have to accompany me to my house I said sternly Karamaneh upturned her great eyes to mine They were wide with fear She was on the point of speaking when I extended my hand to grasp her At that the look of fear was gone and one of rebellion held its place Ere I had time to realize her purpose she flung back from me with that wild grace which I had met with in no other woman turned and ran Fatuously net and basket in hand I stood looking after her The idea of pursuit came to me certainly but I doubted if I could have outrun her For Karamaneh ran not like a girl used to town or even country life but with the lightness and swiftness of a gazelle ran like the daughter of the desert that she was Some two hundred yards she went stopped and looked back It would seem that the sheer joy of physical effort had aroused the devil in her the devil that must lie latent in every woman with eyes like the eyes of Karamaneh In the ever brightening sunlight I could see the lithe figure swaying no rags imaginable could mask its beauty I could see the red lips and gleaming teeth Then and it was music good to hear despite its taunt she laughed defiantly turned and ran again I resigned myself to defeat I blush to add gladly Some evidences of a world awakening were perceptible about me now Feathered choirs hailed the new day joyously Carrying the mysterious contrivance which I had captured from the enemy I set out in the direction of my house my mind very busy with conjectures respecting the link between this bird snare and the cry like that of a nighthawk which we had heard at the moment of Forsyth s death The path that I had chosen led me around the border of the Mound Pond a small pool having an islet in the center Lying at the margin of the pond I was amazed to see the plate and jug which Nayland Smith had borrowed recently Dropping my burden I walked down to the edge of the water I was filled with a sudden apprehension Then as I bent to pick up the now empty jug came a hail All right Petrie Shall join you in a moment I started up looked to right and left but although the voice had been that of Nayland Smith no sign could I discern of his presence Smith I cried Smith Coming Seriously doubting my senses I looked in the direction from which the voice had seemed to proceed and there was Nayland Smith He stood on the islet in the center of the pond and as I perceived him he walked down into the shallow water and waded across to me Good heavens I began One of his rare laughs interrupted me You must think me mad this morning Petrie he said But I have made several discoveries Do you know what that islet in the pond really is Merely an islet I suppose Nothing of the kind it is a burial mound Petrie It marks the site of one of the Plague Pits where victims were buried during the Great Plague of London You will observe that although you have seen it every morning for some years it remains for a British Commissioner resident in Burma to acquaint you with its history Hullo the laughter was gone from his eyes and they were steely hard again what the blazes have we here He picked up the net What a bird trap Exactly I said Smith turned his searching gaze upon me Where did you find it Petrie I did not exactly find it I replied and I related to him the circumstances of my meeting with Karamaneh He directed that cold stare upon me throughout the narrative and when with some embarrassment I had told him of the girl s escape Petrie he said succinctly you are an imbecile I flushed with anger for not even from Nayland Smith whom I esteemed above all other men could I accept such words uttered as he had uttered them We glared at one another Karamaneh he continued coldly is a beautiful toy I grant you but so is a cobra Neither is suitable for playful purposes Smith I cried hotly drop that Adopt another tone or I cannot listen to you You must listen he said squaring his lean jaw truculently You are playing not only with a pretty girl who is the favorite of a Chinese Nero but with my life And I object Petrie on purely personal grounds I felt my anger oozing from me for this was strictly just I had nothing to say and Smith continued You know that she is utterly false yet a glance or two from those dark eyes of hers can make a fool of you A woman made a fool of me once but I learned my lesson you have failed to learn yours If you are determined to go to pieces on the rock that broke up Adam do so But don t involve me in the wreck Petrie for that might mean a yellow emperor of the world and you know it Your words are unnecessarily brutal Smith I said feeling very crestfallen but there perhaps I fully deserve them all You do he assured me but he relaxed immediately A murderous attempt is made upon my life resulting in the death of a perfectly innocent man in no way concerned Along you come and let an accomplice perhaps a participant escape merely because she has a red mouth or black lashes or whatever it is that fascinates you so hopelessly He opened the wicker basket sniffing at the contents Ah he snapped do you recognize this odor Certainly Then you have some idea respecting Karamaneh s quarry Nothing of the kind Smith shrugged his shoulders Come along Petrie he said linking his arm in mine We proceeded Many questions there were that I wanted to put to him but one above all Smith I said what in Heaven s name were you doing on the mound Digging something up No he replied smiling dryly burying something CHAPTER VI UNDER THE ELMS Dusk found Nayland Smith and me at the top bedroom window We knew now that poor Forsyth s body had been properly examined that he had died from poisoning Smith declaring that I did not deserve his confidence had refused to confide in me his theory of the origin of the peculiar marks upon the body On the soft ground under the trees he said I found his tracks right up to the point where something happened There were no other fresh tracks for several yards around He was attacked as he stood close to the trunk of one of the elms Six or seven feet away I found some other tracks very much like this He marked a series of dots upon the blotting pad at his elbow Claws I cried That eerie call like the call of a nighthawk is it some unknown species of flying thing We shall see shortly possibly to night was his reply Since probably owing to the absence of any moon a mistake was made his jaw hardened at the thoughts of poor Forsyth another attempt along the same lines will almost certainly follow you know Fu Manchu s system So in the darkness expectant we sat watching the group of nine elms To night the moon was come raising her Aladdin s lamp up to the star world and summoning magic shadows into being By midnight the highroad showed deserted the common was a place of mystery and save for the periodical passage of an electric car in blazing modernity this was a fit enough stage for an eerie drama No notice of the tragedy had appeared in print Nayland Smith was vested with powers to silence the press No detectives no special constables were posted My friend was of opinion that the publicity which had been given to the deeds of doctor Fu Manchu in the past together with the sometimes clumsy company operation of the police had contributed not a little to the Chinaman s success There is only one thing to fear he jerked suddenly he may not be ready for another attempt to night Why Since he has only been in England for a short time his menagerie of venomous things may be a limited one at present Earlier in the evening there had been a brief but violent thunderstorm with a tropical downpour of rain and now clouds were scudding across the blue of the sky Through a temporary rift in the veiling the crescent of the moon looked down upon us It had a greenish tint and it set me thinking of the filmed green eyes of Fu Manchu The cloud passed and a lake of silver spread out to the edge of the coppice where it terminated at a shadow bank There it is Petrie hissed Nayland Smith A lambent light was born in the darkness it rose slowly unsteadily to a great height and died It s under the trees Smith But he was already making for the door Over his shoulder Bring the pistol Petrie he cried I have another Give me at least twenty yards start or no attempt may be made But the instant I m under the trees join me Out of the house we ran and over onto the common which latterly had been a pageant ground for phantom warring The light did not appear again and as Smith plunged off toward the trees I wondered if he knew what uncanny thing was hidden there I more than suspected that he had solved the mystery His instructions to keep well in the rear I understood Fu Manchu or the creature of Fu Manchu would attempt nothing in the presence of a witness But we knew full well that the instrument of death which was hidden in the elm coppice could do its ghastly work and leave no clue could slay and vanish For had not Forsyth come to a dreadful end while Smith and I were within twenty yards of him Not a breeze stirred as Smith ahead of me for I had slowed my pace came up level with the first tree The moon sailed clear of the straggling cloud wisps which alone told of the recent storm and I noted that an irregular patch of light lay silvern on the moist ground under the elms where otherwise lay shadow He passed on slowly I began to run again Black against the silvern patch I saw him emerge and look up Be careful Smith I cried and I was racing under the trees to join him Uttering a loud cry he leaped away from the pool of light Stand back Petrie he screamed Back further He charged into me shoulder lowered and sent me reeling Mixed up with his excited cry I had heard a loud splintering and sweeping of branches overhead and now as we staggered into the shadows it seemed that one of the elms was reaching down to touch us So at least the phenomenon presented itself to my mind in that fleeting moment while Smith uttering his warning cry was hurling me back Then the truth became apparent With an appalling crash a huge bough fell from above One piercing awful shriek there was a crackling of broken branches and a choking groan The crack of Smith s pistol close beside me completed my confusion of mind Missed he yelled Shoot it Petrie On your left For God s sake don t miss it I turned A lithe black shape was streaking past me I fired once twice Another frightful cry made yet more hideous the nocturne Nayland Smith was directing the ray of a pocket torch upon the fallen bough Have you killed it Petrie he cried Yes yes I stood beside him looking down From the tangle of leaves and twigs an evil yellow face looked up at us The features were contorted with agony but the malignant eyes wherein light was dying regarded us with inflexible hatred The man was pinned beneath the heavy bough his back was broken and as we watched he expired frothing slightly at the mouth and quitted his tenement of clay leaving those glassy eyes set hideously upon us The pagan gods fight upon our side said Smith strangely Elms have a dangerous habit of shedding boughs in still weather particularly after a storm Pan god of the woods with this one has performed Justice s work of retribution I don t understand Where was this man Up the tree lying along the bough which fell Petrie That is why he left no footmarks Last night no doubt he made his escape by swinging from bough to bough ape fashion and descending to the ground somewhere at the other side of the coppice He glanced at me You are wondering perhaps he suggested what caused the mysterious light I could have told you this morning but I fear I was in a bad temper Petrie It s very simple a length of tape soaked in spirit or something of the kind and sheltered from the view of any one watching from your windows behind the trunk of the tree then the end ignited lowered still behind the tree to the ground The operator swinging it around the flame ascended of course I found the unburned fragment of the tape last night a few yards from here I was peering down at Fu Manchu s servant the hideous yellow man who lay dead in a bower of elm leaves He has some kind of leather bag beside him I began Exactly rapped Smith In that he carried his dangerous instrument of death from that he released it Released what What your fascinating friend came to recapture this morning Don t taunt me Smith I said bitterly Is it some species of bird You saw the marks on Forsyth s body and I told you of those which I had traced upon the ground here They were caused by claws Petrie Claws I thought so But what claws The claws of a poisonous thing I recaptured the one used last night killed it against my will and buried it on the mound I was afraid to throw it in the pond lest some juvenile fisherman should pull it out and sustain a scratch I don t know how long the claws would remain venomous You are treating me like a child Smith I said slowly No doubt I am hopelessly obtuse but perhaps you will tell me what this Chinaman carried in a leather bag and released upon Forsyth It was something which you recaptured apparently with the aid of a plate of cold turbot and a jug of milk It was something also which Karamaneh had been sent to recapture with the aid I stopped Go on said Nayland Smith turning the ray to the left what did she have in the basket Valerian I replied mechanically The ray rested upon the lithe creature that I had shot down It was a black cat A cat will go through fire and water for valerian said Smith but I got first innings this morning with fish and milk I had recognized the imprints under the trees for those of a cat and I knew that if a cat had been released here it would still be hiding in the neighborhood probably in the bushes I finally located a cat sure enough and came for bait I laid my trap for the animal was too frightened to be approachable and then shot it I had to That yellow fiend used the light as a decoy The branch which killed him jutted out over the path at a spot where an opening in the foliage above allowed some moon rays to penetrate Directly the victim stood beneath the Chinaman uttered his bird cry the one below looked up and the cat previously held silent and helpless in the leather sack was dropped accurately upon his head But I was growing confused Smith stooped lower The cat s claws are sheathed now he said but if you could examine them you would find that they are coated with a shining black substance Only Fu Manchu knows what that substance is Petrie but you and I know what it can do CHAPTER VII ENTER mister ABEL SLATTIN I don t blame you rapped Nayland Smith Suppose we say then a thousand pounds if you show us the present hiding place of Fu Manchu the payment to be in no way subject to whether we profit by your information or not Abel Slattin shrugged his shoulders racially and returned to the armchair which he had just quitted He reseated himself placing his hat and cane upon my writing table A little agreement in black and white he suggested smoothly Smith raised himself up out of the white cane chair and bending forward over a corner of the table scribbled busily upon a sheet of notepaper with my fountain pen The while he did so I covertly studied our visitor He lay back in the armchair his heavy eyelids lowered deceptively He was a thought overdressed a big man dark haired and well groomed who toyed with a monocle most unsuitable to his type During the preceding conversation I had been vaguely surprised to note mister Abel Slattin s marked American accent Sometimes when Slattin moved a big diamond which he wore upon the third finger of his right hand glittered magnificently There was a sort of bluish tint underlying the dusky skin noticeable even in his hands but proclaiming itself significantly in his puffy face and especially under the eyes I diagnosed a laboring valve somewhere in the heart system Nayland Smith s pen scratched on My glance strayed from our Semitic caller to his cane lying upon the red leather before me It was of most unusual workmanship apparently Indian being made of some kind of dark brown mottled wood bearing a marked resemblance to a snake s skin and the top of the cane was carved in conformity to represent the head of what I took to be a puff adder fragments of stone or beads being inserted to represent the eyes and the whole thing being finished with an artistic realism almost startling When Smith had tossed the written page to Slattin and he having read it with an appearance of carelessness had folded it neatly and placed it in his pocket I said You have a curio here Our visitor whose dark eyes revealed all the satisfaction which by his manner he sought to conceal nodded and took up the cane in his hand It comes from Australia Doctor he replied it s aboriginal work and was given to me by a client You thought it was Indian Everybody does It s my mascot Really It is indeed Its former owner ascribed magical powers to it In fact I believe he thought that it was one of those staffs mentioned in biblical history Aaron s rod suggested Smith glancing at the cane Something of the sort said Slattin standing up and again preparing to depart You will phone us then asked my friend You will hear from me to morrow was the reply Smith returned to the cane armchair and Slattin bowing to both of us made his way to the door as I rang for the girl to show him out Considering the importance of his proposal I began as the door closed you hardly received our visitor with cordiality I hate to have any relations with him answered my friend but we must not be squeamish respecting our instruments in dealing with doctor Fu Manchu Slattin has a rotten reputation even for a private inquiry agent He is little better than a blackmailer How do you know Because I called on our friend Weymouth at the Yard yesterday and looked up the man s record Whatever for I knew that he was concerning himself for some reason in the case Beyond doubt he has established some sort of communication with the Chinese group I am only wondering You don t mean Yes I do Petrie I tell you he is unscrupulous enough to stoop even to that No doubt Slattin knew that this gaunt eager eyed Burmese commissioner was vested with ultimate authority in his quest of the mighty Chinaman who represented things unutterable whose potentialities for evil were boundless as his genius who personified a secret danger the extent and nature of which none of us truly understood And learning of these things with unerring Semitic instinct he had sought an opening in this glittering Rialto But there were two bidders You think he may have sunk so low as to become a creature of Fu Manchu I asked aghast Exactly If it paid him well I do not doubt that he would serve that master as readily as any other His record is about as black as it well could be Slattin is of course an assumed name he was known as Lieutenant Pepley when he belonged to the New York Police and he was kicked out of the service for complicity in an unsavory Chinatown case Chinatown Yes Petrie it made me wonder too and we must not forget that he is undeniably a clever scoundrel Shall you keep any appointment which he may suggest Undoubtedly But I shall not wait until tomorrow What I propose to pay a little informal visit to mister Abel Slattin to night At his office No at his private residence If as I more than suspect his object is to draw us into some trap he will probably report his favorable progress to his employer to night Then we should have followed him Nayland Smith stood up and divested himself of the old shooting jacket He has been followed Petrie he replied with one of his rare smiles Two C I D men have been watching the house all night This was entirely characteristic of my friend s farseeing methods By the way I said you saw Eltham this morning He will soon be convalescent Where in heaven s name can he Don t be alarmed on his behalf Petrie interrupted Smith His life is no longer in danger I stared stupidly No longer in danger He received some time yesterday a letter written in Chinese upon Chinese paper and enclosed in an ordinary business envelope having a typewritten address and bearing a London postmark Well As nearly as I can render the message in English it reads Although because you are a brave man you would not betray your correspondent in China he has been discovered He was a mandarin and as I cannot write the name of a traitor I may not name him He was executed four days ago I salute you and pray for your speedy recovery Fu Manchu Fu Manchu But it is almost certainly a trap On the contrary Petrie Fu Manchu would not have written in Chinese unless he were sincere and to clear all doubt I received a cable this morning reporting that the Mandarin Yen Sun Yat was assassinated in his own garden in Nan Yang one day last week CHAPTER VIII doctor FU MANCHU STRIKES Together we marched down the slope of the quiet suburban avenue to take pause before a small detached house displaying the hatchet boards of the Estate Agent Here we found unkempt laurel bushes and acacias run riot from which arboreal tangle protruded the notice To be Let or Sold Smith with an alert glance to right and left pushed open the wooden gate and drew me in upon the gravel path Darkness mantled all for the nearest street lamp was fully twenty yards beyond From the miniature jungle bordering the path a soft whistle sounded Is that Carter called Smith sharply A shadowy figure uprose and vaguely I made it out for that of a man in the unobtrusive blue serge which is the undress uniform of the Force Well rapped my companion mister Slattin returned ten minutes ago sir reported the constable He came in a cab which he dismissed He has not left again A few minutes after his return the man continued another cab came up and a lady alighted A lady The same sir that has called upon him before Smith I whispered plucking at his arm is it He half turned nodding his head and my heart began to throb foolishly For now the manner of Slattin s campaign suddenly was revealed to me In our operations against the Chinese murder group two years before we had had an ally in the enemy s camp Karamaneh the beautiful slave whose presence in those happenings of the past had colored the sometimes sordid drama with the opulence of old Arabia who had seemed a fitting figure for the romances of Bagdad during the Caliphate Karamaneh whom I had thought sincere whose inscrutable Eastern soul I had presumed fatuously to have laid bare and analyzed Now once again she was plying her old trade of go between professing to reveal the secrets of doctor Fu Manchu and all the time I could not doubt it inveigling men into the net of this awful fisher Yesterday I had been her dupe yesterday I had rejoiced in my captivity To day I was not the favored one to day I had not been selected recipient of her confidences confidences sweet seductive deadly but Abel Slattin a plausible rogue who in justice should be immured in Sing Sing was chosen out was enslaved by those lovely mysterious eyes was taking to his soul the lies which fell from those perfect lips triumphant in a conquest that must end in his undoing deeming poor fool that for love of him this pearl of the Orient was about to betray her master to resign herself a prize to the victor Companioned by these bitter reflections I had lost the remainder of the conversation between Nayland Smith and the police officer now casting off the succubus memory which threatened to obsess me I put forth a giant mental effort to purge my mind of this uncleanness and became again an active participant in the campaign against the Master the director of all things noxious Our plans being evidently complete Smith seized my arm and I found myself again out upon the avenue He led me across the road and into the gate of a house almost opposite From the fact that two upper windows were illuminated I adduced that the servants were retiring the other windows were in darkness except for one on the ground floor to the extreme left of the building through the lowered venetian blinds whereof streaks of light shone out Slattin s study whispered Smith He does not anticipate surveillance and you will note that the window is wide open With that my friend crossed the strip of lawn and careless of the fact that his silhouette must have been visible to any one passing the gate climbed carefully up the artificial rockery intervening and crouched upon the window ledge peering into the room A moment I hesitated fearful that if I followed I should stumble or dislodge some of the larva blocks of which the rockery was composed Then I heard that which summoned me to the attempt whatever the cost Through the open window came the sound of a musical voice a voice possessing a haunting accent possessing a quality which struck upon my heart and set it quivering as though it were a gong hung in my bosom Karamaneh was speaking Upon hands and knees heedless of damage to my garments I crawled up beside Smith One of the laths was slightly displaced and over this my friend was peering in Crouching close beside him I peered in also I saw the study of a business man with its files neatly arranged works of reference roll top desk and Milner safe Before the desk in a revolving chair sat Slattin He sat half turned toward the window leaning back and smiling so that I could note the gold crown which preserved the lower left molar In an armchair by the window close very close and sitting with her back to me was Karamaneh She who in my dreams I always saw was ever seeing in an Eastern dress with gold bands about her white ankles with jewel laden fingers with jewels in her hair wore now a fashionable costume and a hat that could only have been produced in Paris Karamaneh was the one Oriental woman I had ever known who could wear European clothes and as I watched that exquisite profile I thought that Delilah must have been just such another as this that excepting the Empress Poppaea history has record of no woman who looking so innocent was yet so utterly vile Yes my dear Slattin was saying and through his monocle ogling his beautiful visitor I shall be ready for you to morrow night I felt Smith start at the words There will be a sufficient number of men Karamaneh put the question in a strangely listless way My dear little girl replied Slattin rising and standing looking down at her with his gold tooth twinkling in the lamplight there will be a whole division if a whole division is necessary He sought to take her white gloved hand which rested upon the chair arm but she evaded the attempt with seeming artlessness and stood up Slattin fixed his bold gaze upon her So now give me my orders he said I am not prepared to do so yet replied the girl composedly but now that I know you are ready I can make my plans She glided past him to the door avoiding his outstretched arm with an artless art which made me writhe for once I had been the willing victim of all these wiles But began Slattin I will ring you up in less than half an hour said Karamaneh and without further ceremony she opened the door I still had my eyes glued to the aperture in the blind when Smith began tugging at my arm Down you fool he hissed harshly if she sees us all is lost Realizing this and none too soon I turned and rather clumsily followed my friend I dislodged a piece of granite in my descent but fortunately Slattin had gone out into the hall and could not well have heard it We were crouching around an angle of the house when a flood of light poured down the steps and Karamaneh rapidly descended I had a glimpse of a dark faced man who evidently had opened the door for her then all my thoughts were centered upon that graceful figure receding from me in the direction of the avenue She wore a loose cloak and I saw this fluttering for a moment against the white gate posts then she was gone Yet Smith did not move Detaining me with his hand he crouched there against a quick set hedge until from a spot lower down the hill we heard the start of the cab which had been waiting Twenty seconds elapsed and from some other distant spot a second cab started That s Weymouth snapped Smith With decent luck we should know Fu Manchu s hiding place before Slattin tells us But Oh as it happens he s apparently playing the game In the half light Smith stared at me significantly Which makes it all the more important he concluded that we should not rely upon his aid Those grim words were prophetic My companion made no attempt to communicate with the detective or detectives who shared our vigil we took up a position close under the lighted study window and waited waited Once a taxi cab labored hideously up the steep gradient of the avenue It was gone The lights at the upper windows above us became extinguished A policeman tramped past the gateway casually flashing his lamp in at the opening One by one the illuminated windows in other houses visible to us became dull then lived again as mirrors for the pallid moon In the silence words spoken within the study were clearly audible and we heard someone presumably the man who had opened the door inquire if his services would be wanted again that night Smith inclined his head and hung over me in a tense attitude in order to catch Slattin s reply Yes Burke it came I want you to sit up until I return I shall be going out shortly Evidently the man withdrew at that for a complete silence followed which prevailed for fully half an hour I sought cautiously to move my cramped limbs unlike Smith who seeming to have sinews of piano wire crouched beside me immovable untiringly Then loud upon the stillness broke the strident note of the telephone bell I started nervously clutching at Smith s arm It felt hard as iron to my grip Hullo I heard Slattin call who is speaking Yes yes This is mister A S I am to come at once I know where yes I you will meet me there Good I shall be with you in half an hour Good by Distinctly I heard the creak of the revolving office chair as Slattin rose then Smith had me by the arm and we were flying swiftly away from the door to take up our former post around the angle of the building This gained He s going to his death rapped Smith beside me but Carter has a cab from the Yard waiting in the nearest rank We shall follow to see where he goes for it is possible that Weymouth may have been thrown off the scent then when we are sure of his destination we can take a hand in the game We The end of the sentence was lost to me drowned in such a frightful wave of sound as I despair to describe It began with a high thin scream which was choked off staccato fashion upon it followed a loud and dreadful cry uttered with all the strength of Slattin s lungs Oh God he cried and again Oh God This in turn merged into a sort of hysterical sobbing I was on my feet now and automatically making for the door I had a vague impression of Nayland Smith s face beside me the eyes glassy with a fearful apprehension Then the door was flung open and in the bright light of the hall way I saw Slattin standing swaying and seemingly fighting with the empty air What is it For God s sake what has happened reached my ears dimly and the man Burke showed behind his master White faced I saw him to be for now Smith and I were racing up the steps Ere we could reach him Slattin uttering another choking cry pitched forward and lay half across the threshold We burst into the hall where Burke stood with both his hands raised dazedly to his head I could hear the sound of running feet upon the gravel and knew that Carter was coming to join us Burke a heavy man with a lowering bull dog type of face collapsed onto his knees beside Slattin and began softly to laugh in little rising peals Drop that snapped Smith and grasping him by the shoulders he sent him spinning along the hallway where he sank upon the bottom step of the stairs to sit with his outstretched fingers extended before his face and peering at us grotesquely through the crevices There were rustlings and subdued cries from the upper part of the house Carter came in out of the darkness carefully stepping over the recumbent figure and the three of us stood there in the lighted hall looking down at Slattin Help us to move him back directed Smith tensely far enough to close the door Between us we accomplished this and Carter fastened the door We were alone with the shadow of Fu Manchu s vengeance for as I knelt beside the body on the floor a look and a touch sufficed to tell me that this was but clay from which the spirit had fled Smith met my glance as I raised my head and his teeth came together with a loud snap the jaw muscles stood out prominently beneath the dark skin and his face was grimly set in that odd half despairful expression which I knew so well but which boded so ill for whomsoever occasioned it Dead Petrie already Lightning could have done the work no better Can I turn him over Smith nodded Together we stooped and rolled the heavy body on its back A flood of whispers came sibilantly from the stairway Smith spun around rapidly and glared upon the group of half dressed servants Return to your rooms he rapped imperiously let no one come into the hall without my orders The masterful voice had its usual result there was a hurried retreat to the upper landing Burke shaking like a man with an ague sat on the lower step pathetically drumming his palms upon his uplifted knees I warned him I warned him he mumbled monotonously I warned him oh I warned him Stand up shouted Smith stand up and come here The man with his frightened eyes turning to right and left and seeming to search for something in the shadows about him advanced obediently Have you a flask demanded Smith of Carter The detective silently administered to Burke a stiff restorative Now continued Smith you Petrie will want to examine him I suppose He pointed to the body And in the meantime I have some questions to put to you my man He clapped his hand upon Burke s shoulder My God Burke broke out I was ten yards from him when it happened No one is accusing you said Smith less harshly but since you were the only witness it is by your aid that we hope to clear the matter up Exerting a gigantic effort to regain control of himself Burke nodded watching my friend with a childlike eagerness During the ensuing conversation I examined Slattin for marks of violence and of what I found more anon In the first place said Smith you say that you warned him When did you warn him and of what I warned him sir that it would come to this That what would come to this His dealings with the Chinaman He had dealings with Chinamen He accidentally met a Chinaman at an East End gaming house a man he had known in Frisco a man called Singapore Charlie What Singapore Charlie Yes sir the same man that had a dope shop two years ago down Ratcliffe way There was a fire But Singapore Charlie escaped sir And he is one of the gang He is one of what we used to call in New York the Seven Group Smith began to tug at the lobe of his left ear reflectively as I saw out of the corner of my eye The Seven Group he mused That is significant I always suspected that doctor Fu Manchu and the notorious Seven Group were one and the same Go on Burke Well sir the man continued more calmly the lieutenant The lieutenant began Smith then Oh of course Slattin used to be a police lieutenant Well sir he mister Slattin had a sort of hold on this Singapore Charlie and two years ago when he first met him he thought that with his aid he was going to pull off the biggest thing of his life Forestall me in fact Yes sir but you got in first with the big raid and spoiled it Smith nodded grimly glancing at the Scotland Yard man who returned his nod with equal grimness A couple of months ago resumed Burke he met Charlie again down East and the Chinaman introduced him to a girl some sort of an Egyptian girl Go on snapped Smith I know her He saw her a good many times and she came here once or twice She made out that she and Singapore Charlie were prepared to give away the boss of the Yellow gang For a price of course I suppose so said Burke but I don t know I only know that I warned him H m muttered Smith And now what took place to night He had an appointment here with the girl began Burke I know all that interrupted Smith I merely want to know what took place after the telephone call Well he told me to wait up and I was dozing in the next room to the study the dining room when the phone bell aroused me I heard the lieutenant mister Slattin coming out and I ran out too but only in time to see him taking his hat from the rack But he wears no hat He never got it off the peg Just as he reached up to take it he gave a most frightful scream and turned around like lightning as though some one had attacked him from behind There was no one else in the hall No one at all I was standing down there outside the dining room just by the stairs but he didn t turn in my direction he turned and looked right behind him where there was no one nothing His cries were frightful Burke s voice broke and he shuddered feverishly Then he made a rush for the front door It seemed as though he had not seen me He stood there screaming but before I could reach him he fell Nayland Smith fixed a piercing gaze upon Burke Is that all you know he demanded slowly As God is my judge sir that s all I know and all I saw There was no living thing near him when he met his death We shall see muttered Smith He turned to me What killed him he asked shortly Apparently a minute wound on the left wrist I replied and stooping I raised the already cold hand in mine A tiny inflamed wound showed on the wrist and a certain puffiness was becoming observable in the injured hand and arm Smith bent down and drew a quick sibilant breath You know what this is Petrie he cried Certainly It was too late to employ a ligature and useless to inject ammonia Death was practically instantaneous His heart There came a loud knocking and ringing Carter cried Smith turning to the detective open that door to no one no one Explain who I am But if it is the inspector I said open the door to no one snapped Smith Burke stand exactly where you are Carter you can speak to whoever knocks through the letter box Petrie don t move for your life It may be here in the hallway CHAPTER IX THE CLIMBER Our search of the house of Abel Slattin ceased only with the coming of the dawn and yielded nothing but disappointment Failure followed upon failure for in the gray light of the morning our own quest concluded Inspector Weymouth returned to report that the girl Karamaneh had thrown him off the scent Again he stood before me the big burly friend of old and dreadful days a little grayer above the temples which I set down for a record of former horrors but deliberate stoical thorough as ever His blue eyes melted in the old generous way as he saw me and he gripped my hand in greeting Once again he said your dark eyed friend has been too clever for me Doctor But the track as far as I could follow leads to the old spot In fact he turned to Smith who grim faced and haggard looked thoroughly ill in that gray light I believe Fu Manchu s lair is somewhere near the former opium den of Shen Yan Singapore Charlie Smith nodded We will turn our attention in that direction he replied at a very early date Inspector Weymouth looked down at the body of Abel Slattin How was it done he asked softly Clumsily for Fu Manchu I replied A snake was introduced into the house by some means By Karamaneh rapped Smith Very possibly by Karamaneh I continued firmly The thing has escaped us My own idea said Smith is that it was concealed about his clothing When he fell by the open door it glided out of the house We must have the garden searched thoroughly by daylight He Weymouth glanced at that which lay upon the floor must be moved but otherwise we can leave the place untouched clear out the servants and lock the house up I have already given orders to that effect answered Smith He spoke wearily and with a note of conscious defeat in his voice Nothing has been disturbed he swept his arm around comprehensively papers and so forth you can examine at leisure Presently we quitted that house upon which the fateful Chinaman had set his seal as the suburb was awakening to a new day The clank of milk cans was my final impression of the avenue to which a dreadful minister of death had come at the bidding of the death lord We left Inspector Weymouth in charge and returned to my rooms scarcely exchanging a word upon the way Nayland Smith ignoring my entreaties composed himself for slumber in the white cane chair in my study About noon he retired to the bathroom and returning made a pretense of breakfast then resumed his seat in the cane armchair Carter reported in the afternoon but his report was merely formal Returning from my round of professional visits at half past five I found Nayland Smith in the same position and so the day waned into evening and dusk fell uneventfully In the corner of the big room by the empty fireplace Nayland Smith lay with his long lean frame extended in the white cane chair A tumbler from which two straws protruded stood by his right elbow and a perfect continent of tobacco smoke lay between us wafted toward the door by the draught from an open window He had littered the hearth with matches and tobacco ash being the most untidy smoker I have ever met and save for his frequent rapping out of his pipe bowl and perpetual striking of matches he had shown no sign of activity for the past hour Collarless and wearing an old tweed jacket he had spent the evening as he had spent the day in the cane chair only quitting it for some ten minutes or less to toy with dinner My several attempts at conversation had elicited nothing but growls therefore as dusk descended having dismissed my few patients I busied myself collating my notes upon the renewed activity of the Yellow Doctor and was thus engaged when the phone bell disturbed me It was Smith who was wanted however and he went out eagerly leaving me to my task At the end of a lengthy conversation he returned from the phone and began restlessly to pace the room I made a pretense of continuing my labors but covertly I was watching him He was twitching at the lobe of his left ear and his face was a study in perplexity Abruptly he burst out I shall throw the thing up Petrie Either I am growing too old to cope with such an adversary as Fu Manchu or else my intellect has become dull I cannot seem to think clearly or consistently For the Doctor this crime this removal of Slattin is clumsy unfinished There are two explanations Either he too is losing his old cunning or he has been interrupted Interrupted Take the facts Petrie Smith clapped his hands upon my table and bent down peering into my eyes is it characteristic of Fu Manchu to kill a man by the direct agency of a snake and to implicate one of his own damnable servants in this way But we have found no snake Karamaneh introduced one in some way Do you doubt it Certainly Karamaneh visited him on the evening of his death but you must be perfectly well aware that even if she had been arrested no jury could convict her Smith resumed his restless pacings up and down You are very useful to me Petrie he replied as a counsel for the defense you constantly rectify my errors of prejudice Yet I am convinced that our presence at Slattin s house last night prevented Fu Manchu from finishing off this little matter as he had designed to do What has given you this idea Weymouth is responsible He has rung me up from the Yard The constable on duty at the house where the murder was committed reports that some one less than an hour ago attempted to break in Break in Ah you are interested I thought the circumstance illuminating also Did the officer see this person No he only heard him It was some one who endeavored to enter by the bathroom window which I am told may be reached fairly easily by an agile climber The attempt did not succeed No the constable interrupted but failed to make a capture or even to secure a glimpse of the man We were both silent for some moments then What do you propose to do I asked We must not let Fu Manchu s servants know replied Smith but to night I shall conceal myself in Slattin s house and remain there for a week or a day it matters not how long until that attempt is repeated Quite obviously Petrie we have overlooked something which implicates the murderer with the murder In short either by accident by reason of our superior vigilance or by the clumsiness of his plans Fu Manchu for once in an otherwise blameless career has left a clue CHAPTER X THE CLIMBER RETURNS In utter darkness we groped our way through into the hallway of Slattin s house having entered stealthily from the rear for Smith had selected the study as a suitable base of operations We reached it without mishap and presently I found myself seated in the very chair which Karamaneh had occupied my companion took up a post just within the widely opened door So we commenced our ghostly business in the house of the murdered man a house from which but a few hours since his body had been removed This was such a vigil as I had endured once before when with Nayland Smith and another I had waited for the coming of one of Fu Manchu s death agents Of all the sounds which one by one now began to detach themselves from the silence there was a particular sound homely enough at another time which spoke to me more dreadfully than the rest It was the ticking of the clock upon the mantelpiece and I thought how this sound must have been familiar to Abel Slattin how it must have formed part and parcel of his life as it were and how it went on now tick tick tick tick whilst he for whom it had ticked lay unheeding would never heed it more As I grew more accustomed to the gloom I found myself staring at his office chair once I found myself expecting Abel Slattin to enter the room and occupy it There was a little China Buddha upon the bureau in one corner with a gilded cap upon its head and as some reflection of the moonlight sought out this little cap my thoughts grotesquely turned upon the murdered man s gold tooth Vague creakings from within the house sounds as though of stealthy footsteps upon the stair set my nerves tingling but Nayland Smith gave no sign and I knew that my imagination was magnifying these ordinary night sounds out of all proportion to their actual significance Leaves rustled faintly outside the window at my back I construed their sibilant whispers into the dreaded name Fu Manchu Fu Manchu Fu Manchu So wore on the night and when the ticking clock hollowly boomed the hour of one I almost leaped out of my chair so highly strung were my nerves and so appallingly did the sudden clangor beat upon them Smith like a man of stone showed no sign He was capable of so subduing his constitutionally high strung temperament at times that temporarily he became immune from human dreads On such occasions he would be icily cool amid universal panic but his object accomplished I have seen him in such a state of collapse that utter nervous exhaustion is the only term by which I can describe it Tick tick tick tick went the clock and with my heart still thumping noisily in my breast I began to count the tickings one two three four five and so on to a hundred and from one hundred to many hundreds Then out from the confusion of minor noises a new arresting sound detached itself I ceased my counting no longer I noted the tick tick of the clock nor the vague creakings rustlings and whispers I saw Smith shadowly raise his hand in warning in needless warning for I was almost holding my breath in an effort of acute listening From high up in the house this new sound came from above the topmost room it seemed up under the roof a regular squeaking oddly familiar yet elusive Upon it followed a very soft and muffled thud then a metallic sound as of a rusty hinge in motion then a new silence pregnant with a thousand possibilities more eerie than any clamor My mind was rapidly at work Lighting the topmost landing of the house was a sort of glazed trap evidently set in the floor of a loft like place extending over the entire building Somewhere in the red tiled roof above there presumably existed a corresponding skylight or lantern So I argued and ere I had come to any proper decision another sound more intimate came to interrupt me This time I could be in no doubt some one was lifting the trap above the stairhead slowly cautiously and all but silently Yet to my ears attuned to trifling disturbances the trap creaked and groaned noisily Nayland Smith waved to me to take a stand on the other side of the opened door behind it in fact where I should be concealed from the view of any one descending the stair I stood up and crossed the floor to my new post A dull thud told of the trap fully raised and resting upon some supporting joist A faint rustling of discarded garments I told myself spoke to my newly awakened acute perceptions of the visitor preparing to lower himself to the landing Followed a groan of woodwork submitted to sudden strain and the unmistakable pad of bare feet upon the linoleum of the top corridor I knew now that one of doctor Fu Manchu s uncanny servants had gained the roof of the house by some means had broken through the skylight and had descended by means of the trap beneath on to the landing In such a tensed up state as I cannot describe nor at this hour mentally reconstruct I waited for the creaking of the stairs which should tell of the creature s descent I was disappointed Removed scarce a yard from me as he was I could hear Nayland Smith s soft staccato breathing but my eyes were all for the darkened hallway for the smudgy outline of the stair rail with the faint patterning in the background which alone indicated the wall It was amid an utter silence unheralded by even so slight a sound as those which I had acquired the power of detecting that I saw the continuity of the smudgy line of stair rail to be interrupted A dark patch showed upon it just within my line of sight invisible to Smith on the other side of the doorway and some ten or twelve stairs up No sound reached me but the dark patch vanished and reappeared three feet lower down Still I knew that this phantom approach must be unknown to my companion and I knew that it was impossible for me to advise him of it unseen by the dreaded visitor A third time the dark patch the hand of one who ghostly silent was creeping down into the hallway vanished and reappeared on a level with my eyes Then a vague shape became visible no more than a blur upon the dim design of the wall paper and Nayland Smith got his first sight of the stranger The clock on the mantelpiece boomed out the half hour At that such was my state I blush to relate it I uttered a faint cry It ended all secrecy that hysterical weakness of mine It might have frustrated our hopes that it did not do so was in no measure due to me But in a sort of passionate whirl the ensuing events moved swiftly Smith hesitated not one instant With a panther like leap he hurled himself into the hall The lights Petrie he cried the lights The switch is near the street door I clenched my fists in a swift effort to regain control of my treacherous nerves and bounding past Smith and past the foot of the stair I reached out my hand to the switch the situation of which fortunately I knew Around I came in response to a shrill cry from behind me an inhuman cry less a cry than the shriek of some enraged animal With his left foot upon the first stair Nayland Smith stood his lean body bent perilously backward his arms rigidly thrust out and his sinewy fingers gripping the throat of an almost naked man a man whose brown body glistened unctuously whose shaven head was apish low whose bloodshot eyes were the eyes of a mad dog His teeth upper and lower were bared they glistened they gnashed and a froth was on his lips With both his hands he clutched a heavy stick and once twice he brought it down upon Nayland Smith s head I leaped forward to my friend s aid but as though the blows had been those of a feather he stood like some figure of archaic statuary nor for an instant relaxed the death grip which he had upon his adversary s throat Thrusting my way up the stairs I wrenched the stick from the hand of the dacoit for in this glistening brown man I recognized one of that deadly brotherhood who hailed doctor Fu Manchu their Lord and Master I cannot dwell upon the end of that encounter I cannot hope to make acceptable to my readers an account of how Nayland Smith glassy eyed and with consciousness ebbing from him instant by instant stood there a realization of Leighton s Athlete his arms rigid as iron bars even after Fu Manchu s servant hung limply in that frightful grip In his last moments of consciousness with the blood from his wounded head trickling down into his eyes he pointed to the stick which I had torn from the grip of the dacoit and which I still held in my hand Not Aaron s rod Petrie he gasped hoarsely the rod of Moses Slattin s stick Even in upon my anxiety for my friend amazement intruded But I began and turned to the rack in which Slattin s favorite cane at that moment reposed had reposed at the time of his death Yes there stood Slattin s cane we had not moved it we had disturbed nothing in that stricken house there it stood in company with an umbrella and a malacca I glanced at the cane in my hand Surely there could not be two such in the world Smith collapsed on the floor at my feet Examine the one in the rack Petrie he whispered almost inaudibly but do not touch it It may not be yet I propped him up against the foot of the stairs and as the constable began knocking violently at the street door crossed to the rack and lifted out the replica of the cane which I held in my hand A faint cry from Smith and as if it had been a leprous thing I dropped the cane instantly Merciful God I groaned Although in every other particular it corresponded with that which I held which I had taken from the dacoit which he had come to substitute for the cane now lying upon the floor in one dreadful particular it differed Up to the snake s head it was an accurate copy but the head lived Either from pain fear or starvation the thing confined in the hollow tube of this awful duplicate was become torpid Otherwise no power on earth could have saved me from the fate of Abel Slattin for the creature was an Australian death adder CHAPTER XI THE WHITE PEACOCK Nayland Smith wasted no time in pursuing the plan of campaign which he had mentioned to Inspector Weymouth Less than forty eight hours after quitting the house of the murdered Slattin I found myself bound along Whitechapel Road upon strange enough business A very fine rain was falling which rendered it difficult to see clearly from the windows but the weather apparently had little effect upon the commercial activities of the district The cab was threading a hazardous way through the cosmopolitan throng crowding the street On either side of me extended a row of stalls seemingly established in opposition to the more legitimate shops upon the inner side of the pavement Jewish hawkers many of them in their shirt sleeves acclaimed the rarity of the bargains which they had to offer and allowing for the difference of costume these tireless Israelites heedless of climatic conditions sweating at their mongery might well have stood not in a squalid London thoroughfare but in an equally squalid market street of the Orient They offered linen and fine raiment from footgear to hair oil their wares ranged They enlivened their auctioneering with conjuring tricks and witty stories selling watches by the aid of legerdemain and fancy vests by grace of a seasonable anecdote Poles Russians Serbs Roumanians Jews of Hungary and Italians of Whitechapel mingled in the throng Near East and Far East rubbed shoulders Pidgin English contested with Yiddish for the ownership of some tawdry article offered by an auctioneer whose nationality defied conjecture save that always some branch of his ancestry had drawn nourishment from the soil of Eternal Judea Some wearing mens caps some with shawls thrown over their oily locks and some more true to primitive instincts defying bare headed the unkindly elements bedraggled women more often than not burdened with muffled infants crowded the pavements and the roadway thronged about the stalls like white ants about some choicer carrion And the fine drizzling rain fell upon all alike pattering upon the hood of the taxi cab trickling down the front windows glistening upon the unctuous hair of those in the street who were hatless dewing the bare arms of the auctioneers and dripping melancholy from the tarpaulin coverings of the stalls Heedless of the rain above and of the mud beneath North South East and West mingled their cries their bids their blandishments their raillery mingled their persons in that joyless throng Sometimes a yellow face showed close to one of the streaming windows sometimes a black eyed pallid face but never a face wholly sane and healthy This was an underworld where squalor and vice went hand in hand through the beautiless streets a melting pot of the world s outcasts this was the shadowland which last night had swallowed up Nayland Smith Ceaselessly I peered to right and left searching amid that rain soaked company for any face known to me Whom I expected to find there I know not but I should have counted it no matter for surprise had I detected amid that ungracious ugliness the beautiful face of Karamaneh the Eastern slave girl the leering yellow face of a Burmese dacoit the gaunt bronzed features of Nayland Smith a hundred times I almost believed that I had seen the ruddy countenance of Inspector Weymouth and once at which instant my heart seemed to stand still I suffered from the singular delusion that the oblique green eyes of doctor Fu Manchu peered out from the shadows between two stalls It was mere phantasy of course the sick imaginings of a mind overwrought I had not slept and had scarcely tasted food for more than thirty hours for following up a faint clue supplied by Burke Slattin s man and like his master an ex officer of New York Police my friend Nayland Smith on the previous evening had set out in quest of some obscene den where the man called Shen Yan former keeper of an opium shop was now said to be in hiding Shen Yan we knew to be a creature of the Chinese doctor and only a most urgent call had prevented me from joining Smith upon this promising though hazardous expedition At any rate Fate willing it so he had gone without me and now although Inspector Weymouth assisted by a number of C I D men was sweeping the district about me to the time of my departure nothing whatever had been heard of Smith The ordeal of waiting finally had proved too great to be borne With no definite idea of what I proposed to do I had thrown myself into the search filled with such dreadful apprehensions as I hope never again to experience I did not know the exact situation of the place to which Smith was gone for owing to the urgent case which I have mentioned I had been absent at the time of his departure nor could Scotland Yard enlighten me upon this point Weymouth was in charge of the case under Smith s direction and since the inspector had left the Yard early that morning he had disappeared as completely as Smith no report having been received from him As my driver turned into the black mouth of a narrow ill lighted street and the glare and clamor of the greater thoroughfare died behind me I sank into the corner of the cab burdened with such a sense of desolation as mercifully comes but rarely We were heading now for that strange settlement off the West India Dock Road which bounded by Limehouse Causeway and Pennyfields and narrowly confined within four streets composes an unique Chinatown a miniature of that at Liverpool and of the greater one in San Francisco Inspired with an idea which promised hopefully I raised the speaking tube Take me first to the River Police Station I directed along Ratcliffe Highway The man turned and nodded comprehendingly as I could see through the wet pane Presently we swerved to the right and into an even narrower street This inclined in an easterly direction and proved to communicate with a wide thoroughfare along which passed brilliantly lighted electric trams I had lost all sense of direction and when swinging to the left and to the right again I looked through the window and perceived that we were before the door of the Police Station I was dully surprised In quite mechanical fashion I entered the depot Inspector Ryman our associate in one of the darkest episodes of the campaign with the Yellow Doctor two years before received me in his office By a negative shake of the head he answered my unspoken question The ten o clock boat is lying off the Stone Stairs Doctor he said and company operating with some of the Scotland Yard men who are dragging that district I shuddered at the word dragging Ryman had not used it literally but nevertheless it had conjured up a dread possibility a possibility in accordance with the methods of doctor Fu Manchu All within space of an instant I saw the tide of Limehouse Reach the Thames lapping about the green coated timbers of a dock pier and rising falling sometimes disclosing to the pallid light a rigid hand sometimes a horribly bloated face I saw the body of Nayland Smith at the mercy of those oily waters Ryman continued There is a launch out too patrolling the riverside from here to Tilbury Another lies at the breakwater he jerked his thumb over his shoulder Should you care to take a run down and see for yourself No thanks I replied shaking my head You are doing all that can be done Can you give me the address of the place to which mister Smith went last night Certainly said Ryman I thought you knew it You remember Shen Yan s place by Limehouse Basin Well further east east of the Causeway between Gill Street and Three Colt Street is a block of wooden buildings You recall them Yes I replied Is the man established there again then It appears so but although you have evidently not been informed of the fact Weymouth raided the establishment in the early hours of this morning Well I cried Unfortunately with no result continued the inspector The notorious Shen Yan was missing and although there is no real doubt that the place is used as a gaming house not a particle of evidence to that effect could be obtained Also there was no sign of mister Nayland Smith and no sign of the American Burke who had led him to the place Is it certain that they went there Two C I D men who were shadowing actually saw the pair of them enter A signal had been arranged but it was never given and at about half past four the place was raided Surely some arrests were made But there was no evidence cried Ryman Every inch of the rat burrow was searched The Chinese gentleman who posed as the proprietor of what he claimed to be a respectable lodging house offered every facility to the police What could we do I take it that the place is being watched Certainly said Ryman Both from the river and from the shore Oh they are not there God knows where they are but they are not there I stood for a moment in silence endeavoring to determine my course then telling Ryman that I hoped to see him later I walked out slowly into the rain and mist and nodding to the taxi driver to proceed to our original destination I re entered the cab As we moved off the lights of the River Police depot were swallowed up in the humid murk and again I found myself being carried through the darkness of those narrow streets which like a maze hold secret within their labyrinth mysteries as great and at least as foul as that of Pasiphae The marketing centers I had left far behind me to my right stretched the broken range of riverside buildings and beyond them flowed the Thames a stream more heavily burdened with secrets than ever was Tiber or Tigris On my left occasional flickering lights broke through the mist for the most part the lights of taverns and saving these rents in the veil the darkness was punctuated with nothing but the faint and yellow luminance of the street lamps Ahead was a black mouth which promised to swallow me up as it had swallowed up my friend In short what with my lowered condition and consequent frame of mind and what with the traditions for me inseparable from that gloomy quarter of London I was in the grip of a shadowy menace which at any moment might become tangible I perceived in the most commonplace objects the yellow hand of doctor Fu Manchu When the cab stopped in a place of utter darkness I aroused myself with an effort opened the door and stepped out into the mud of a narrow lane A high brick wall frowned upon me from one side and dimly perceptible there towered a smoke stack beyond On my right uprose the side of a wharf building shadowly and some distance ahead almost obscured by the drizzling rain a solitary lamp flickered I turned up the collar of my raincoat shivering as much at the prospect as from physical chill You will wait here I said to the man and feeling in my breast pocket I added If you hear the note of a whistle drive on and rejoin me He listened attentively and with a certain eagerness I had selected him that night for the reason that he had driven Smith and myself on previous occasions and had proved himself a man of intelligence Transferring a Browning pistol from my hip pocket to that of my raincoat I trudged on into the mist The headlights of the taxi were swallowed up behind me and just abreast of the street lamp I stood listening Save for the dismal sound of rain and the trickling of water along the gutters all about me was silent Sometimes this silence would be broken by the distant muffled note of a steam siren and always forming a sort of background to the near stillness was the remote din of riverside activity I walked on to the corner just beyond the lamp This was the street in which the wooden buildings were situated I had expected to detect some evidences of surveillances but if any were indeed being observed the fact was effectively masked Not a living creature was visible peer as I could Plans I had none and perceiving that the street was empty and that no lights showed in any of the windows I passed on only to find that I had entered a cul de sac A rickety gate gave access to a descending flight of stone steps the bottom invisible in the denser shadows of an archway beyond which I doubted not lay the river Still uninspired by any definite design I tried the gate and found that it was unlocked Like some wandering soul as it has since seemed to me I descended There was a lamp over the archway but the glass was broken and the rain apparently had extinguished the light as I passed under it I could hear the gas whistling from the burner Continuing my way I found myself upon a narrow wharf with the Thames flowing gloomily beneath me A sort of fog hung over the river shutting me in Then came an incident Suddenly quite near there arose a weird and mournful cry a cry indescribable and inexpressibly uncanny I started back so violently that how I escaped falling into the river I do not know to this day That cry so eerie and so wholly unexpected had unnerved me and realizing the nature of my surroundings and the folly of my presence alone in such a place I began to edge back toward the foot of the steps away from the thing that cried when a great white shape uprose like a phantom before me There are few men I suppose whose lives have been crowded with so many eerie happenings as mine but this phantom thing which grew out of the darkness which seemed about to envelope me takes rank in my memory amongst the most fearsome apparitions which I have witnessed I knew that I was frozen with a sort of supernatural terror I stood there with hands clenched staring staring at that white shape which seemed to float As I stared every nerve in my body thrilling I distinguished the outline of the phantom With a subdued cry I stepped forward A new sensation claimed me In that one stride I passed from the horrible to the bizarre I found myself confronted with something tangible certainly but something whose presence in that place was utterly extravagant could only be reconcilable in the dreams of an opium slave Was I awake was I sane Awake and sane beyond doubt but surely moving not in the purlieus of Limehouse but in the fantastic realms of fairyland Swooping with open arms I rounded up in an angle against the building and gathered in this screaming thing which had inspired in me so keen a terror The great ghostly fan was closed as I did so and I stumbled back toward the stair with my struggling captive tucked under my arm I mounted into one of London s darkest slums carrying a beautiful white peacock CHAPTER XII DARK EYES LOOKED INTO MINE My adventure had done nothing to relieve the feeling of unreality which held me enthralled Grasping the struggling bird firmly by the body and having the long white tail fluttering a yard or so behind me I returned to where the taxi waited Open the door I said to the man who greeted me with such a stare of amazement that I laughed outright though my mirth was but hollow He jumped into the road and did as I directed Making sure that both windows were closed I thrust the peacock into the cab and shut the door upon it For God s sake sir began the driver It has probably escaped from some collector s place on the riverside I explained but one never knows See that it does not escape again and if at the end of an hour as arranged you do not hear from me take it back with you to the River Police Station Right you are sir said the man remounting his seat It s the first time I ever saw a peacock in Limehouse It was the first time I had seen one and the incident struck me as being more than odd it gave me an idea and a new faint hope I returned to the head of the steps at the foot of which I had met with this singular experience and gazed up at the dark building beneath which they led Three windows were visible but they were broken and neglected One immediately above the arch had been pasted up with brown paper and this was now peeling off in the rain a little stream of which trickled down from the detached corner to drop drearily upon the stone stairs beneath Where were the detectives I could only assume that they had directed their attention elsewhere for had the place not been utterly deserted surely I had been challenged In pursuit of my new idea I again descended the steps The persuasion shortly to be verified that I was close upon the secret hold of the Chinaman grew stronger unaccountably I had descended some eight steps and was at the darkest part of the archway or tunnel when confirmation of my theories came to me A noose settled accurately upon my shoulders was snatched tightly about my throat and with a feeling of insupportable agony at the base of my skull and a sudden supreme knowledge that I was being strangled hanged I lost consciousness How long I remained unconscious I was unable to determine at the time but I learned later that it was for no more than half an hour at any rate recovery was slow The first sensation to return to me was a sort of repetition of the asphyxia The blood seemed to be forcing itself into my eyes I choked I felt that my end was come And raising my hands to my throat I found it to be swollen and inflamed Then the floor upon which I lay seemed to be rocking like the deck of a ship and I glided back again into a place of darkness and forgetfulness My second awakening was heralded by a returning sense of smell for I became conscious of a faint exquisite perfume It brought me to my senses as nothing else could have done and I sat upright with a hoarse cry I could have distinguished that perfume amid a thousand others could have marked it apart from the rest in a scent bazaar For me it had one meaning and one meaning only Karamaneh She was near to me or had been near to me And in the first moments of my awakening I groped about in the darkness blindly seeking her Then my swollen throat and throbbing head together with my utter inability to move my neck even slightly reminded me of the facts as they were I knew in that bitter moment that Karamaneh was no longer my friend but for all her beauty and charm was the most heartless the most fiendish creature in the service of doctor Fu Manchu I groaned aloud in my despair and misery Something stirred near to me in the room and set my nerves creeping with a new apprehension I became fully alive to the possibilities of the darkness To my certain knowledge doctor Fu Manchu at this time had been in England for fully three months which meant that by now he must be equipped with all the instruments of destruction animate and inanimate which dread experience had taught me to associate with him Now as I crouched there in that dark apartment listening for a repetition of the sound I scarcely dared to conjecture what might have occasioned it but my imagination peopled the place with reptiles which writhed upon the floor with tarantulas and other deadly insects which crept upon the walls which might drop upon me from the ceiling at any moment Then since nothing stirred about me I ventured to move turning my shoulders for I was unable to move my aching head and I looked in the direction from which a faint very faint light proceeded A regular tapping sound now began to attract my attention and having turned about I perceived that behind me was a broken window in places patched with brown paper the corner of one sheet of paper was detached and the rain trickled down upon it with a rhythmical sound In a flash I realized that I lay in the room immediately above the archway and listening intently I perceived above the other faint sounds of the night or thought that I perceived the hissing of the gas from the extinguished lamp burner Unsteadily I rose to my feet but found myself swaying like a drunken man I reached out for support stumbling in the direction of the wall My foot came in contact with something that lay there and I pitched forward and fell I anticipated a crash which would put an end to my hopes of escape but my fall was comparatively noiseless for I fell upon the body of a man who lay bound up with rope close against the wall A moment I stayed as I fell the chest of my fellow captive rising and falling beneath me as he breathed Knowing that my life depended upon retaining a firm hold upon myself I succeeded in overcoming the dizziness and nausea which threatened to drown my senses and moving back so that I knelt upon the floor I fumbled in my pocket for the electric lamp which I had placed there My raincoat had been removed whilst I was unconscious and with it my pistol but the lamp was untouched I took it out pressed the button and directed the ray upon the face of the man beside me It was Nayland Smith Trussed up and fastened to a ring in the wall he lay having a cork gag strapped so tightly between his teeth that I wondered how he had escaped suffocation But although a grayish pallor showed through the tan of his skin his eyes were feverishly bright and there as I knelt beside him I thanked heaven silently but fervently Then in furious haste I set to work to remove the gag It was most ingeniously secured by means of leather straps buckled at the back of his head but I unfastened these without much difficulty and he spat out the gag uttering an exclamation of disgust Thank God old man he said huskily Thank God that you are alive I saw them drag you in and I thought I have been thinking the same about you for more than twenty four hours I said reproachfully Why did you start without I did not want you to come Petrie he replied I had a sort of premonition You see it was realized and instead of being as helpless as I Fate has made you the instrument of my release Quick You have a knife Good The old feverish energy was by no means extinguished in him Cut the ropes about my wrists and ankles but don t otherwise disturb them I set to work eagerly Now Smith continued put that filthy gag in place again but you need not strap it so tightly Directly they find that you are alive they will treat you the same you understand She has been here three times Karamaneh Ssh I heard a sound like the opening of a distant door Quick the straps of the gag whispered Smith and pretend to recover consciousness just as they enter Clumsily I followed his directions for my fingers were none too steady replaced the lamp in my pocket and threw myself upon the floor Through half shut eyes I saw the door open and obtained a glimpse of a desolate empty passage beyond On the threshold stood Karamaneh She held in her hand a common tin oil lamp which smoked and flickered with every movement filling the already none too cleanly air with an odor of burning paraffin She personified the outre nothing so incongruous as her presence in that place could well be imagined She was dressed as I remembered once to have seen her two years before in the gauzy silks of the harem There were pearls glittering like great tears amid the cloud of her wonderful hair She wore broad gold bangles upon her bare arms and her fingers were laden with jewelry A heavy girdle swung from her hips defining the lines of her slim shape and about one white ankle was a gold band As she appeared in the doorway I almost entirely closed my eyes but my gaze rested fascinatedly upon the little red slippers which she wore Again I detected the exquisite elusive perfume which like a breath of musk spoke of the Orient and as always it played havoc with my reason seeming to intoxicate me as though it were the very essence of her loveliness But I had a part to play and throwing out one clenched hand so that my fist struck upon the floor I uttered a loud groan and made as if to rise upon my knees One quick glimpse I had of her wonderful eyes widely opened and turned upon me with such an enigmatical expression as set my heart leaping wildly then stepping back Karamaneh placed the lamp upon the boards of the passage and clapped her hands As I sank upon the floor in assumed exhaustion a Chinaman with a perfectly impassive face and a Burman whose pock marked evil countenance was set in an apparently habitual leer came running into the room past the girl With a hand which trembled violently she held the lamp whilst the two yellow ruffians tied me I groaned and struggled feebly fixing my gaze upon the lamp bearer in a silent reproach which was by no means without its effect She lowered her eyes and I could see her biting her lip whilst the color gradually faded from her cheeks Then glancing up again quickly and still meeting that reproachful stare she turned her head aside altogether and rested one hand upon the wall swaying slightly as she did so It was a singular ordeal for more than one of that incongruous group but in order that I may not be charged with hypocrisy or with seeking to hide my own folly I confess here that when again I found myself in darkness my heart was leaping not because of the success of my strategy but because of the success of that reproachful glance which I had directed toward the lovely dark eyed Karamaneh toward the faithless evil Karamaneh So much for myself The door had not been closed ten seconds ere Smith again was spitting out the gag swearing under his breath and stretching his cramped limbs free from their binding Within a minute from the time of my trussing I was a free man again save that look where I would to right to left or inward to my own conscience two dark eyes met mine enigmatically What now I whispered Let me think replied Smith A false move would destroy us How long have you been here Since last night Is Fu Manchu Fu Manchu is here replied Smith grimly and not only Fu Manchu but another Another A higher than Fu Manchu apparently I have an idea of the identity of this person but no more than an idea Something unusual is going on Petrie otherwise I should have been a dead man twenty four hours ago Something even more important than my death engages Fu Manchu s attention and this can only be the presence of the mysterious visitor Your seductive friend Karamaneh is arrayed in her very becoming national costume in his honor I presume He stopped abruptly then added I would give five hundred pounds for a glimpse of that visitor s face Is Burke God knows what has become of Burke Petrie We were both caught napping in the establishment of the amiable Shen Yan where amid a very mixed company of poker players we were losing our money like gentlemen But Weymouth Burke and I had both been neatly sand bagged my dear Petrie and removed elsewhere some hours before Weymouth raided the gaming house Oh I don t know how they smuggled us away with the police watching the place but my presence here is sufficient evidence of the fact Are you armed No my pistol was in my raincoat which is missing In the dim light from the broken window I could see Smith tugging reflectively at the lobe of his left ear I am without arms too he mused We might escape from the window It s a long drop Ah I imagined so If only I had a pistol or a revolver What should you do I should present myself before the important meeting which I am assured is being held somewhere in this building and to night would see the end of my struggle with the Fu Manchu group the end of the whole Yellow menace For not only is Fu Manchu here Petrie with all his gang of assassins but he whom I believe to be the real head of the group a certain mandarin is here also CHAPTER XIII THE SACRED ORDER Smith stepped quietly across the room and tried the door It proved to be unlocked and an instant later we were both outside in the passage Coincident with our arrival there arose a sudden outcry from some place at the westward end A high pitched grating voice in which guttural notes alternated with a serpent like hissing was raised in anger doctor Fu Manchu whispered Smith grasping my arm Indeed it was the unmistakable voice of the Chinaman raised hysterically in one of those outbursts which in the past I had diagnosed as symptomatic of dangerous mania The voice rose to a scream the scream of some angry animal rather than anything human Then chokingly it ceased Another short sharp cry followed but not in the voice of Fu Manchu a dull groan and the sound of a fall With Smith still grasping my wrist I shrank back into the doorway as something that looked in the darkness like a great ball of fluff came rapidly along the passage toward me Just at my feet the thing stopped and I made it out for a small animal The tiny gleaming eyes looked up at me and chattering wickedly the creature bounded past and was lost from view It was doctor Fu Manchu s marmoset Smith dragged me back into the room which we had just left As he partly reclosed the door I heard the clapping of hands In a condition of most dreadful suspense we waited until a new ominous sound proclaimed itself Some heavy body was being dragged into the passage I heard the opening of a trap Exclamations in guttural voices told of a heavy task in progress there was a great straining and creaking whereupon the trap was softly reclosed Smith bent to my ear Fu Manchu has chastised one of his servants he whispered There will be food for the grappling irons to night I shuddered violently for without Smith s words I knew that a bloody deed had been done in that house within a few yards of where we stood In the new silence I could hear the drip drip drip of the rain outside the window then a steam siren hooted dismally upon the river and I thought how the screw of that very vessel even as we listened might be tearing the body of Fu Manchu s servant Have you some one waiting whispered Smith eagerly How long was I insensible About half an hour Then the cabman will be waiting Have you a whistle with you I felt in my coat pocket Yes I reported Good Then we will take a chance Again we slipped out into the passage and began a stealthy progress to the west Ten paces amid absolute darkness and we found ourselves abreast of a branch corridor At the further end through a kind of little window a dim light shone See if you can find the trap whispered Smith light your lamp I directed the ray of the pocket lamp upon the floor and there at my feet was a square wooden trap As I stooped to examine it I glanced back painfully over my shoulder and saw Nayland Smith tiptoeing away from me along the passage toward the light Inwardly I cursed his folly but the temptation to peep in at that little window proved too strong for me as it had proved too strong for him Fearful that some board would creak beneath my tread I followed and side by side we two crouched looking into a small rectangular room It was a bare and cheerless apartment with unpapered walls and carpetless floor A table and a chair constituted the sole furniture Seated in the chair with his back toward us was a portly Chinaman who wore a yellow silken robe His face it was impossible to see but he was beating his fist upon the table and pouring out a torrent of words in a thin piping voice So much I perceived at a glance then into view at the distant end of the room paced a tall high shouldered figure a figure unforgettable at once imposing and dreadful stately and sinister With the long bony hands behind him fingers twining and intertwining serpentinely about the handle of a little fan and with the pointed chin resting on the breast of the yellow robe so that the light from the lamp swinging in the center of the ceiling gleamed upon the great dome like brow this tall man paced somberly from left to right He cast a sidelong venomous glance at the voluble speaker out of half shut eyes in the act they seemed to light up as with an internal luminance momentarily they sparkled like emeralds then their brilliance was filmed over as in the eyes of a bird when the membrane is lowered My blood seemed to chill and my heart to double its pulsations beside me Smith was breathing more rapidly than usual I knew now the explanation of the feeling which had claimed me when first I had descended the stone stairs I knew what it was that hung like a miasma over that house It was the aura the glamour which radiated from this wonderful and evil man as light radiates from radium It was the vril the force of doctor Fu Manchu I began to move away from the window But Smith held my wrist as in a vise He was listening raptly to the torrential speech of the Chinaman who sat in the chair and I perceived in his eyes the light of a sudden comprehension As the tall figure of the Chinese doctor came pacing into view again Smith his head below the level of the window pushed me gently along the passage Regaining the site of the trap he whispered to me We owe our lives Petrie to the national childishness of the Chinese A race of ancestor worshipers is capable of anything and doctor Fu Manchu the dreadful being who has rained terror upon Europe stands in imminent peril of disgrace for having lost a decoration What do you mean Smith I mean that this is no time for delay Petrie Here unless I am greatly mistaken lies the rope by means of which you made your entrance It shall be the means of your exit Open the trap Handling the lamp to Smith I stooped and carefully raised the trap door At which moment a singular and dramatic thing happened A softly musical voice the voice of my dreams spoke Not that way O God not that way In my surprise and confusion I all but let the trap fall but I retained sufficient presence of mind to replace it gently Standing upright I turned and there with her little jeweled hand resting upon Smith s arm stood Karamaneh In all my experience of him I had never seen Nayland Smith so utterly perplexed Between anger distrust and dismay he wavered and each passing emotion was written legibly upon the lean bronzed features Rigid with surprise he stared at the beautiful face of the girl She although her hand still rested upon Smith s arm had her dark eyes turned upon me with that same enigmatical expression Her lips were slightly parted and her breast heaved tumultuously This ten seconds of silence in which we three stood looking at one another encompassed the whole gamut of human emotion The silence was broken by Karamaneh They will be coming back that way she whispered bending eagerly toward me How in the most desperate moments I loved to listen to that odd musical accent Please if you would save your life and spare mine trust me She suddenly clasped her hands together and looked up into my face passionately Trust me just for once and I will show you the way Nayland Smith never removed his gaze from her for a moment nor did he stir Oh she whispered tremulously and stamped one little red slipper upon the floor Won t you heed me Come or it will be too late I glanced anxiously at my friend the voice of doctor Fu Manchu now raised in anger was audible above the piping tones of the other Chinaman And as I caught Smith s eye in silent query the trap at my feet began slowly to lift Karamaneh stifled a little sobbing cry but the warning came too late A hideous yellow face with oblique squinting eyes appeared in the aperture I found myself inert useless I could neither think nor act Nayland Smith however as if instinctively delivered a pitiless kick at the head protruding above the trap A sickening crushing sound with a sort of muffled snap spoke of a broken jaw bone and with no word or cry the Chinaman fell As the trap descended with a bang I heard the thud of his body on the stone stairs beneath But we were lost Karamaneh fled along one of the passages lightly as a bird and disappeared as doctor Fu Manchu his top lip drawn up above his teeth in the manner of an angry jackal appeared from the other This way cried Smith in a voice that rose almost to a shriek this way and he led toward the room overhanging the steps Off we dashed with panic swiftness only to find that this retreat also was cut off Dimly visible in the darkness was a group of yellow men and despite the gloom the curved blades of the knives which they carried glittered menacingly The passage was full of dacoits Smith and I turned together The trap was raised again and the Burman who had helped to tie me was just scrambling up beside doctor Fu Manchu who stood there watching us a shadowy sinister figure The game s up Petrie muttered Smith It has been a long fight but Fu Manchu wins Not entirely I cried I whipped the police whistle from my pocket and raised it to my lips but brief as the interval had been the dacoits were upon me A sinewy brown arm shot over my shoulder and the whistle was dashed from my grasp Then came a whirl of maelstrom fighting with Smith and myself ever sinking lower amid a whirlpool as it seemed of blood lustful eyes yellow fangs and gleaming blades I had some vague idea that the rasping voice of Fu Manchu broke once through the turmoil and when with my wrists tied behind me I emerged from the strife to find myself lying beside Smith in the passage I could only assume that the Chinaman had ordered his bloody servants to take us alive for saving numerous bruises and a few superficial cuts I was unwounded The place was utterly deserted again and we two panting captives found ourselves alone with doctor Fu Manchu The scene was unforgettable that dimly lighted passage its extremities masked in shadow and the tall yellow robed figure of the Satanic Chinaman towering over us where we lay He had recovered his habitual calm and as I peered at him through the gloom I was impressed anew with the tremendous intellectual force of the man He had the brow of a genius the features of a born ruler and even in that moment I could find time to search my memory and to discover that the face saving the indescribable evil of its expression was identical with that of Seti the mighty Pharaoh who lies in the Cairo Museum Down the passage came leaping and gamboling the doctor s marmoset Uttering its shrill whistling cry it leaped onto his shoulder clutched with its tiny fingers at the scanty neutral colored hair upon his crown and bent forward peering grotesquely into that still dreadful face doctor Fu Manchu stroked the little creature and crooned to it as a mother to her infant Only this crooning and the labored breathing of Smith and myself broke that impressive stillness Suddenly the guttural voice began You come at an opportune time mister Commissioner Nayland Smith and doctor Petrie at a time when the greatest man in China flatters me with a visit In my absence from home a tremendous honor has been conferred upon me and in the hour of this supreme honor dishonor and calamity have befallen For my services to China the New China the China of the future I have been admitted by the Sublime Prince to the Sacred Order of the White Peacock Warming to his discourse he threw wide his arms hurling the chattering marmoset fully five yards along the corridor O god of Cathay he cried sibilantly in what have I sinned that this catastrophe has been visited upon my head Learn my two dear friends that the sacred white peacock brought to these misty shores for my undying glory has been lost to me Death is the penalty of such a sacrilege death shall be my lot since death I deserve Covertly Smith nudged me with his elbow I knew what the nudge was designed to convey he would remind me of his words anent the childish trifles which sway the life of intellectual China Personally I was amazed That Fu Manchu s anger grief sorrow and resignation were real no one watching him and hearing his voice could doubt He continued By one deed and one deed alone may I win a lighter punishment By one deed and the resignation of all my titles all my lands and all my honors may I merit to be spared to my work which has only begun I knew now that we were lost indeed these were confidences which our graves should hold inviolate He suddenly opened fully those blazing green eyes and directed their baneful glare upon Nayland Smith The Director of the Universe he continued softly has relented toward me To night you die To night the arch enemy of our caste shall be no more This is my offering the price of redemption My mind was working again and actively I managed to grasp the stupendous truth and the stupendous possibility doctor Fu Manchu was in the act of clapping his hands when I spoke Stop I cried He paused and the weird film which sometimes became visible in his eyes now obscured their greenness and lent him the appearance of a blind man doctor Petrie he said softly I shall always listen to you with respect I have an offer to make I continued seeking to steady my voice Give us our freedom and I will restore your shattered honor I will restore the sacred peacock doctor Fu Manchu bent forward until his face was so close to mine that I could see the innumerable lines which an intricate network covered his yellow skin Speak he hissed You lift up my heart from a dark pit I can restore your white peacock I said I and I alone know where it is and I strove not to shrink from the face so close to mine Upright shot the tall figure high above his head Fu Manchu threw his arms and a light of exaltation gleamed in the now widely opened catlike eyes O god he screamed frenziedly O god of the Golden Age like a phoenix I arise from the ashes of myself He turned to me Quick Quick make your bargain End my suspense Smith stared at me like a man dazed but ignoring him I went on You will release me now immediately In another ten minutes it will be too late my friend will remain One of your servants can accompany me and give the signal when I return with the peacock mister Nayland Smith and yourself or another will join me at the corner of the street where the raid took place last night We shall then give you ten minutes grace after which we shall take whatever steps we choose Agreed cried Fu Manchu I ask but one thing from an Englishman your word of honor I give it I also said Smith hoarsely Ten minutes later Nayland Smith and I standing beside the cab whose lights gleamed yellowly through the mist exchanged a struggling frightened bird for our lives capitulated with the enemy of the white race With characteristic audacity and characteristic trust in the British sense of honor doctor Fu Manchu came in person with Nayland Smith in response to the wailing signal of the dacoit who had accompanied me No word was spoken save that the cabman suppressed a curse of amazement and the Chinaman his sinister servant at his elbow bowed low and left us surely to the mocking laughter of the gods CHAPTER XIV THE COUGHING HORROR I leaped up in bed with a great start My sleep was troubled often enough in these days which immediately followed our almost miraculous escape from the den of Fu Manchu and now as I crouched there nerves aquiver listening listening I could not be sure if this dank panic which possessed me had its origin in nightmare or in something else Surely a scream a choking cry for help had reached my ears but now almost holding my breath in that sort of nervous tensity peculiar to one aroused thus I listened and the silence seemed complete Perhaps I had been dreaming Help Petrie Help It was Nayland Smith in the room above me My doubts were dissolved this was no trick of an imagination disordered Some dreadful menace threatened my friend Not delaying even to snatch my dressing gown I rushed out on to the landing up the stairs bare footed as I was threw open the door of Smith s room and literally hurled myself in Those cries had been the cries of one assailed had been uttered I judged in the brief interval of a life and death struggle had been choked off A certain amount of moonlight found access to the room without spreading so far as the bed in which my friend lay But at the moment of my headlong entrance and before I had switched on the light my gaze automatically was directed to the pale moonbeam streaming through the window and down on to one corner of the sheep skin rug beside the bed There came a sound of faint and muffled coughing What with my recent awakening and the panic at my heart I could not claim that my vision was true but across this moonbeam passed a sort of gray streak for all the world as though some long thin shape had been withdrawn snakelike from the room through the open window From somewhere outside the house and below I heard the cough again followed by a sharp cracking sound like the lashing of a whip I depressed the switch flooding the room with light and as I leaped forward to the bed a word picture of what I had seen formed in my mind and I found that I was thinking of a gray feather boa Smith I cried my voice seemed to pitch itself unwilled in a very high key Smith old man He made no reply and a sudden sorrowful fear clutched at my heart strings He was lying half out of bed flat upon his back his head at a dreadful angle with his body As I bent over him and seized him by the shoulders I could see the whites of his eyes His arms hung limply and his fingers touched the carpet My God I whispered what has happened I heaved him back onto the pillow and looked anxiously into his face Habitually gaunt the flesh so refined away by the consuming nervous energy of the man as to reveal the cheekbones in sharp prominence he now looked truly ghastly His skin was so sunbaked as to have changed constitutionally nothing could ever eradicate that tan But to night a fearful grayness was mingled with the brown his lips were purple and there were marks of strangulation upon the lean throat ever darkening weals made by clutching fingers He began to breathe stentoriously and convulsively inhalation being accompanied by a significant gurgling in the throat But now my calm was restored in face of a situation which called for professional attention I aided my friend s labored respirations by the usual means setting to work vigorously so that presently he began to clutch at his inflamed throat which that murderous pressure had threatened to close I could hear sounds of movement about the house showing that not I alone had been awakened by those hoarse screams It s all right old man I said bending over him brace up He opened his eyes they looked bleared and bloodshot and gave me a quick glance of recognition It s all right Smith I said no don t sit up lie there for a moment I ran across to the dressing table whereon I perceived his flask to lie and mixed him a weak stimulant with which I returned to the bed As I bent over him again my housekeeper appeared in the doorway pale and wide eyed There is no occasion for alarm I said over my shoulder mister Smith s nerves are overwrought and he was awakened by some disturbing dream You can return to bed missus Newsome Nayland Smith seemed to experience much difficulty in swallowing the contents of the tumbler which I held to his lips and from the way in which he fingered the swollen glands I could see that his throat which I had vigorously massaged was occasioning him great pain But the danger was past and already that glassy look was disappearing from his eyes nor did they protrude so unnaturally God Petrie he whispered that was a near shave I haven t the strength of a kitten The weakness will pass off I replied there will be no collapse now A little more fresh air I stood up glancing at the windows then back at Smith who forced a wry smile in answer to my look Couldn t be done Petrie he said huskily His words referred to the state of the windows Although the night was oppressively hot these were only opened some four inches at top and bottom Further opening was impossible because of iron brackets screwed firmly into the casements which prevented the windows being raised or lowered further It was a precaution adopted after long experience of the servants of doctor Fu Manchu Now as I stood looking from the half strangled man upon the bed to those screwed up windows the fact came home to my mind that this precaution had proved futile I thought of the thing which I had likened to a feather boa and I looked at the swollen weals made by clutching fingers upon the throat of Nayland Smith The bed stood fully four feet from the nearest window I suppose the question was written in my face for as I turned again to Smith who having struggled upright was still fingering his injured throat ruefully God only knows Petrie he said no human arm could have reached me For us the night was ended so far as sleep was concerned Arrayed in his dressing gown Smith sat in the white cane chair in my study with a glass of brandy and water beside him and despite my official prohibition with the cracked briar which had sent up its incense in many strange and dark places of the East and which yet survived to perfume these prosy rooms in suburban London steaming between his teeth I stood with my elbow resting upon the mantelpiece looking down at him where he sat By God Petrie he said yet again with his fingers straying gently over the surface of his throat that was a narrow shave a damned narrow shave Narrower than perhaps you appreciate old man I replied You were a most unusual shade of blue when I found you I managed said Smith evenly to tear those clutching fingers away for a moment and to give a cry for help It was only for a moment though Petrie they were fingers of steel of steel The bed I began I know that rapped Smith I shouldn t have been sleeping in it had it been within reach of the window but knowing that the doctor avoids noisy methods I had thought myself fairly safe so long as I made it impossible for any one actually to enter the room I have always insisted Smith I cried that there was danger What of poisoned darts What of the damnable reptiles and insects which form part of the armory of Fu Manchu Familiarity breeds contempt I suppose he replied But as it happened none of those agents was employed The very menace that I sought to avoid reached me somehow It would almost seem that doctor Fu Manchu deliberately accepted the challenge of those screwed up windows Hang it all Petrie one cannot sleep in a room hermetically sealed in weather like this It s positively Burmese and although I can stand tropical heat curiously enough the heat of London gets me down almost immediately The humidity that s easily understood But you ll have to put up with it in the future After nightfall our windows must be closed entirely Smith Nayland Smith knocked out his pipe upon the side of the fireplace The bowl sizzled furiously but without delay he stuffed broad cut mixture into the hot pipe dropping a liberal quantity upon the carpet during the process He raised his eyes to me and his face was very grim Petrie he said striking a match on the heel of his slipper the resources of doctor Fu Manchu are by no means exhausted Before we quit this room it is up to us to come to a decision upon a certain point He got his pipe well alight What kind of thing what unnatural distorted creature laid hands upon my throat to night I owe my life primarily to you old man but secondarily to the fact that I was awakened just before the attack by the creature s coughing by its vile high pitched coughing I glanced around at the books upon my shelves Often enough following some outrage by the brilliant Chinese doctor whose genius was directed to the discovery of new and unique death agents we had obtained a clue in those works of a scientific nature which bulk largely in the library of a medical man There are creatures there are drugs which ordinarily innocuous may be so employed as to become inimical to human life and in the distorting of nature in the disturbing of balances and the diverting of beneficent forces into strange and dangerous channels doctor Fu Manchu excelled I had known him to enlarge by artificial culture a minute species of fungus so as to render it a powerful agent capable of attacking man his knowledge of venomous insects has probably never been paralleled in the history of the world whilst in the sphere of pure toxicology he had and has no rival the Borgias were children by comparison But look where I would think how I might no adequate explanation of this latest outrage seemed possible along normal lines There s the clue said Nayland Smith pointing to a little ash tray upon the table near by Follow it if you can But I could not As I have explained continued my friend I was awakened by a sound of coughing then came a death grip on my throat and instinctively my hands shot out in search of my attacker I could not reach him my hands came in contact with nothing palpable Therefore I clutched at the fingers which were dug into my windpipe and found them to be small as the marks show and hairy I managed to give that first cry for help then with all my strength I tried to unfasten the grip that was throttling the life out of me At last I contrived to move one of the hands and I called out again though not so loudly Then both the hands were back again I was weakening but I clawed like a madman at the thin hairy arms of the strangling thing and with a blood red mist dancing before my eyes I seemed to be whirling madly round and round until all became a blank Evidently I used my nails pretty freely and there s the trophy For the twentieth time I should think I carried the ash tray in my hand and laid it immediately under the table lamp in order to examine its contents In the little brass bowl lay a blood stained fragment of grayish hair attached to a tatter of skin This fragment of epidermis had an odd bluish tinge and the attached hair was much darker at the roots than elsewhere Saving its singular color it might have been torn from the forearm of a very hirsute human but although my thoughts wandered unfettered north south east and west although knowing the resources of Fu Manchu I considered all the recognized Mongolian types and in quest of hirsute mankind even roamed far north among the blubbering Esquimo although I glanced at Australasia at Central Africa and passed in mental review the dark places of the Congo nowhere in the known world nowhere in the history of the human species could I come upon a type of man answering to the description suggested by our strange clue Nayland Smith was watching me curiously as I bent over the little brass ash tray You are puzzled he rapped in his short way So am I utterly puzzled Fu Manchu s gallery of monstrosities clearly has become reinforced for even if we identified the type we should not be in sight of our explanation You mean I began Fully four feet from the window Petrie and that window but a few inches open Look he bent forward resting his chest against the table and stretched out his hand toward me You have a rule there just measure Setting down the ash tray I opened out the rule and measured the distance from the further edge of the table to the tips of Smith s fingers Twenty eight inches and I have a long reach snapped Smith withdrawing his arm and striking a match to relight his pipe There s one thing Petrie often proposed before which now we must do without delay The ivy must be stripped from the walls at the back It s a pity but we can not afford to sacrifice our lives to our sense of the aesthetic What do you make of the sound like the cracking of a whip I make nothing of it Smith I replied wearily It might have been a thick branch of ivy breaking beneath the weight of a climber Did it sound like it I must confess that the explanation does not convince me but I have no better one Smith permitting his pipe to go out sat staring straight before him and tugging at the lobe of his left ear The old bewilderment is seizing me I continued At first when I realized that doctor Fu Manchu was back in England when I realized that an elaborate murder machine was set up somewhere in London it seemed unreal fantastical Then I met Karamaneh She whom we thought to be his victim showed herself again to be his slave Now with Weymouth and Scotland Yard at work the old secret evil is established again in our midst unaccountably our lives are menaced sleep is a danger every shadow threatens death oh it is awful Smith remained silent he did not seem to have heard my words I knew these moods and had learnt that it was useless to seek to interrupt them With his brows drawn down and his deep set eyes staring into space he sat there gripping his cold pipe so tightly that my own jaw muscles ached sympathetically No man was better equipped than this gaunt British Commissioner to stand between society and the menace of the Yellow Doctor I respected his meditations for unlike my own they were informed by an intimate knowledge of the dark and secret things of the East of that mysterious East out of which Fu Manchu came of that jungle of noxious things whose miasma had been wafted Westward with the implacable Chinaman I walked quietly from the room occupied with my own bitter reflections CHAPTER XV BEWITCHMENT You say you have two items of news for me said Nayland Smith looking across the breakfast table to where Inspector Weymouth sat sipping coffee There are two points yes replied the Scotland Yard man whilst Smith paused egg spoon in hand and fixed his keen eyes upon the speaker The first is this the headquarters of the Yellow group is no longer in the East End How can you be sure of that For two reasons In the first place that district must now be too hot to hold doctor Fu Manchu in the second place we have just completed a house to house inquiry which has scarcely overlooked a rathole or a rat That place where you say Fu Manchu was visited by some Chinese mandarin where you mister Smith and glancing in my direction you Doctor were confined for a time Yes snapped Smith attacking his egg Well continued the inspector it is all deserted now There is not the slightest doubt that the Chinaman has fled to some other abode I am certain of it My second piece of news will interest you very much I am sure You were taken to the establishment of the Chinaman Shen Yan by a certain ex officer of New York Police Burke Good God cried Smith looking up with a start I thought they had him So did I replied Weymouth grimly but they haven t He got away in the confusion following the raid and has been hiding ever since with a cousin a nurseryman out Upminster way Hiding snapped Smith Exactly hiding He has been afraid to stir ever since and has scarcely shown his nose outside the door He says he is watched night and day Then how He realized that something must be done continued the inspector and made a break this morning He is so convinced of this constant surveillance that he came away secretly hidden under the boxes of a market wagon He landed at Covent Garden in the early hours of this morning and came straight away to the Yard What is he afraid of exactly Inspector Weymouth put down his coffee cup and bent forward slightly He knows something he said in a low voice and they are aware that he knows it And what is this he knows Nayland Smith stared eagerly at the detective Every man has his price replied Weymouth with a smile and Burke seems to think that you are a more likely market than the police authorities I see snapped Smith He wants to see me He wants you to go and see him was the reply I think he anticipates that you may make a capture of the person or persons spying upon him Did he give you any particulars Several He spoke of a sort of gipsy girl with whom he had a short conversation one day over the fence which divides his cousin s flower plantations from the lane adjoining Gipsy girl I whispered glancing rapidly at Smith I think you are right Doctor said Weymouth with his slow smile it was Karamaneh She asked him the way to somewhere or other and got him to write it upon a loose page of his notebook so that she should not forget it You hear that Petrie rapped Smith I hear it I replied but I don t see any special significance in the fact I do rapped Smith I didn t sit up the greater part of last night thrashing my weary brains for nothing But I am going to the British Museum to day to confirm a certain suspicion He turned to Weymouth Did Burke go back he demanded abruptly He returned hidden under the empty boxes was the reply Oh you never saw a man in such a funk in all your life He may have good reasons I said He has good reasons replied Nayland Smith grimly if that man really possesses information inimical to the safety of Fu Manchu he can only escape doom by means of a miracle similar to that which has hitherto protected you and me Burke insists said Weymouth at this point that something comes almost every night after dusk slinking about the house it s an old farmhouse I understand and on two or three occasions he has been awakened fortunately for him he is a light sleeper by sounds of coughing immediately outside his window He is a man who sleeps with a pistol under his pillow and more than once on running to the window he has had a vague glimpse of some creature leaping down from the tiles of the roof which slopes up to his room into the flower beds below Creature said Smith his gray eyes ablaze now you said creature I used the word deliberately replied Weymouth because Burke seems to have the idea that it goes on all fours There was a short and rather strained silence Then In descending a sloping roof I suggested a human being would probably employ his hands as well as his feet Quite so agreed the inspector I am merely reporting the impression of Burke Has he heard no other sound rapped Smith one like the cracking of dry branches for instance He made no mention of it replied Weymouth staring And what is the plan One of his cousin s vans said Weymouth with his slight smile has remained behind at Covent Garden and will return late this afternoon I propose that you and I mister Smith imitate Burke and ride down to Upminster under the empty boxes Nayland Smith stood up leaving his breakfast half finished and began to wander up and down the room reflectively tugging at his ear Then he began to fumble in the pockets of his dressing gown and finally produced the inevitable pipe dilapidated pouch and box of safety matches He began to load the much charred agent of reflection Do I understand that Burke is actually too afraid to go out openly even in daylight he asked suddenly He has not hitherto left his cousin s plantations at all replied Weymouth He seems to think that openly to communicate with the authorities or with you would be to seal his death warrant He s right snapped Smith Therefore he came and returned secretly continued the inspector and if we are to do any good obviously we must adopt similar precautions The market wagon loaded in such a way as to leave ample space in the interior for us will be drawn up outside the office of Messrs Pike and Pike in Covent Garden until about five o clock this afternoon At say half past four I propose that we meet there and embark upon the journey The speaker glanced in my direction interrogatively Include me in the program I said Will there be room in the wagon Certainly was the reply it is most commodious but I cannot guarantee its comfort Nayland Smith promenaded the room unceasingly and presently he walked out altogether only to return ere the inspector and I had had time to exchange more than a glance of surprise carrying a brass ash tray He placed this on a corner of the breakfast table before Weymouth Ever seen anything like that he inquired The inspector examined the gruesome relic with obvious curiosity turning it over with the tip of his little finger and manifesting considerable repugnance in touching it at all Smith and I watched him in silence and finally placing the tray again upon the table he looked up in a puzzled way It s something like the skin of a water rat he said Nayland Smith stared at him fixedly A water rat Now that you come to mention it I perceive a certain resemblance yes But he had been wearing a silk scarf about his throat and now he unwrapped it did you ever see a water rat that could make marks like these Weymouth started to his feet with some muttered exclamation What is this he cried When did it happen and how In his own terse fashion Nayland Smith related the happenings of the night At the conclusion of the story By heaven whispered Weymouth the thing on the roof the coughing thing that goes on all fours seen by Burke My own idea exactly cried Smith Fu Manchu I said excitedly has brought some new some dreadful creature from Burma No Petrie snapped Smith turning upon me suddenly Not from Burma from Abyssinia That day was destined to be an eventful one a day never to be forgotten by any of us concerned in those happenings which I have to record Early in the morning Nayland Smith set off for the British Museum to pursue his mysterious investigations and having performed my brief professional round for as Nayland Smith had remarked on one occasion this was a beastly healthy district I found having made the necessary arrangements that with over three hours to spare I had nothing to occupy my time until the appointment in Covent Garden Market My lonely lunch completed a restless fit seized me and I felt unable to remain longer in the house Inspired by this restlessness I attired myself for the adventure of the evening not neglecting to place a pistol in my pocket and walking to the neighboring Tube station I booked to Charing Cross and presently found myself rambling aimlessly along the crowded streets Led on by what link of memory I know not I presently drifted into New Oxford Street and looked up with a start to learn that I stood before the shop of a second hand book seller where once two years before I had met Karamaneh The thoughts conjured up at that moment were almost too bitter to be borne and without so much as glancing at the books displayed for sale I crossed the roadway entered Museum Street and rather in order to distract my mind than because I contemplated any purchase began to examine the Oriental Pottery Egyptian statuettes Indian armor and other curios displayed in the window of an antique dealer But strive as I would to concentrate my mind upon the objects in the window my memories persistently haunted me and haunted me to the exclusion even of the actualities The crowds thronging the Pavement the traffic in New Oxford Street swept past unheeded my eyes saw nothing of pot nor statuette but only met in a misty imaginative world the glance of two other eyes the dark and beautiful eyes of Karamaneh In the exquisite tinting of a Chinese vase dimly perceptible in the background of the shop I perceived only the blushing cheeks of Karamaneh her face rose up a taunting phantom from out of the darkness between a hideous gilded idol and an Indian sandalwood screen I strove to dispel this obsessing thought resolutely fixing my attention upon a tall Etruscan vase in the corner of the window near to the shop door Was I losing my senses indeed A doubt of my own sanity momentarily possessed me For struggle as I would to dispel the illusion there looking out at me over that ancient piece of pottery was the bewitching face of the slave girl Probably I was glaring madly and possibly I attracted the notice of the passers by but of this I cannot be certain for all my attention was centered upon that phantasmal face with the cloudy hair slightly parted red lips and the brilliant dark eyes which looked into mine out of the shadows of the shop It was bewildering it was uncanny for delusion or verity the glamour prevailed I exerted a great mental effort stepped to the door turned the handle and entered the shop with as great a show of composure as I could muster A curtain draped in a little door at the back of one counter swayed slightly with no greater violence than may have been occasioned by the draught But I fixed my eyes upon this swaying curtain almost fiercely as an impassive half caste of some kind who appeared to be a strange cross between a Graeco Hebrew and a Japanese entered and quite unemotionally faced me with a slight bow So wholly unexpected was this apparition that I started back Can I show you anything sir inquired the new arrival with a second slight inclination of the head I looked at him for a moment in silence Then I thought I saw a lady of my acquaintance here a moment ago I said Was I mistaken Quite mistaken sir replied the shopman raising his black eyebrows ever so slightly a mistake possibly due to a reflection in the window Will you take a look around now that you are here Thank you I replied staring him hard in the face at some other time I turned and quitted the shop abruptly Either I was mad or Karamaneh was concealed somewhere therein However realizing my helplessness in the matter I contented myself with making a mental note of the name which appeared above the establishment J Salaman and walked on my mind in a chaotic condition and my heart beating with unusual rapidity CHAPTER XVI THE QUESTING HANDS Within my view from the corner of the room where I sat in deepest shadow 
4234-187735-0001	train-other-500	through the partly opened window it was screwed like our own were rows of glass houses gleaming in the moonlight and beyond them orderly ranks of flower beds extending into a blue haze of distance
4234-187735-0002	train-other-500	By reason of the moon s position no light entered the room but my eyes from long watching were grown familiar with the darkness and I could see Burke quite clearly as he lay in the bed between my post and the window
4234-187735-0003	train-other-500	I seemed to be back again in those days of the troubled past when first Nayland Smith and I had come to grips with the servants of doctor Fu Manchu A more peaceful scene than this flower planted corner of Essex it would be difficult to imagine
4234-187735-0004	train-other-500	but either because of my knowledge that its peace was chimerical or because of that outflung consciousness of danger which actually or in my imagination preceded the coming of the Chinaman s agents
none	none	 to my seeming the silence throbbed electrically and the night was laden with stilly omens Already cramped by my journey in the market cart I found it difficult to remain very long in any one position 
4234-187735-0005	train-other-500	What information had Burke to sell He had refused for some reason to discuss the matter that evening and now enacting the part allotted him by Nayland Smith he feigned sleep consistently
none	none	 although at intervals he would whisper to me his doubts and fears 
4234-187735-0006	train-other-500	All the chances were in our favor to night for whilst I could not doubt that doctor Fu Manchu was set upon the removal of the ex officer of New York police neither could I doubt that our presence in the farm was unknown to the agents of the Chinaman
4234-187735-0007	train-other-500	According to Burke constant attempts had been made to achieve Fu Manchu s purpose and had only been frustrated by his Burke s wakefulness There was every probability that another attempt would be made to night
4234-187735-0008	train-other-500	Any one who has been forced by circumstance to undertake such a vigil as this will be familiar with the marked changes corresponding with phases of the earth s movement which take place in the atmosphere at midnight at two o clock and again at four o clock
4234-187735-0009	train-other-500	During those fours hours falls a period wherein all life is at its lowest ebb and every Physician is aware that there is a greater likelihood of a patient s passing between midnight and four A M than at any other period during the cycle of the hours
4234-187735-0010	train-other-500	To night I became specially aware of this lowering of vitality and now with the night at that darkest phase which precedes the dawn an indescribable dread such as I had known before in my dealings with the Chinaman assailed me
none	none	 when I was least prepared to combat it The stillness was intense Then Here it is whispered Burke from the bed The chill at the very center of my being which but corresponded with the chill of all surrounding nature at that hour became intensified keener at the whispered words I rose stealthily out of my chair and from my nest of shadows watched 
4234-187735-0011	train-other-500	watched intently the bright oblong of the window Without the slightest heralding sound a black silhouette crept up against the pane the silhouette of a small malformed head a dog like head
4234-187735-0012	train-other-500	deep set in square shoulders Malignant eyes peered intently in Higher it arose that wicked head against the window then crouched down on the sill and became less sharply defined as the creature stooped to the opening below
4234-187735-0013	train-other-500	There was a faint sound of sniffing Judging from the stark horror which I experienced myself I doubted now if Burke could sustain the role allotted him In beneath the slightly raised window came a hand
4234-187735-0014	train-other-500	perceptible to me despite the darkness of the room It seemed to project from the black silhouette outside the pane to be thrust forward and forward and forward that small hand with the outstretched fingers
4234-187735-0015	train-other-500	The unknown possesses unique terrors and since I was unable to conceive what manner of thing this could be which extending its incredibly long arms now sought the throat of the man upon the bed
none	none	 I tasted of that sort of terror which ordinarily one knows only in dreams 
4234-187735-0016	train-other-500	Quick sir quick screamed Burke starting up from the pillow The questing hands had reached his throat Choking down an urgent dread that I had of touching the thing which reached through the window to kill the sleeper
none	none	 I sprang across the room and grasped the rigid hairy forearms Heavens Never have I felt such muscles such tendons as those beneath the hirsute skin 
4234-187735-0017	train-other-500	They seemed to be of steel wire and with a sudden frightful sense of impotence
none	none	 I realized that I was as powerless as a child to relax that strangle hold Burke was making the most frightful sounds and quite obviously was being asphyxiated before my eyes Smith I cried Smith Help help for God s sake 
4234-187735-0018	train-other-500	Despite the confusion of my mind I became aware of sounds outside and below me Twice the thing at the window coughed there was an incessant lash like cracking
none	none	 then some shouted words which I was unable to make out and finally the staccato report 
4234-187735-0019	train-other-500	of a pistol Snarling like that of a wild beast came from the creature with the hairy arms together with renewed coughing But the steel grip relaxed not one iota I realized two things the first that in my terror at the suddenness of the attack
4234-187735-0020	train-other-500	I had omitted to act as pre arranged the second that I had discredited the strength of the visitant whilst Smith had foreseen it Desisting in my vain endeavor to pit my strength against that of the nameless thing
none	none	 I sprang back across the room and took up the weapon which had been left in my charge earlier in the night but which I had been unable to believe it would be necessary to employ This was a sharp and heavy axe which Nayland Smith when I had met him in Covent Garden had brought with him 
4234-187735-0021	train-other-500	to the great amazement of Weymouth and myself As I leaped back to the window and uplifted this primitive weapon a second shot sounded from below and more fierce snarling coughing and guttural mutterings assailed my ears from beyond the pane
4234-187735-0022	train-other-500	Lifting the heavy blade I brought it down with all my strength upon the nearer of those hairy arms where it crossed the window ledge severing muscle tendon and bone as easily as a knife might cut cheese A shriek
4234-187735-0023	train-other-500	a shriek neither human nor animal but gruesomely compounded of both followed and merged into a choking cough Like a flash the other shaggy arm was withdrawn and some vaguely seen body went rolling down the sloping red tiles
none	none	 and crashed on to the ground beneath 
4234-187735-0024	train-other-500	With a second piercing shriek louder than that recently uttered by Burke wailing through the night from somewhere below I turned desperately to the man on the bed who now was become significantly silent
4234-187735-0025	train-other-500	A candle with matches stood upon a table hard by and my fingers far from steady I set about obtaining a light This accomplished I stood the candle upon the little chest of drawers and returned to Burke s side Merciful God I cried
4234-187735-0026	train-other-500	Of all the pictures which remain in my memory some of them dark enough I can find none more horrible than that which now confronted me in the dim candle light Burke lay crosswise on the bed his head thrown back and sagging one rigid hand he held in the air
none	none	 and with the other grasped the hairy forearm which I had severed with the ax for in a death grip the dead fingers were still fastened vise like at his throat His face was nearly black and his eyes projected from their sockets horribly Mastering my repugnance I seized the hideous piece of bleeding anatomy and strove to release it It 
4234-187735-0027	train-other-500	defied all my efforts
none	none	 in death it was as implacable as in life 
4234-187735-0028	train-other-500	I took a knife from my pocket and tendon by tendon cut away that uncanny grip from Burke s throat But my labor was in vain Burke was dead
4234-187735-0029	train-other-500	I think I failed to realize this for some time My clothes were sticking clammily to my body I was bathed in perspiration and shaking furiously I clutched at the edge of the window avoiding the bloody patch upon the ledge
none	none	 and looked out over the roofs to where in the more distant plantations I could hear excited voices 
4234-187735-0030	train-other-500	What had been the meaning of that scream which I had heard
none	none	 but to which in my frantic state of mind I had paid comparatively little attention 
4234-187735-0031	train-other-500	There was a great stirring all about me Smith I cried from the window Smith for mercy s sake where are you Footsteps came racing up the stairs
4234-187735-0032	train-other-500	Behind me the door burst open and Nayland Smith stumbled into the room God he said and started back in the doorway Have you got it Smith I demanded hoarsely In sanity s name what is it what is it
4234-187735-0033	train-other-500	Come downstairs replied Smith quietly and see for yourself He turned his head aside from the bed Very unsteadily I followed him down the stairs and through the rambling old house out into the stone paved courtyard
none	none	 There were figures moving at the end of a long alleyway between the glass houses and one carrying a lantern stooped over something which lay upon the ground That s Burke s cousin with the lantern whispered Smith in my ear don t tell him yet I nodded and we hurried up to join the group I found myself looking down at one of those thick set Burmans whom I always associated with Fu Manchu s activities He lay quite flat face downward but the back of his head was a shapeless blood dotted mass and a heavy stock whip the butt end ghastly because of the blood and hair which clung to it lay beside him I started back appalled as Smith caught my arm It turned on its keeper he hissed in my ear I wounded it twice from below and you severed one arm in its insensate fury its unreasoning malignity it returned and there lies its second victim Then It s gone Petrie It has the strength of four men even now Look He stooped and from the clenched left hand of the dead Burman extracted a piece of paper and opened it Hold the lantern a moment he said In the yellow light he glanced at the scrap of paper As I expected a leaf of Burke s notebook it worked by scent He turned to me with an odd expression in his gray eyes I wonder what piece of my personal property Fu Manchu has pilfered he said in order to enable it to sleuth me He met the gaze of the man holding the lantern 
4234-187735-0034	train-other-500	Perhaps you had better return to the house he said looking him squarely in the eyes
none	none	 The other s face blanched You don t mean sir you don t mean 
4234-187735-0035	train-other-500	Brace up said Smith laying his hand upon his shoulder Remember he chose to play with fire One wild look the man cast from Smith to me then went off staggering toward the farm Smith I began
4234-187735-0036	train-other-500	He turned to me with an impatient gesture
none	none	 Weymouth has driven into Upminster he snapped and the whole district will be scoured before morning They probably motored here but the sounds of the shots will have enabled whoever was with the car to make good his escape And exhausted from loss of blood its capture is only a matter of time Petrie CHAPTER XVII ONE DAY IN RANGOON Nayland Smith returned from the telephone Nearly twenty four hours had elapsed since the awful death of Burke No news Petrie he said shortly It must have crept into some inaccessible hole to die I glanced up from my notes Smith settled into the white cane armchair and began to surround himself with clouds of aromatic smoke I took up a half sheet of foolscap covered with penciled writing in my friend s cramped characters and transcribed the following in order to complete my account of the latest Fu Manchu outrage The Amharun a Semitic tribe allied to the Falashas who have been settled for many generations in the southern province of Shoa Abyssinia have been regarded as unclean and outcast apparently since the days of Menelek son of Suleyman and the Queen of Sheba from whom they claim descent Apart from their custom of eating meat cut from living beasts they are accursed because of their alleged association with the Cynocephalus hamadryas Sacred Baboon I myself was taken to a hut on the banks of the Hawash and shown a creature whose predominant trait was an unreasoning malignity toward and a ferocious tenderness for the society of its furry brethren Its powers of scent were fully equal to those of a bloodhound whilst its abnormally long forearms possessed incredible strength a Cynocephalyte such as this contracts phthisis even in the more northern provinces of Abyssinia You have not explained to me Smith I said having completed this note how you got in touch with Fu Manchu how you learnt that he was not dead as we had supposed but living active Nayland Smith stood up and fixed his steely eyes upon me with an indefinable expression in them Then No he replied I haven t Do you wish to know Certainly I said with surprise is there any reason why I should not There is no real reason said Smith or staring at me very hard I hope there is no real reason What do you mean Well he grabbed up his pipe from the table and began furiously to load it I blundered upon the truth one day in Rangoon I was walking out of a house which I occupied there for a time and as I swung around the corner into the main street I ran into literally ran into Again he hesitated oddly then closed up his pouch and tossed it into the cane chair He struck a match I ran into Karamaneh he continued abruptly and began to puff away at his pipe filling the air with clouds of tobacco smoke I caught my breath This was the reason why he had kept me so long in ignorance of the story He knew of my hopeless uncrushable sentiments toward the gloriously beautiful but utterly hypocritical and evil Eastern girl who was perhaps the most dangerous of all doctor Fu Manchu s servants for the power of her loveliness was magical as I knew to my cost What did you do I asked quietly my fingers drumming upon the table Naturally enough continued Smith with a cry of recognition I held out both my hands to her gladly I welcomed her as a dear friend regained I thought of the joy with which you would learn that I had found the missing one I thought how you would be in Rangoon just as quickly as the fastest steamer could get you there Well Karamaneh started back and treated me to a glance of absolute animosity No recognition was there and no friendliness only a sort of scornful anger He shrugged his shoulders and began to walk up and down the room I do not know what you would have done in the circumstances Petrie but I Yes I dealt with the situation rather promptly I think I simply picked her up without another word right there in the public street and raced back into the house with her kicking and fighting like a little demon She did not shriek or do anything of that kind but fought silently like a vicious wild animal Oh I had some scars I assure you but I carried her up into my office which fortunately was empty at the time plumped her down in a chair and stood looking at her Go on I said rather hollowly what next She glared at me with those wonderful eyes an expression of implacable hatred in them Remembering all that we had done for her remembering our former friendship above all remembering you this look of hers almost made me shiver She was dressed very smartly in European fashion and the whole thing had been so sudden that as I stood looking at her I half expected to wake up presently and find it all a day dream But it was real as real as her enmity I felt the need for reflection and having vainly endeavored to draw her into conversation and elicited no other answer than this glare of hatred I left her there going out and locking the door behind me Very high handed A commissioner has certain privileges Petrie and any action I might choose to take was not likely to be questioned There was only one window to the office and it was fully twenty feet above the level it overlooked a narrow street off the main thoroughfare I think I have explained that the house stood on a corner so I did not fear her escaping I had an important engagement which I had been on my way to fulfil when the encounter took place and now with a word to my native servant who chanced to be downstairs I hurried off Smith s pipe had gone out as usual and he proceeded to relight it whilst with my eyes lowered I continued to drum upon the table This boy took her some tea later in the afternoon he continued and apparently found her in a more placid frame of mind I returned immediately after dusk and he reported that when last he had looked in about half an hour earlier she had been seated in an armchair reading a newspaper I may mention that everything of value in the office was securely locked up I was determined upon a certain course by this time and I went slowly upstairs unlocked the door and walked into the darkened office I turned up the light the place was empty Empty The window was open and the bird flown Oh it was not so simple a flight as you would realize if you knew the place The street which the window overlooked was bounded by a blank wall on the opposite side for thirty or forty yards along and as we had been having heavy rains it was full of glutinous mud Furthermore the boy whom I had left in charge had been sitting in the doorway immediately below the office window watching for my return ever since his last visit to the room above She must have bribed him I said bitterly or corrupted him with her infernal blandishments I ll swear she did not rapped Smith decisively I know my man and I ll swear she did not There were no marks in the mud of the road to show that a ladder had been placed there moreover nothing of the kind could have been attempted whilst the boy was sitting in the doorway that was evident In short she did not descend into the roadway and did not come out by the door Was there a gallery outside the window No it was impossible to climb to right or left of the window or up on to the roof I convinced myself of that But my dear man I cried you are eliminating every natural mode of egress Nothing remains but flight I am aware Petrie that nothing remains but flight in other words I have never to this day understood how she quitted the room I only know that she did And then I saw in this incredible escape the cunning hand of doctor Fu Manchu saw it at once Peace was ended and I set to work along certain channels without delay In this manner I got on the track at last and learned beyond the possibility of doubt that the Chinese doctor lived nay was actually on his way to Europe again There followed a short silence Then I suppose it s a mystery that will be cleared up some day concluded Smith but to date the riddle remains intact He glanced at the clock I have an appointment with Weymouth therefore leaving you to the task of solving this problem which thus far has defied my own efforts I will get along He read a query in my glance Oh I shall not be late he added I think I may venture out alone on this occasion without personal danger Nayland Smith went upstairs to dress leaving me seated at my writing table deep in thought My notes upon the renewed activity of doctor Fu Manchu were stacked at my left hand and opening a new writing block I commenced to add to them particulars of this surprising event in Rangoon which properly marked the opening of the Chinaman s second campaign Smith looked in at the door on his way out but seeing me thus engaged did not disturb me I think I have made it sufficiently evident in these records that my practice was not an extensive one and my hour for receiving patients arrived and passed with only two professional interruptions My task concluded I glanced at the clock and determined to devote the remainder of the evening to a little private investigation of my own From Nayland Smith I had preserved the matter a secret largely because I feared his ridicule but I had by no means forgotten that I had seen or had strongly imagined that I had seen Karamaneh that beautiful anomaly who in modern London asserted herself to be a slave in the shop of an antique dealer not a hundred yards from the British Museum A theory was forming in my brain which I was burningly anxious to put to the test I remembered how two years before I had met Karamaneh near to this same spot and I had heard Inspector Weymouth assert positively that Fu Manchu s headquarters were no longer in the East End as of yore There seemed to me to be a distinct probability that a suitable center had been established for his reception in this place so much less likely to be suspected by the authorities Perhaps I attached too great a value to what may have been a delusion perhaps my theory rested upon no more solid foundation than the belief that I had seen Karamaneh in the shop of the curio dealer If her appearance there should prove to have been phantasmal the structure of my theory would be shattered at its base To night I should test my premises and upon the result of my investigations determine my future action CHAPTER XVIII THE SILVER BUDDHA Museum Street certainly did not seem a likely spot for doctor Fu Manchu to establish himself yet unless my imagination had strangely deceived me from the window of the antique dealer who traded under the name of J Salaman those wonderful eyes of Karamaneh like the velvet midnight of the Orient had looked out at me As I paced slowly along the pavement toward that lighted window my heart was beating far from normally and I cursed the folly which in spite of all refused to die but lingered on poisoning my life Comparative quiet reigned in Museum Street at no time a busy thoroughfare and excepting another shop at the Museum end commercial activities had ceased there The door of a block of residential chambers almost immediately opposite to the shop which was my objective threw out a beam of light across the pavement but not more than two or three people were visible upon either side of the street I turned the knob of the door and entered the shop The same dark and immobile individual whom I had seen before and whose nationality defied conjecture came out from the curtained doorway at the back to greet me Good evening sir he said monotonously with a slight inclination of the head is there anything which you desire to inspect I merely wish to take a look around I replied I have no particular item in view The shop man inclined his head again swept a yellow hand comprehensively about as if to include the entire stock and seated himself on a chair behind the counter I lighted a cigarette with such an air of nonchalance as I could summon to the operation and began casually to inspect the varied objects of interest loading the shelves and tables about me I am bound to confess that I retain no one definite impression of this tour Vases I handled statuettes Egyptian scarabs bead necklaces illuminated missals portfolios of old prints jade ornaments bronzes fragments of rare lace early printed books Assyrian tablets daggers Roman rings and a hundred other curiosities leisurely and I trust with apparent interest yet without forming the slightest impression respecting any one of them Probably I employed myself in this way for half an hour or more and whilst my hands busied themselves among the stock of J Salaman my mind was occupied entirely elsewhere Furtively I was studying the shopman himself a human presentment of a Chinese idol I was listening and watching especially I was watching the curtained doorway at the back of the shop We close at about this time sir the man interrupted me speaking in the emotionless monotonous voice which I had noted before I replaced upon the glass counter a little Sekhet boat carved in wood and highly colored and glanced up with a start Truly my methods were amateurish I had learnt nothing I was unlikely to learn anything I wondered how Nayland Smith would have conducted such an inquiry and I racked my brains for some means of penetrating into the recesses of the establishment Indeed I had been seeking such a plan for the past half an hour but my mind had proved incapable of suggesting one Why I did not admit failure I cannot imagine but instead I began to tax my brains anew for some means of gaining further time and as I looked about the place the shopman very patiently awaiting my departure I observed an open case at the back of the counter The three lower shelves were empty but upon the fourth shelf squatted a silver Buddha I should like to examine the silver image yonder I said what price are you asking for it It is not for sale sir replied the man with a greater show of animation than he had yet exhibited Not for sale I said my eyes ever seeking the curtained doorway how s that It is sold Well even so there can be no objection to my examining it It is not for sale sir Such a rebuff from a tradesman would have been more than sufficient to call for a sharp retort at any other time but now it excited the strangest suspicions The street outside looked comparatively deserted and prompted primarily by an emotion which I did not pause to analyze I adopted a singular measure without doubt I relied upon the unusual powers vested in Nayland Smith to absolve me in the event of error I made as if to go out into the street then turned leaped past the shopman ran behind the counter and grasped at the silver Buddha That I was likely to be arrested for attempted larceny I cared not the idea that Karamaneh was concealed somewhere in the building ruled absolutely and a theory respecting this silver image had taken possession of my mind Exactly what I expected to happen at that moment I cannot say but what actually happened was far more startling than anything I could have imagined At the instant that I grasped the figure I realized that it was attached to the woodwork in the next I knew that it was a handle as I tried to pull it toward me I became aware that this handle was the handle of a door For that door swung open before me and I found myself at the foot of a flight of heavily carpeted stairs Anxious as I had been to proceed a moment before I was now trebly anxious to retire and for this reason on the bottom step of the stair facing me stood doctor Fu Manchu CHAPTER XIX doctor FU MANCHU S LABORATORY I cannot conceive that any ordinary mortal ever attained to anything like an intimacy with doctor Fu Manchu I cannot believe that any man could ever grow used to his presence could ever cease to fear him 
4234-187738-0000	train-other-500	I suppose I had set eyes upon Fu Manchu some five or six times prior to this occasion and now he was dressed in the manner which I always associated with him probably because it was thus I first saw him
4234-187738-0001	train-other-500	He wore a plain yellow robe and with his pointed chin resting upon his bosom he looked down at me revealing a great expanse of the marvelous brow with its sparse neutral colored hair
4234-187738-0002	train-other-500	Never in my experience have I known such force to dwell in the glance of any human eye as dwelt in that of this uncanny being His singular affliction if affliction it were the film or slight membrane which sometimes obscured the oblique eyes
4234-187738-0003	train-other-500	was particularly evident at the moment that I crossed the threshold but now as I looked up at doctor Fu Manchu it lifted revealing the eyes in all their emerald greenness The idea of physical attack upon this incredible being seemed childish
4234-187738-0004	train-other-500	inadequate But following that first instant of stupefaction I forced myself to advance upon him A dull crushing blow descended on the top of my skull and I became oblivious of all things
none	none	 My return to consciousness was accompanied by tremendous pains in my head whereby from previous experience I knew that a sandbag had been used against me by some one in the shop presumably by the immobile shopman 
4234-187738-0005	train-other-500	This awakening was accompanied by none of those hazy doubts respecting previous events and present surroundings which are the usual symptoms of revival from sudden unconsciousness even before I opened my eyes before I had more than a partial command of my senses
4234-187738-0006	train-other-500	I knew that with my wrists handcuffed behind me I lay in a room which was also occupied by doctor Fu Manchu This absolute certainty of the Chinaman s presence was evidenced not by my senses
4234-187738-0007	train-other-500	but only by an inner consciousness and the same that always awoke into life at the approach not only of Fu Manchu in person but of certain of his uncanny servants A faint perfume hung in the air about me
4234-187738-0008	train-other-500	I do not mean that of any essence or of any incense but rather the smell which is suffused by Oriental furniture by Oriental draperies the indefinable but unmistakable perfume of the East
none	none	 Thus London has a distinct smell of its own and so has Paris 
4234-187738-0009	train-other-500	whilst the difference between Marseilles and Suez for instance is even more marked Now the atmosphere surrounding me was Eastern but not of the East that I knew rather it was Far Eastern
4234-187738-0010	train-other-500	Perhaps I do not make myself very clear but to me there was a mysterious significance in that perfumed atmosphere I opened my eyes
4234-187738-0011	train-other-500	I lay upon a long low settee in a fairly large room which was furnished as I had anticipated in an absolutely Oriental fashion The two windows were so screened as to have lost from the interior point of view all resemblance to European windows
none	none	 and the whole structure of the room had been altered in conformity bearing out my idea that the place had been prepared for Fu Manchu s reception some time before his actual return I doubt if East or West a duplicate of that singular apartment could be found 
4234-187738-0012	train-other-500	The end in which I lay was as I have said typical of an Eastern house and a large ornate lantern hung from the ceiling almost directly above me The further end of the room was occupied by tall cases
4234-187738-0013	train-other-500	some of them containing books but the majority filled with scientific paraphernalia rows of flasks and jars frames of test tubes retorts scales
none	none	 and other objects of the laboratory 
4234-187738-0014	train-other-500	At a large and very finely carved table sat doctor Fu Manchu a yellow and faded volume open before him
none	none	 and some dark red fluid almost like blood 
4234-187738-0015	train-other-500	bubbling in a test tube which he held over the flame of a Bunsen burner
none	none	 The enormously long nail of his right index finger rested upon the opened page of the book to which he seemed constantly to refer 
4234-187738-0016	train-other-500	dividing his attention between the volume the contents of the test tube and the progress of a second experiment or possibly a part of the same which was taking place upon another corner of the littered table
4234-187738-0017	train-other-500	A huge glass retort the bulb was fully two feet in diameter fitted with a Liebig s Condenser rested in a metal frame and within the bulb floating in an oily substance was a fungus some six inches high
4234-187738-0018	train-other-500	shaped like a toadstool but of a brilliant and venomous orange color Three flat tubes of light were so arranged as to cast violet rays upward into the retort and the receiver wherein condensed the product of this strange experiment
none	none	 contained some drops of a red fluid which may have been identical with that boiling in the test tube These things I perceived at a glance then the filmy eyes of doctor Fu Manchu were raised from the book turned in my direction and all else was forgotten I regret came the sibilant voice that unpleasant measures were necessary but hesitation would have been fatal I trust doctor Petrie that you suffer no inconvenience To this speech no reply was possible and I attempted none You have long been aware of my esteem for your acquirements continued the Chinaman his voice occasionally touching deep guttural notes and you will appreciate the pleasure which this visit affords me I kneel at the feet of my silver Buddha I look to you when you shall have overcome your prejudices due to ignorance of my true motives to assist me in establishing that intellectual control which is destined to be the new World Force I bear you no malice for your ancient enmity and even now he waved one yellow hand toward the retort I am conducting an experiment designed to convert you from your misunderstanding and to adjust your perspective Quite unemotionally he spoke then turned again to his book his test tube and retort in the most matter of fact way imaginable I do not think the most frenzied outburst on his part the most fiendish threats 
4234-187738-0019	train-other-500	could have produced such effect upon me as those cold and carefully calculated words spoken in that unique voice which rang about the room sibilantly In its tones in the glance of the green eyes in the very pose of the gaunt high shouldered body
4234-187738-0020	train-other-500	there was power force I counted myself lost and in view of the doctor s words studied the progress of the experiment with frightful interest But a few moments sufficed in which to realize that for all my training I knew as little of chemistry
4234-187738-0021	train-other-500	of chemistry as understood by this man s genius as a junior student in surgery knows of trephining
none	none	 The process in operation was a complete mystery to me the means and the end alike incomprehensible 
4234-187738-0022	train-other-500	Thus in the heavy silence of that room a silence only broken by the regular bubbling from the test tube I found my attention straying from the table to the other objects surrounding it and at one of them my gaze stopped and remained chained with horror
4234-187738-0023	train-other-500	It was a glass jar some five feet in height and filled with viscous fluid of a light amber color Out from this peered a hideous dog like face low browed with pointed ears and a nose almost hoggishly flat
4234-187738-0024	train-other-500	By the death grin of the face the gleaming fangs were revealed and the body the long yellow gray body rested or seemed to rest upon short malformed legs whilst one long limp arm the right
4234-187738-0025	train-other-500	hung down straightly in the preservative The left arm had been severed above the elbow Fu Manchu finding his experiment to be proceeding favorably lifted his eyes to me again
none	none	 You are interested in my poor Cynocephalyte he said 
4234-187738-0026	train-other-500	and his eyes were filmed like the eyes of one afflicted with cataract He was a devoted servant doctor Petrie but the lower influences in his genealogy sometimes conquered Then he got out of hand
none	none	 and at last he was so ungrateful toward those who had educated him 
4234-187738-0027	train-other-500	that in one of those paroxysms of his he attacked and killed a most faithful Burman one of my oldest followers Fu Manchu returned to his experiment
none	none	 Not the slightest emotion had he exhibited thus far but had chatted with me as any other scientist might chat with a friend who casually visits his laboratory 
4234-187738-0028	train-other-500	The horror of the thing was playing havoc with my own composure however There I lay fettered in the same room with this man whose existence was a menace to the entire white race whilst placidly he pursued an experiment designed if his own words were believable
none	none	 to cut me off from my kind to wreak some change psychological or physiological I knew not to place me it might be upon a level with such brute things as that which now hung half floating in the glass jar 
4234-187738-0029	train-other-500	Something I knew of the history of that ghastly specimen that thing neither man nor ape for within my own knowledge had it not attempted the life of Nayland Smith and was it not I who with an ax had maimed it in the instant of one of its last slayings
none	none	 Of these things doctor Fu Manchu was well aware so that his placid speech was doubly trebly horrible to my ears 
4234-187738-0030	train-other-500	I sought furtively to move my arms only to realize that as I had anticipated the handcuffs were chained to a ring in the wall behind me The establishments of doctor Fu Manchu were always well provided with such contrivances as these
4234-187738-0031	train-other-500	I uttered a short harsh laugh Fu Manchu stood up slowly from the table and placing the test tube in a rack stood the latter carefully upon a shelf at his side
none	none	 I am happy to find you in such good humor he said softly Other affairs call me 
4234-187738-0032	train-other-500	and in my absence that profound knowledge of chemistry of which I have had evidence in the past will
none	none	 enable you to follow with intelligent interest the action of these violet rays upon this exceptionally fine specimen of Siberian amanita muscaria 
4234-187738-0033	train-other-500	At some future time possibly when you are my guest in China
none	none	 which country I am now making arrangements for you to visit I shall discuss with you some lesser known properties of this species and I may say that one of your first tasks when you commence your duties as assistant in my laboratory in Kiang su will be to conduct a series of twelve experiments which I have outlined into other potentialities of this unique 
4234-187738-0034	train-other-500	fungus He walked quietly to a curtained doorway with his cat like yet awkward gait lifted the drapery and with a slight nod in my direction
none	none	 went out of the room CHAPTER XX THE CROSS BAR How long I lay there alone I had no means of computing My mind was busy with many matters but principally concerned with my fate in the immediate future That doctor Fu Manchu entertained for me a singular kind of regard I had had evidence before He had formed the erroneous opinion that I was an advanced scientist who could be of use to him in his experiments and I was aware that he cherished a project of transporting me to some place in China where his principal laboratory was situated Respecting the means which he proposed to employ I was unlikely to forget that this man who had penetrated further along certain byways of science than seemed humanly possible undoubtedly was master of a process for producing artificial catalepsy It was my lot then to be packed in a chest to all intents and purposes a dead man for the time being and despatched to the interior of China What a fool I had been To think that I had learned nothing from my long and dreadful experience of the methods of doctor Fu Manchu to think that I had come alone in quest of him that leaving no trace behind me I had deliberately penetrated to his secret abode I have said that my wrists were manacled behind me the manacles being attached to a chain fastened in the wall I now contrived with extreme difficulty to reverse the position of my hands that is to say I climbed backward through the loop formed by my fettered arms so that instead of their being locked behind me they now were locked in front Then I began to examine the fetters learning as I had anticipated that they fastened with a lock I sat gazing at the steel bracelets in the light of the lamp which swung over my head and it became apparent to me that I had gained little by my contortion A slight noise disturbed these unpleasant reveries It was nothing less than the rattling of keys For a moment I wondered if I had heard aright or if the sound portended the coming of some servant of the doctor who was locking up the establishment for the night The jangling sound was repeated and in such a way that I could not suppose it to be accidental Some one was deliberately rattling a small bunch of keys in an adjoining room And now my heart leaped wildly then seemed to stand still With a low whistling cry a little gray shape shot through the doorway by which Fu Manchu had retired and rolled like a ball of fluff blown by the wind completely under the table which bore the weird scientific appliances of the Chinaman the advent of the gray object was accompanied by a further rattling of keys My fear left me and a mighty anxiety took its place This creature which now crouched chattering at me from beneath the big table was Fu Manchu s marmoset and in the intervals of its chattering and grimacing it nibbled speculatively at the keys upon the ring which it clutched in its tiny hands Key after key it sampled in this manner evincing a growing dissatisfaction with the uncrackable nature of its find One of those keys might be that of the handcuffs I could not believe that the tortures of Tantulus were greater than were mine at this moment In all my hopes of rescue or release I had included nothing so strange so improbable as this A sort of awe possessed me for if by this means the key which should release me should come into my possession how ever again could I doubt a beneficent Providence But they were not yet in my possession moreover the key of the handcuffs might not be amongst the bunch Were there no means whereby I could induce the marmoset to approach me Whilst I racked my brains for some scheme the little animal took the matter out of my hands Tossing the ring with its jangling contents a yard or so across the carpet in my direction it leaped in pursuit picked up the ring whirled it over its head and then threw a complete somersault around it Now it snatched up the keys again and holding them close to its ear rattled them furiously Finally with an incredible spring it leaped onto the chain supporting the lamp above my head and with the garish shade swinging and spinning wildly clung there looking down at me like an acrobat on a trapeze The tiny bluish face completely framed in grotesque whiskers enhanced the illusion of an acrobatic comedian Never for a moment did it release its hold upon the key ring My suspense now was intolerable I feared to move lest alarming the marmoset it should run off again taking the keys with it So as I lay there looking up at the little creature swinging above me the second wonder of the night came to pass A voice that I could never forget strive how I would a voice that haunted my dreams by night and for which by day I was ever listening cried out from some adjoining room Ta ala hina it called Ta ala hina Peko It was Karamaneh The effect upon the marmoset was instantaneous Down came the bunch of keys upon one side of the shade almost falling on my head and down leaped the ape upon the other In two leaps it had traversed the room and had vanished through the curtained doorway If ever I had need of coolness it was now the slightest mistake would be fatal The keys had slipped from the mattress of the divan and now lay just beyond reach of my fingers Rapidly I changed my position and sought without undue noise to move the keys with my foot I had actually succeeded in sliding them back on to the mattress when unheralded by any audible footstep Karamaneh came through the doorway holding the marmoset in her arms She wore a dress of fragile muslin material and out from its folds protruded one silk stockinged foot resting in a high heeled red shoe For a moment she stood watching me with a sort of enforced composure then her glance strayed to the keys lying upon the floor Slowly and with her eyes fixed again upon my face she crossed the room stooped and took up the key ring It was one of the poignant moments of my life for by that simple act all my hopes had been shattered Any poor lingering doubt that I may have had left me now Had the slightest spark of friendship animated the bosom of Karamaneh most certainly she would have overlooked the presence of the keys of the keys which represented my one hope of escape from the clutches of the fiendish Chinaman There is a silence more eloquent than words For half a minute or more Karamaneh stood watching me forcing herself to watch me and I looked up at her with a concentrated gaze in which rage and reproach must have been strangely mingled What eyes she had of that blackly lustrous sort nearly always associated with unusually dark complexions but Karamaneh s complexion was peachlike or rather of an exquisite and delicate fairness which reminded me of the petal of a rose By some I had been accused of raving about this girl s beauty but only by those who had not met her for indeed she was astonishingly lovely At last her eyes fell the long lashes drooped upon her cheeks She turned and walked slowly to the chair in which Fu Manchu had sat Placing the keys upon the table amid the scientific litter she rested one dimpled elbow upon the yellow page of the book and with her chin in her palm again directed upon me that enigmatical gaze I dared not think of the past of the past in which this beautiful treacherous girl had played a part yet watching her I could not believe even now that she was false My state was truly a pitiable one I could have cried out in sheer anguish With her long lashes partly lowered she watched me awhile then spoke and her voice was music which seemed to mock me every inflection of that elusive accent reopened lancet like the ancient wound Why do you look at me so she said almost in a whisper By what right do you reproach me Have you ever offered me friendship that I should repay you with friendship When first you came to the house where I was by the river came to save some one from there was the familiar hesitation which always preceded the name of Fu Manchu from him you treated me as your enemy although I would have been your friend There was appeal in the soft voice but I laughed mockingly and threw myself back upon the divan Karamaneh stretched out her hands toward me and I shall never forget the expression which flashed into those glorious eyes but seeing me intolerant of her appeal she drew back and quickly turned her head aside Even in this hour of extremity of impotent wrath I could find no contempt in my heart for her feeble hypocrisy with all the old wonder I watched that exquisite profile and Karamaneh s very deceitfulness was a salve for had she not cared she would not have attempted it Suddenly she stood up taking the keys in her hands and approached me Not by word nor by look she said quietly have you asked for my friendship but because I cannot bear you to think of me as you do I will prove that I am not the hypocrite and the liar you think me You will not trust me but I will trust you I looked up into her eyes and knew a pagan joy when they faltered before my searching gaze She threw herself upon her knees beside me and the faint exquisite perfume inseparable from my memories of her became perceptible and seemed as of old to intoxicate me The lock clicked and I was free Karamaneh rose swiftly to her feet as I stood upright and outstretched my cramped arms For one delirious moment her bewitching face was close to mine and the dictates of madness almost ruled but I clenched my teeth and turned sharply aside I could not trust myself to speak With Fu Manchu s marmoset again gamboling before us she walked through the curtained doorway into the room beyond It was in darkness but I could see the slave girl in front of me a slim silhouette as she walked to a screened window and opening the screen in the manner of a folding door also threw up the window Look she whispered I crept forward and stood beside her I found myself looking down into Museum Street from a first floor window Belated traffic still passed along New Oxford Street on the left but not a solitary figure was visible to the right as far as I could see and that was nearly to the railings of the Museum Immediately opposite in one of the flats which I had noticed earlier in the evening another window was opened I turned and in the reflected light saw that Karamaneh held a cord in her hand Our eyes met in the semi darkness She began to haul the cord into the window and looking upward I perceived that it was looped in some way over the telegraph cables which crossed the street at that point It was a slender cord and it appeared to be passed across a joint in the cables almost immediately above the center of the roadway As it was hauled in a second and stronger line attached to it was pulled in turn over the cables and thence in by the window Karamaneh twisted a length of it around a metal bracket fastened in the wall and placed a light wooden crossbar in my hand Make sure that there is no one in the street she said craning out and looking to right and left then swing across The length of the rope is just sufficient to enable you to swing through the open window opposite and there is a mattress inside to drop upon But release the bar immediately or you may be dragged back The door of the room in which you will find yourself is unlocked and you have only to walk down the stairs and out into the street I peered at the crossbar in my hand then looked hard at the girl beside me I missed something of the old fire of her nature she was very subdued tonight Thank you Karamaneh I said softly She suppressed a little cry as I spoke her name and drew back into the shadows I believe you are my friend I said but I cannot understand Won t you help me to understand I took her unresisting hand and drew her toward me My very soul seemed to thrill at the contact of her lithe body She was trembling wildly and seemed to be trying to speak but although her lips framed the words no sound followed Suddenly comprehension came to me I looked down into the street hitherto deserted and into the upturned face of Fu Manchu Wearing a heavy fur collared coat and with his yellow malignant countenance grotesquely horrible beneath the shade of a large tweed motor cap he stood motionless looking up at me That he had seen me I could not doubt but had he seen my companion In a choking whisper Karamaneh answered my unspoken question He has not seen me I have done much for you do in return a small thing for me Save my life She dragged me back from the window and fled across the room to the weird laboratory where I had lain captive Throwing herself upon the divan she held out her white wrists and glanced significantly at the manacles Lock them upon me she said rapidly Quick quick Great as was my mental disturbance I managed to grasp the purpose of this device The very extremity of my danger found me cool I fastened the manacles which so recently had confined my own wrists upon the slim wrists of Karamaneh A faint and muffled disturbance doubly ominous because there was nothing to proclaim its nature reached me from some place below on the ground floor Tie something around my mouth directed Karamaneh with nervous rapidity As I began to look about me Tear a strip from my dress she said do not hesitate be quick be quick I seized the flimsy muslin and tore off half a yard or so from the hem of the skirt The voice of doctor Fu Manchu became audible He was speaking rapidly sibilantly and evidently was approaching would be upon me in a matter of moments I fastened the strip of fabric over the girl s mouth and tied it behind experiencing a pang half pleasurable and half fearful as I found my hands in contact with the foamy luxuriance of her hair doctor Fu Manchu was entering the room immediately beyond Snatching up the bunch of keys I turned and ran for in another instant my retreat would be cut off As I burst once more into the darkened room I became aware that a door on the further side of it was open and framed in the opening was the tall high shouldered figure of the Chinaman still enveloped in his fur coat and wearing the grotesque cap As I saw him so he perceived me and as I sprang to the window he advanced I turned desperately and hurled the bunch of keys with all my force into the dimly seen face Either because they possessed a chatoyant quality of their own as I had often suspected or by reason of the light reflected through the open window the green eyes gleamed upon me vividly like those of a giant cat One short guttural exclamation paid tribute to the accuracy of my aim then I had the crossbar in my hand I threw one leg across the sill and dire as was my extremity hesitated for an instant ere trusting myself to the flight A vise like grip fastened upon my left ankle Hazily I became aware that the dark room was flooded with figures The whole yellow gang were upon me the entire murder group composed of units recruited from the darkest place of the East I have never counted myself a man of resource and have always envied Nayland Smith his possession of that quality in him extraordinarily developed but on this occasion the gods were kind to me and I resorted to the only device perhaps which could have saved me Without releasing my hold upon the crossbar I clutched at the ledge with the fingers of both hands and swung back into the room my right leg which was already across the sill With all my strength I kicked out My heel came in contact in sickening contact with a human head beyond doubt that I had split the skull of the man who held me The grip upon my ankle was released automatically and now consigning all my weight to the rope I slipped forward as a diver across the broad ledge and found myself sweeping through the night like a winged thing The line as Karamaneh had assured me was of well judged length Down I swept to within six or seven feet of the street level then up at ever decreasing speed toward the vague oblong of the open window beyond I hope I have been successful in some measure in portraying the varied emotions which it was my lot to experience that night and it may well seem that nothing more exquisite could remain for me Yet it was written otherwise for as I swept up to my goal describing the inevitable arc which I had no power to check I saw that one awaited me Crouching forward half out of the open window was a Burmese dacoit a cross eyed leering being whom I well remembered to have encountered two years before in my dealings with doctor Fu Manchu One bare sinewy arm held rigidly at right angles before his breast he clutched a long curved knife and waited waited for the critical moment when my throat should be at his mercy I have said that a strange coolness had come to my aid even now it did not fail me and so incalculably rapid are the workings of the human mind that I remember complimenting myself upon an achievement which Smith himself could not have bettered and this in the immeasurable interval which intervened between the commencement of my upward swing and my arrival on a level with the window I threw my body back and thrust my feet forward As my legs went through the opening an acute pain in one calf told me that I was not to escape scatheless from the night s melee But the dacoit went rolling over in the darkness of the room as helpless in face of that ramrod stroke as the veriest infant Back I swept upon my trapeze a sight to have induced any passing citizen to question his sanity With might and main I sought to check the swing of the pendulum for if I should come within reach of the window behind I doubted not that other knives awaited me It was no difficult feat and I succeeded in checking my flight Swinging there above Museum Street I could even appreciate so lucid was my mind the ludicrous element of the situation I dropped My wounded leg almost failed me and greatly shaken but with no other serious damage I picked myself up from the dust of the roadway It was a mockery of Fate that the problem which Nayland Smith had set me to solve should have been solved thus for I could not doubt that by means of the branch of a tall tree or some other suitable object situated opposite to Smith s house in Rangoon Karamaneh had made her escape as tonight I had made mine Apart from the acute pain in my calf I knew that the dacoit s knife had bitten deeply by reason of the fact that a warm liquid was trickling down into my boot Like any drunkard I stood there in the middle of the road looking up at the vacant window where the dacoit had been and up at the window above the shop of J Salaman where I knew Fu Manchu to be But for some reason the latter window had been closed or almost closed and as I stood there this reason became apparent to me The sound of running footsteps came from the direction of New Oxford Street I turned to see two policemen bearing down upon me This was a time for quick decisions and prompt action I weighed all the circumstances in the balance and made the last vital choice of the night I turned and ran toward the British Museum as though the worst of Fu Manchu s creatures and not my allies the police were at my heels No one else was in sight but as I whirled into the Square the red lamp of a slowly retreating taxi became visible some hundred yards to the left My leg was paining me greatly but the nature of the wound did not interfere with my progress therefore I continued my headlong career and ere the police had reached the end of Museum Street I had my hand upon the door handle of the cab for the Fates being persistently kind to me the vehicle was for hire doctor Cleeve s Harley Street I shouted at the man Drive like hell It s an urgent case I leaped into the cab Within five seconds from the time that I slammed the door and dropped back panting upon the cushions we were speeding westward toward the house of the famous pathologist thereby throwing the police hopelessly off the track Faintly to my ears came the purr of a police whistle The taxi man evidently did not hear the significant sound Merciful Providence had rung down the curtain for to night my role in the yellow drama was finished CHAPTER XXI CRAGMIRE TOWER Less than two hours later Inspector Weymouth and a party of men from Scotland Yard raided the house in Museum Street They found the stock of J Salaman practically intact and in the strangely appointed rooms above every evidence of a hasty outgoing But of the instruments drugs and other laboratory paraphernalia not one item remained I would gladly have given my income for a year to have gained possession of the books alone for beyond all shadow of doubt I knew them to contain formula calculated to revolutionize the science of medicine Exhausted physically and mentally and with my mind a whispering gallery of conjectures it were needless for me to mention whom respecting I turned in gratefully having patched up the slight wound in my calf I seemed scarcely to have closed my eyes when Nayland Smith was shaking me into wakefulness You are probably tired out he said but your crazy expedition of last night entitles you to no sympathy Read this there is a train in an hour We will reserve a compartment and you can resume your interrupted slumbers in a corner seat As I struggled upright in bed rubbing my eyes sleepily Smith handed me the Daily Telegraph pointing to the following paragraph upon the literary page Messrs M announce that they will publish shortly the long delayed work of Kegan Van Roon the celebrated American traveler Orientalist and psychic investigator dealing with his recent inquiries in China It will be remembered that mister Van Roon undertook to motor from Canton to Siberia last winter but met with unforeseen difficulties in the province of Ho Nan He fell into the hands of a body of fanatics and was fortunate to escape with his life His book will deal in particular with his experiences in Ho Nan and some sensational revelations regarding the awakening of that most mysterious race the Chinese are promised For reasons of his own he has decided to remain in England until the completion of his book which will be published simultaneously in New York and London and has leased Cragmire Tower Somersetshire in which romantic and historical residence he will collate his notes and prepare for the world a work ear marked as a classic even before it is published I glanced up from the paper to find Smith s eyes fixed upon me inquiringly From what I have been able to learn he said evenly we should reach Saul with decent luck just before dusk As he turned and quitted the room without another word I realized in a flash the purport of our mission I understood my friend s ominous calm betokening suppressed excitement The Fates were with us or so it seemed and whereas we had not hoped to gain Saul before sunset as a matter of fact the autumn afternoon was in its most glorious phase as we left the little village with its oldtime hostelry behind us and set out in an easterly direction with the Bristol Channel far away on our left and a gently sloping upland on our right The crooked high street practically constituted the entire hamlet of Saul and the inn The Wagoners was the last house in the street Now as we followed the ribbon of moor path to the top of the rise we could stand and look back upon the way we had come and although we had covered fully a mile of ground it was possible to detect the sunlight gleaming now and then upon the gilt lettering of the inn sign as it swayed in the breeze The day had been unpleasantly warm but was relieved by this same sea breeze which although but slight had in it the tang of the broad Atlantic Behind us then the foot path sloped down to Saul unpeopled by any living thing east and northeast swelled the monotony of the moor right out to the hazy distance where the sky began and the sea remotely lay hidden west fell the gentle gradient from the top of the slope which we had mounted and here as far as the eye could reach the country had an appearance suggestive of a huge and dried up lake This idea was borne out by an odd blotchiness for sometimes there would be half a mile or more of seeming moorland then a sharply defined change or it seemed sharply defined from that bird s eye point of view A vivid greenness marked these changes which merged into a dun colored smudge and again into the brilliant green then the moor would begin once more That will be the Tor of Glastonbury I suppose said Smith suddenly peering through his field glasses in an easterly direction and yonder unless I am greatly mistaken is Cragmire Tower Shading my eyes with my hand I also looked ahead and saw the place for which we were bound one of those round towers more common in Ireland which some authorities have declared to be of Phoenician origin Ramshackle buildings clustered untidily about its base and to it a sort of tongue of that oddly venomous green which patched the lowlands shot out and seemed almost to reach the towerbase The land for miles around was as flat as the palm of my hand saving certain hummocks lesser tors and irregular piles of boulders which dotted its expanse Hills and uplands there were in the hazy distance forming a sort of mighty inland bay which I doubted not in some past age had been covered by the sea Even in the brilliant sunlight the place had something of a mournful aspect looking like a great dried up pool into which the children of giants had carelessly cast stones We met no living soul upon the moor With Cragmire Tower but a quarter of a mile off Smith paused again and raising his powerful glasses swept the visible landscape Not a sign Petrie he said softly yet Dropping the glasses back into their case my companion began to tug at his left ear Have we been over confident he said narrowing his eyes in speculative fashion No less than three times I have had the idea that something or some one has just dropped out of sight behind me as I focused What do you mean Smith Are we he glanced about him as though the vastness were peopled with listening Chinamen followed Silently we looked into one another s eyes each seeking for the dread which neither had named Then Come on Petrie said Smith grasping my arm and at quick march we were off again Cragmire Tower stood upon a very slight eminence and what had looked like a green tongue from the moorland slopes above was in fact a creek flanked by lush land which here found its way to the sea The house which we were come to visit consisted in a low two story building joining the ancient tower on the east with two smaller outbuildings There was a miniature kitchen garden and a few stunted fruit trees in the northwest corner the whole being surrounded by a gray stone wall The shadow of the tower fell sharply across the path which ran up almost alongside of it We were both extremely warm by reason of our long and rapid walk on that hot day and this shade should have been grateful to us In short I find it difficult to account for the unwelcome chill which I experienced at the moment that I found myself at the foot of the time worn monument I know that we both pulled up sharply and looked at one another as though acted upon by some mutual disturbance But not a sound broke the stillness save a remote murmuring until a solitary sea gull rose in the air and circled directly over the tower uttering its mournful and unmusical cry Automatically to my mind sprang the lines of the poem Far from all brother men in the weird of the fen With God s creatures I bide mid the birds that I ken Where the winds ever dree where the hymn of the sea Brings a message of peace from the ocean to me Not a soul was visible about the premises there was no sound of human activity and no dog barked Nayland Smith drew a long breath glanced back along the way we had come then went on following the wall I beside him until we came to the gate It was unfastened and we walked up the stone path through a wilderness of weeds Four windows of the house were visible two on the ground floor and two above Those on the ground floor were heavily boarded up those above though glazed boasted neither blinds nor curtains Cragmire Tower showed not the slightest evidence of tenancy We mounted three steps and stood before a tremendously massive oaken door An iron bell pull ancient and rusty hung on the right of the door and Smith giving me an odd glance seized the ring and tugged it From somewhere within the building answered a mournful clangor a cracked and toneless jangle which seeming to echo through empty apartments sought and found an exit apparently by way of one of the openings in the round tower for it was from above our heads that the noise came to us It died away that eerie ringing that clanging so dismal that it could chill my heart even then with the bright sunlight streaming down out of the blue it awoke no other response than the mournful cry of the sea gull circling over our heads Silence fell We looked at one another and we were both about to express a mutual doubt when unheralded by any unfastening of bolts or bars the oaken door was opened and a huge mulatto dressed in white stood there regarding us I started nervously for the apparition was so unexpected but Nayland Smith without evidence of surprise thrust a card into the man s hand Take my card to mister Van Roon and say that I wish to see him on important business he directed authoritatively The mulatto bowed and retired His white figure seemed to be swallowed up by the darkness within for beyond the patch of uncarpeted floor revealed by the peeping sunlight was a barn like place of densest shadow I was about to speak but Smith laid his hand upon my arm warningly as out from the shadows the mulatto returned He stood on the right of the door and bowed again Be pleased to enter he said in his harsh negro voice mister Van Roon will see you The gladness of the sun could no longer stir me a chill and sense of foreboding bore me company as beside Nayland Smith I entered Cragmire Tower CHAPTER XXII THE MULATTO The room in which Van Roon received us was roughly of the shape of an old fashioned keyhole one end of it occupied the base of the tower upon which the remainder had evidently been built In many respects it was a singular room but the feature which caused me the greatest amazement was this it had no windows In the deep alcove formed by the tower sat Van Roon at a littered table upon which stood an oil reading lamp green shaded of the Victoria pattern to furnish the entire illumination of the apartment That bookshelves lined the rectangular portion of this strange study I divined although that end of the place was dark as a catacomb The walls were wood paneled and the ceiling was oaken beamed A small bookshelf and tumble down cabinet stood upon either side of the table and the celebrated American author and traveler lay propped up in a long split cane chair He wore smoked glasses and had a clean shaven olive face with a profusion of jet black hair He was garbed in a dirty red dressing gown and a perfect fog of cigar smoke hung in the room He did not rise to greet us but merely extended his right hand between two fingers whereof he held Smith s card You will excuse the seeming discourtesy of an invalid gentlemen he said but I am suffering from undue temerity in the interior of China He waved his hand vaguely and I saw that two rough deal chairs stood near the table Smith and I seated ourselves and my friend leaning his elbow upon the table looked fixedly at the face of the man whom we had come from London to visit Although comparatively unfamiliar to the British public the name of Van Roon was well known in American literary circles for he enjoyed in the United States a reputation somewhat similar to that which had rendered the name of our mutual friend Sir Lionel Barton a household word in England It was Van Roon who following in the footsteps of Madame Blavatsky had sought out the haunts of the fabled mahatmas in the Himalayas and Van Roon who had essayed to explore the fever swamps of Yucatan in quest of the secret of lost Atlantis lastly it was Van Roon who with an overland car specially built for him by a celebrated American firm had undertaken the journey across China I studied the olive face with curiosity Its natural impassivity was so greatly increased by the presence of the colored spectacles that my study was as profitless as if I had scrutinized the face of a carven Buddha The mulatto had withdrawn and in an atmosphere of gloom and tobacco smoke Smith and I sat staring perhaps rather rudely at the object of our visit to the West Country mister Van Roon began my friend abruptly you will no doubt have seen this paragraph It appeared in this morning s Daily Telegraph He stood up and taking out the cutting from his notebook placed it on the table I have seen this yes said Van Roon revealing a row of even white teeth in a rapid smile Is it to this paragraph that I owe the pleasure of seeing you here The paragraph appeared in this morning s issue replied Smith An hour from the time of seeing it my friend doctor Petrie and I were entrained for Bridgewater Your visit delights me gentlemen and I should be ungrateful to question its cause but frankly I am at a loss to understand why you should have honored me thus I am a poor host God knows for what with my tortured limb a legacy from the Chinese devils whose secrets I surprised and my semi blindness due to the same cause I am but sorry company Nayland Smith held up his right hand deprecatingly Van Roon tendered a box of cigars and clapped his hands whereupon the mulatto entered I see that you have a story to tell me mister Smith he said therefore I suggest whisky and soda or you might prefer tea as it is nearly tea time Smith and I chose the former refreshment and the soft footed half breed having departed upon his errand my companion leaning forward earnestly across the littered table outlined for Van Roon the story of doctor Fu Manchu the great and malign being whose mission in England at that moment was none other than the stoppage of just such information as our host was preparing to give to the world There is a giant conspiracy mister Van Roon he said which had its birth in this very province of Ho Nan from which you were so fortunate to escape alive whatever its scope or limitations a great secret society is established among the yellow races It means that China which has slumbered for so many generations now stirs in that age long sleep I need not tell you how much more it means this seething in the pot In a word interrupted Van Roon pushing Smith s glass across the table you would say That your life is not worth that replied Smith snapping his fingers before the other s face A very impressive silence fell I watched Van Roon curiously as he sat propped up among his cushions his smooth face ghastly in the green light from the lamp shade He held the stump of a cigar between his teeth but apparently unnoticed by him it had long since gone out Smith out of the shadows was watching him too Then Your information is very disturbing said the American I am the more disposed to credit your statement because I am all too painfully aware of the existence of such a group as you mention in China but that they had an agent here in England is something I had never conjectured In seeking out this solitary residence I have unwittingly done much to assist their designs But my dear mister Smith I am very remiss Of course you will remain tonight and I trust for some days to come Smith glanced rapidly across at me then turned again to our host It seems like forcing our company upon you he said but in your own interests I think it will be best to do as you are good enough to suggest I hope and believe that our arrival here has not been noticed by the enemy therefore it will be well if we remain concealed as much as possible for the present until we have settled upon some plan Hagar shall go to the station for your baggage said the American rapidly and clapped his hands his usual signal to the mulatto Whilst the latter was receiving his orders I noticed Nayland Smith watching him closely and when he had departed How long has that man been in your service snapped my friend Van Roon peered blindly through his smoked glasses For some years he replied he was with me in India and in China Where did you engage him Actually in saint Kitts H m muttered Smith and automatically he took out and began to fill his pipe I can offer you no company but my own gentlemen continued Van Roon but unless it interferes with your plans you may find the surrounding district of interest and worthy of inspection between now and dinner time By the way I think I can promise you quite a satisfactory meal for Hagar is a model chef A walk would be enjoyable said Smith but dangerous Ah perhaps you are right Evidently you apprehend some attempt upon me At any moment To one in my crippled condition an alarming outlook However I place myself unreservedly in your hands But really you must not leave this interesting district before you have made the acquaintance of some of its historical spots To me steeped as I am in what I may term the lore of the odd it is a veritable wonderland almost as interesting in its way as the caves and jungles of Hindustan depicted by Madame Blavatsky His high pitched voice with a certain labored intonation not quite so characteristically American as was his accent rose even higher he spoke with the fire of the enthusiast When I learned that Cragmire Tower was vacant he continued I leaped at the chance excuse the metaphor from a lame man This is a ghost hunter s paradise The tower itself is of unknown origin though probably Phoenician and the house traditionally sheltered doctor Macleod the necromancer after his flight from the persecution of James of Scotland Then to add to its interest it borders on Sedgemoor the scene of the bloody battle during the Monmouth rising whereat a thousand were slain on the field It is a local legend that the unhappy Duke and his staff may be seen on stormy nights crossing the path which skirts the mire after which this building is named with flaming torches held aloft Merely marsh lights I take it interjected Smith gripping his pipe hard between his teeth Your practical mind naturally seeks a practical explanation smiled Van Roon but I myself have other theories Then in addition to the charms of Sedgemoor haunted Sedgemoor on a fine day it is quite possible to see the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey from here and Glastonbury Abbey as you may know is closely bound up with the history of alchemy It was in the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey that the adept Kelly companion of doctor Dee discovered in the reign of Elizabeth the famous caskets of saint Dunstan containing the two tinctures So he ran on enumerating the odd charms of his residence charms which for my part I did not find appealing Finally We cannot presume further upon your kindness said Nayland Smith standing up No doubt we can amuse ourselves in the neighborhood of the house until the return of your servant Look upon Cragmire Tower as your own gentlemen cried Van Roon Most of the rooms are unfurnished and the garden is a wilderness but the structure of the brickwork in the tower may interest you archaeologically and the view across the moor is at least as fine as any in the neighborhood So with his brilliant smile and a gesture of one thin yellow hand the crippled traveler made us free of his odd dwelling As I passed out from the room close at Smith s heels I glanced back I cannot say why Van Roon already was bending over his papers in his green shadowed sanctuary and the light shining down upon his smoked glasses created the odd illusion that he was looking over the tops of the lenses and not down at the table as his attitude suggested However it was probably ascribable to the weird chiaroscuro of the scene although it gave the seated figure an oddly malignant appearance and I passed out through the utter darkness of the outer room to the front door Smith opening it I was conscious of surprise to find dusk come to meet darkness where I had looked for sunlight The silver wisps which had raced along the horizon as we came to Cragmire Tower had been harbingers of other and heavier banks A stormy sunset smeared crimson streaks across the skyline where a great range of clouds like the oily smoke of a city burning was banked mountain topping mountain and lighted from below by this angry red As we came down the steps and out by the gate I turned and looked across the moor behind us A sort of reflection from this distant blaze encrimsoned the whole landscape The inland bay glowed sullenly as if internal fires and not reflected light were at work a scene both wild and majestic Nayland Smith was staring up at the cone like top of the ancient tower in a curious speculative fashion Under the influence of our host s conversation I had forgotten the reasonless dread which had touched me at the moment of our arrival but now with the red light blazing over Sedgemoor as if in memory of the blood which had been shed there and with the tower of unknown origin looming above me I became very uncomfortable again nor did I envy Van Roon his eerie residence The proximity of a tower of any kind at night makes in some inexplicable way for awe and to night there were other agents too What s that snapped Smith suddenly grasping my arm He was peering southward toward the distant hamlet and starting violently at his words and the sudden grasp of his hand I too stared in that direction We were followed Petrie he almost whispered I never got a sight of our follower but I ll swear we were followed Look there s something moving over yonder Together we stood staring into the dusk then Smith burst abruptly into one of his rare laughs and clapped me upon the shoulder It s Hagar the mulatto he cried and our grips That extraordinary American with his tales of witch lights and haunted abbeys has been playing the devil with our nerves Together we waited by the gate until the half caste appeared on the bend of the path with a grip in either hand He was a great muscular fellow with a stoic face and for the purpose of visiting Saul presumably he had doffed his white raiment and now wore a sort of livery with a peaked cap Smith watched him enter the house Then I wonder where Van Roon obtains his provisions and so forth he muttered It s odd they knew nothing about the new tenant of Cragmire Tower at The Wagoners There came a sort of sudden expectancy into his manner for which I found myself at a loss to account He turned his gaze inland and stood there tugging at his left ear and clicking his teeth together He stared at me and his eyes looked very bright in the dusk for a sort of red glow from the sunset touched them but he spoke no word merely taking my arm and leading me off on a rambling walk around and about the house Neither of us spoke a word until we stood at the gate of Cragmire Tower again then I ll swear now that we were followed here today muttered Smith The lofty place immediately within the doorway proved in the light of a lamp now fixed in an iron bracket to be a square entrance hall meagerly furnished The closed study door faced the entrance and on the left of it ascended an open staircase up which the mulatto led the way We found ourselves on the floor above in a corridor traversing the house from back to front An apartment on the immediate left was indicated by the mulatto as that allotted to Smith It was a room of fair size furnished quite simply but boasting a wardrobe cupboard and Smith s grip stood beside the white enameled bed I glanced around and then prepared to follow the man who had awaited me in the doorway He still wore his dark livery and as I followed the lithe broad shouldered figure along the corridor I found myself considering critically his breadth of shoulder and the extraordinary thickness of his neck I have repeatedly spoken of a sort of foreboding an elusive stirring in the depths of my being of which I became conscious at certain times in my dealings with doctor Fu Manchu and his murderous servants This sensation or something akin to it claimed me now unaccountably as I stood looking into the neat bedroom on the same side of the corridor but at the extreme end wherein I was to sleep A voiceless warning urged me to return a kind of childish panic came fluttering about my heart a dread of entering the room of allowing the mulatto to come behind me Doubtless this was no more than a sub conscious product of my observations respecting his abnormal breadth of shoulder But whatever the origin of the impulse I found myself unable to disobey it Therefore I merely nodded turned on my heel and went back to Smith s room I closed the door then turned to face Smith who stood regarding me Smith I said that man sends cold water trickling down my spine Still regarding me fixedly my friend nodded his head You are curiously sensitive to this sort of thing he replied slowly I have noticed it before as a useful capacity I don t like the look of the man myself The fact that he has been in Van Roon s employ for some years goes for nothing We are neither of us likely to forget Kwee the Chinese servant of Sir Lionel Barton and it is quite possible that Fu Manchu has corrupted this man as he corrupted the other It is quite possible His voice trailed off into silence and he stood looking across the room with unseeing eyes meditating deeply It was quite dark now outside as I could see through the uncurtained window which opened upon the dreary expanse stretching out to haunted Sedgemoor Two candles were burning upon the dressing table they were but recently lighted and so intense was the stillness that I could distinctly hear the spluttering of one of the wicks which was damp Without giving the slightest warning of his intention Smith suddenly made two strides forward stretched out his long arms and snuffed the pair of candles in a twinkling The room became plunged in impenetrable darkness Not a word Petrie whispered my companion I moved cautiously to join him but as I did so perceived that he was moving too Vaguely against the window I perceived him silhouetted He was looking out across the moor and See see he hissed With my heart thumping furiously in my breast I bent over him and for the second time since our coming to Cragmire Tower my thoughts flew to The Fenman There are shades in the fen ghosts of women and men Who have sinned and have died but are living again O er the waters they tread with their lanterns of dread And they peer in the pools in the pools of the dead A light was dancing out upon the moor a witchlight that came and went unaccountably up and down in and out now clearly visible now masked in the darkness Lock the door snapped my companion if there s a key I crept across the room and fumbled for a moment then There is no key I reported Then wedge the chair under the knob and let no one enter until I return he said amazingly With that he opened the window to its fullest extent threw his leg over the sill and went creeping along a wide concrete ledge in which ran a leaded gutter in the direction of the tower on the right Not pausing to follow his instructions respecting the chair I craned out of the window watching his progress and wondering with what sudden madness he was bitten Indeed I could not credit my senses could not believe that I heard and saw aright Yet there out in the darkness on the moor moved the will o the wisp and ten yards along the gutter crept my friend like a great gaunt cat Unknown to me he must have prospected the route by daylight for now I saw his design The ledge terminated only where it met the ancient wall of the tower and it was possible for an agile climber to step from it to the edge of the unglazed window some four feet below and to scramble from that point to the stone fence and thence on to the path by which we had come from Saul This difficult operation Nayland Smith successfully performed and to my unbounded amazement went racing into the darkness toward the dancing light headlong like a madman The night swallowed him up and between my wonder and my fear my hands trembled so violently that I could scarce support myself where I rested with my full weight upon the sill I seemed now to be moving through the fevered phases of a nightmare Around and below me Cragmire Tower was profoundly silent but a faint odor of cookery was now perceptible Outside from the night came a faint whispering as of the distant sea but no moon and no stars relieved the impenetrable blackness Only out over the moor the mysterious light still danced and moved One two three four five minutes passed The light vanished and did not appear again Five more age long minutes elapsed in absolute silence whilst I peered into the darkness of the night and listened every nerve in my body tense for the return of Nayland Smith Yet two more minutes which embraced an agony of suspense passed in the same fashion then a shadowy form grew phantomesque out of the gloom a moment more and I distinctly heard the heavy breathing of a man nearly spent and saw my friend scrambling up toward the black embrasure in the tower His voice came huskily pantingly Creep along and lend me a hand Petrie I am nearly winded I crept through the window steadied my quivering nerves by an effort of the will and reached the end of the ledge in time to take Smith s extended hand and to draw him up beside me against the wall of the tower He was shaking with his exertions and must have fallen I think without my assistance Inside the room again Quick light the candles he breathed hoarsely Did any one come No one nothing Having expended several matches in vain for my fingers twitched nervously I ultimately succeeded in relighting the candles Get along to your room directed Smith Your apprehensions are unfounded at the moment but you may as well leave both doors wide open I looked into his face it was very drawn and grim and his brow was wet with perspiration but his eyes had the fighting glint and I knew that we were upon the eve of strange happenings CHAPTER XXIII A CRY ON THE MOOR Of the events intervening between this moment and that when death called to us out of the night I have the haziest recollections An excellent dinner was served in the bleak and gloomy dining room by the mulatto and the crippled author was carried to the head of the table by this same Herculean attendant as lightly as though he had but the weight of a child Van Roon talked continuously revealing a deep knowledge of all sorts of obscure matters and in the brief intervals Nayland Smith talked also with almost feverish rapidity Plans for the future were discussed I can recall no one of them I could not stifle my queer sentiments in regard to the mulatto and every time I found him behind my chair I was hard put to repress a shudder In this fashion the strange evening passed and to the accompaniment of distant muttering thunder we two guests retired to our chambers in Cragmire Tower Smith had contrived to give me my instructions in a whisper and five minutes after entering my own room I had snuffed the candles slipped a wedge which he had given me under the door crept out through the window onto the guttered ledge and joined Smith in his room He too had extinguished his candles and the place was in darkness As I climbed in he grasped my wrist to silence me and turned me forcibly toward the window Listen he said I turned and looked out upon a prospect which had been a fit setting for the witch scene in Macbeth Thunder clouds hung low over the moor but through them ran a sort of chasm or rift allowing a bar of lurid light to stretch across the drear from east to west a sort of lane walled by darkness There came a remote murmuring as of a troubled sea a hushed and distant chorus and sometimes in upon it broke the drums of heaven In the west lightning flickered though but faintly intermittently Then came the call Out of the blackness of the moor it came wild and distant Help help Smith I whispered what is it What mister Smith came the agonized cry Nayland Smith help for God s sake Quick Smith I cried quick man It s Van Roon he s been dragged out they are murdering him Nayland Smith held me in a vise like grip silent unmoved Louder and more agonized came the cry for aid and I became more than ever certain that it was poor Van Roon who uttered it mister Smith doctor Petrie for God s sake come or it will be too late Smith I said turning furiously upon my friend if you are going to remain here whilst murder is done I am not My blood boiled now with hot resentment It was incredible inhuman that we should remain there inert whilst a fellow man and our host to boot was being done to death out there in the darkness I exerted all my strength to break away but although my efforts told upon him as his loud breathing revealed Nayland Smith clung to me tenaciously Had my hands been free in my fury I could have struck him for the pitiable cries growing fainter now told their own tale Then Smith spoke shortly and angrily breathing hard between the words Be quiet you fool he snapped it s little less than an insult Petrie to think me capable of refusing help where help is needed Like a cold douche his words acted in that instant I knew myself a fool You remember the Call of Siva he said thrusting me away irritably two years ago and what it meant to those who obeyed it You might have told me Told you You would have been through the window before I had uttered two words I realized the truth of his assertion and the justness of his anger Forgive me old man I said very crestfallen but my impulse was a natural one you ll admit You must remember that I have been trained never to refuse aid when aid is asked Shut up Petrie he growled forget it The cries had ceased now entirely and a peal of thunder louder than any yet echoed over distant Sedgemoor The chasm of light splitting the heavens closed in leaving the night wholly black Don t talk rapped Smith act You wedged your door Yes Good Get into that cupboard have your Browning ready and keep the door very slightly ajar He was in that mood of repressed fever which I knew and which always communicated itself to me I spoke no further word but stepped into the wardrobe indicated and drew the door nearly shut The recess just accommodated me and through the aperture I could see the bed vaguely the open window and part of the opposite wall I saw Smith cross the floor as a mighty clap of thunder boomed over the house A gleam of lightning flickered through the gloom I saw the bed for a moment distinctly and it appeared to me that Smith lay therein with the sheets pulled up over his head The light was gone and I could hear big drops of rain pattering upon the leaden gutter below the open window My mood was strange detached and characterized by vagueness That Van Roon lay dead upon the moor I was convinced and although I recognized that it must be a sufficient one I could not even dimly divine the reason why we had refrained from lending him aid To have failed to save him knowing his peril would have been bad enough to have refused I thought was shameful Better to have shared his fate yet The downpour was increasing and beating now a regular tattoo upon the gutterway Then splitting the oblong of greater blackness which marked the casement quivered dazzlingly another flash of lightning in which I saw the bed again with that impression of Smith curled up in it The blinding light died out came the crash of thunder harsh and fearsome more imminently above the tower than ever The building seemed to shake Coming as they did horror and the wrath of heaven together suddenly crashingly black and angry after the fairness of the day these happenings and their setting must have terrorized the stoutest heart but somehow I seemed detached as I have said and set apart from the whirl of events a spectator Even when a vague yellow light crept across the room from the direction of the door and flickered unsteadily on the bed I remained unmoved to a certain degree although passively alive to the significance of the incident I realized that the ultimate issue was at hand but either because I was emotionally exhausted or from some other cause the pending climax failed to disturb me Going on tiptoe in stockinged feet across my field of vision passed Kegan Van Roon He was in his shirt sleeves and held a lighted candle in one hand whilst with the other he shaded it against the draught from the window He was a cripple no longer and the smoked glasses were discarded most of the light at the moment when first I saw him shone upon his thin olive face and at sight of his eyes much of the mystery of Cragmire Tower was resolved For they were oblique very slightly but nevertheless unmistakably oblique Though highly educated and possibly an American citizen Van Roon was a Chinaman Upon the picture of his face as I saw it then I do not care to dwell It lacked the unique horror of doctor Fu Manchu s unforgettable countenance but possessed a sort of animal malignancy which the latter lacked He approached within three or four feet of the bed peering peering Then with a timidity which spoke well for Nayland Smith s reputation paused and beckoned to some one who evidently stood in the doorway behind him As he did so I noted that the legs of his trousers were caked with greenish brown mud nearly up to the knees The huge mulatto silent footed crossed to the bed in three strides He was stripped to the waist and excepting some few professional athletes I had never seen a torso to compare with that which brown and glistening now bent over Nayland Smith The muscular development was simply enormous the man had a neck like a column and the thews around his back and shoulders were like ivy tentacles wreathing some gnarled oak Whilst Van Roon his evil gaze upon the bed held the candle aloft the mulatto with a curious preparatory writhing movement of the mighty shoulders lowered his outstretched fingers to the disordered bed linen I pushed open the cupboard door and thrust out the Browning As I did so a dramatic thing happened A tall gaunt figure shot suddenly upright from beyond the bed It was Nayland Smith Upraised in his hand he held a heavy walking cane I knew the handle to be leaded and I could judge of the force with which he wielded it by the fact that it cut the air with a keen swishing sound It descended upon the back of the mulatto s skull with a sickening thud and the great brown body dropped inert upon the padded bed in which not Smith but his grip reposed There was no word no cry Then Shoot Petrie Shoot the fiend Shoot Van Roon dropping the candle in the falling gleam of which I saw the whites of the oblique eyes turned and leaped from the room with the agility of a wild cat The ensuing darkness was split by a streak of lightning and there was Nayland Smith scrambling around the foot of the bed and making for the door in hot pursuit We gained it almost together Smith had dropped the cane and now held his pistol in his hand Together we fired into the chasm of the corridor and in the flash saw Van Roon hurling himself down the stairs He went silently in his stockinged feet and our own clatter was drowned by the awful booming of the thunder which now burst over us again Crack crack crack Three times our pistols spat venomously after the flying figure then we had crossed the hall below and were in the wilderness of the night with the rain descending upon us in sheets Vaguely I saw the white shirt sleeves of the fugitive near the corner of the stone fence A moment he hesitated then darted away inland not toward Saul but toward the moor and the cup of the inland bay Steady Petrie steady cried Nayland Smith He ran panting beside me It is the path to the mire He breathed sibilantly between every few words It was out there that he hoped to lure us with the cry for help A great blaze of lightning illuminated the landscape as far as the eye could see Ahead of us a flying shape hair lank and glistening in the downpour followed a faint path skirting that green tongue of morass which we had noted from the upland It was Kegan Van Roon He glanced over his shoulder showing a yellow terror stricken face We were gaining upon him Darkness fell and the thunder cracked and boomed as though the very moor were splitting about us Another fifty yards Petrie breathed Nayland Smith and after that it s unchartered ground On we went through the rain and the darkness then Slow up slow up cried Smith It feels soft Indeed already I had made one false step and the hungry mire had fastened upon my foot almost tripping me Lost the path We stopped dead The falling rain walled us in I dared not move for I knew that the mire the devouring mire stretched eager close about my feet We were both waiting for the next flash of lightning I think but before it came out of the darkness ahead of us rose a cry that sometimes rings in my ears to this hour Yet it was no more than a repetition of that which had called to us deathfully awhile before Help help for God s sake help Quick I am sinking Nayland Smith grasped my arm furiously We dare not move Petrie we dare not move he breathed It s God s justice visible for once Then came the lightning and ignoring a splitting crash behind us we both looked ahead over the mire Just on the edge of the venomous green path not thirty yards away I saw the head and shoulders and upstretched appealing arms of Van Roon Even as the lightning flickered and we saw him he was gone with one last long drawn out cry horribly like the mournful wail of a sea gull he was gone That eerie light died and in the instant before the sound of the thunder came shatteringly we turned about in time to see Cragmire Tower a blacker silhouette against the night topple and fall A red glow began to be perceptible above the building The thunder came booming through the caverns of space Nayland Smith lowered his wet face close to mine and shouted in my ear Kegan Van Roon never returned from China It was a trap Those were two creatures of doctor Fu Manchu The thunder died away hollowly echoing over the distant sea That light on the moor to night You have not learned the Morse Code Petrie It was a signal and it read S M I T H SOS Well I took the chance as you know And it was Karamaneh She knew of the plot to bury us in the mire She had followed from London but could do nothing until dusk God forgive me if I ve misjudged her for we owe her our lives to night Flames were bursting up from the building beside the ruin of the ancient tower which had faced the storms of countless ages only to succumb at last The lightning literally had cloven it in twain The mulatto Again the lightning flashed and we saw the path and began to retrace our steps Nayland Smith turned to me his face was very grim in that unearthly light and his eyes shone like steel I killed him Petrie as I meant to do From out over Sedgemoor it came cracking and rolling and booming toward us swelling in volume to a stupendous climax that awful laughter of Jove the destroyer of Cragmire Tower CHAPTER XXIV STORY OF THE GABLES In looking over my notes dealing with the second phase of doctor Fu Manchu s activities in England I find that one of the worst hours of my life was associated with the singular and seemingly inconsequent adventure of the fiery hand I shall deal with it in this place begging you to bear with me if I seem to digress Inspector Weymouth called one morning shortly after the Van Roon episode and entered upon a surprising account of a visit to a house at Hampstead which enjoyed the sinister reputation of being uninhabitable But in what way does the case enter into your province inquired Nayland Smith idly tapping out his pipe on a bar of the grate We had not long finished breakfast but from an early hour Smith had been at his eternal smoking which only the advent of the meal had interrupted Well replied the inspector who occupied a big armchair near the window I was sent to look into it I suppose because I had nothing better to do at the moment Ah jerked Smith glancing over his shoulder The ejaculation had a veiled significance for our quest of doctor Fu Manchu had come to an abrupt termination by reason of the fact that all trace of that malignant genius and of the group surrounding him had vanished with the destruction of Cragmire Tower The house is called the Gables continued the Scotland Yard man and I knew I was on a wild goose chase from the first Why snapped Smith Because I was there before six months ago or so just before your present return to England and I knew what to expect Smith looked up with some faint dawning of interest perceptible in his manner I was unaware he said with a slight smile that the cleaning up of haunted houses came within the jurisdiction of Scotland Yard I am learning something In the ordinary way replied the big man good humoredly it doesn t But a sudden death always excites suspicion and A sudden death I said glancing up you didn t explain that the ghost had killed any one I m afraid I m a poor hand at yarn spinning Doctor said Weymouth turning his blue twinkling eyes in my direction Two people have died at the Gables within the last six months You begin to interest me declared Smith and there came something of the old eager look into his gaunt face as having lighted his pipe he tossed the match end into the hearth I had hoped for some little excitement myself confessed the inspector This dead end with not a ghost of a clue to the whereabouts of the yellow fiend has been getting on my nerves Nayland Smith grunted sympathetically Although doctor Fu Manchu has been in England for some months now continued Weymouth I have never set eyes upon him the house we raided in Museum Street proved to be empty in a word I am wasting my time So that I volunteered to run up to Hampstead and look into the matter of the Gables principally as a distraction It s a queer business but more in the Psychical Research Society s line than mine I m afraid Still if there were no doctor Fu Manchu it might be of interest to you and to you doctor Petrie because it illustrates the fact that given the right sort of subject death can be brought about without any elaborate mechanism such as our Chinese friends employ You interest me more and more declared Smith stretching himself in the long white cane rest chair Two men both fairly sound except that the first one had an asthmatic heart have died at the Gables without any one laying a little finger upon them Oh there was no jugglery They weren t poisoned or bitten by venomous insects or suffocated or anything like that They just died of fear stark fear With my elbows resting upon the table cover and my chin in my hands I was listening attentively now and Nayland Smith a big cushion behind his head was watching the speaker with a keen and speculative look in those steely eyes of his You imply that doctor Fu Manchu has something to learn from the Gables he jerked Weymouth nodded stolidly I can t work up anything like amazement in these days continued the latter every other case seems stale and hackneyed alongside the case But I must confess that when the Gables came on the books of the Yard the second time I began to wonder I thought there might be some tangible clue some link connecting the two victims perhaps some evidence of robbery or of revenge of some sort of motive In short I hoped to find evidence of human agency at work but as before I was disappointed It s a legitimate case of a haunted house then said Smith Yes we find them occasionally these uninhabitable places where there is something something malignant and harmful to human life but something that you cannot arrest that you cannot hope to bring into court Ah replied Smith slowly I suppose you are right There are historic instances of course Glamys Castle and Spedlins Tower in Scotland Peel Castle Isle of Man with its Maudhe Dhug the gray lady of Rainham Hall the headless horses of Caistor the Wesley ghost of Epworth Rectory and others But I have never come in personal contact with such a case and if I did I should feel very humiliated to have to confess that there was any agency which could produce a physical result death but which was immune from physical retaliation Weymouth nodded his head again I might feel a bit sour about it too he replied if it were not that I haven t much pride left in these days considering the show of physical retaliation I have made against doctor Fu Manchu A home thrust Weymouth snapped Nayland Smith with one of those rare boyish laughs of his We re children to that Chinese doctor Inspector to that weird product of a weird people who are as old in evil as the pyramids are old in mystery But about the Gables Well it s an uncanny place You mentioned Glamys Castle a moment ago and it s possible to understand an old stronghold like that being haunted but the Gables was only built about eighteen seventy it s quite a modern house It was built for a wealthy Quaker family and they occupied it uninterruptedly and apparently without anything unusual occurring for over forty years Then it was sold to a mister Maddison and mister Maddison died there six months ago Maddison said Smith sharply staring across at Weymouth What was he Where did he come from He was a retired tea planter from Colombo replied the inspector Colombo There was a link with the East certainly if that s what you are thinking and it was this fact which interested me at the time and which led me to waste precious days and nights on the case But there was no mortal connection between this liverish individual and the schemes of doctor Fu Manchu I m certain of that And how did he die I asked interestedly He just died in his chair one evening in the room which he used as a library It was his custom to sit there every night when there were no visitors reading until twelve o clock or later He was a bachelor and his household consisted of a cook a housemaid and a man who had been with him for thirty years I believe At the time of mister Maddison s death his household had recently been deprived of two of its members The cook and housemaid both resigned one morning giving as their reason the fact that the place was haunted In what way I interviewed the precious pair at the time and they told me absurd and various tales about dark figures wandering along the corridors and bending over them in bed at night whispering but their chief trouble was a continuous ringing of bells about the house Bells They said that it became unbearable Night and day there were bells ringing all over the house At any rate they went and for three or four days the Gables was occupied only by mister Maddison and his man whose name was Stevens I interviewed the latter also and he was an altogether more reliable witness a decent steady sort of man whose story impressed me very much at the time Did he confirm the ringing He swore to it a sort of jangle sometimes up in the air near the ceilings and sometimes under the floor like the shaking of silver bells Nayland Smith stood up abruptly and began to pace the room leaving great trails of blue gray smoke behind him Your story is sufficiently interesting Inspector he declared even to divert my mind from the eternal contemplation of the Fu Manchu problem This would appear to be distinctly a case of an astral bell such as we sometimes hear of in India It was Stevens continued Weymouth who found mister Maddison He Stevens had been out on business connected with the household arrangements and at about eleven o clock he returned letting himself in with a key There was a light in the library and getting no response to his knocking Stevens entered He found his master sitting bolt upright in a chair clutching the arms with rigid fingers and staring straight before him with a look of such frightful horror on his face that Stevens positively ran from the room and out of the house mister Maddison was stone dead When a doctor who lives at no great distance away came and examined him he could find no trace of violence whatever he had apparently died of fright to judge from the expression on his face Anything else Only this I learnt indirectly that the last member of the Quaker family to occupy the house had apparently witnessed the apparition which had led to his vacating the place I got the story from the wife of a man who had been employed as gardener there at that time The apparition which he witnessed in the hallway if I remember rightly took the form of a sort of luminous hand clutching a long curved knife Oh Heavens cried Smith and laughed shortly that s quite in order This gentleman told no one of the occurrence until after he had left the house no doubt in order that the place should not acquire an evil reputation Most of the original furniture remained and mister Maddison took the house furnished I don t think there can be any doubt that what killed him was fear at seeing a repetition Of the fiery hand concluded Smith Quite so Well I examined the Gables pretty closely and with another Scotland Yard man spent a night in the empty house We saw nothing but once very faintly we heard the ringing of bells Smith spun around upon him rapidly You can swear to that he snapped I can swear to it declared Weymouth stolidly It seemed to be over our heads We were sitting in the dining room Then it was gone and we heard nothing more whatever of an unusual nature Following the death of mister Maddison the Gables remained empty until a while ago when a French gentleman name Lejay leased it Furnished Yes nothing was removed Who kept the place in order A married couple living in the neighborhood undertook to do so The man attended to the lawn and so forth and the woman came once a week I believe to clean up the house And Lejay He came in only last week having leased the house for six months His family were to have joined him in a day or two and he with the aid of the pair I have just mentioned and assisted by a French servant he brought over with him was putting the place in order At about twelve o clock on Friday night this servant ran into a neighboring house screaming the fiery hand and when at last a constable arrived and a frightened group went up the avenue of the Gables they found M Lejay dead in the avenue near the steps just outside the hall door He had the same face of horror What a tale for the press snapped Smith The owner has managed to keep it quiet so far but this time I think it will leak into the press yes There was a short silence then And you have been down to the Gables again I was there on Saturday but there s not a scrap of evidence The man undoubtedly died of fright in the same way as Maddison The place ought to be pulled down it s unholy Unholy is the word I said I never heard anything like it This M Lejay had no enemies there could be no possible motive None whatever He was a business man from Marseilles and his affairs necessitated his remaining in or near London for some considerable time therefore he decided to make his headquarters here temporarily and leased the Gables with that intention Nayland Smith was pacing the floor with increasing rapidity he was tugging at the lobe of his left ear and his pipe had long since gone out CHAPTER XXV THE BELLS I started to my feet as a tall bearded man swung open the door and hurled himself impetuously into the room He wore a silk hat which fitted him very ill and a black frock coat which did not fit him at all It s all right Petrie cried the apparition I ve leased the Gables It was Nayland Smith I stared at him in amazement The first time I have employed a disguise continued my friend rapidly since the memorable episode of the false pigtail He threw a small brown leather grip upon the floor In case you should care to visit the house Petrie I have brought these things My tenancy commences to night Two days had elapsed and I had entirely forgotten the strange story of the Gables which Inspector Weymouth had related to us evidently it was otherwise with my friend and utterly at a loss for an explanation of his singular behavior I stooped mechanically and opened the grip It contained an odd assortment of garments and amongst other things several gray wigs and a pair of gold rimmed spectacles Kneeling there with this strange litter about me I looked up amazedly Nayland Smith with the unsuitable silk hat set right upon the back of his head was pacing the room excitedly his fuming pipe protruding from the tangle of factitious beard You see Petrie he began again rapidly I did not entirely trust the agent I ve leased the house in the name of Professor Maxton But Smith I cried what possible reason can there be for disguise There s every reason he snapped Why should you interest yourself in the Gables Does no explanation occur to you None whatever to me the whole thing smacks of stark lunacy Then you won t come I ve never stuck at anything Smith I replied however undignified when it has seemed that my presence could be of the slightest use As I rose to my feet Smith stepped in front of me and the steely gray eyes shone out strangely from the altered face He clapped his hands upon my shoulders If I assure you that your presence is necessary to my safety he said that if you fail me I must seek another companion will you come Intuitively I knew that he was keeping something back and I was conscious of some resentment but nevertheless my reply was a foregone conclusion and with the borrowed appearance of an extremely untidy old man I crept guiltily out of my house that evening and into the cab which Smith had waiting The Gables was a roomy and rambling place lying back a considerable distance from the road A semicircular drive gave access to the door and so densely wooded was the ground that for the most part the drive was practically a tunnel a verdant tunnel A high brick wall concealed the building from the point of view of any one on the roadway but either horn of the crescent drive terminated at a heavy wrought iron gateway Smith discharged the cab at the corner of the narrow and winding road upon which the Gables fronted It was walled in on both sides on the left the wall being broken by tradesmen s entrances to the houses fronting upon another street and on the right following uninterruptedly the grounds of the Gables As we came to the gate Nothing now said Smith pointing into the darkness of the road before us except a couple of studios until one comes to the Heath He inserted the key in the lock of the gate and swung it creakingly open I looked into the black arch of the avenue thought of the haunted residence that lay hidden somewhere beyond of those who had died in it especially of the one who had died there under the trees and found myself out of love with the business of the night Come on said Nayland Smith briskly holding the gate open there should be a fire in the library and refreshments if the charwoman has followed instructions I heard the great gate clang to behind us Even had there been any moon and there was none I doubted if more than a patch or two of light could have penetrated there The darkness was extraordinary Nothing broke it and I think Smith must have found his way by the aid of some sixth sense At any rate I saw nothing of the house until I stood some five paces from the steps leading up to the porch A light was burning in the hallway but dimly and inhospitably of the facade of the building I could perceive little When we entered the hall and the door was closed behind us I began wondering anew what purpose my friend hoped to serve by a vigil in this haunted place There was a light in the library the door of which was ajar and on the large table were decanters a siphon and some biscuits and sandwiches A large grip stood upon the floor also For some reason which was a mystery to me Smith had decided that we must assume false names whilst under the roof of the Gables and Now Pearce he said a whisky and soda before we look around The proposal was welcome enough for I felt strangely dispirited and to tell the truth in my strange disguise not a little ridiculous All my nerves no doubt were highly strung and my sense of hearing unusually acute for I went in momentary expectation of some uncanny happening I had not long to wait As I raised the glass to my lips and glanced across the table at my friend I heard the first faint sound heralding the coming of the bells It did not seem to proceed from anywhere within the library but from some distant room far away overhead A musical sound it was but breaking in upon the silence of that ill omened house its music was the music of terror In a faint and very sweet cascade it rippled a ringing as of tiny silver bells I set down my glass upon the table and rising slowly from the chair in which I had been seated stared fixedly at my companion who was staring with equal fixity at me I could see that I had not been deluded Nayland Smith had heard the ringing too The ghosts waste no time he said softly This is not new to me I spent an hour here last night and heard the same sound I glanced hastily around the room It was furnished as a library and contained a considerable collection of works principally novels I was unable to judge of the outlook for the two lofty windows were draped with heavy purple curtains which were drawn close A silk shaded lamp swung from the center of the ceiling and immediately over the table by which I stood There was much shadow about the room and now I glanced apprehensively about me but especially toward the open door In that breathless suspense of listening we stood awhile then There it is again whispered Smith tensely The ringing of bells was repeated and seemingly much nearer to us in fact it appeared to come from somewhere above up near the ceiling of the room in which we stood Simultaneously we looked up then Smith laughed shortly Instinctive I suppose he snapped but what do we expect to see in the air The musical sound now grew in volume the first tiny peal seemed to be reinforced by others and by others again until the air around about us was filled with the pealings of these invisible bell ringers Although as I have said the sound was rather musical than horrible it was on the other hand so utterly unaccountable as to touch the supreme heights of the uncanny I could not doubt that our presence had attracted these unseen ringers to the room in which we stood and I knew quite well that I was growing pale This was the room in which at least one unhappy occupant of the Gables had died of fear I recognized the fact that if this mere overture were going to affect my nerves to such an extent I could not hope to survive the ordeal of the night a great effort was called for I emptied my glass at a gulp and stared across the table at Nayland Smith with a sort of defiance He was standing very upright and motionless but his eyes were turning right and left searching every visible corner of the big room Good he said in a very low voice The terrorizing power of the Unknown is boundless but we must not get in the grip of panic or we could not hope to remain in this house ten minutes I nodded without speaking Then Smith to my amazement suddenly began to speak in a loud voice a marked contrast to that almost a whisper in which he had spoken formerly My dear Pearce he cried do you hear the ringing of bells Clearly the latter words were spoken for the benefit of the unseen intelligence controlling these manifestations and although I regarded such finesse as somewhat wasted I followed my friend s lead and replied in a voice as loud as his own Distinctly Professor Silence followed my words a silence in which both stood watchful and listening Then very faintly I seemed to detect the silvern ringing receding away through distant rooms Finally it became inaudible and in the stillness of the Gables I could distinctly hear my companion breathing For fully ten minutes we two remained thus each momentarily expecting a repetition of the ringing or the coming of some new and more sinister manifestation But we heard nothing and saw nothing Hand me that grip and don t stir until I come back hissed Smith in my ear He turned and walked out of the library his boots creaking very loudly in that awe inspiring silence Standing beside the table I watched the open door for his return crushing down a dread that another form than his might suddenly appear there I could hear him moving from room to room and presently as I waited in hushed tense watchfulness he came in depositing the grip upon the table His eyes were gleaming feverishly The house is haunted Pearce he cried But no ghost ever frightened me Come I will show you your room CHAPTER XXVI THE FIERY HAND Smith walked ahead of me upstairs he had snapped up the light in the hallway and now he turned and cried back loudly I fear we should never get servants to stay here Again I detected the appeal to a hidden Audience and there was something very uncanny in the idea The house now was deathly still the ringing had entirely subsided In the upper corridor my companion who seemed to be well acquainted with the position of the switches again turned up all the lights and in pursuit of the strange comedy which he saw fit to enact addressed me continuously in the loud and unnatural voice which he had adopted as part of his disguise We looked into a number of rooms all well and comfortably furnished but although my imagination may have been responsible for the idea they all seemed to possess a chilly and repellent atmosphere I felt that to essay sleep in any one of them would be the merest farce that the place to all intents and purposes was uninhabitable that something incalculably evil presided over the house And through it all so obtuse was I that no glimmer of the truth entered my mind Outside again in the long brightly lighted corridor we stood for a moment as if a mutual anticipation of some new event pending had come to us It was curious that sudden pulling up and silent questioning of one another because although we acted thus no sound had reached us A few seconds later our anticipation was realized From the direction of the stairs it came a low wailing in a woman s voice and the sweetness of the tones added to the terror of the sound I clutched at Smith s arm convulsively whilst that uncanny cry rose and fell rose and fell and died away Neither of us moved immediately My mind was working with feverish rapidity and seeking to run down a memory which the sound had stirred into faint quickness My heart was still leaping wildly when the wailing began again rising and falling in regular cadence At that instant I identified it During the time Smith and I had spent together in Egypt two years before searching for Karamaneh I had found myself on one occasion in the neighborhood of a native cemetery near to Bedrasheen Now the scene which I had witnessed there rose up again vividly before me and I seemed to see a little group of black robed women clustered together about a native grave for the wailing which now was dying away again in the Gables was the same or almost the same as the wailing of those Egyptian mourners The house was very silent again now My forehead was damp with perspiration and I became more and more convinced that the uncanny ordeal must prove too much for my nerves Hitherto I had accorded little credence to tales of the supernatural but face to face with such manifestations as these I realized that I would have faced rather a group of armed dacoits nay doctor Fu Manchu himself than have remained another hour in that ill omened house My companion must have read as much in my face But he kept up the strange and to me purposeless comedy when presently he spoke I feel it to be incumbent upon me to suggest he said that we spend the night at a hotel after all He walked rapidly downstairs and into the library and began to strap up the grip After all he said there may be a natural explanation of what we ve heard for it is noteworthy that we have actually seen nothing It might even be possible to get used to the ringing and the wailing after a time Frankly I am loath to go back on my bargain Whilst I stared at him in amazement he stood there indeterminate as it seemed Then Come Pearce he cried loudly I can see that you do not share my views but for my own part I shall return to morrow and devote further attention to the phenomena Extinguishing the light he walked out into the hallway carrying the grip in his hand I was not far behind him We walked toward the door together and Turn the light out Pearce directed Smith the switch is at your elbow We can see our way to the door well enough now In order to carry out these instructions it became necessary for me to remain a few paces in the rear of my companion and I think I have never experienced such a pang of nameless terror as pierced me at the moment of extinguishing the light for Smith had not yet opened the door and the utter darkness of the Gables was horrible beyond expression Surely darkness is the most potent weapon of the Unknown I know that at the moment my hand left the switch I made for the door as though the hosts of hell pursued me I collided violently with Smith He was evidently facing toward me in the darkness for at the moment of our collision he grasped my shoulder as in a vise My God Petrie look behind you he whispered I was enabled to judge of the extent and reality of his fear by the fact that the strange subterfuge of addressing me always as Pearce was forgotten I turned in a flash Never can I forget what I saw Many strange and terrible memories are mine memories stranger and more terrible than those of the average man but this thing which now moved slowly down upon us through the impenetrable gloom of that haunted place was if the term be understood almost absurdly horrible It was a medieval legend come to life in modern London it was as though some horrible chimera of the black and ignorant past was become create and potent in the present A luminous hand a hand in the veins of which fire seemed to run so that the texture of the skin and the shape of the bones within were perceptible in short a hand of glowing fiery flesh clutching a short knife or dagger which also glowed with the same hellish internal luminance was advancing upon us where we stood was not three paces removed What I did or how I came to do it I can never recall In all my years I have experienced nothing to equal the stark panic which seized upon me then I know that I uttered a loud and frenzied cry I know that I tore myself like a madman from Smith s restraining grip Don t touch it Keep away for your life I heard But dimly I recollect that finding the thing approaching yet nearer I lashed out with my fists madly blindly and struck something palpable What was the result I cannot say At that point my recollections merge into confusion Something or some one Smith as I afterwards discovered was hauling me by main force through the darkness I fell a considerable distance onto gravel which lacerated my hands and gashed my knees Then with the cool night air fanning my brow I was running running my breath coming in hysterical sobs Beside me fled another figure And my definite recollections commence again at that point For this companion of my flight from the Gables threw himself roughly against me to alter my course Not that way not that way came pantingly Not on to the Heath we must keep to the roads It was Nayland Smith That healing realization came to me bringing such a gladness as no words of mine can express nor convey Still we ran on There s a policeman s lantern panted my companion They ll attempt nothing now I gulped down the stiff brandy and soda then glanced across to where Nayland Smith lay extended in the long cane chair Perhaps you will explain I said for what purpose you submitted me to that ordeal If you proposed to correct my skepticism concerning supernatural manifestations you have succeeded Yes said my companion musingly they are devilishly clever but we knew that already I stared at him fatuously Have you ever known me to waste my time when there was important work to do he continued Do you seriously believe that my ghost hunting was undertaken for amusement Really Petrie although you are very fond of assuring me that I need a holiday I think the shoe is on the other foot From the pocket of his dressing gown he took out a piece of silk fringe which had apparently been torn from a scarf and rolling it into a ball tossed it across to me Smell he snapped I did as he directed and gave a great start The silk exhaled a faint perfume but its effect upon me was as though some one had cried aloud Karamaneh Beyond doubt the silken fragment had belonged to the beautiful servant of doctor Fu Manchu to the dark eyed seductive Karamaneh Nayland Smith was watching me keenly You recognize it yes I placed the piece of silk upon the table slightly shrugging my shoulders It was sufficient evidence in itself continued my friend but I thought it better to seek confirmation and the obvious way was to pose as a new lessee of the Gables But Smith I began Let me explain Petrie The history of the Gables seemed to be susceptible of only one explanation in short it was fairly evident to me that the object of the manifestations was to insure the place being kept empty This idea suggested another and with them both in mind I set out to make my inquiries first taking the precaution to disguise my identity to which end Weymouth gave me the freedom of Scotland Yard s fancy wardrobe I did not take the agent into my confidence but posed as a stranger who had heard that the house was to let furnished and thought it might suit his purpose My inquiries were directed to a particular end but I failed to achieve it at the time I had theories as I have said and when having paid the deposit and secured possession of the keys I was enabled to visit the place alone I was fortunate enough to obtain evidence to show that my imagination had not misled me You were very curious the other morning I recall respecting my object in borrowing a large brace and bit My object Petrie was to bore a series of holes in the wainscoating of various rooms at the Gables in inconspicuous positions of course But my dear Smith I cried you are merely adding to my mystification He stood up and began to pace the room in his restless fashion I had cross examined Weymouth closely regarding the phenomenon of the bell ringing and an exhaustive search of the premises led to the discovery that the house was in such excellent condition that from ground floor to attic there was not a solitary crevice large enough to admit of the passage of a mouse I suppose I must have been staring very foolishly indeed for Nayland Smith burst into one of his sudden laughs A mouse I said Petrie he cried With the brace and bit I rectified that matter I made the holes I have mentioned and before each set a trap baited with a piece of succulent toasted cheese Just open that grip The light at last was dawning upon my mental darkness and I pounced upon the grip which stood upon a chair near the window and opened it A sickly smell of cooked cheese assailed my nostrils Mind your fingers cried Smith some of them are still set possibly Out from the grip I began to take mouse traps Two or three of them were still set but in the case of the greater number the catches had slipped Nine I took out and placed upon the table and all were empty In the tenth there crouched panting its soft furry body dank with perspiration a little white mouse Only one capture cried my companion showing how well fed the creatures were Examine his tail But already I had perceived that to which Smith would draw my attention and the mystery of the astral bells was a mystery no longer Bound to the little creature s tail close to the root with fine soft wire such as is used for making up bouquets were three tiny silver bells I looked across at my companion in speechless surprise Almost childish is it not he said yet by means of this simple device the Gables has been emptied of occupant after occupant There was small chance of the trick being detected for as I have said there was absolutely no aperture from roof to basement by means of which one of them could have escaped into the building Then They were admitted into the wall cavities and the rafters from some cellar underneath Petrie to which after a brief scamper under the floors and over the ceilings they instinctively returned for the food they were accustomed to receive and for which even had it been possible which it was not they had no occasion to forage I too stood up for excitement was growing within me I took up the piece of silk from the table Where did you find this I asked my eyes upon Smith s keen face In a sort of wine cellar Petrie he replied under the stair There is no cellar proper to the Gables at least no such cellar appears in the plans But But there is one beyond doubt yes It must be part of some older building which occupied the site before the Gables was built One can only surmise that it exists although such a surmise is a fairly safe one and the entrance to the subterranean portion of the building is situated beyond doubt in the wine cellar Of this we have at least two evidences the finding of the fragment of silk there and the fact that in one case at least as I learned the light was extinguished in the library unaccountably This could only have been done in one way by manipulating the main switch which is also in the wine cellar But Smith I cried do you mean that Fu Manchu Nayland Smith turned in his promenade of the floor and stared into my eyes I mean that doctor Fu Manchu has had a hiding place under the Gables for an indefinite period he replied I always suspected that a man of his genius would have a second retreat prepared for him anticipating the event of the first being discovered Oh I don t doubt it The place probably is extensive and I am almost certain though the point has to be confirmed that there is another entrance from the studio further along the road We know now why our recent searchings in the East End have proved futile why the house in Museum Street was deserted he has been lying low in this burrow at Hampstead But the hand Smith the luminous hand Nayland Smith laughed shortly Your superstitious fears overcame you to such an extent Petrie and I don t wonder at it the sight was a ghastly one that probably you don t remember what occurred when you struck out at that same ghostly hand I seemed to hit something That was why we ran But I think our retreat had all the appearance of a rout as I intended that it should Pardon my playing upon your very natural fears old man but you could not have simulated panic half so naturally And if they had suspected that the device was discovered we might never have quitted the Gables alive It was touch and go for a moment But Turn out the light snapped my companion Wondering greatly I did as he desired I turned out the light and in the darkness of my own study I saw a fiery fist being shaken at me threateningly The bones were distinctly visible and the luminosity of the flesh was truly ghastly Turn on the light again cried Smith Deeply mystified I did so and my friend tossed a little electric pocket lamp on to the writing table They used merely a small electric lamp fitted into the handle of a glass dagger he said with a sort of contempt It was very effective but the luminous hand is a phenomenon producible by any one who possesses an electric torch The Gables will be watched At last Petrie I think we have Fu Manchu in his own trap CHAPTER XXVII THE NIGHT OF THE RAID Dash it all Petrie cried Smith this is most annoying The bell was ringing furiously although midnight was long past Whom could my late visitor be Almost certainly this ringing portended an urgent case In other words I was not fated to take part in what I anticipated would prove to be the closing scene of the Fu Manchu drama Every one is in bed I said ruefully and how can I possibly see a patient in this costume Smith and I were both arrayed in rough tweeds and anticipating the labors before us had dispensed with collars and wore soft mufflers It was hard to be called upon to face a professional interview dressed thus and having a big tweed cap pulled down over my eyes Across the writing table we confronted one another in dismayed silence whilst below the bell sent up its ceaseless clangor It has to be done Smith I said regretfully Almost certainly it means a journey and probably an absence of some hours I threw my cap upon the table turned up my coat to hide the absence of collar and started for the door My last sight of Smith showed him standing looking after me tugging at the lobe of his ear and clicking his teeth together with suppressed irritability I stumbled down the dark stairs along the hall and opened the front door Vaguely visible in the light of a street lamp which stood at no great distance away I saw a slender man of medium height confronting me From the shadowed face two large and luminous eyes looked out into mine My visitor who despite the warmth of the evening wore a heavy greatcoat was an Oriental I drew back apprehensively then Ah doctor Petrie he said in a softly musical voice which made me start again to God be all praise that I have found you Some emotion which at present I could not define was stirring within me Where had I seen this graceful Eastern youth before Where had I heard that soft voice Do you wish to see me professionally I asked yet even as I put the question I seemed to know it unnecessary So you know me no more said the stranger and his teeth gleamed in a slight smile Heavens I knew now what had struck that vibrant chord within me The voice though infinitely deeper yet had an unmistakable resemblance to the dulcet tones of Karamaneh of Karamaneh whose eyes haunted my dreams whose beauty had done much to embitter my years The Oriental youth stepped forward with outstretched hand So you know me no more he repeated but I know you and give praise to Allah that I have found you I stepped back pressed the electric switch and turned with leaping heart to look into the face of my visitor It was a face of the purest Greek beauty a face that might have served as a model for Praxiteles the skin had a golden pallor which with the crisp black hair and magnetic yet velvety eyes suggested to my fancy that this was the young Antinious risen from the Nile whose wraith now appeared to me out of the night I stifled a cry of surprise not unmingled with gladness It was Aziz the brother of Karamaneh Never could the entrance of a figure upon the stage of a drama have been more dramatic than the coming of Aziz upon this night of all nights I seized the outstretched hand and drew him forward then reclosed the door and stood before him a moment in doubt A vaguely troubled look momentarily crossed the handsome face with the Oriental s unerring instinct he had detected the reserve of my greeting Yet when I thought of the treachery of Karamaneh when I remember how she whom we had befriended whom we had rescued from the house of Fu Manchu now had turned like the beautiful viper that she was to strike at the hand that caressed her when I thought how to night we were set upon raiding the place where the evil Chinese doctor lurked in hiding were set upon the arrest of that malignant genius and of all his creatures Karamaneh amongst them is it strange that I hesitated Yet again when I thought of my last meeting with her and of how twice she had risked her life to save me So avoiding the gaze of the lad I took his arm and in silence we two ascended the stairs and entered my study where Nayland Smith stood bolt upright beside the table his steely eyes fixed upon the face of the new arrival No look of recognition crossed the bronzed features and Aziz who had started forward with outstretched hands fell back a step and looked pathetically from me to Nayland Smith and from the grim commissioner back again to me The appeal in the velvet eyes was more than I could tolerate unmoved Smith I said shortly you remember Aziz Not a muscle visibly moved in Smith s face as he snapped back I remember him perfectly He has come I think to seek our assistance Yes yes cried Aziz laying his hand upon my arm with a gesture painfully reminiscent of Karamaneh I came only to night to London Oh my gentlemen I have searched and searched and searched until I am weary Often I have wished to die And then at last I come to Rangoon To Rangoon snapped Smith still with the gray eyes fixed almost fiercely upon the lad s face To Rangoon yes and there I heard news at last I hear that you have seen her have seen Karamaneh that you are back in London He was not entirely at home with his English I know then that she must be here too I ask them everywhere and they answer yes Oh Smith Pasha he stepped forward and impulsively seized both Smith s hands You know where she is take me to her Smith s face was a study in perplexity now In the past we had befriended the young Aziz and it was hard to look upon him in the light of an enemy Yet had we not equally befriended his sister and she At last Smith glanced across at me where I stood just within the doorway What do you make of it Petrie he said harshly Personally I take it to mean that our plans have leaked out He sprang suddenly back from Aziz and I saw his glance traveling rapidly over the slight figure as if in quest of concealed arms I take it to be a trap A moment he stood so regarding him and despite my well grounded distrust of the Oriental character I could have sworn that the expression of pained surprise upon the youth s face was not simulated but real Even Smith I think began to share my view for suddenly he threw himself into the white cane rest chair and still fixedly regarding Aziz Perhaps I have wronged you he said If I have you shall know the reason presently Tell your own story There was a pathetic humidity in the velvet eyes of Aziz eyes so like those others that were ever looking into mine in dreams as glancing from Smith to me he began hands outstretched characteristically palms upward and fingers curling to tell in broken English the story of his search for Karamaneh It was Fu Manchu my kind gentlemen it was the hakim who is really not a man at all but an efreet He found us again less than four days after you had left us Smith Pasha He found us in Cairo and to Karamaneh he made the forgetting of all things even of me even of me Nayland Smith snapped his teeth together sharply then What do you mean by that he demanded For my own part I understood well enough remembering how the brilliant Chinese doctor once had performed such an operation as this upon poor Inspector Weymouth how by means of an injection of some serum prepared as Karamaneh afterwards told us from the venom of a swamp adder or similar reptile he had induced amnesia or complete loss of memory I felt every drop of blood recede from my cheeks Smith I began Let him speak for himself interrupted my friend sharply They tried to take us both continued Aziz still speaking in that soft melodious manner but with deep seriousness I escaped I who am swift of foot hoping to bring help He shook his head sadly But except the All Powerful who is so powerful as the Hakim Fu Manchu I hid my gentlemen and watched and waited one two three weeks At last I saw her again my sister Karamaneh but ah she did not know me did not know me Aziz her brother She was in an arabeeyeh and passed me quickly along the Sharia en Nahhasin I ran and ran and ran crying her name but although she looked back she did not know me she did not know me I felt that I was dying and presently I fell upon the steps of the Mosque of Abu He dropped the expressive hands wearily to his sides and sank his chin upon his breast And then I said huskily for my heart was fluttering like a captive bird Alas from that day to this I see her no more my gentlemen I travel not only in Egypt but near and far and still I see her no more until in Rangoon I hear that which brings me to England again he extended his palms naively and here I am Smith Pasha Smith sprang upright again and turned to me Either I am growing over credulous he said or Aziz speaks the truth But he held up his hand you can tell me all that at some other time Petrie We must take no chances Sergeant Carter is downstairs with the cab you might ask him to step up He and Aziz can remain here until our return CHAPTER XXVIII THE SAMURAI S SWORD The muffled drumming of sleepless London seemed very remote from us as side by side we crept up the narrow path to the studio This was a starry but moonless night and the little dingy white building with a solitary tree peeping in silhouette above the glazed roof bore an odd resemblance to one of those tombs which form a city of the dead so near to the city of feverish life on the slopes of the Mokattam Hills This line of reflection proved unpleasant and I dismissed it sternly from my mind The shriek of a train whistle reached me a sound which breaks the stillness of the most silent London night telling of the ceaseless febrile life of the great world capital whose activity ceases not with the coming of darkness Around and about us a very great stillness reigned however and the velvet dusk which with the star jeweled sky was strongly suggestive of an Eastern night gave up no sign to show that it masked the presence of more than twenty men Some distance away on our right was the Gables that sinister and deserted mansion which we assumed and with good reason to be nothing less than the gateway to the subterranean abode of doctor Fu Manchu before us was the studio which if Nayland Smith s deductions were accurate concealed a second entrance to the same mysterious dwelling As my friend glancing cautiously all about him inserted the key in the lock an owl hooted dismally almost immediately above our heads I caught my breath sharply for it might be a signal but looking upward I saw a great black shape float slantingly from the tree beyond the studio into the coppice on the right which hemmed in the Gables Silently the owl winged its uncanny flight into the greater darkness of the trees and was gone Smith opened the door and we stepped into the studio Our plans had been well considered and in accordance with these I now moved up beside my friend who was dimly perceptible to me in the starlight which found access through the glass roof and pressed the catch of my electric pocket lamp I suppose that by virtue of my self imposed duty as chronicler of the deeds of doctor Fu Manchu the greatest and most evil genius whom the later centuries have produced the man who dreamt of an universal Yellow Empire I should have acquired a certain facility in describing bizarre happenings But I confess that it fails me now as I attempt in cold English to portray my emotions when the white beam from the little lamp cut through the darkness of the studio and shone fully upon the beautiful face of Karamaneh Less than six feet away from me she stood arrayed in the gauzy dress of the harem her fingers and slim white arms laden with barbaric jewelry The light wavered in my suddenly nerveless hand gleaming momentarily upon bare ankles and golden anklets upon little red leather shoes I spoke no word and Smith was as silent as I both of us I think were speechless rather from amazement than in obedience to the evident wishes of Fu Manchu s slave girl Yet I have only to close my eyes at this moment to see her as she stood one finger raised to her lips enjoining us to silence She looked ghastly pale in the light of the lamp but so lovely that my rebellious heart threatened already to make a fool of me So we stood in that untidy studio with canvases and easels heaped against the wall and with all sorts of litter about us a trio strangely met and one to have amused the high gods watching through the windows of the stars Go back came in a whisper from Karamaneh I saw the red lips moving and read a dreadful horror in the widely opened eyes in those eyes like pools of mystery to taunt the thirsty soul The world of realities was slipping past me I seemed to be losing my hold on things actual I had built up an Eastern palace about myself and Karamaneh wherein the world shut out I might pass the hours in reading the mystery of those dark eyes Nayland Smith brought me sharply to my senses Steady with the light Petrie he hissed in my ear My skepticism has been shaken to night but I am taking no chances He moved from my side and forward toward that lovely unreal figure which stood immediately before the model s throne and its background of plush curtains Karamaneh started forward to meet him suppressing a little cry whose real anguish could not have been simulated Go back go back she whispered urgently and thrust out her hands against Smith s breast For God s sake go back I have risked my life to come here to night He knows and is ready The words were spoken with passionate intensity and Nayland Smith hesitated To my nostrils was wafted that faint delightful perfume which since one night two years ago it had come to disturb my senses had taunted me many times as the mirage taunts the parched Sahara traveler I took a step forward Don t move snapped Smith Karamaneh clutched frenziedly at the lapels of his coat Listen to me she said beseechingly and stamped one little foot upon the floor listen to me You are a clever man but you know nothing of a woman s heart nothing nothing if seeing me hearing me knowing as you do know I risk you can doubt that I speak the truth And I tell you that it is death to go behind those curtains that he That s what I wanted to know snapped Smith His voice quivered with excitement Suddenly grasping Karamaneh by the waist he lifted her and set her aside then in three bounds he was on to the model s throne and had torn the Plush curtains bodily from their fastenings How it occurred I cannot hope to make dear for here my recollections merge into a chaos I know that Smith seemed to topple forward amid the purple billows of velvet and his muffled cry came to me Petrie My God Petrie The pale face of Karamaneh looked up into mine and her hands were clutching me but the glamour of her personality had lost its hold for I knew heavens how poignantly it struck home to me that Nayland Smith was gone to his death What I hoped to achieve I know not but hurling the trembling girl aside I snatched the Browning pistol from my coat pocket and with the ray of the lamp directed upon the purple mound of velvet I leaped forward I think I realized that the curtains had masked a collapsible trap a sheer pit of blackness an instant before I was precipitated into it but certainly the knowledge came too late With the sound of a soft shuddering cry in my ears I fell dropping lamp and pistol and clutching at the fallen hangings But they offered me no support My head seemed to be bursting I could utter only a hoarse groan as I fell fell fell When my mind began to work again in returning consciousness I found it to be laden with reproach How often in the past had we blindly hurled ourselves into just such a trap as this Should we never learn that where Fu Manchu was impetuosity must prove fatal On two distinct occasions in the past we had been made the victims of this device yet even although we had had practically conclusive evidence that this studio was used by doctor Fu Manchu we had relied upon its floor being as secure as that of any other studio we had failed to sound every foot of it ere trusting our weight to its support There is such a divine simplicity in the English mind that one may lay one s plans with mathematical precision and rely upon the Nayland Smiths and doctor Petries to play their allotted parts Excepting two faithful followers my friends are long since departed But here in these vaults which time has overlooked and which are as secret and as serviceable to day as they were two hundred years ago I wait patiently with my trap set like the spider for the fly To the sound of that taunting voice I opened my eyes As I did so I strove to spring upright only to realize that I was tied fast to a heavy ebony chair inlaid with ivory and attached by means of two iron brackets to the floor Even children learn from experience continued the unforgettable voice alternately guttural and sibilant but always as deliberate as though the speaker were choosing with care words which should perfectly clothe his thoughts For a burnt child fears the fire says your English adage But mister Commissioner Nayland Smith who enjoys the confidence of the India Office and who is empowered to control the movements of the Criminal Investigation Department learns nothing from experience He is less than a child since he has twice rashly precipitated himself into a chamber charged with an anesthetic prepared by a process of my own from the lycoperdon or Common Puff ball I became fully master of my senses and I became fully alive to a stupendous fact At last it was ended we were utterly in the power of doctor Fu Manchu our race was run I sat in a low vaulted room The roof was of ancient brickwork but the walls were draped with exquisite Chinese fabric having a green ground whereon was a design representing a grotesque procession of white peacocks A green carpet covered the floor and the whole of the furniture was of the same material as the chair to which I was strapped viz ebony inlaid with ivory This furniture was scanty There was a heavy table in one corner of the dungeonesque place on which were a number of books and papers Before this table was a high backed heavily carven chair A smaller table stood upon the right of the only visible opening a low door partially draped with bead work curtains above which hung a silver lamp On this smaller table a stick of incense in a silver holder sent up a pencil of vapor into the air and the chamber was loaded with the sickly sweet fumes A faint haze from the incense stick hovered up under the roof In the high backed chair sat doctor Fu Manchu wearing a green robe upon which was embroidered a design the subject of which at first glance was not perceptible but which presently I made out to be a huge white peacock He wore a little cap perched upon the dome of his amazing skull and with one clawish hand resting upon the ebony of the table he sat slightly turned toward me his emotionless face a mask of incredible evil In spite of or because of the high intellect written upon it the face of doctor Fu Manchu was more utterly repellent than any I have ever known and the green eyes eyes green as those of a cat in the darkness which sometimes burned like witch lamps and sometimes were horribly filmed like nothing human or imaginable might have mirrored not a soul but an emanation of hell incarnate in this gaunt high shouldered body Stretched flat upon the floor lay Nayland Smith partially stripped his arms thrown back over his head and his wrists chained to a stout iron staple attached to the wall he was fully conscious and staring intently at the Chinese doctor His bare ankles also were manacled and fixed to a second chain which quivered tautly across the green carpet and passed out through the doorway being attached to something beyond the curtain and invisible to me from where I sat Fu Manchu was now silent I could hear Smith s heavy breathing and hear my watch ticking in my pocket I suddenly realized that although my body was lashed to the ebony chair my hands and arms were free Next looking dazedly about me my attention was drawn to a heavy sword which stood hilt upward against the wall within reach of my hand It was a magnificent piece of Japanese workmanship a long curved Damascened blade having a double handed hilt of steel inlaid with gold and resembling fine Kuft work A host of possibilities swept through my mind Then I perceived that the sword was attached to the wall by a thin steel chain some five feet in length Even if you had the dexterity of a Mexican knife thrower came the guttural voice of Fu Manchu you would be unable to reach me dear doctor Petrie The Chinaman had read my thoughts Smith turned his eyes upon me momentarily only to look away again in the direction of Fu Manchu My friend s face was slightly pale beneath the tan and his jaw muscles stood out with unusual prominence By this fact alone did he reveal his knowledge that he lay at the mercy of this enemy of the white race of this inhuman being who himself knew no mercy of this man whose very genius was inspired by the cool calculated cruelty of his race of that race which to this day disposes of hundreds nay thousands of its unwanted girl children by the simple measure of throwing them down a well specially dedicated to the purpose The weapon near your hand continued the Chinaman imperturbably is a product of the civilization of our near neighbors the Japanese a race to whose courage I prostrate myself in meekness It is the sword of a samurai doctor Petrie It is of very great age and was until an unfortunate misunderstanding with myself led to the extinction of the family a treasured possession of a noble Japanese house The soft voice into which an occasional sibilance crept but which never rose above a cool monotone gradually was lashing me into fury and I could see the muscles moving in Smith s jaws as he convulsively clenched his teeth whereby I knew that impotent he burned with a rage at least as great as mine But I did not speak and did not move The ancient tradition of seppuku continued the Chinaman or hara kiri still rules as you know in the great families of Japan There is a sacred ritual and the samurai who dedicates himself to this honorable end must follow strictly the ritual As a physician the exact nature of the ceremony might possibly interest you doctor Petrie but a technical account of the two incisions which the sacrificant employs in his self dismissal might on the other hand bore mister Nayland Smith Therefore I will merely enlighten you upon one little point a minor one but interesting to the student of human nature In short even a samurai and no braver race has ever honored the world sometimes hesitates to complete the operation The weapon near to your hand my dear doctor Petrie is known as the Friend s Sword On such occasions as we are discussing a trusty friend is given the post an honored one of standing behind the brave man who offers himself to his gods and should the latter s courage momentarily fail him the friend with the trusty blade to which now I especially direct your attention diverts the hierophant s mind from his digression and rectifies his temporary breach of etiquette by severing the cervical vertebrae of the spinal column with the friendly blade which you can reach quite easily doctor Petrie if you care to extend your hand Some dim perceptions of the truth was beginning to creep into my mind When I say a perception of the truth I mean rather of some part of the purpose of doctor Fu Manchu of the whole horrible truth of the scheme which had been conceived by that mighty evil man I had no glimmering but I foresaw that a frightful ordeal was before us both That I hold you in high esteem continued Fu Manchu is a fact which must be apparent to you by this time but in regard to your companion I entertain very different sentiments Always underlying the deliberate calm of the speaker sometimes showing itself in an unusually deep guttural sometimes in an unusually serpentine sibilance lurked the frenzy of hatred which in the past had revealed itself occasionally in wild outbursts Momentarily I expected such an outburst now but it did not come One quality possessed by mister Nayland Smith resumed the Chinaman I admire I refer to his courage I would wish that so courageous a man should seek his own end should voluntarily efface himself from the path of that world movement which he is powerless to check In short I would have him show himself a samurai Always his friend you shall remain so to the end doctor Petrie I have arranged for this He struck lightly a little silver gong dependent from the corner of the table whereupon from the curtained doorway there entered a short thickly built Burman whom I recognized for a dacoit He wore a shoddy blue suit which had been made for a much larger man but these things claimed little of my attention which automatically was directed to the load beneath which the Burman labored Upon his back he carried a sort of wire box rather less than six feet long some two feet high and about two feet wide In short it was a stout framework covered with fine wire netting on the top sides and ends but being open at the bottom It seemed to be made in five sections or to contain four sliding partitions which could be raised or lowered at will These were of wood and in the bottom of each was cut a little arch The arches in the four partitions varied in size so that whereas the first was not more than five inches high the fourth opened almost to the wire roof of the box or cage and a fifth which was but little higher than the first was cut in the actual end of the contrivance So intent was I upon this device the purpose of which I was wholly unable to divine that I directed the whole of my attention upon it Then as the Burman paused in the doorway resting a corner of the cage upon the brilliant carpet I glanced toward Fu Manchu He was watching Nayland Smith and revealing his irregular yellow teeth the teeth of an opium smoker in the awful mirthless smile which I knew God whispered Smith the Six Gates The knowledge of my beautiful country serves you well replied Fu Manchu gently Instantly I looked to my friend and every drop of blood seemed to recede from my heart leaving it cold in my breast If I did not know the purpose of the cage obviously Smith knew it all too well His pallor had grown more marked and although his gray eyes stared defiantly at the Chinaman I who knew him could read a deathly horror in their depths The dacoit in obedience to a guttural order from doctor Fu Manchu placed the cage upon the carpet completely covering Smith s body but leaving his neck and head exposed The seared and pock marked face set in a sort of placid leer the dacoit adjusted the sliding partitions to Smith s recumbent form and I saw the purpose of the graduated arches They were intended to divide a human body in just such fashion and as I realized were most cunningly shaped to that end The whole of Smith s body lay now in the wire cage each of the five compartments whereof was shut off from its neighbor The Burman stepped back and stood waiting in the doorway doctor Fu Manchu removing his gaze from the face of my friend directed it now upon me mister Commissioner Nayland Smith shall have the honor of acting as hierophant admitting himself to the Mysteries said Fu Manchu softly and you doctor Petrie shall be the Friend CHAPTER XXIX THE SIX GATES He glanced toward the Burman who retired immediately to re enter a moment later carrying a curious leather sack in shape not unlike that of a sakka or Arab water carrier Opening a little trap in the top of the first compartment of the cage that is the compartment which covered Smith s bare feet and ankles he inserted the neck of the sack then suddenly seized it by the bottom and shook it vigorously Before my horrified gaze four huge rats came tumbling out from the bag into the cage The dacoit snatched away the sack and snapped the shutter fast A moving mist obscured my sight a mist through which I saw the green eyes of doctor Fu Manchu fixed upon me and through which as from a great distance his voice sunk to a snake like hiss came to my ears Cantonese rats doctor Petrie the most ravenous in the world they have eaten nothing for nearly a week Then all became blurred as though a painter with a brush steeped in red had smudged out the details of the picture For an indefinite period which seemed like many minutes yet probably was only a few seconds I saw nothing and heard nothing my sensory nerves were dulled entirely From this state I was awakened and brought back to the realities by a sound which ever afterward I was doomed to associate with that ghastly scene This was the squealing of the rats The red mist seemed to disperse at that and with frightfully intense interest I began to study the awful torture to which Nayland Smith was being subjected The dacoit had disappeared and Fu Manchu placidly was watching the four lean and hideous animals in the cage As I also turned my eyes in that direction the rats overcame their temporary fear and began You have been good enough to notice said the Chinaman his voice still sunk in that sibilant whisper my partiality for dumb allies You have met my scorpions my death adders my baboon man The uses of such a playful little animal as a marmoset have never been fully appreciated before I think but to an indiscretion of this last named pet of mine I seem to remember that you owed something in the past doctor Petrie Nayland Smith stifled a deep groan One rapid glance I ventured at his face It was a grayish hue now and dank with perspiration His gaze met mine The rats had almost ceased squealing Much depends upon yourself Doctor continued Fu Manchu slightly raising his voice I credit mister Commissioner Nayland Smith with courage high enough to sustain the raising of all the gates but I estimate the strength of your friendship highly also and predict that you will use the sword of the samurai certainly not later than the time when I shall raise the third gate A low shuddering sound which I cannot hope to describe but alas I can never forget broke from the lips of the tortured man In China resumed Fu Manchu we call this quaint fancy the Six Gates of joyful Wisdom The first gate by which the rats are admitted is called the Gate of joyous Hope the second the Gate of Mirthful Doubt The third gate is poetically named the Gate of True Rapture and the fourth the Gate of Gentle Sorrow I once was honored in the friendship of an exalted mandarin who sustained the course of joyful Wisdom to the raising of the Fifth Gate called the Gate of Sweet Desires and the admission of the twentieth rat I esteem him almost equally with my ancestors The Sixth or Gate Celestial whereby a man enters into the joy of Complete Understanding I have dispensed with here substituting a Japanese fancy of an antiquity nearly as great and honorable The introduction of this element of speculation I count a happy thought and accordingly take pride to myself The sword Petrie whispered Smith I should not have recognized his voice but he spoke quite evenly and steadily I rely upon you old man to spare me the humiliation of asking mercy from that yellow fiend My mind throughout this time had been gaining a sort of dreadful clarity I had avoided looking at the sword of hara kiri but my thoughts had been leading me mercilessly up to the point at which we were now arrived No vestige of anger of condemnation of the inhuman being seated in the ebony chair remained that was past Of all that had gone before and of what was to come in the future I thought nothing knew nothing Our long fight against the yellow group our encounters with the numberless creatures of Fu Manchu the dacoits even Karamaneh were forgotten blotted out I saw nothing of the strange appointments of that subterranean chamber but face to face with the supreme moment of a lifetime I was alone with my poor friend and God The rats began squealing again They were fighting Quick Petrie Quick man I am weakening I turned and took up the samurai sword My hands were very hot and dry but perfectly steady and I tested the edge of the heavy weapon upon my left thumb nail as quietly as one might test a razor blade It was as keen this blade of ghastly history as any razor ever wrought in Sheffield I seized the graven hilt bent forward in my chair and raised the Friend s Sword high above my head With the heavy weapon poised there I looked into my friend s eyes They were feverishly bright but never in all my days nor upon the many beds of suffering which it had been my lot to visit had I seen an expression like that within them The raising of the First Gate is always a crucial moment came the guttural voice of the Chinaman Although I did not see him and barely heard his words I was aware that he had stood up and was bending forward over the lower end of the cage Now Petrie now God bless you and good by From somewhere somewhere remote I heard a hoarse and animal like cry followed by the sound of a heavy fall I can scarcely bear to write of that moment for I had actually begun the downward sweep of the great sword when that sound came a faint Hope speaking of aid where I had thought no aid possible How I contrived to divert the blade I do not know to this day but I do know that its mighty sweep sheared a lock from Smith s head and laid bare the scalp With the hilt in my quivering hands I saw the blade bite deeply through the carpet and floor above Nayland Smith s skull There buried fully two inches in the woodwork it stuck and still clutching the hilt I looked to the right and across the room I looked to the curtained doorway Fu Manchu with one long claw like hand upon the top of the First Gate was bending over the trap but his brilliant green eyes were turned in the same direction as my own upon the curtained doorway Upright within it her beautiful face as pale as death but her great eyes blazing with a sort of splendid madness stood Karamaneh She looked not at the tortured man not at me but fully at doctor Fu Manchu One hand clutched the trembling draperies now she suddenly raised the other so that the jewels on her white arm glittered in the light of the lamp above the door She held my Browning pistol Fu Manchu sprang upright inhaling sibilantly as Karamaneh pointed the pistol point blank at his high skull and fired I saw a little red streak appear up by the neutral colored hair under the black cap I became as a detached intelligence unlinked with the corporeal looking down upon a thing which for some reason I had never thought to witness Fu Manchu threw up both arms so that the sleeves of the green robe fell back to the elbows He clutched at his head and the black cap fell behind him He began to utter short guttural cries he swayed backward to the right to the left then lurched forward right across the cage There he lay writhing for a moment his baneful eyes turned up revealing the whites and the great gray rats released began leaping about the room Two shot like gray streaks past the slim figure in the doorway one darted behind the chair to which I was lashed and the fourth ran all around against the wall Fu Manchu prostrate across the overturned cage lay still his massive head sagging downward I experienced a mental repetition of my adventure in the earlier evening I was dropping dropping dropping into some bottomless pit warm arms were about my neck and burning kisses upon my lips CHAPTER XXX THE CALL OF THE EAST I seemed to haul myself back out of the pit of unconsciousness by the aid of two little hands which clasped my own I uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and opened my eyes I was sitting in the big red leathern armchair in my own study and a lovely but truly bizarre figure in a harem dress was kneeling on the carpet at my feet so that my first sight of the world was the sweetest sight that the world had to offer me the dark eyes of Karamaneh with tears trembling like jewels upon her lashes I looked no further than that heeded not if there were others in the room beside we two but gripping the jewel laden fingers in what must have been a cruel clasp I searched the depths of the glorious eyes in ever growing wonder What change had taken place in those limpid mysterious pools Why was a wild madness growing up within me like a flame Why was the old longing returned ten thousandfold to snatch that pliant exquisite shape to my breast No word was spoken but the spoken words of a thousand ages could not have expressed one tithe of what was held in that silent communion A hand was laid hesitatingly on my shoulder I tore my gaze away from the lovely face so near to mine and glanced up Aziz stood at the back of my chair God is all merciful he said My sister is restored to us I loved him for the plural and she remembers Those few words were enough I understood now that this lovely girl who half knelt half lay at my feet was not the evil perverted creature of Fu Manchu whom we had gone out to arrest with the other vile servants of the Chinese doctor but was the old beloved companion of two years ago the Karamaneh for whom I had sought long and wearily in Egypt who had been swallowed up and lost to me in that land of mystery The loss of memory which Fu Manchu had artificially induced was subject to the same inexplicable laws which ordinarily rule in cases of amnesia The shock of her brave action that night had begun to effect a cure the sight of Aziz had completed it Inspector Weymouth was standing by the writing table My mind cleared rapidly now and standing up but without releasing the girl s hands so that I drew her up beside me I said Weymouth where is He s waiting to see you Doctor replied the inspector A pang almost physical struck at my heart Poor dear old Smith I cried with a break in my voice doctor Gray a neighboring practitioner appeared in the doorway at the moment that I spoke the words It s all right Petrie he said reassuringly I think we took it in time I have thoroughly cauterized the wounds and granted that no complication sets in he ll be on his feet again in a week or two I suppose I was in a condition closely bordering upon the hysterical At any rate my behavior was extraordinary I raised both my hands above my head Thank God I cried at the top of my voice thank God thank God Thank Him indeed responded the musical voice of Aziz He spoke with all the passionate devoutness of the true Moslem Everything even Karamaneh was forgotten and I started for the door as though my life depended upon my speed With one foot upon the landing I turned looked back and met the glance of Inspector Weymouth What have you done with the body I asked We haven t been able to get to it That end of the vault collapsed two minutes after we hauled you out As I write now of those strange days already they seem remote and unreal But where other and more dreadful memories already are grown misty the memory of that evening in my rooms remains clear cut and intimate It marked a crisis in my life During the days that immediately followed whilst Smith was slowly recovering from his hurts I made my plans deliberately I prepared to cut myself off from old associations prepared to exile myself gladly how gladly I cannot hope to express in mere cold words That my friend approved of my projects I cannot truthfully state but his disapproval at least was not openly expressed To Karamaneh I said nothing of my plans but her complete reliance in my powers to protect her now from all harm was at once pathetic and exquisite Since always I have sought in these chronicles to confine myself to the facts directly relating to the malignant activity of doctor Fu Manchu I shall abstain from burdening you with details of my private affairs As an instrument of the Chinese doctor it has sometimes been my duty to write of the beautiful Eastern girl I cannot suppose that my readers have any further curiosity respecting her from the moment that Fate freed her from that awful servitude Therefore when I shall have dealt with the episodes which marked our voyage to Egypt I had opened negotiations in regard to a practice in Cairo I may honorably lay down my pen These episodes opened dramatically upon the second night of the voyage from Marseilles CHAPTER XXXI MY SHADOW LIES UPON YOU 
4234-187750-0000	train-other-500	I suppose I did not awake very readily Following the nervous vigilance of the past six months my tired nerves in the enjoyment of this relaxation were rapidly recuperating
4234-187750-0001	train-other-500	I no longer feared to awake to find a knife at my throat no longer dreaded the darkness as a foe So that the voice may have been calling indeed had been calling for some time and of this I had been hazily conscious
none	none	 before finally I awoke 
4234-187750-0002	train-other-500	Then ere the new sense of security came to reassure me the old sense of impending harm set my heart leaping nervously
none	none	 There is always a certain physical panic attendant upon such awakening in the still of night especially in novel surroundings 
4234-187750-0003	train-other-500	Now I sat up abruptly clutching at the rail of my berth and listening There was a soft thudding on my cabin door and a voice low and urgent was crying my name
4234-187750-0004	train-other-500	Through the open porthole the moonlight streamed into my room and save for a remote and soothing throb inseparable from the progress of a great steamship nothing else disturbed the stillness I might have floated lonely upon the bosom of the Mediterranean
4234-187750-0005	train-other-500	But there was the drumming on the door again and the urgent appeal doctor Petrie doctor Petrie I threw off the bedclothes and stepped on to the floor of the cabin fumbling hastily for my slippers A fear that something was amiss
4234-187750-0006	train-other-500	that some aftermath some wraith of the dread Chinaman was yet to come to disturb our premature peace began to haunt me I threw open the door
4234-187750-0007	train-other-500	Upon the gleaming deck blackly outlined against a wondrous sky stood a man who wore a blue greatcoat over his pyjamas and whose unstockinged feet were thrust into red slippers It was Platts the Marconi operator
none	none	 I m awfully sorry to disturb you doctor Petrie he said and I was even less anxious to arouse your neighbor but somebody seems to be trying to get a message presumably urgent through to you To me I cried I cannot make it out admitted Platts running his fingers through disheveled hair but I thought it better to arouse you Will you come up 
4234-187750-0008	train-other-500	I turned without a word slipped into my dressing gown and with Platts passed aft along the deserted deck The sea was as calm as a great lake Ahead on the port bow an angry flambeau burned redly beneath the peaceful vault of the heavens
4234-187750-0009	train-other-500	Platts nodded absently in the direction of the weird flames Stromboli he said we shall be nearly through the Straits by breakfast time
none	none	 We mounted the narrow stair to the Marconi deck At the table sat Platts assistant with the Marconi attachment upon his head an apparatus which always set me thinking of the electric chair 
4234-187750-0010	train-other-500	Have you got it demanded my companion as we entered the room
none	none	 It s still coming through replied the other without moving but in the same jerky fashion Every time I get it it seems to have gone back to the beginning just doctor Petrie doctor Petrie He began to listen again for the elusive message I turned to Platts Where is it being sent from I asked 
4234-187750-0011	train-other-500	Platts shook his head That s the mystery he declared Look
none	none	 and he pointed to the table according to the Marconi chart there s a Messagerie boat due west between us and Marseilles and the homeward bound P O which we passed this morning must be getting on that way also by now The Isis is somewhere ahead but I ve spoken to all these and the message comes from none of them 
4234-187750-0012	train-other-500	Then it may come from Messina It doesn t come from Messina replied the man at the table beginning to write rapidly
4234-187750-0013	train-other-500	Platts stepped forward and bent over the message which the other was writing Here it is he cried excitedly we re getting it Stepping in turn to the table I leaned over between the two and read these words as the operator wrote them down
none	none	 doctor Petrie my shadow I drew a quick breath and gripped Platts shoulder harshly His assistant began fingering the instrument with irritation Lost it again he muttered This message I began 
4234-187750-0014	train-other-500	But again the pencil was traveling over the paper lies upon you all end of message
4234-187750-0015	train-other-500	The operator stood up and unclasped the receivers from his ears There high above the sleeping ship s company with the carpet of the blue Mediterranean stretched indefinitely about us we three stood looking at one another
4234-187750-0016	train-other-500	By virtue of a miracle of modern science some one divided from me by mile upon mile of boundless ocean had spoken and had been heard Is there no means of learning I said from whence this message emanated
4234-187750-0017	train-other-500	Platts shook his head perplexedly They gave no code word he said God knows who they were It s a strange business and a strange message
none	none	 Have you any sort of idea doctor Petrie respecting the identity of the sender 
4234-187750-0018	train-other-500	I stared him hard in the face an idea had mechanically entered my mind but one of which I did not choose to speak since it was opposed to human possibility But
4234-187750-0019	train-other-500	had I not seen with my own eyes the bloody streak across his forehead as the shot fired by Karamaneh entered his high skull had I not known so certainly as it is given to man to know that the giant intellect was no more
4234-187750-0020	train-other-500	the mighty will impotent I should have replied The message is from doctor Fu Manchu My reflections were rudely terminated and my sinister thoughts given new stimulus by a loud though muffled cry
none	none	 which reached me from somewhere in the ship below Both my companions started as violently as I whereby I knew that the mystery of the wireless message had not been without its effect upon their minds also But whereas they paused in doubt 
4234-187750-0021	train-other-500	I leaped from the room and almost threw myself down the ladder It was Karamaneh who had uttered that cry of fear and horror
4234-187750-0022	train-other-500	Although I could perceive no connection betwixt the strange message and the cry in the night intuitively I linked them intuitively I knew that my fears had been well grounded that the shadow of Fu Manchu still lay upon us
4234-187750-0023	train-other-500	Karamaneh occupied a large stateroom aft on the main deck so that I had to descend from the upper deck on which my own room was situated to the promenade deck again to the main deck and thence proceed nearly the whole length of the alleyway
none	none	 Karamaneh and her brother Aziz who occupied a neighboring room met me near the library 
4234-187750-0024	train-other-500	Karamaneh s eyes were wide with fear her peerless coloring had fled and she was white to the lips Aziz who wore a dressing gown thrown hastily over his night attire had his arm protectively about the girl s shoulders The mummy
4234-187750-0025	train-other-500	she whispered tremulously the mummy
none	none	 There came a sound of opening doors and several passengers whom Karamaneh cries had alarmed 
4234-187750-0026	train-other-500	appeared in various stages of undress A stewardess came running from the far end of the alleyway and I found time to wonder at my own speed for starting from the distant Marconi deck yet I had been the first to arrive upon the scene
none	none	 Stacey the ship s doctor was quartered at no great distance from the spot and he now joined the group Anticipating the question which trembled upon the lips of several of those about me Come to doctor Stacey s room I said taking Karamaneh arm 
4234-187750-0027	train-other-500	we will give you something to enable you to sleep I turned to the group My patient has had severe nerve trouble I explained and has developed somnambulistic tendencies
none	none	 I declined the stewardess offer of assistance with a slight shake of the head and shortly the four of us entered the doctor s cabin on the deck above 
4234-187750-0028	train-other-500	Stacey carefully closed the door He was an old fellow student of mine and already he knew much of the history of the beautiful Eastern girl and her brother Aziz
none	none	 I fear there s mischief afoot Petrie he said 
4234-187750-0029	train-other-500	Thanks to your presence of mind the ship s gossips need know nothing of it
none	none	 I glanced at Karamaneh who since the moment of my arrival had never once removed her gaze from me 
4234-187750-0030	train-other-500	she remained in that state of passive fear in which I had found her the lovely face pallid and she stared at me fixedly in a childish expressionless way which made me fear that the shock to which she had been subjected whatever its nature
4234-187750-0031	train-other-500	had caused a relapse into that strange condition of forgetfulness from which a previous shock had aroused her
none	none	 I could see that Stacey shared my view for 
4234-187750-0032	train-other-500	Something has frightened you he said gently seating himself on the arm of Karamaneh s chair and patting her hand as if to reassure her Tell us all about it For the first time since our meeting that night the girl turned her eyes from me and glanced up at Stacey
4234-187750-0033	train-other-500	a sudden warm blush stealing over her face and throat and as quickly departing to leave her even more pale than before She grasped Stacey s hand in both her own and looked again at me Send for mister Nayland Smith without delay
4234-187750-0034	train-other-500	she said and her sweet voice was slightly tremulous He must be put on his guard I started up Why I said For God s sake tell us what has happened
none	none	 Aziz who evidently was as anxious as myself for information and who now knelt at his sister s feet looking at her with that strange love which was almost adoration in his eyes glanced back at me and nodded his head rapidly Something Karamaneh paused shuddering violently some dreadful thing like a mummy escaped from its tomb came into my room to night through the porthole Through the porthole echoed Stacey amazedly Yes yes through the porthole A creature tall and very very thin He wore wrappings yellow wrappings swathed about his head so that only his eyes his evil gleaming eyes were visible From waist to knees he was covered also but his body his feet and his legs were bare Was he I began He was a brown man yes Karamaneh divining my question nodded and the shimmering cloud of her wonderful hair hastily confined burst free and rippled about her shoulders A gaunt fleshless brown man who bent and writhed bony fingers so A thug I cried He it the mummy thing would have strangled me if I had slept for he crouched over the berth seeking seeking I clenched my teeth convulsively But I was sitting up With the light on interrupted Stacey in surprise No added Karamaneh the light was out She turned her eyes toward me as the wonderful blush overspread her face once more I was sitting thinking It all happened within a few seconds and quite silently As the mummy crouched over the berth I unlocked the door and leaped out into the passage I think I screamed I did not mean to Oh doctor Stacey there is not a moment to spare mister Nayland Smith must be warned immediately Some horrible servant of doctor Fu Manchu is on the ship CHAPTER XXXII THE TRAGEDY Nayland Smith leaned against the edge of the dressing table attired in pyjamas The little stateroom was hazy with smoke and my friend gripped the charred briar between his teeth and watched the blue gray clouds arising from the bowl in an abstracted way I knew that he was thinking hard and from the fact that he had exhibited no surprise when I had related to him the particular s of the attack upon Karamaneh I judged that he had half anticipated something of the kind Suddenly he stood up staring at me fixedly Your tact has saved the situation Petrie he snapped It failed you momentarily though when you proposed to me just now that we should muster the lascars for inspection Our game is to pretend that we know nothing that we believe Karamaneh to have had a bad dream But Smith I began It would be useless Petrie he interrupted me You cannot suppose that I overlooked the possibility of some creature of the doctor s being among the lascars I can assure you that not one of them answers to the description of the midnight assailant From the girl s account we have to look discarding the idea of a revivified mummy for a man of unusual height and there s no lascar of unusual height on board and from the visible evidence that he entered the stateroom through the porthole we have to look for a man more than normally thin In a word the servant of doctor Fu Manchu who attempted the life of Karamaneh is either in hiding on the ship or if visible is disguised With his usual clarity of vision Nayland Smith had visualized the facts of the case I passed in mental survey each one of the passengers and those of the crew whose appearances were familiar to me with the result that I had to admit the justice of my friend s conclusions Smith began to pace the narrow strip of carpet between the dressing table and the door Suddenly he began again From our knowledge of Fu Manchu and of the group surrounding him and don t forget surviving him we may further assume that the wireless message was no gratuitous piece of melodrama but that it was directed to a definite end Let us endeavor to link up the chain a little You occupy an upper deck berth so do I Experience of the Chinaman has formed a habit in both of us that of sleeping with closed windows Your port was fastened and so was my own Karamaneh is quartered on the main deck and her brother s stateroom opens into the same alleyway Since the ship is in the Straits of Messina and the glass set fair the stewards have not closed the portholes nightly at present We know that that of Karamaneh s stateroom was open Therefore in any attempt upon our quartet Karamaneh would automatically be selected for the victim since failing you or myself she may be regarded as being the most obnoxious to doctor Fu Manchu I nodded comprehendingly Smith s capacity for throwing the white light of reason into the darkest places often amazed me You may have noticed he continued that Karamaneh s room is directly below your own In the event of any outcry you would be sooner upon the scene than I should for instance because I sleep on the opposite side of the ship This circumstance I take to be the explanation of the wireless message which because of its hesitancy a piece of ingenuity very characteristic of the group led to your being awakened and invited up to the Marconi deck in short it gave the would be assassin a better chance of escaping before your arrival I watched my friend in growing wonder The strange events seemingly having no link took their places in the drama and became well ordered episodes in a plot that only a criminal genius could have devised As I studied the keen bronzed face I realized to the full the stupendous mental power of doctor Fu Manchu measuring it by the criterion of Nayland Smith s For the cunning Chinaman in a sense had foiled this brilliant man before me whereby if by nought else I might know him a master of his evil art I regard the episode continued Smith as a posthumous attempt of the doctor s a legacy of hate which may prove more disastrous than any attempt made upon us by Fu Manchu in life Some fiendish member of the murder group is on board the ship We must as always meet guile with guile There must be no appeal to the captain no public examination of passengers and crew One attempt has failed I do not doubt that others will be made At present you will enact the role of physician in attendance upon Karamaneh and will put it about for whom it may interest that a slight return of her nervous trouble is causing her to pass uneasy nights I can safely leave this part of the case to you I think I nodded rapidly I haven t troubled to make inquiries added Smith but I think it probable that the regulation respecting closed ports will come into operation immediately we have passed the Straits or at any rate immediately there is any likelihood of bad weather You mean I mean that no alteration should be made in our habits A second attempt along similar lines is to be apprehended to night After that we may begin to look out for a new danger I pray we may avoid it I said fervently As I entered the saloon for breakfast in the morning I was subjected to solicitous inquiries from missus Prior the gossip of the ship Her room adjoined Karamaneh s and she had been one of the passengers aroused by the girl s cries in the night Strictly adhering to my role I explained that my patient was threatened with a second nervous breakdown and was subject to vivid and disturbing dreams One or two other inquiries I met in the same way ere escaping to the corner table reserved to us That iron bound code of conduct which rules the Anglo Indian in the first days of the voyage had threatened to ostracize Karamaneh and Aziz by reason of the Eastern blood to which their brilliant but peculiar type of beauty bore witness Smith s attitude however and in a Burmese commissioner it constituted something of a law had done much to break down the barriers the extraordinary beauty of the girl had done the rest So that now far from finding themselves shunned the society of Karamaneh and her romantic looking brother was universally courted The last inquiry that morning respecting my interesting patient came from the bishop of Damascus a benevolent old gentleman whose ancestry was not wholly innocent of Oriental strains and who sat at a table immediately behind me As I settled down to my porridge he turned his chair slightly and bent to my ear missus Prior tells me that your charming friend was disturbed last night he whispered She seems rather pale this morning I sincerely trust that she is suffering no ill effect I swung around with a smile Owing to my carelessness there was a slight collision and the poor bishop who had been invalided to England after typhoid in order to undergo special treatment suppressed an exclamation of pain although his fine dark eyes gleamed kindly upon me through the pebbles of his gold rimmed pince nez Indeed despite his Eastern blood he might have posed for a Sadler picture his small and refined features seeming out of place above the bulky body Can you forgive my clumsiness I began But the bishop raised his small slim fingered hand of old ivory hue deprecatingly His system was supercharged with typhoid bacilli and as sometimes occurs the superfluous bugs had sought exit He could only walk with the aid of two stout sticks and bent very much at that His left leg had been surgically scraped to the bone and I appreciated the exquisite torture to which my awkwardness had subjected him But he would entertain no apologies pressing his inquiry respecting Karamaneh in the kindly manner which had made him so deservedly popular on board Many thanks for your solicitude I said I have promised her sound repose to night and since my professional reputation is at stake I shall see that she secures it In short we were in pleasant company and the day passed happily enough and without notable event Smith spent some considerable time with the chief officer wandering about unfrequented parts of the ship I learned later that he had explored the lascars quarters the forecastle the engine room and had even descended to the stokehold but this was done so unostentatiously that it occasioned no comment With the approach of evening in place of that physical contentment which usually heralds the dinner hour at sea I experienced a fit of the seemingly causeless apprehension which too often in the past had harbingered the coming of grim events which I had learnt to associate with the nearing presence of one of Fu Manchu s death agents In view of the facts as I afterwards knew them to be I cannot account for this Yet in an unexpected manner my forebodings were realized That night I was destined to meet a sorrow surpassing any which my troubled life had known Even now I experience great difficulty in relating the matters which befell in speaking of the sense of irrevocable loss which came to me Briefly then at about ten minutes before the dining hour whilst all the passengers myself included were below dressing a faint cry arose from somewhere aft on the upper deck a cry which was swiftly taken up by other voices so that presently a deck steward echoed it immediately outside my own stateroom Man overboard Man overboard All my premonitions rallying in that one sickening moment I sprang out on the deck half dressed as I was and leaping past the boat which swung nearly opposite my door craned over the rail looking astern For a long time I could detect nothing unusual The engine room telegraph was ringing and the motion of the screws momentarily ceased then in response to further ringing recommenced but so as to jar the whole structure of the vessel whereby I knew that the engines were reversed Peering intently into the wake of the ship I was but dimly aware of the ever growing turmoil around me of the swift mustering of a boat s crew of the shouted orders of the third officer Suddenly I saw it the sight which was to haunt me for succeeding days and nights Half in the streak of the wake and half out of it I perceived the sleeve of a white jacket and near to it a soft felt hat The sleeve rose up once into clear view seemed to describe a half circle in the air then sink back again into the glassy swell of the water Only the hat remained floating upon the surface By the evidence of the white sleeve alone I might have remained unconvinced although upon the voyage I had become familiar enough with the drill shooting jacket but the presence of the gray felt hat was almost conclusive The man overboard was Nayland Smith I cannot hope writing now to convey in any words at my command a sense even remote of the utter loneliness which in that dreadful moment closed coldly down upon me To spring overboard to the rescue was a natural impulse but to have obeyed it would have been worse than quixotic In the first place the drowning man was close upon half a mile astern in the second place others had seen the hat and the white coat as clearly as I among them the third officer standing upright in the stern of the boat which with commendable promptitude had already been swung into the water The steamer was being put about describing a wide arc around the little boat dancing on the deep blue rollers Of the next hour I cannot bear to write at all Long as I had known him I was ignorant of my friend s powers as a swimmer but I judged that he must have been a poor one from the fact that he had sunk so rapidly in a calm sea Except the hat no trace of Nayland Smith remained when the boat got to the spot CHAPTER XXXIII THE MUMMY Dinner was out of the question that night for all of us Karamaneh who had spoken no word but grasping my hands had looked into my eyes her own glassy with unshed tears and then stolen away to her cabin had not since reappeared Seated upon my berth I stared unseeingly before me upon a changed ship a changed sea and sky upon another world The poor old bishop my neighbor had glanced in several times as he hobbled by and his spectacles were unmistakably humid but even he had vouchsafed no word realizing that my sorrow was too deep for such consolation When at last I became capable of connected thought I found myself faced by a big problem Should I place the facts of the matter as I knew them to be before the captain or could I hope to apprehend Fu Manchu s servant by the methods suggested by my poor friend That Smith s death was an accident I did not believe for a moment it was impossible not to link it with the attempt upon Karamaneh In my misery and doubt I determined to take counsel with doctor Stacey I stood up and passed out on to the deck Those passengers whom I met on my way to his room regarded me in respectful silence By contrast Stacey s attitude surprised and even annoyed me I d be prepared to stake all I possess although it s not much he said that this was not the work of your hidden enemy He blankly refused to give me his reasons for the statement and strongly advised me to watch and wait but to make no communication to the captain At this hour I can look back and savor again something of the profound dejection of that time I could not face the passengers I even avoided Karamaneh and Aziz I shut myself in my cabin and sat staring aimlessly into the growing darkness The steward knocked once inquiring if I needed anything but I dismissed him abruptly So I passed the evening and the greater part of the night Those groups of promenaders who passed my door invariably were discussing my poor friend s tragic end but as the night wore on the deck grew empty and I sat amid a silence that in my miserable state I welcomed more than the presence of any friend saving only the one whom I should never welcome again Since I had not counted the bells to this day I have only the vaguest idea respecting the time whereat the next incident occurred which it is my duty to chronicle Perhaps I was on the verge of falling asleep seated there as I was at any rate I could scarcely believe myself awake when unheralded by any footsteps to indicate his coming some one who seemed to be crouching outside my stateroom slightly raised himself and peered in through the porthole which I had not troubled to close He must have been a fairly tall man to have looked in at all and although his features were indistinguishable in the darkness his outline which was clearly perceptible against the white boat beyond was unfamiliar to me He seemed to have a small and oddly swathed head and what I could make out of the gaunt neck and square shoulders in some way suggested an unnatural thinness in short the smudgy silhouette in the porthole was weirdly like that of a mummy For some moments I stared at the apparition then rousing myself from the apathy into which I had sunk I stood up very quickly and stepped across the room As I did so the figure vanished and when I threw open the door and looked out upon the deck the deck was wholly untenanted I realized at once that it would be useless even had I chosen the course to seek confirmation of what I had seen from the officer on the bridge my own berth together with the one adjoining that of the bishop was not visible from the bridge For some time I stood in my doorway wondering in a disinterested fashion which now I cannot explain if the hidden enemy had revealed himself to me or if disordered imagination had played me a trick Later I was destined to know the truth of the matter but when at last I fell into a troubled sleep that night I was still in some doubt upon the point My state of mind when I awakened on the following day was indescribable I found it difficult to doubt that Nayland Smith would meet me on the way to the bathroom as usual with the cracked briar fuming between his teeth I felt myself almost compelled to pass around to his stateroom in order to convince myself that he was not really there The catastrophe was still unreal to me and the world a dream world Indeed I retain scarcely any recollections of the traffic of that day or of the days that followed it until we reached Port Said Two things only made any striking appeal to my dulled intelligence at that time These were the aloof attitude of doctor Stacey who seemed carefully to avoid me and a curious circumstance which the second officer mentioned in conversation one evening as we strolled up and down the main deck together Either I was fast asleep at my post doctor Petrie he said or last night in the middle watch some one or something came over the side of the ship just aft the bridge slipped across the deck and disappeared I stared at him wonderingly Do you mean something that came up out of the sea I said Nothing could very well have come up out of the sea he replied smiling slightly so that it must have come up from the deck below Was it a man It looked like a man and a fairly tall one but he came and was gone like a flash and I saw no more of him up to the time I was relieved To tell you the truth I did not report it because I thought I must have been dozing it s a dead slow watch and the navigation on this part of the run is child s play I was on the point of telling him what I had seen myself two evenings before but for some reason I refrained from doing so although I think had I confided in him he would have abandoned the idea that what he had seen was phantasmal for the pair of us could not very well have been dreaming Some malignant presence haunted the ship I could not doubt this yet I remained passive sunk in a lethargy of sorrow We were scheduled to reach Port Said at about eight o clock in the evening but by reason of the delay occasioned so tragically I learned that in all probability we should not arrive earlier than midnight whilst passengers would not go ashore until the following morning Karamaneh who had been staring ahead all day seeking a first glimpse of her native land was determined to remain up until the hour of our arrival but after dinner a notice was posted up that we should not be in before two A M Even those passengers who were the most enthusiastic thereupon determined to postpone for a few hours their first glimpse of the land of the Pharaohs and even to forego the sight one of the strangest and most interesting in the world of Port Said by night For my own part I confess that all the interest and hope with which I had looked forward to our arrival had left me and often I detected tears in the eyes of Karamaneh whereby I knew that the coldness in my heart had manifested itself even to her I had sustained the greatest blow of my life and not even the presence of so lovely a companion could entirely recompense me for the loss of my dearest friend The lights on the Egyptian shore were faintly visible when the last group of stragglers on deck broke up I had long since prevailed upon Karamaneh to retire and now utterly sick at heart I sought my own stateroom mechanically undressed and turned in It may or may not be singular that I had neglected all precautions since the night of the tragedy I was not even conscious of a desire to visit retribution upon our hidden enemy in some strange fashion I took it for granted that there would be no further attempts upon Karamaneh Aziz or myself I had not troubled to confirm Smith s surmise respecting the closing of the portholes but I know now for a fact that whereas they had been closed from the time of our leaving the Straits of Messina to night in sight of the Egyptian coast the regulation was relaxed again I cannot say if this is usual but that it occurred on this ship is a fact to which I can testify a fact to which my attention was to be drawn dramatically The night was steamingly hot and because I welcomed the circumstance that my own port was widely opened I reflected that those on the lower decks might be open also A faint sense of danger stirred within me indeed I sat upright and was about to spring out of my berth when that occurred which induced me to change my mind All passengers had long since retired and a midnight silence descended upon the ship for we were not yet close enough to port for any unusual activities to have commenced Clearly outlined in the open porthole there suddenly arose that same grotesque silhouette which I had seen once before Prompted by I know not what I lay still and simulated heavy breathing for it was evident to me that I must be partly visible to the watcher so bright was the night For ten twenty thirty seconds he studied me in absolute silence that gaunt thing so like a mummy and with my eyes partly closed I watched him breathing heavily all the time Then making no more noise than a cat he moved away across the deck and I could judge of his height by the fact that his small swathed head remained visible almost to the time that he passed to the end of the white boat which swung opposite my stateroom In a moment I slipped quietly to the floor crossed and peered out of the porthole so that at last I had a clear view of the sinister mummy man He was crouching under the bow of the boat and attaching to the white rails below a contrivance of a kind with which I was not entirely unfamiliar This was a thin ladder of silken rope having bamboo rungs with two metal hooks for attaching it to any suitable object The one thus engaged was as Karamaneh had declared almost superhumanly thin His loins were swathed in a sort of linen garment and his head so bound about turban fashion that only his gleaming eyes remained visible The bare limbs and body were of a dusky yellow color and at sight of him I experienced a sudden nausea My pistol was in my cabin trunk and to have found it in the dark without making a good deal of noise would have been impossible Doubting how I should act I stood watching the man with the swathed head whilst he threw the end of the ladder over the side crept past the bow of the boat and swung his gaunt body over the rail exhibiting the agility of an ape One quick glance fore and aft he gave then began to swarm down the ladder in which instant I knew his mission With a choking cry which forced itself unwilled from my lips I tore at the door threw it open and sprang across the deck Plans I had none and since I carried no instrument wherewith to sever the ladder the murderer might indeed have carried out his design for all that I could have done to prevent him were it not that another took a hand in the game At the moment that the mummy man his head now on a level with the deck perceived me he stopped dead Coincident with his stopping the crack of a pistol shot sounded from immediately beyond the boat Uttering a sort of sobbing sound the creature fell then clutched with straining yellow fingers at the rails and seemingly by dint of a great effort swarmed along aft some twenty feet with incredible swiftness and agility and clambered onto the deck A second shot cracked sharply and a voice God was I mad cried Hold him Petrie Rigid with fearful astonishment I stood as out from the boat above me leaped a figure attired solely in shirt and trousers The newcomer leaped away in the wake of the mummy man who had vanished around the corner by the smoke room Over his shoulder he cried back at me The bishop s stateroom See that no one enters I clutched at my head which seemed to be fiery hot I realized in my own person the sensation of one who knows himself mad For the man who pursued the mummy was Nayland Smith I stood in the bishop s state room Nayland Smith his gaunt face wet with perspiration beside me handling certain odd looking objects which littered the place and lay about amid the discarded garments of the absent cleric Pneumatic pads he snapped The man was a walking air cushion He gingerly fingered two strange rubber appliances For distending the cheeks he muttered dropping them disgustedly on the floor His hands and wrists betrayed him Petrie He wore his cuff unusually long but he could not entirely hide his bony wrists To have watched him whilst remaining myself unseen was next to impossible hence my device of tossing a dummy overboard calculated to float for less than ten minutes It actually floated nearly fifteen as a matter of fact and I had some horrible moments Smith I said how could you submit me He clapped his hands on my shoulders My dear old chap there was no other way believe me From that boat I could see right into his stateroom but once in I dare not leave it except late at night stealthily The second spotted me one night and I thought the game was up but evidently he didn t report it But you might have confided Impossible I ll admit I nearly fell to the temptation that first night for I could see into your room as well as into his He slapped me boisterously on the back but his gray eyes were suspiciously moist Dear old Petrie Thank God for our friends But you d be the first to admit old man that you re a dead rotten actor Your portrayal of grief for the loss of a valued chum would not have convinced a soul on board Therefore I made use of Stacey whose callous attitude was less remarkable Gad Petrie I nearly bagged our man the first night The elaborate plan Marconi message to get you out of the way and so forth had miscarried and he knew the porthole trick would be useless once we got into the open sea He took a big chance He discarded his clerical guise and peeped into your room you remember but you were awake and I made no move when he slipped back to his own cabin I wanted to take him red handed Have you any idea Who he is No more than where he is Probably some creature of doctor Fu Manchu specially chosen for the purpose obviously a man of culture and probably of thug ancestry I hit him in the shoulder but even then he ran like a hare We ve searched the ship without result He may have gone overboard and chanced the swim to shore We stepped out onto the deck Around us was that unforgettable scene Port Said by night The ship was barely moving through the glassy water now Smith took my arm and we walked forward Above us was the mighty peace of Egypt s sky ablaze with splendor around and about us moved the unique turmoil of the clearing house of the Near East I would give much to know the real identity of the bishop of Damascus muttered Smith He stopped abruptly snapping his teeth together and grasping my arm as in a vise Hard upon his words had followed the rattling clangor as the great anchor was let go but horribly intermingled with the metallic roar there came to us such a fearful inarticulate shrieking as to chill one s heart The anchor plunged into the water of the harbor the shrieking ceased Smith turned to me and his face was tragic in the light of the arc lamp swung hard by We shall never know he whispered God forgive him he must be in bloody tatters now Petrie the poor fool was hiding in the chainlocker A little hand stole into mine I turned quickly Karamaneh stood beside me I placed my arm about her shoulders drawing her close and I blush to relate that all else was forgotten For a moment heedless of the fearful turmoil forward Nayland Smith stood looking at us Then he turned with his rare smile and walked aft Perhaps you re right Petrie he said End of Project Gutenberg s The Return of doctor Fu Manchu by Sax Rohmer END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RETURN OF
